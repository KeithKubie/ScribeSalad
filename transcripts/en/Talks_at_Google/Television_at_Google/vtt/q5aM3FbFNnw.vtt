[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:12.850
BILL HADER: How's
it going, guys?

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.740
ALAN SEALES: Thank you
for coming out today.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.100
BILL HADER: Oh, no,
thanks for having me.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.790
ALAN SEALES: It's unusual to do
press at the end of a season.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.650
BILL HADER: Well, no.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.080
Yeah, man, I wish we just did
it at the top of the season.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.940
No, it's like I always do
press, and I'm like, oh, good,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.440
I'm done.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.590
And then before the show
airs, it's like, no, no, no.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.920
You've got to do press every
week while the show's airing,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.370
you know, to get people going,
like, there's a new episode,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.970
you know.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.260
So New York is, like-- because
the finale is this Sunday.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.280
So that's why I'm here.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.030
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.490
Has everybody seen it?

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.460
Yeah, all right.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.100
Cool.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.370
So we can talk about season
two, and you guys won't get mad.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.390
BILL HADER: Oh, yeah,
there's going to be spoilers.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.850
So if you guys haven't seen
it, you're shit out of luck.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.517
We're going to--

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:56.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920
Sorry.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.280
ALAN SEALES: It gets dark.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.995
BILL HADER: Yeah, it
was dark to begin with.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.043
It gets really dark.

00:01:05.043 --> 00:01:06.460
ALAN SEALES: Given
what we've seen

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.347
of you and our
preconceived notion of,

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:09.430
like, oh, it's Bill Hader.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.342
It's comedy.

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:12.550
And then I started watching
"Barry," and I was like--

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
I scratched my head halfway
through the first episode,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.383
and I didn't get it.

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:18.592
And then all of a sudden,
I started thinking about it

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:19.960
as a drama instead of a comedy.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.582
And then I loved
the shit out of it.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.540
BILL HADER: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.000
ALAN SEALES: And do you
get that reaction a lot?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.880
Do you classify this as,
like, a drama with comedy

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.490
or a comedy with drama?

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.240
BILL HADER: My favorite
stuff doesn't have

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.890
any sort of classification.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.810
It's kind of just--
it's a story, you know?

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.705
And there's elements
of all those things.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.400
But we did have a
very conscious--

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.030
Alec Berg, who I created this
with-- we had a very conscious

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.010
of the very first
shot of the pilot

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.400
be something that
was more disturbing,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.890
which is Barry in a room
and a man's been killed,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.900
and he's just getting
his gun and leaving.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.910
That almost was
there for a purpose,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.610
not only to say this is what
he does, but also to give you

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.397
a sense of here's the tone.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.730
I think you hear Alec and I
are doing a show about a hit

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.105
man who wants to
be an actor, you

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.760
kind of think this kind of
glib, kind of comedy thing.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
So we were like, no, we
want to make it very real,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.730
lead with the drama, lead with
his kind of existential crisis

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.520
and the emotion, and
then have the comedy

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.310
be behind that, and that'll
work a little bit better.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.270
ALAN SEALES: So did this
come from any real life

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.220
existential--

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.340
BILL HADER: No, that I
want to murder somebody?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.840
No.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.400
No, no, no.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.230
I mean, I think it
came a bit from--

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.910
I don't know.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.080
I don't know where it came from.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.415
I mean, Alec Berg
and I were always--

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:43.100
[THUNK]

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.040
Did someone just die?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.748
Like [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:48.290
ALAN SEALES: Fainted
with excitement.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.296
BILL HADER: Someone
fainted, like Alec Berg--

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:54.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.550
I don't know where it came from.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.210
I mean, Alec and I always are--

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.950
we just kind of
talked it through.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.950
And I personally have
always been interested in--

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.370
ALAN SEALES:
There's another one.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.870
BILL HADER: Someone
else just dying.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.890
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.700
BILL HADER: But I've always
been interested in kind

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.883
of people's, like, violence
and people's propensity

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:19.300
of violence, and how it affects
you, and things like that.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.072
I just have been.

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:20.780
I don't know why.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.340
But it's just that thing that--

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.050
you know, and from someone
who watches a lot of movies

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.510
and a of genre type movies,
you do kind of go, like, well,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.240
what's that guy like,
though, in reality, you know?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.190
What would he be like--
you know, the hit man

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.730
you kind of see in a movie, and
then he's, like, being dashing

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.240
or whatever.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.410
I'm like, isn't he fucked up?

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.080
He's murdered people.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.860
What if he actually
thought about that,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.990
and what he's doing,
and the amount of people

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.310
that he's affected,
and all that?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.290
And if he became aware of
that, what would do to him?

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.540
ALAN SEALES: It's kind of
like Liam Neeson in "Taken."

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.210
Once he's done getting
his daughters back,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.470
is he a normal guy again?

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.820
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.520
There was this great
movie, "The Act

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.035
Of Killing," this documentary.

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:09.550
I don't know if
you saw that movie.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.270
It was really great.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.520
But there's a moment in that--

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.680
it was very hard to watch in
the film, where they recreate

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.260
these executions-- that
these guys recreate

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.730
their executions that they
did in the Philippines.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.510
And these two guys who murdered
all these people in the '60s

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.045
are driving, and they're kind
of talking to each other.

00:04:28.045 --> 00:04:29.920
And then one guy goes,
do you get nightmares?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.560
And he goes, oh, yeah,
I get nightmares.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.144
And it's like, yeah,
no shit, you know?

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:36.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.730
That affects you in some way.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.800
And so yeah, exactly.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.690
It's like the "Taken"
guy is like, yeah, he's

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.440
not with his kids.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.930
Like, it's Christmas,
you know what I mean?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.380
He hasn't slept for--

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.660
how do you handle that?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.740
So I think everyone was a bit
surprised when the show aired,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.970
and they were expecting that.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.140
They were like, oh,
whoa, this is something

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.250
a little bit different.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.750
ALAN SEALES: Well,
it's interesting.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.530
Because the trailer we just
watched, it's upbeat music.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.020
And Henry Winkler is also
known for comedy and whatnot.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.402
And so obviously,
you went into this--

00:05:08.402 --> 00:05:10.860
or whoever did the casting, I
assume you had a part in it--

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.568
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:13.850
ALAN SEALES: --went in
looking for the certain type

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.040
of characters and
certain type of people.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.470
And even NoHo Hank is one of the
audience's favorite characters,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.890
aside from Barry, of course.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.960
BILL HADER: No, he's
better than Barry.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.790
I'm a bigger fan of him.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.010
No, we did not pick the
music in the trailer.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.410
No, I was actually back
there, just going like,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.385
what is this music?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.840
No, but Henry Winkler was kind
of like casting against type.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.728
It was like we knew we
had this acting teacher.

00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:49.520
And I'll be honest.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.520
Alec Berg and I
wrote it very arch.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.150
I mean, he was, I
think he had a cape.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.750
It was very John Barrymore,
like, listen, you, like me.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.420
It was just too much.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.160
And we kind of knew that, but
we were like, I don't know.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.630
It's making me laugh, but
this is probably wrong.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.090
And then Henry Winkler
came in and read,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.560
he auditioned, which was crazy.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.450
And then when he read and--

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.270
he merely brought
this humanity to it

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.330
because he's an
incredibly nice man.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.370
And immediately was
like, oh, failed actor.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.947
That's who this guy is.

00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:27.780
He's a failed actor.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.660
And inside this studio, inside
this building where he teaches,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.757
he's the star that
he wanted to be.

00:06:35.757 --> 00:06:38.340
But the minute he leaves this,
he's just an out-of-work actor.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.550
So he's got to stay
inside this place

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.290
and he has all the
status that he wants,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.410
and it was like, oh,
that's a good character.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.896
But that all came from
his read, you know?

00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:52.610
And Anthony Carrigan, when
he came in to read NoHo Hank,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.830
he said, you know, I don't
really have an accent.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.220
I'm working on it, or you know?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.410
And it was one of those
auditions where we had more--

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.650
like in the audition, he
didn't have a lot of lines

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.240
in his auditions, so it
was a lot of listening.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.850
But the way he listened was
so funny that that got him.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.007
He was just like--

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:15.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.930
--doing that, and Alec
and I were like, what?

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.170
So funny, yeah.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.210
So, yeah, we loved
him from there.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.020
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
he's wonderful.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.520
I was telling you backstage
that my friends on Facebook were

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.895
like-- they had this whole
thread about how great "Barry"

00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:33.670
is, the show, and how
much they love NoHo Hank--

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.280
Anthony.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.220
But in the scenes, you're often
looking down or looking away

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.030
because he's making you laugh.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.130
BILL HADER: Well, yeah.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.200
If anybody's seen
episode 6 this season,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.010
there's a scene where he
yells at an accordion player.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.480
If you watch, I'm going like--

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.380
I'm fully turning away
because, yeah, he's--

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.290
every time he would yell, he
would say something different.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.370
You just-- you just
whipped out your accordion

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.870
and just fucked this moment.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.558
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.440
And I started laughing because
if you saw last episode that

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.748
followed it, that leads them--

00:08:14.748 --> 00:08:17.040
I started laughing, and he's
like why are you laughing?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.810
I go because this leads
you to be put on a bus

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.550
and almost set on
fire this moment.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.940
Because you were, like, fuck
you to this accordion player,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.800
you're going to
get burned alive.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.308
That's just so funny to me.

00:08:35.308 --> 00:08:37.100
ALAN SEALES: So does
he do a lot of improv,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.358
or do you do improv with him?

00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:38.900
Or how does--

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.692
BILL HADER: Yeah, he
provides a little bit.

00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:43.010
And sometimes, a lot of it
is, like, we'll write it,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.410
and then Alec and
I'll get there,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.120
and then we kind of immediately
go what the heck were we doing?

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.750
You know, this isn't
good, you know?

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.450
There is a scene in
the end of episode 2

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.880
when I come back
to my apartment,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.640
and Stephen Root is there
and we get in an argument.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.265
That whole scene
we rewrote on set.

00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:08.030
Hiro Murai, the director of
that episode, sent me a picture,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.090
and it's me and Alec
on the set of that.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.550
I'm in the Barry costume,
and Alec has a laptop,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.780
and we're rewriting it.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.150
And Stephen Root is just
staring at us so angry.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
He's like get your
shit together.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.420
Like, I have to learn all
new lines now, you know?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.375
But yeah, we tend to like it
right up until we shoot it.

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:31.250
And then we go, wait,
wait, wait, no, no, no.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.460
You should say this and then you
say that, and then, you know,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.960
that's what we kind of do.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.460
ALAN SEALES: Does that speak
to sort of the sketch comedy

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.710
background that you come from?

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.585
BILL HADER: Yeah, and
Alec comes from a big--

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:44.270
he was a writer on
"Seinfeld" forever

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.570
and did "Curb Your Enthusiasm"
and "Silicon Valley" and stuff.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.250
So I think it is
like a comedy thing.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.940
You want the immediacy,
and also how everyone's

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.440
relating that day,
or it might be

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.995
just the set or the costumes or
something will spark something.

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:01.370
And you go, oh, yeah, you
should do this instead of that.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.460
Or it's the intention
of this scene, you know?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.240
We wrote it in a vacuum, and
then you're playing it out

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.110
and I'll go--

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.700
or one of the other actors
will go, well, wait.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.890
We just played this where
I kind of already answered

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.473
this question.

00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:15.950
Are we saying the
same thing twice now?

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.310
And it's like, shit, yes.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.780
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, Let's--

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.060
OK, you know, that was what that
scene was with Stephen where

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.150
he initially said a bunch of
information we already knew.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.420
And we were like,
well, this is no--

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.368
and Barry was acting
shocked by it.

00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:32.660
And I'm like, no, Barry knows
all this stuff, you know?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.740
So it's constant--
it's just banging

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.307
your head against the
wall all day basically.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:41.890
ALAN SEALES: Is he
used to the comedy?

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.957
Like, I guess
coming into "Barry,"

00:10:43.957 --> 00:10:45.290
did he have a comedy background?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.920
BILL HADER: Stephen Root?

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.370
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.330
BILL HADER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.120
"Office Space."

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.830
I mean, yeah--

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.247
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:54.150
BILL HADER: And "NewsRadio"--
oh, my God, he's great.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.340
But yeah, he's really good.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.650
I mean, everybody-- the
only person who didn't have,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.410
like, a big comedy background
was Sarah Goldberg,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.590
but she's, like, a theater
actor, and she's amazing.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.810
So she's really funny.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.280
She's incredibly funny.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.120
But everyone else had been
on, I think, comedy shows.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.390
Like, capital K comedy shows.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.760
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, it's
so fascinating to me

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:24.380
to watch them, watch you, and
everybody who is in the acting

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.260
class with Henry Winkler.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.630
Because everybody else in--

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.730
their main characters
in Barry are very just

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.782
kind of like ditzy, I guess,
for a lack of a better term.

00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:36.740
BILL HADER: For actors?

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.448
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:11:37.448 --> 00:11:39.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.160
And then for the most
part, they get on stage.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.130
They go into character,
they're really good.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.290
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.680
ALAN SEALES: Like, in real
life, they're real good actors.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.690
BILL HADER: Yeah, yeah, that's
the only way it's interesting.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.120
It's like he is a good--

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.680
Cousineau is a good teacher.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.430
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.270
BILL HADER: Like
that's the thing

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.380
I learned when you're writing.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.570
It's like it's more
interesting if they're flawed,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.080
but they're actually good
at something, you know?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.830
When they're kind of
shitty at everything,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.362
you're like why am I
hanging with this person?

00:12:03.362 --> 00:12:05.570
ALAN SEALES: And then Barry
is the complete opposite.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.430
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.910
ALAN SEALES: Barry--
you're a great hit man.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.500
BILL HADER: Yeah,
yeah, that was the--

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.970
that's the thing
he's terrified of

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.460
is is this the only
thing I'm good at?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.597
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:12:14.597 --> 00:12:16.930
BILL HADER: And that was the
thing that we talked about.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.820
I remember being on
"Saturday Night Live"

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.710
and I could do
impressions, but I

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.457
wanted to write and direct
and do all these other things.

00:12:27.457 --> 00:12:29.040
But I was like I
don't know if I can--

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.530
I was trying to
write screenplays

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.920
and they weren't really good,
and showing them to people,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.470
and they were like,
you know, just

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.560
go learn an impression
of somebody.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.425
That was there no on my script.

00:12:42.425 --> 00:12:43.300
That was interesting.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.937
My only note is you should
stick to impressions.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.190
But I didn't-- you know, so I
had this kind of security and I

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:54.980
was still working.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.355
I went and worked
at "South Park"

00:12:56.355 --> 00:12:57.940
to try to learn how
to write better.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.310
And I've been hanging
out with the Pixar guys,

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.760
like, how to work better.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.157
And then I was telling
Alec Berg that,

00:13:06.157 --> 00:13:07.990
and we were talking
about in terms of Barry.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.300
I was like, well, you know,
you can write towards that.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.750
Maybe that's what his thing
is, that emotion of what

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.540
if this is the only
thing I'm good at?

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.450
And I was like,
well, I can write

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.200
that because I can
relate to it, you know?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.640
And so it's funny that that
weird very small thing--

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.120
we did a whole show about a
guy can only do impressions,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.412
but wanted to write and direct.

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:27.980
That's a boring show, you know?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.730
So I was like he
should be a hit man

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.770
and wanted to be
in an acting class.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.370
ALAN SEALES: It's
very gory, too.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.313
I mean, in a not
over-the-top way.

00:13:43.313 --> 00:13:44.980
BILL HADER: Yeah, we
want it to be real.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.380
Yeah, but we didn't
want it hand-held,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.780
but we wanted the aesthetic
to be somewhat real.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.858
Except for the karate
episode we did that--

00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:54.650
ALAN SEALES: Can we
can we talk about that?

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.130
That's season 2, episode 5.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.350
You wrote and directed that
entirely yourself, yeah?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.100
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.730
ALAN SEALES: So was that a
different experience for you?

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.560
Why did you decide to do that
for that particular episode?

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.645
BILL HADER: Well-- again,
spoilers, I'm sorry, everybody.

00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:11.020
Barry has to kill--
we knew Barry

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.333
had to kill this guy,
Ronny Proxin, for Loach.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.620
And initially, it was
just going to be this,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.020
I think, just one
part of that episode.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.140
It'd be like a scene, or
the end of the episode,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.740
is he has to do this hit.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.087
And then I remembered that
our stunt coordinator,

00:14:33.087 --> 00:14:35.170
Wade Allen said, you know,
I have this little girl

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.700
who could do martial arts.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.137
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:40.137 --> 00:14:41.617
ALAN SEALES:
They've all seen it.

00:14:41.617 --> 00:14:44.200
BILL HADER: Yeah, and he's like
she can do crazy martial arts,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.490
and he showed me
this video of her.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.198
And she was, like,
running along a house,

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:49.210
and then she jumped
onto a moving car.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.130
And it was her doing
all these crazy kicks,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.672
and her parents are
stunt performers,

00:14:52.672 --> 00:14:57.412
and I was like, whoa, cool.

00:14:57.412 --> 00:14:58.870
Why do you have
this on your phone?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.920
But Wade was like,
well, you know, I

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.770
don't know if you ever need
a little girl or somebody

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.530
to do some crazy shit.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.275
Let me know.

00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:15.580
I was like, well, thanks, man.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.260
And so then when we were doing--

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.280
what was it, episode 5, and
where I was thinking about it,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.310
I suddenly went, oh, what if
he wanted to kill that guy?

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.770
He doesn't want to kill him,
he inadvertently kills him.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.905
And then as he's
leaving, the girl's

00:15:31.905 --> 00:15:34.280
daughters there-- his daughter
is there, and you're like,

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.535
oh, God, Barry
has to kill a kid,

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.160
and then she kicks
the shit out of him.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.528
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.380
And so, I kind of
went off-- we usually

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.410
write in a writers' room, and I
kind of went off and wrote that

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.720
and came back and
presented it to the table,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.650
and they were like, what?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.100
But they were into it.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.850
They dug it.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.540
And so yeah, it was just a
matter of getting her and then

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.460
finding the guy to play Ronny.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.360
Initially, Ronny was written
as a very short fat guy

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.890
who's bald.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.080
And so it was a
bigger reveal that he

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.810
was like a Taekwondo master, and
apparently that does not exist.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.450
Because I went to the stunt
coordinator, the casting

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.713
director, and they were
like, no, that doesn't exist.

00:16:24.713 --> 00:16:26.630
And so I was like, well,
let me meet somebody.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.190
And they bring in
that guy, Daniel,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.880
and he's like--
looks like Jon Hamm.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.110
He's like a crazy
gorgeous-looking guy.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.940
Our casting director,
Sherry Thomas,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.360
was like I think we should
have him be a series regular.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.150
I think we need him to come
into my office every day

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.230
and read with everybody.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.852
And so I said--

00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:51.560
and so I just talked
about the character,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.570
and initially he was
this kind of uptight guy.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.330
And I said, can you
put on some weight?

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.827
And he was like I can put
on 20 pounds in two weeks.

00:16:58.827 --> 00:16:59.910
And I was like, all right.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.099
You're still going to be you.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.599
You're still going
to look like you.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.220
So he told me a
lot of those guys,

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.470
you know, they compete, and then
they make a lot of their money,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.480
and then they retire.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.690
And they're in such
pain that they get--

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.750
they take a lot of pills and
they smoke weed and drink

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.829
a lot because of all the pain.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.079
And I went, oh, let's do that.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.454
So you're smoking
weed and you're

00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:28.010
kind of high the whole time.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.530
That works great.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.250
So when Barry shows up, you're
a little confused, you know?

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.520
Like why is this guy
in there, you know?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.940
And so that helped.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.860
But yeah, I mean, the
rest of that episode

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.750
was just kind of
like just following

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.770
the instinct and just a stream
of consciousness of writing it.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.530
And going like, all right, so
he should walk into a room,

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.822
and what's the worst thing
that should be in that room?

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.660
Taekwondo trophy, you know?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.292
And yeah, but that one is
definitely one that I think

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.000
surprised people.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.500
And then it played right after
the Battle of Winterfell.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.970
We're right after
"Game of Thrones."

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.285
So we're--

00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:14.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.355
So we go and see this "Game
of Thrones" screening,

00:18:18.355 --> 00:18:20.480
Alec and I do, and they
had a Battle of Winterfell,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.650
like, at the Mann's
Chinese Theatre.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.490
And we go there and
we're watching this,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.198
and we're like no one
is going to stick--

00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:30.440
like we have to follow this?

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.290
And then they have a little
girl with a knife jump on a guy

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.420
and stab him, and Alec and I
are like fuck, what the fuck?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.530
Like, how did we not--

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.620
what are the chances
that a little girl at 9

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.530
is just going to jump on the--

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.230
and we were like, oh, no.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.420
No.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.020
Thank God we cut the
scene where, yeah, we

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.330
had a witch self-destruct.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:08.940
ALAN SEALES: Well--

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.273
BILL HADER: It just sucks, yeah.

00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:12.567
But anyway, it didn't seem
to bother people too much,

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:13.150
I don't think.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.817
ALAN SEALES: No.

00:19:13.817 --> 00:19:16.210
No, I mean, it got-- its gotten
the most critical acclaim

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.800
out of all the episodes
so far, I believe.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.430
BILL HADER: That episode?

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.790
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.165
BILL HADER: Well,
you know what's

00:19:20.165 --> 00:19:23.380
funny too is that we had
the, what you call it,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.100
like "Game of Thrones" started--

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.850
we started playing
after "Game of Thrones"

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.240
after our third
episode this season.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.300
And so then episode 3--

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.320
suddenly we had like 2.5
million more viewers.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.320
And Alec and I had a
funny text exchange going.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.660
I go I don't think it's--

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.170
I think it's because people
just got into the show.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.590
I don't think it's anything--

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.425
I was asked of this
text exchange at HBO

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:47.800
where Alec-- and they didn't
realize that we were joking.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.925
They were like, no, no, no.

00:19:48.925 --> 00:19:50.092
They were trying to be nice.

00:19:50.092 --> 00:19:52.040
Like, we're pretty sure
it's Game of Thrones.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.315
And Alec and I were like no, no,
no, I think people, you know--

00:19:57.315 --> 00:19:59.273
like this happened to me
on Seinfeld, you know?

00:19:59.273 --> 00:20:00.910
It just they finally
kind of catch on

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.910
and you just don't know
when they catch on and--

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.583
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.550
Like we think it's dragons.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.220
And they're like,
nope, it's not dragons.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.670
ALAN SEALES: Hit men.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.100
So I've got a
couple of questions

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.210
that I guess I should get to.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.210
I actually want to go
back to the very beginning

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.150
of young Bill Hader, and you
grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.340
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.280
Nothing.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.063
People from Tulsa don't
make it to Google, I guess.

00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:29.230
AUDIENCE: I'm from Oklahoma.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.140
BILL HADER: You're
from Oklahoma?

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.210
ALAN SEALES: Oklahoma.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.180
BILL HADER: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.570
You're at Google.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.730
Yeah, that's good.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.050
Good job, man.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.940
ALAN SEALES: How did
you get it into comedy?

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.140
How'd you make it-- you
made it to LA originally.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.260
BILL HADER: Yeah, as a
production assistant.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.010
I wanted to write and
direct, and then I

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.728
was a PA like all these
low-budget movies.

00:20:50.728 --> 00:20:53.020
And then I worked on a movie
called "Collateral Damage"

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.145
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:59.620
I was a PA on that, which was
crazy because he's just weird.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.100
And then-- nice.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.180
ALAN SEALES: Nice weird?

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.170
BILL HADER: I just realized
we're being filmed,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.455
so I'm going to say that.

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:14.860
He's very nice.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.840
Because I don't need
that in my life.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.530
Ding-dong--

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.447
(IMITATES ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER) Get out here.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.340
I saw you on Google.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.450
You're fucking dead, man.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.680
Get out and fucking
say it to my face.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.540
(NORMAL VOICE) Now that he--

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.670
and then, yeah, I did that.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.810
And then I did--

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.810
and then I was a PA and
I did stuff I like that.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.000
And I started classes
at Second City LA,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.078
and then Megan Mulally
saw me in a show

00:21:44.078 --> 00:21:45.620
and recommended me
to Lorne Michaels.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.670
And I got onto "Saturday
Night Live" totally fluky.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.530
Like, just-- yeah.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.370
I don't know how--

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.120
I owe my whole
career to her, Yeah.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.960
ALAN SEALES: Wow, and
your whole audition

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.640
was impersonations for
the most part, right?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.682
BILL HADER: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, all impersonations.

00:22:00.682 --> 00:22:02.760
I did them as a character
I do on the show.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.160
I used to do this Italian talk
show hosts, Vinny Vedecci,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.130
and so it was him
doing impressions.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.870
Yeah.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.290
ALAN SEALES: Do you
have a favorite one?

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.207
BILL HADER: From that?

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.330
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.090
BILL HADER: They were all like--

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.920
you know, it was like
James Mason and Al Pacino.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.510
And I don't know, it was
all stuff that people--

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.550
like Lorne Michaels
is always like,

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:31.240
can you do anybody
who's a five, you know?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.440
So yeah, I always did
just impressions of people

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.540
that people had
done impressions of

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.050
ALAN SEALES: One
of my favorites--

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.133
BILL HADER: Over the years

00:22:37.133 --> 00:22:39.860
ALAN SEALES: I mean, one of
my favorites of the sketches

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.568
from "SNL" was Greg the Alien.

00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:43.110
BILL HADER: Oh,
Yeah, Greg the Alien.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.640
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.848
BILL HADER: Oh, that's funny.

00:22:44.848 --> 00:22:47.000
Yeah, I forgot about that one.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.470
That one came from
this guy-- it's

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.630
Simon Rich and John Mulaney
and I worked on that.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.967
And it was so--

00:22:52.967 --> 00:22:54.800
I was like, oh, we
should do an alien thing,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.460
and it was like a
sports talk show

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.403
where it was like the guests
would be like The Rock.

00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:03.570
Like, welcome back to Sports
Center, blah blah blah,

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.270
my co-host is Greg.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.990
Greg is not an alien and
they have no eyebrows.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.492
And I'm just like this.

00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.700
And then the callers, those
are the people calling in

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.730
and, like, hey how's it going?

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.272
Hey, I don't know
about the Patriots.

00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:18.310
[CHATTER]

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.750
So Greg, he's an alien, right?

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.075
Like-- he don't know
much about Earth.

00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:26.200
You know, and he was like,
no, Greg's not an alien.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.700
He's not.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.783
And all this little stuff.

00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:30.110
And then it was just like
I barely said anything.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.660
And at some point, water--

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.650
he knocks water on me
and I start smoking,

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.733
and I'm like, [MUFFLED VOICE],,
and all this smoke

00:23:35.733 --> 00:23:37.722
starts to come out.

00:23:37.722 --> 00:23:40.180
ALAN SEALES: Well, I brought
it up because the actual voice

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.220
itself is so unusual
and so unique.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.770
And I was just wondering
how you approach

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.980
a character-- a unique sort
of character like that.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.480
Like it sounds like
you're inhaling.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.013
BILL HADER: No, I don't know
where that stuff happen.

00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:53.680
I mean, it's just
they want-- initially,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.600
Greg was, like, normal
and he would talk normal,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.892
but he would say, like, how
much does your brain weigh?

00:23:57.892 --> 00:24:04.360
Like he was-- he just wasn't
he clearly wasn't from Earth.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.490
And then I heard with John
Mulaney was, like, yeah,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.310
what if did you just like
grunted or something?

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.383
What if it was more
like a character.

00:24:12.383 --> 00:24:13.050
I was like, oh--

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.230
[GARBLES]

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.065
--kind of thing?

00:24:15.065 --> 00:24:17.487
I'm just, like, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:17.487 --> 00:24:18.070
Let's do that.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.700
I mean, I wish I had a
better story, but there was--

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.600
it was just John going,
like, doing other noise.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.923
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:33.340
ALAN SEALES: Well of course,
I think everyone's favorite's

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.150
probably Stefon.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.460
And you would crack a
lot because the writer--

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.290
was it the writers?

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:41.720
BILL HADER: Yeah, John.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.650
John Mulaney, yeah.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.840
ALAN SEALES: Swap
out the cue cards.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.570
BILL HADER: John would sometimes
tell me as I was walking out,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.910
or he would put
little things on.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.610
It was like one little
thing was off that I--

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.090
and then that would set me
off, or he would add something

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.880
to the club list that
wasn't on there before,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.560
and it was one thing.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.710
And the first time was
when I first went out,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.720
we had a club promoter.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.400
Her name was Amnesia Bernstein.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.950
That was it-- that's
what it was at dress.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.240
And it didn't get a laugh.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.295
And then John was, like,
I'll change that club.

00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:17.670
I'll change Amnesia Bernstein--
that didn't get anything.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.878
And then he went off, and
then I was walking up there

00:25:19.878 --> 00:25:21.470
and I was really nervous.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.762
And he goes, I changed
it to Gay Liotta.

00:25:23.762 --> 00:25:26.202
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:26.202 --> 00:25:27.410
And he just kind of threw it.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.910
He's like, I changed it to Gay
Liotta, and he walked away.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.410
And then I was just
thinking about that,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.993
and then when it
came up on the cards,

00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:35.300
like I'd start laughing
because, like, that's so dumb.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.870
So I was just saying insane
shit, and then it was part--

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.410
the reason that
made me laugh was

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:47.010
I was imagining John laughing,
and that is like the most--

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.610
it's the most personal
thing that the entire nation

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.220
is watching.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.220
Not the entire nation,
but people are all across

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.928
the nation are watching
it, and it really

00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:56.480
is just a moment between John
Mulaney and I of him messing

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.980
with me, and me
finding it funny,

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.170
and me trying to make
him laugh and he's

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.400
trying to make me laugh.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.310
And it's just, like, this,
you know, us being friends.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.591
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.591 --> 00:26:08.090
SEALES: Did you look forward
to that all the time?

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.790
Because Stefon recurred
on "Weekend Update,"

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.010
like, over a dozen times.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.950
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.295
No, and I never made it
through a single one.

00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:17.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:17.632 --> 00:26:18.590
John made sure of that.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.390
One time, he put an
entire joke on it.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.380
He did once, where he'd put
a whole new joke, which was,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.900
hey Seth--

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.770
it was Halloween, and
he said, hey Seth,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.380
do you know there's
Blackula the black Dracula?

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.420
Well, there's a Jewish one.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.282
And he said, oh,
what's his name?

00:26:34.282 --> 00:26:36.320
And I said, Sidney Applebaum.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.140
Oh my god, That was funny.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.650
Sidney Applebaum.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.370
ALAN SEALES: Do you
miss the "SNL" days,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.422
or do you like the chapter
that you're in now?

00:26:57.422 --> 00:26:58.130
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.463
I mean, I love the people there.

00:26:59.463 --> 00:27:00.770
I miss the people there.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.030
Like, I'm doing "Seth
Meyers" later today.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.120
It's on the eighth floor.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.540
And I did a thing when
John Mulaney hosted last.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.580
I did a sketch on that.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.580
So I like being back for that,
but working there and having

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.160
to do the live show is really
hard on me after a while.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.045
I get very anxious.

00:27:17.045 --> 00:27:17.550
Yeah.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:17.750
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.230
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.940
ALAN SEALES: Do you have a
lot of anxiety in general?

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.430
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.180
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.890
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.712
Yeah, just in general, yeah.

00:27:23.712 --> 00:27:25.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.548
But it's just me.

00:27:27.548 --> 00:27:28.340
It's gotten better.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.490
Like, I do TM, and now
it's like I work out

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.208
not as a vanity thing, it's
just to, like, be sane.

00:27:35.208 --> 00:27:36.500
ALAN SEALES: Endorphin release.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.310
BILL HADER: Endorphin release.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.268
Like, all this shit when
in my 20s, I was like,

00:27:39.268 --> 00:27:41.620
endorphin release.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.230
Fuck you.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.920
Fucking idiots.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.469
Now I'm like, I need
my endorphin release.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.280
But yeah, and you
know, it's always

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.260
been a thing I've
always dealt with.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.570
You know, just very, what
could happen or want and make

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.790
sure I'm prepared
and things like that.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.415
ALAN SEALES: Well, the thing is,
I mean, you're good at improv,

00:28:13.415 --> 00:28:15.777
and when we're watching it,
you roll with the punches.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.360
So if things happen,
you're loving it.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.068
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:28:18.068 --> 00:28:19.260
It's the anticipation of it.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.695
It's the anticipation of
going out just like that.

00:28:21.695 --> 00:28:23.570
ALAN SEALES: Like, once
you're out it's fine.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.660
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.830
Once you're out
you're like, oh good.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.580
But even there, when
the thing's playing

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.170
I start to go like, [EXHALES].

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.560
You know what I mean?

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.315
Because it's just the
anticipation of it.

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:33.800
ALAN SEALES: Of this room
full of wonderful Googlers?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.508
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:28:34.508 --> 00:28:36.140
But that's just me.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.630
I've learned to accept it.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.190
You don't push it away, anxiety.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.440
Like, the more you push
it, it's like quicksand.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.580
And it's like, if you just let
it attack you and go hey, hey.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.831
And it's like [GROWLS].

00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:49.914
And you're like, hi buddy.

00:28:49.914 --> 00:28:50.930
OK, OK, just right here.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.410
Just stay here.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.070
It goes away quicker.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.732
ALAN SEALES: And
you've kept in touch--

00:28:57.732 --> 00:29:00.190
you're still working with Matt
Stone and Trey Parker, yeah?

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.130
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.870
Not as much, but we did--

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.668
I would go and help out some
in the "South Park" room, yeah.

00:29:06.668 --> 00:29:08.960
ALAN SEALES: Do you still
write or do you still produce

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.835
for them or anything?

00:29:09.835 --> 00:29:11.840
BILL HADER: No, just
because "Barry" happened,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.820
that's my whole life.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.460
But I just had dinner with
Matt a couple weeks ago,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.568
and they're doing
fine without me.

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:21.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.840
I don't know how big
of a help I was there.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.570
The first one I
worked on was this one

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:32.450
with Kanye West
"Fishsticks" episode, where

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.735
he says he's not a gay
fish, and at the end

00:29:34.735 --> 00:29:35.748
he has sex with a fish.

00:29:35.748 --> 00:29:37.456
ALAN SEALES: Oh, I
remember that episode.

00:29:37.456 --> 00:29:40.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.892 --> 00:29:42.850
BILL HADER: So on "My
Dark Fantasy," because he

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.610
says fuck "SNL", the entire
cast, and then he says,

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.300
I want to choke a South Park
writer with a fish dick.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.614
So he tells me to
fuck off twice.

00:29:51.614 --> 00:29:55.330
So I'm like, slick,
that's awesome.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.510
ALAN SEALES: I love that
Matt and Trey, they both--

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.230
they're outspoken about
disliking actors in general.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.150
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.810
ALAN SEALES: And
so they do a lot

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.390
of their own voices themselves.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.050
They do most of the
voices themselves.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.300
Have you ever gotten to do VO?

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.560
BILL HADER: Yeah, I
did a couple of voices.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.940
They did a "Yo Gabba Gabba" one.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.720
I was Plex.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.530
I did Alec Baldwin
on there, where

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.530
Alec Baldwin kept getting
in trouble on Twitter,

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.072
so he cut off his thumbs.

00:30:16.072 --> 00:30:17.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.030
He blamed his thumbs.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.750
It wasn't him.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.730
He was like, it's
clearly these thumbs.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.580
And I can't remember what else.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.320
Oh yeah, we did this one
where it was like these two--

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.680
Trey and I did these
two farmer characters.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.370
It was weird.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.487
Yeah.

00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:42.070
But what happened
is, you would write,

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.330
and then you would come
up with two characters,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.160
and then Trey would go, OK,
me and Bill will do that.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.830
Here, come on.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.070
And you go right next
door and you record it,

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.470
and you come right back
and you keep writing.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.540
And then, it's animated
by the time we're done,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.080
you know what I mean?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.965
It's, like, so fast.

00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:55.140
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.740
The completion process on a
weekly episode is ridiculous.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.110
BILL HADER: They turn
it around so fast.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.650
Yeah.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:02.740
I don't know how they do it.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.657
ALAN SEALES: I think one
of the biggest things

00:31:04.657 --> 00:31:07.630
that I read about
was when Hillary

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.050
lost the election, because
they had to rewrite everything

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.620
that night.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.037
BILL HADER: Yeah, they fully
thought she was going to win,

00:31:14.037 --> 00:31:16.210
and they were all ready,
and then she didn't.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.000
And it was like, shit, and
they had to completely rethink

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.352
the whole thing while crying.

00:31:21.352 --> 00:31:23.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.970
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.820
Well, that was a downer.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.750
And you have a very long
history, and a very successful

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.240
history, and a career now of
working with so many others.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.780
And like you yourself an
"SNL" alum who have gone

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.560
on to a lot of great things.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.860
But, like, Fred Armisen you've
worked with in "Portlandia,"

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.720
And of course, like, "Inside
Amy Schumer" and "Trainwreck"

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.970
with Amy Schumer, obviously.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.550
And "Skeleton Twins"-- it
sounds you and Kristen Wiig

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.950
are very good friends, yeah?

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.840
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.600
We don't see each other as
much, because we're so--

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.660
running around so much.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.760
But yeah, when we see each
other it's always fun.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.530
ALAN SEALES: Do you prefer to--

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.420
I mean, is that like reliving
the glory days of "SNL"?

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.050
And like you said,
you miss the people.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.980
So do you like those projects?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.930
BILL HADER: I miss the
people who work there.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.810
I always liked the
people-- my friends there.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.210
Like, I just had dinner the
other night with Will Forte.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.335
We had this awesome dinner.

00:32:14.335 --> 00:32:18.940
It was Will Forte, Tim Meadows,
Molly Shannon, and David Spade,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.900
and Jorma Taccone.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.730
And we all were just hanging
out, and just being like--

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.370
Gilbert Gottfried when I
saw him at the "SNL" 40th,

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.870
he looked at me and
he goes, I know.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.610
It's like we have
the same disease.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:34.426 --> 00:32:36.650
We had never met each other,
and he's like, I know,

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.280
we got the same disease.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.320
But it is, I mean,
you kind of have

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.250
this experience that
other people haven't had,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.310
and you're like,
remember this and that?

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.040
I know I'll see Seth, and
the minute he'll sit down,

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.680
we will start
talking immediately.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.580
John Mulaney and I did this
92nd Street Y thing for "Barry,"

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.950
and it just immediately
devolved into us talking

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.110
about "SNL" sketches
that didn't get on

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.622
that we are still mad about.

00:33:02.622 --> 00:33:05.080
And you know, you could tell
John would be like, anyway, so

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.590
"Barry"--

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.257
and then, we would
just be like, can you

00:33:07.257 --> 00:33:09.410
believe they didn't
pick whatever it was?

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:09.910
Yeah.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.910
ALAN SEALES: Well, it
sounds a little bit like--

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:12.657
not PTSD.

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.990
I don't want to go that extreme.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.460
But the weekly process of going
through rehearsing and editing

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.270
and rewrites and--

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.895
BILL HADER: Yeah,
and having to come up

00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:23.410
with new stuff every week,
and every week, every week.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.077
ALAN SEALES: Like, you get close
with these guys and these women

00:33:26.077 --> 00:33:29.380
in a way that I don't think you
have an opportunity to possibly

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.740
in a normal movies setup.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.448
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:34.252
And it's nine months a year, and
you just live with each other.

00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:35.210
Like, that's the thing.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.918
It wasn't until I did
"Trainwreck" that I

00:33:36.918 --> 00:33:38.507
got to see the city, honestly.

00:33:38.507 --> 00:33:39.340
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.150
BILL HADER: I was
like, what's that?

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.477
And they're like, that's
the Flatiron Building.

00:33:42.477 --> 00:33:43.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.240
You lived here for eight years.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.320
I was like, my apartment, 30
Rock, 30 Rock, my apartment,

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.160
you know?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.880
Yeah, so I never had
a chance to really--

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.533
so yeah, you just live there.

00:33:54.533 --> 00:33:56.950
ALAN SEALES: Was it hard to
say goodbye after eight years?

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.575
BILL HADER: No.

00:33:57.575 --> 00:34:00.440
I was kind of ready,
like, for my sanity,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.010
to move on, but just because
of the live performing.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.580
But I missed all
the people there.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.080
Yeah.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.320
I mean, I got really
sad when I left.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.290
We did the final
Stefon, and it's

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.690
that thing where Seth Meyers had
to see me cry, which was weird.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.706
Seth was like, oh, he's crying.

00:34:16.706 --> 00:34:19.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:22.150
And I just started crying,
because I was like, I'm really

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.679
going to miss you guys.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.096
And he's like, uh,
all right, man.

00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:26.388
All right, dude.

00:34:26.388 --> 00:34:26.889
Oh man.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.150
This is weird.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.084
Bill's crying.

00:34:31.084 --> 00:34:33.790
But yeah, it was sad.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:34.690
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.170
We'll start taking
questions in a second,

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.587
so if you want to
start lining up,

00:34:37.587 --> 00:34:40.150
audience members, please
go to the mics now.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.202
BILL HADER: This is going to be
just like the Aaron Sorkin one.

00:34:43.202 --> 00:34:44.469
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:46.175
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:47.550
BILL HADER: Aaron
Sorkin is going

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.873
to be just, [FIRING NOISES].

00:34:49.873 --> 00:34:50.790
ALAN SEALES: OK, yeah?

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.480
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's it going?

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.147
BILL HADER: Hey.

00:34:52.147 --> 00:34:54.510
AUDIENCE: I was wondering--
it seems like "Barry"

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.580
is kind of a departure from
what a lot of your content

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.360
previously was.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.470
Like, I'm always thinking of
you as the cop in "Superbad."

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.460
Like, that's just the role.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.110
No offense.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.110
It was an amazing movie.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:05.620
BILL HADER: No, that's cool.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.370
I like that movie.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.675
AUDIENCE: So it was kind
of exciting to see you

00:35:09.675 --> 00:35:11.800
go to something darker,
something a little angrier.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.383
Like, oh wow, he's
killing people now.

00:35:13.383 --> 00:35:15.770
Like, he shot some guns in
"Superbad," but no one died.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:16.540
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.260
AUDIENCE: So how do you
avoid typecasting yourself,

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:26.250
or like, making sure that you're
not being Bill Hader in "Barry"

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.685
as opposed to being Barry?

00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:29.190
BILL HADER: Well,
I try not to be

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:36.350
myself and in hardly anything,
because that's just boring.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.120
But you're right, though.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.140
I mean, it's funny.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.110
After "Superbad" came out,
it was like, the amount

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.710
of crazy authority figures.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.510
And I did a movie
called "Adventureland"

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.830
after that, which was like,
Kristen Wiig and I were

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.120
the bosses of Jesse
Eisenberg's character.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.020
And that was Greg Mottola,
and I love that movie,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.280
but I just kept getting
kind of cast in--

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.850
you know, like I was always
the boss to the main character.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.540
Like, the wacky whatever.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.992
And so honestly, I was like,
I need to learn to write.

00:36:10.992 --> 00:36:11.700
I need to learn--

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.168
Judd Apatow, when I met him,
he was like, learn to write.

00:36:14.168 --> 00:36:15.960
You're going to write
a lot of bad scripts.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.630
Learn to write right now
and control your destiny.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.020
And so I did, and I wrote
a lot of terrible scripts.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.160
And that's why,
like I said earlier,

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.118
I went to "South Park."

00:36:24.118 --> 00:36:27.660
I went to Pixar, because I
just loved how their things had

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.750
this great structure to it.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.880
Vince Gilligan was nice
let me go and hang out

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.920
one day at the "Better
Call Saul" writers room,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.010
just so I could be like,
how do you guys do this?

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:46.650
And then, so going into "Barry,"
it was a long apprenticeship

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.980
to get to that place, you know?

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.430
And it's just like anything.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.835
It's just, if you could just
learn to tell this story

00:36:54.835 --> 00:36:56.460
and make it about
the story, you're OK.

00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:00.790
But yeah, that was it.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.160
You're right, though.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.870
It's so funny.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.740
You do that, and then after
"Trainwreck," it was like, hey,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.040
do you want to be,
like, the romantic lead

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.450
guy who likes sports?

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.200
I'm not kidding.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.210
The amount of scripts
that were like,

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.410
he works with sports people.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.380
And I'm like, I just--

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.380
just did that, you know?

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.705 --> 00:37:19.410
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:19.910
Thank you.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.450
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.950
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, thank you

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.575
for giving us something
to look forward

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:27.828
to on Sunday nights, especially
us "Game of Thrones" fans.

00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:28.620
But second of all--

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:28.945
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:37:28.945 --> 00:37:29.130
Good.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.630
All right.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.870
[LAUGHTER AND GROANING]

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.760
Oh wait, does that mean
you guys don't like--

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.070
wait, what does that mean?

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.675
That "Game of
Thrones" has been bad?

00:37:36.675 --> 00:37:37.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.010
The last season was bad.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:38.942
BILL HADER: Oh, word.

00:37:38.942 --> 00:37:41.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:41.675 --> 00:37:42.600
Yeah.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.017
I've been hearing that a lot,
and I'm always like, what?

00:37:45.017 --> 00:37:45.600
What happened?

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.580
And then, yeah,
people on the street

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.066
will come up to you like,
what the fuck was that?

00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:54.474
And I go, I had nothing
to do with that.

00:37:54.474 --> 00:37:57.120
It's like, she can change
her face to whatever the fuck

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.438
she wants it to be!

00:37:58.438 --> 00:38:01.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:04.550
And I'm like,
right, right, right.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.880
And it's like, rocks?

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.965
Fucking rocks fell on them?

00:38:08.965 --> 00:38:09.550
Fuck you!

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.500
And I'm like, fuck me.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.050
I'm not HBO.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.030
I'm just the guy
after that thing.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.765
Anyway.

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:17.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.910
I'm not joking.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.285
Both those things
happened to me.

00:38:20.285 --> 00:38:22.660
She can change her face to
whatever she wants, and rocks.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.003
And I'm like, I have no
idea what to tell you.

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:28.170
AUDIENCE: When you guys are
writing these characters

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.727
on "Barry," do you have some
idea of how the audience might

00:38:30.727 --> 00:38:31.810
react to these characters?

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.840
Like, when you're writing
and filming the show,

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.890
do you sort of have an idea?

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.900
Oh, NoHo Hank is probably
going to become a fan favorite

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.990
because he's funny or something?

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.375
BILL HADER: No.

00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:40.167
AUDIENCE: And how do
you react to it when--

00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:40.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:40.996
OK.

00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:43.038
BILL HADER: You know, we
tried to kill NoHo Hank.

00:38:43.038 --> 00:38:44.298
I mean, in the pilot, he died.

00:38:44.298 --> 00:38:46.590
You know, when I shoot up
the car in the first episode,

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.850
he died.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:52.560
And then, Anthony was so funny
that Alec and I were shooting

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.332
his death scene, and it was
a thing where Anthony said--

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:57.040
it was like, they were
like, where do you

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.930
want the squibs to hit him?

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.550
And I was like, well, I think
one hits him in the neck

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.870
and one hits him in
the head or whatever.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.370
And Anthony was
like, well you know,

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.570
maybe if that one was here--

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.162
And this one was
kind of more here.

00:39:08.162 --> 00:39:11.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.160
Anthony was like, and
instead of the head,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.500
what if it, like, misses?

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500
But yeah, we were just
watching him going, like,

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.000
we'd be idiots to kill him.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.130
And so we let him, you know,
live, because he was so funny.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.770
I mean, you have no idea.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.450
You just try to tell
the story, and not

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.428
think about it in
terms of what people

00:39:32.428 --> 00:39:33.470
are going to want to see.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.590
You just go, well,
what do we want to see?

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.872
And hopefully there's
a Venn diagram there.

00:39:40.872 --> 00:39:42.080
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, over here?

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.030
AUDIENCE: Love "Barry," but
I have a "Forgetting Sarah

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.822
Marshall" question.

00:39:44.822 --> 00:39:45.447
BILL HADER: OK.

00:39:45.447 --> 00:39:46.410
Let me go back to 2008.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.303
Yeah, of course.

00:39:47.303 --> 00:39:48.550
Just take your time.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.203
A great year.

00:39:50.203 --> 00:39:52.370
BILL HADER: "Slumdog
Millionaire" was in the cinema.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.037
AUDIENCE: Let me know
when you're there.

00:39:54.037 --> 00:39:56.606
BILL HADER: "Milk" told us
the story of Harvey Milk--

00:39:56.606 --> 00:39:57.502
OK, no.

00:39:57.502 --> 00:39:59.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.090
AUDIENCE: What was
it like to shoot

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.900
the vampire musical
Dracula musical scene?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.340
BILL HADER: I'm not being coy.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.480
I don't remember.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.240
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:09.770
Well, I'm done here.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.978
BILL HADER: I don't remember.

00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:15.245
No, I do remember working
with the puppeteer people.

00:40:15.245 --> 00:40:17.870
I had to stay in a hotel because
I was living here at the time,

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:21.050
and a woman came in and she
talked through her puppet

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.628
to me.

00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:23.420
It was like, hey, oh,
you having breakfast?

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.108
Whoa!

00:40:25.108 --> 00:40:26.900
So we're going to learn
how to do puppetry!

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.483
And I was like, oh,
can you stop that?

00:40:28.483 --> 00:40:31.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:36.110
And then, Jason Segel was
like, did you meet the?

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.870
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:42.745
Thank you.

00:40:42.745 --> 00:40:44.502
BILL HADER: Yeah, thanks.

00:40:44.502 --> 00:40:46.460
ALAN SEALES: The guy who
composed that actually

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.600
lives on my block.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.160
BILL HADER: Oh, really?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.525
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:40:48.525 --> 00:40:49.280
BILL HADER: Oh.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.050
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.500
Small world.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.672
The Dracula song.

00:40:52.672 --> 00:40:53.630
BILL HADER: Oh, really?

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:54.370
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:55.150
BILL HADER: All of
the questions now

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.858
are going to be like,
what block is that?

00:40:56.858 --> 00:40:58.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.955
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
thanks for being here.

00:41:03.955 --> 00:41:06.080
Last year, you were on one
of my favorite podcasts,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.413
"So Many White Guys," and you
said that you made friends

00:41:08.413 --> 00:41:09.440
with your anxiety.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.860
And I was wondering, how has
that influenced your ability

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:17.060
as an entertainer, as a creative
person, either positively

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.240
or negatively?

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.540
BILL HADER: You know,
you have to manage it.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.850
You just kind of go, oh,
this is a thing I have

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.150
and it's not going away.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.550
And you can take all the drugs
and all this stuff to kind of--

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.490
and it just puts, like,
a lid on it, you know?

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.972
Like, people are like, just
take some Klonopin, brah.

00:41:37.972 --> 00:41:38.933
Take a Xanny, man.

00:41:38.933 --> 00:41:40.100
AUDIENCE: Just a little one.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.110
BILL HADER: And you do it,
and that just put a lid on it.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.568
And then the minute you don't
take it, it's like, [ROARS]..

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:46.880
And you're like, oh, yeah.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.340
So you just kind of,
like, accept it, you know?

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.480
Yeah, I do literally--
this sounds crazy--

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.990
I do think of it as like
a weird little creature

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.850
that's gnawing my face.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.460
And I just go,
OK, we're friends.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.450
And you just accept it.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.310
And you know it's
a thing that's just

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.660
kind of great that I learned
was I'm not anxious because.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.560
Take out the because.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.850
Take the narrative out of it.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.802
Just go, oh, I'm
anxious right now.

00:42:12.802 --> 00:42:14.510
And I just go, oh,
I'm anxious right now.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.320
I'm being anxious right now.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.570
I'm not anxious because I
have to do this Google talk.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.310
I'm just, oh, this
is me anxious.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.440
And then it kind of dissipates.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.320
And it happens a lot,
like, I'll get angry,

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.480
and I get frustrated, and
you just go, I'm frustrated.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.230
And you just kind of
hold it in your hand,

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.860
like, oh, that's what
frustration looks like.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.260
And then it kind of goes, bloop.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.430
Like that.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.590
For me it really works,
because it's the narrative.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.910
You know, I'm frustrated
because I can't kill Anthony.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.534
I can't kill NoHo Hank.

00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:44.270
[LAUGHS]

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:51.225
But you know, that somehow has
helped me, but it's a process.

00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:53.350
And it's like, you never
feel like it's an endgame.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.340
You never go, I got it licked.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.910
You just have to
know, it's like, oh,

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.880
this is the new thing.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.742
I'm going to try to apply
that right now, because I just

00:43:01.742 --> 00:43:01.800
asked you a question.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.260
BILL HADER: Oh, please do.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.900
Yeah.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.400
Oh good.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.360
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.290
Yeah?

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.580
So I have a kind
of weird question.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.980
Back in December 2012 on
"SNL," Jamie Foxx was the host,

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.780
Ne-Yo was the musical performer.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.310
I saw it, and I kind of
had a conversation with you

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.145
in front of the studio audience.

00:43:24.145 --> 00:43:25.190
BILLY HADER: Was I nice?

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.690
Yeah.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.730
I was just wondering
if you remember that.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:28.730
BILL HADER: Oh.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:34.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.588
Wait, where?

00:43:36.588 --> 00:43:37.380
AUDIENCE: At "SNL."

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.963
BILL HADER: No, no, no, where
in front of the studio audience?

00:43:39.963 --> 00:43:42.500
AUDIENCE: I was the
second to front row.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.208
BILL HADER: And it
was during the show?

00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:45.750
AUDIENCE: It was
the dress rehearsal,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.310
and then afterwards
you came over.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.360
We chatted about Stefon.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.902
You told me a thing about how
John Mulaney changes the jokes.

00:43:50.902 --> 00:43:52.100
BILL HADER: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.183
No, I don't remember that.

00:43:53.183 --> 00:43:55.210
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.330
Cool, cool, cool.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.690
I've been, like, waiting
years to ask this question.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.230
BILL HADER: Oh man.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.793
I probably was like, there's
a super cute girl over there.

00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:05.460
I'm going to go talk
to her about stuff.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.040
No, I don't remember.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.180
AUDIENCE: While I
have you, I also

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.114
ran into John Mulaney on
the street recently, and--

00:44:13.114 --> 00:44:16.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:19.095
As he was going into
Equinox and I did--

00:44:19.095 --> 00:44:20.470
BILL HADER: He
went into Equinox?

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.286
AUDIENCE: He did.

00:44:21.286 --> 00:44:21.786
Yeah.

00:44:21.786 --> 00:44:23.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:26.220
I did scream, oh my god,
you're John Mulaney, at him.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.274
And I was just wondering
if you could ask him--

00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:29.566
BILL HADER: If he told me that?

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:30.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:30.772
BILL HADER: No.

00:44:30.772 --> 00:44:31.314
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:31.887
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:31.887 --> 00:44:33.345
BILL HADER: He
didn't tell me that.

00:44:33.345 --> 00:44:33.690
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.530
I actually have a real question.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.200
BILL HADER: This is what
social media is for.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.490
AUDIENCE: Right, right, right.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.250
BILL HADER: This is why you
have social media, is to say,

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.238
I just had this conversation.

00:44:43.238 --> 00:44:45.280
Oh man, no, I don't remember
any of those things.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.080
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.330
BILL HADER: But that's cool
that you did that, though,

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.940
because I don't have the
nerve to say that to people,

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.300
not like--

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.740
I just met Keith Morrison today.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.750
I used to do Keith
Morrison on "Dateline,"

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.730
and I just met him
for the first time,

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.000
and I was so nervous that
I barely said anything.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:02.880
I'm shaking.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.380
BILL HADER: I was like, hey man.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.372
And he was like,
oh, it's just me.

00:45:06.372 --> 00:45:09.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.316
AUDIENCE: I actually
have a real question.

00:45:12.316 --> 00:45:14.430
BILL HADER: Are sitting down?

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.420
OK.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.490
Everybody's sitting.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:17.535
Yeah?

00:45:17.535 --> 00:45:20.160
AUDIENCE: Obviously there's tons
of differences between "Barry"

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.890
and "SNL," and I
was just wondering,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.170
were there any parallels
you experienced,

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.040
or was there something
that you learned

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.955
from "SNL" that you applied
to how you approach "Barry?"

00:45:31.955 --> 00:45:33.330
BILL HADER: Yeah,
a lot of stuff.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:38.370
It was like a lot of things.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.953
You know, like at "SNL,"
you're in charge your sketch.

00:45:41.953 --> 00:45:43.620
You have to work with
all the department

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.060
heads-- makeup, hair, wardrobe.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.620
You have to do all those things.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:57.230
And without knowing it, I
was producing it, you know?

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.600
And it was like, oh,
that's what producing is.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.540
You get all of
these great people

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.800
together to make your
thing make sense, you know?

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.837
Like, Stefon, the
Ed Hardy shirt, I

00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:12.420
remember John just
said he should just

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.420
have some sort of shirt.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.900
And Tom Broecker came out
with that Ed Hardy shirt.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.210
We didn't tell him to do
that, but we kind of said,

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:23.797
here's who this guy
is, and do your job.

00:46:23.797 --> 00:46:24.630
But no, I mean that.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:25.310
Like, I do.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.570
And so, like,
"ronny/lily" episode,

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.903
it's like, we put music in it.

00:46:30.903 --> 00:46:32.320
And I went to the
editor and went,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.560
I don't think we should
have any music in this.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.812
And we'd take it out.

00:46:36.812 --> 00:46:38.520
The assistant editors
at the end of that,

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.200
where the little
girl screams at us

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.190
and it sounds like she's
a raptor or something--

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.080
I initially had her doing that
through the whole episode,

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.955
and it was our assistant
editor, this guy Frankie,

00:46:49.955 --> 00:46:52.330
was like, maybe you should
just have her do it at the end

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.610
so it's, like a new thing.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.490
And I was like,
that's a great idea.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.700
So that collaboration
and working with people,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.320
that came from "SNL."

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.530
I did not know how to
do that beforehand.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.280
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:05.970
Thanks.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.720
BILL HADER: I'll tell
John you said hi.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.800
Thanks for coming today.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.155
I was wondering about Sally,
because she's so annoying.

00:47:18.155 --> 00:47:21.680
And I love her as a character,
but I hate her as a person.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.370
And I have to pause it,
because she's so cringey.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:28.410
And I was wondering if you
were ever nervous about having

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.510
such a main character
be so unlikable,

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.230
especially since she's the
object of Barry's affection,

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.660
and she's so
shallow and selfish.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.680
BILL HADER: She's based on me.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.970
So cool.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.600
Right on.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.240
I thought it'd be
a little bit weird

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.480
to base my character on me,
so I said, you know what?

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.650
I'll put all my energy into
someone of a different sex

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.400
and everything.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.480
But cool.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.110
Right on.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:47:59.610
No.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:04.220
You know, she's based on a
lot of actors that I know,

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:10.070
and they are very self
obsessed and stuff.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.818
And I give Sarah
Goldberg the plays her,

00:48:11.818 --> 00:48:14.110
a lot of credit, because
Sarah is not like that at all,

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.760
and Sarah wants to always
play somebody that--

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.640
she wants it to be, like,
no, that's not truth.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.560
The truth is, she
wouldn't care about that.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.935
She's just worried
about herself.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.220
But you know, when you're
writing these things,

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.468
you have to have a level
of empathy for everybody.

00:48:32.468 --> 00:48:34.260
You know, when you're
writing these things,

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.640
if you just kind
of hate somebody

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.950
or you're kind of talking
down to the characters-- which

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:38.450
we do.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.140
We'll write it that way.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.263
And then, like
with Henry Winkler,

00:48:42.263 --> 00:48:44.430
when he came in and read,
he went, oh, failed actor.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.990
Oh, now I kind of have
this weird empathy for him.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:51.120
And Sally, I mean, this season
she had a terrible-- you know,

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.900
her ex-husband beat her
up and all these things.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.592
ALAN SEALES: Barry
got the audition?

00:48:55.592 --> 00:48:56.300
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.570
I got an audition.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.880
And Sarah did that amazing
monologue in episode seven.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.640
She did, like, a
three-page monologue.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.520
But I like someone that's human.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.283
And it's interesting
that the people tend--

00:49:10.283 --> 00:49:12.200
especially the female
characters-- they always

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.800
want them to be kind of
perfect, and we kind of

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.280
wanted someone who
was just human.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.390
But it's funny, because
I had people go,

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.130
I can't stand that woman, or I
can't stand this, or whatever.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.335
And I'm like, but
Barry kills people.

00:49:27.335 --> 00:49:32.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.790
But I don't know.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:40.820
I really feel for Sally,
because I just know her,

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.312
because it's based on me.

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:42.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:42.812 --> 00:49:44.760
No, OK.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.180
So thanks for that.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.070
ALAN SEALES: I
really like Sally.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.400
For what it's worth,
I think she is

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.790
an incredibly well-written
character, and the way

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:57.580
that Sarah brings her to life.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:58.340
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.882
ALAN SEALES: She's,
like, the example

00:49:59.882 --> 00:50:02.930
of saying earlier of having
two characters in the show.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.780
She's got the normal,
ditzy, everyday.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.120
And then, like, oh my
god, I'm acting now.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.930
But it's so good.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.805
BILL HADER: Yeah, no.

00:50:09.805 --> 00:50:11.495
It's hard to--

00:50:11.495 --> 00:50:13.370
I mean, that's the thing
you're always trying

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.510
to make sure makes sense.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.610
And especially dealing
with domestic violence

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.880
like we did, and Alec and I
are like, we're two white guys.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.470
We don't know what
this is, so we're

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.880
going to go talk to women
who've experienced this

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.580
so we kind of can have a
real point of view on it

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.517
that's truth, because
we don't know.

00:50:29.517 --> 00:50:31.100
We did a thing in
the season one where

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.090
Barry bought her a laptop.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.043
And he buys her a
laptop after one date.

00:50:35.043 --> 00:50:37.460
They slept with each other
once, and he buys her a laptop.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.896
And Alec and I were like,
that's a great gift.

00:50:39.896 --> 00:50:41.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.000
All the women in the writers
room were like, what?

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.142
That's so creepy.

00:50:47.142 --> 00:50:49.100
And I was like, no, what
are you talking about?

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:49.850
What a nice thing?

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:50.930
They're like, what?

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.570
And they were like, that is
the most creepiest thing.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.933
And we had it laid out that
he gave her this laptop.

00:50:55.933 --> 00:50:57.350
And Sally was like,
oh, thank you.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.810
And they were like,
fuck that, you know?

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.330
And so we made her go--

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.870
it totally changed this thing.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:05.180
And it made it more interesting,
because she says no,

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.020
and then they broke up.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.770
And we were like, well
now Sally and Barry

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.510
are kind of on the outs.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.010
Wow.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.680
This is more interesting.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.430
This happened way
quicker than we thought,

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.600
and now it made it more a thing.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.020
So I don't know.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.960
ALAN SEALES: I really
found it admirable was

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.580
where she's got this big break.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.960
I think it was in episode six
or seven, whichever the latest

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.110
one was, where she's got this
big break with Jay Roach,

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.290
actually-- real Jay Roach.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:32.465
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:51:32.465 --> 00:51:33.590
Oh no, Barry has Jay Roach.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:33.970
ALAN SEALES: Oh, sorry.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:35.080
No, you have the Jay Roach hit.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.580
But the--

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.863
BILL HADER: Yeah, the
guy who made the TV show.

00:51:37.863 --> 00:51:39.530
ALAN SEALES: With,
like, stereotypical--

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.640
BILL HADER: Yeah,
the payback ladies.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.390
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.560
But like, as badly as
she wants to succeed,

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.690
as badly as she wants
attention and success,

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:48.980
she still turns it down.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.190
BILL HADER: Yeah.

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.820
She wants to be an artist, which
is, like, the hardest thing.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.140
You have to keep your integrity.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.200
But it was so hard.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200
I have pictures of Alec
Berg when we were trying

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.367
to figure out what that was.

00:51:58.367 --> 00:52:02.180
We just had this hole in
the script that was like,

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.840
Sally has a meeting with this
guy, and he says something.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.510
It's her big break,
and she turns it down.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.360
And it has to be
lame, but he also

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:17.000
has to do with violence
somehow in her experience.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.120
What is that?

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.728
And I have all these pictures of
Alec in my apartment like this.

00:52:21.728 --> 00:52:24.020
And then, we have one where
he kept changing positions,

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.946
and I was just taking
pictures of him,

00:52:25.946 --> 00:52:27.140
because he would be
over here like this.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.765
And we didn't speak
for, like, an hour.

00:52:28.765 --> 00:52:32.040
We were just sitting in my
apartment, like, what is that?

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.748
And then, we both came
up with something.

00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:35.332
And then we pitched
it to Liz Sarnoff,

00:52:35.332 --> 00:52:37.060
one of our other
writers, over the phone.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.912
So I'd go, Alec has
a thing I don't like,

00:52:38.912 --> 00:52:40.370
and I have a thing
he doesn't like.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:41.670
And so we pitched it
to her, and she goes,

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:42.878
I don't like either of those.

00:52:42.878 --> 00:52:43.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.110
And then we talked about it, and
she goes, you know what it is?

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.280
There's all these shows
of women who were abused,

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.400
and so they get a gun, and
then they go and exact revenge.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.470
She goes, which I
find really offensive.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.357
And we were like,
that's perfect.

00:52:56.357 --> 00:52:57.440
She's like, so I'm abused.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.023
I'm going to be an
asshole like Barry.

00:52:59.023 --> 00:53:00.440
Oh, boom, we got it.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.600
But that's it, you know?

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.150
And so yeah, "It's That Time
of the Month for Revenge"

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.590
was the--

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:10.760
Which I think that
could be a real thing.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.812
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:53:11.812 --> 00:53:14.270
So we're running out of times,
so we have time for one more

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.408
question from each side.

00:53:15.408 --> 00:53:16.450
So we'll start over here.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:16.992
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:16.992 --> 00:53:18.318
Thanks for being here.

00:53:18.318 --> 00:53:19.860
The puppeteering
question reminded me

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.500
of one of my favorite
"SNL" sketches

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.990
with the vet puppeteer class.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.520
BILL HADER: Oh, yeah.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.670
Anthony Coleman

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so great.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.530
So on "SNL" you do so
many crazy characters.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.420
You get to kind of
be the crazy man,

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.330
and then like "Trainwreck"
and other movies you done,

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.478
you can do more at
the voice of reason.

00:53:37.478 --> 00:53:39.020
And I was trying to
figure out, like,

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.640
where do you think Barry falls?

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.040
He's not really wacky,
but he is a murderer.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.810
And then, also what
do you prefer to play,

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.732
crazy man or straight
man or voice of reason?

00:53:47.732 --> 00:53:48.690
BILL HADER: It's funny.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:50.482
I don't even think
about it in those terms.

00:53:50.482 --> 00:53:53.210
You kind of just go, is this
a thing I can relate to?

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:55.140
And what's the part of me--

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.760
like, I can't relate
to being a murderer,

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.300
as far as you guys know.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:07.890
But I can relate to wanting
a sense of community,

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:13.740
and that feeling of feeling
isolated and wanting

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.270
so badly to be a part of a
community like Barry does.

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:22.880
And I think he just wants
connection with people,

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:28.297
and he wants to be normal.

00:54:28.297 --> 00:54:30.880
And I've felt that way before,
where you're like, am I normal?

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.697
Am I not normal?

00:54:31.697 --> 00:54:33.030
What is wrong with me, you know?

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:34.405
Or it's like, I
get anxious, or I

00:54:34.405 --> 00:54:36.655
want to do these other things,
and everyone is saying,

00:54:36.655 --> 00:54:37.800
I need to be going to--

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.880
I remember when I
was in high school,

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.440
like, I don't want
to go to college.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.850
My friends were like, what?

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.670
Or whatever it is, and you
just feel out of sorts,

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.890
and it's those feelings
you can remember

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.500
and draw on when you're
writing it and thinking

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.570
about how you felt.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.490
And then, those other
movies, anything-- even

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.850
"Superbad" is like, I worked
at a movie theater once

00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:02.730
and the amount of authority I
had there made me power mad.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.585
I went crazy.

00:55:04.585 --> 00:55:06.668
I was like, no, you can't
bring that food in here.

00:55:06.668 --> 00:55:10.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.800
I was that asshole, just because
it was like, this is awesome.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.480
And so it was that.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.950
Like, I'll bring that to that.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:24.080
And then all the relationship
stuff in "Trainwreck"

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.990
or whatever it is.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.610
In that movie
"Skeleton Twins," it

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.680
was a feeling which I
related to of feeling

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.313
like you peaked already.

00:55:34.313 --> 00:55:36.230
You know, it's like you
did the one thing that

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.938
was already good, and
now everything else

00:55:37.938 --> 00:55:42.420
is it's not happening for
you, and that fear and stuff.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.060
So I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:49.160
But just again, you just have
to find that part of yourself

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.664
and write to that,
or act to that.

00:55:51.664 --> 00:55:52.372
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:55:52.372 --> 00:55:52.870
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:53.453
Last question.

00:55:53.453 --> 00:55:55.850
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's it going?

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:59.180
You mentioned before
that you would sometimes

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.520
meet with your "SNL"
buddies and talk

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.400
about skits that never aired.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.350
And I realized
that, you know, what

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:08.025
I wouldn't give
to be in that room

00:56:08.025 --> 00:56:09.400
with you guys
talking about that.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.442
And I was wondering--
hoping-- if you could maybe

00:56:11.442 --> 00:56:14.830
talk about one of those
"SNL" skits that never aired.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:15.830
BILL HADER: Never aired?

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:17.130
Oh man, there's
too many of them.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.463
AUDIENCE: One of your favorites.

00:56:21.048 --> 00:56:21.840
BILL HADER: Oh man.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:30.030
There's one called "The Kasems."

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:34.500
Me and John Mulaney wrote this
one where it was Casey Kasem,

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.060
and Dana Carvey was hosting.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:41.192
It was Casey Kasem coming out
of his house late at night,

00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:42.150
and he hears something.

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.100
And he's in a robe, and
he goes, who's that?

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.987
I'm Casey Kasem.

00:56:45.987 --> 00:56:49.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.850
And then, I come out from
behind the trashcans.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:56.520
I go, dad, it's not a
burglar or a raccoon.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.916
It's me, your son, JC Kasem.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.040
And he goes, son,
get out of here.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.980
Dad, hear me out.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.752
Son, I want nothing
to do with you.

00:57:04.752 --> 00:57:06.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:13.470
And then they had this
very serious conversation,

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:15.190
but we were talking that way.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.148
So there's lines like--

00:57:16.148 --> 00:57:17.898
it was the hardest
John Mulaney and I ever

00:57:17.898 --> 00:57:19.330
laughed writing something.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.010
One of the lines was like,
you're always telling me,

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:24.807
when are you going to get a job?

00:57:24.807 --> 00:57:26.640
When are you going to
move out of the house?

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.747
And what recording artist
had more number one hits?

00:57:29.747 --> 00:57:33.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:38.820
It's like, and he went,
Mariah Carey with 17.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.360
But seriously, son, I
need you out of here.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.468
And then he said--

00:57:43.468 --> 00:57:45.260
what was the other line
that made us laugh?

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:48.140
He goes, dad, why
won't you let me in?

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.360
And he goes, here's a letter.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:57.050
Dear Casey, your son and his
boyfriend owe me $400,000.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:58:01.100
And it was this whole thing
about how me and the guy

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:07.020
I was living with, we had ripped
off some Colombian drug lord.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.410
I don't know what it was,
but it really was funny.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.600
And so that didn't get on.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.790
And then Will Forte
and I did a sketch

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:22.310
called Emmy Attire that
was really dumb where

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:25.504
I was like, hey man--

00:58:25.504 --> 00:58:33.360
[LAUGHS] it was him and he came
out, and I'm in biking attire.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.758
And I go, hey man, are you
ready to go to the Emmys?

00:58:36.758 --> 00:58:37.550
And I go, yeah man.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:38.800
He goes, what are you wearing?

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.842
And he's in another room.

00:58:39.842 --> 00:58:40.717
What are you wearing?

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:41.690
I go, biking attire.

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.220
He goes, what?

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.090
I go, biking attire.

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:47.520
You know, like gloves,
the thing, the hat.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.170
I'm ready to go to the
Emmys in biking attire.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.500
And he goes, go change.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.030
I go, why?

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.700
And he comes out
in biking attire.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.162
And he goes, because I'm wearing
biking attire to the Emmys.

00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.600
And then, Steve
Carell was the host.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.730
And Steve Carell came
in in Viking attire.

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:08.480
And he goes, oh, I thought
we were doing Viking attire.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.317
I thought you said Viking
attire, not biking attire.

00:59:11.317 --> 00:59:13.400
And I just remember reading
this and looking over,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.603
and Tina Fey just
staring at us like.

00:59:15.603 --> 00:59:18.068
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:23.491 --> 00:59:26.500
And then, Will Forte did a thing
that I think eventually got on.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.870
At that dinner, I said,
did you ever do the thing

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.790
where he was a SWAT
guy that he always

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:35.410
tried to get on, who was
this really like SWAT dude.

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.247
And he was on a
date with Megan Fox,

00:59:38.247 --> 00:59:39.580
I think he said he wrote it for.

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.830
And this might have made it
on, where he was this guy,

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:45.070
and she's like, so
you're a SWAT guy?

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.080
So what do you do?

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.850
And he's like,
[DELICATE VOICE] yeah,

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.216
I've been working in SWAT.

00:59:48.216 --> 00:59:50.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.750
And then it quickly got
into how he raised lambs.

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:57.500
He goes, I raise
lambs on my farm.

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.660
It's a really nice time, when
I'm not in the SWAT business.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.160
And the line that
made me laugh was,

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.320
she goes, how do
you make your money?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.660
And he goes, well
I sell their hides

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.570
and I sell the meat
and all that stuff.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:11.650
And she goes, so you have
to slaughter the lambs

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.260
and he goes, it's really hard.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.068
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.750
I remember he did that at the
table read and I lost my mind.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.780
It's really hard.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:29.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.870
ALAN SEALES: I hope one day
you go back and revitalize

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:33.197
the Californians.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:34.780
BILL HADER: Oh yeah,
the Californians.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.530
ALAN SEALES: One of
my all time favorites.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:39.460
BILL HADER: Yeah,
Californians, especially anyone

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:44.197
who's been to LA or knows LA,
that it's so grossly accurate.

01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:45.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.350
It's so insanely accurate.

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:48.100
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.285
Well, we're out of time.

01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:50.660
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:50.800
BILL HADER: Oh man.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.550
Well, thanks guys.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.940
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:03.040
ALAN SEALES: So the
final season of "Barry"

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.130

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.990
BILL HADER: After got.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.970
ALAN SEALES: After got.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.553
BILL HADER: Everybody
just lay off me.

01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:12.730
Just don't yell at me
about "Game of Thrones."

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:15.100
ALAN SEALES: So you can go
back and stream everything

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.710

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.620
And now you got picked
up for season three.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:19.945
Congratulations.

01:01:19.945 --> 01:01:21.237
BILL HADER: Season three, yeah.

01:01:21.237 --> 01:01:21.950
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.715
We've got to figure it out.

01:01:23.715 --> 01:01:25.340
We've got to figure
out how to end this

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.757
or how to keep
this thing moving.

01:01:26.757 --> 01:01:28.840
ALAN SEALES: The cliffhanger
for the last episode,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.220
I'm still looking
forward to this Sunday,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.080
because I want to know
what happens to Gene.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.720
BILL HADER: Oh, yeah.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.320
I will just say this
episode is really dark.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.205
Yeah, I have friends who've seen
it already, the last episode,

01:01:41.205 --> 01:01:42.330
and they're all like, what?

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.348
Like, Seth Meyers saw it and
he was like, what the fuck?

01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:47.630
That was so fucked up.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:48.280
So yea.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.410
ALAN SEALES: Well,
everybody help

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:50.660
me thank him again for coming.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.670
BILL HADER: Thanks guys.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:52.628
Thank you guys so much.

[APPLAUSE]

Thanks, guys.
