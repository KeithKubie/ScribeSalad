00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
At least 1 student asked, "At the end of this course,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
will we be able to write JavaScript programs?"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This question sounds simple, but actually it's surprisingly complicated.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
By the end of this course, you will have written a few simple, but honest, JavaScript programs.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Lke the implementation of Euclid's algorithm that you've already done,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
over the course of the next few units,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you'll get 1 or 2 more chances to write JavaScript--simple JavaScript programs.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But mostly, we'll be doing that to make sure that we understand the correspondents

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
between JavaScript and Python.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
One of the things that we'll hint at as this course progresses is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that those 2 languages are actually equivalent in a very strong theoretical sense.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Anything you can do in Python, we could also do in JavaScript and vice versa.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now when people say, are you familiar with JavaScript?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Have you written a long JavaScript program?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They're probably talking about the way JavaScript interacts with a web page,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
uses the document-object model to draw flashy animations or change what's displayed

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to the user.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're not going to cover that in this class.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's more of a presentation or user-interface issue.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In this class, we want to understand the theory--the nuts and bolts--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
behind various programming languages.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So we're not going to talk a lot about how to draw buttons

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or how to make special text effects,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
instead we're going to talk about how to interpret functions and integers and strings.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What if the user's Java program is recursive?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Could we still handle that?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And once you can handle a language that has variables and recursion and rich control flow

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and a plethura of meanings,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it turns out that all computer science formal languages that have that power--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they're all equivalent.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Anything that you could do in C, you could do in C++ or Java or JavaScript or Python.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So you could work your way up to writing the flashy buttons,

00:02:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but it's not a topic for this class.
