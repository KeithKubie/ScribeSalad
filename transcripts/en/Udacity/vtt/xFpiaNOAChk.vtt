00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.690
So, you might be wondering why
do I need a master resume?

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.240
Let me tell you about how it helped
me during my own job search.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.650
As I happened to be a person
with many different interests,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.290
I have worked in many different fields
and positions from media to epidemics,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
publishing non-profits,
technology startups, and as a performer.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.890
Before moving to the US,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.180
I had over 14 years of professional
experience under my belt.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.520
Many of these experiences are very
interesting to talk about, like being

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.350
a producer of a daily talk show with
lots and lots of paternity testing, but

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.340
completely irrelevant to a career I
wanted to pursue in a new continent.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.930
Right before I started at Udacity,
I worked for a cultural institution of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.990
the Federal Republic of Germany,
who wanted to have all the dates and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.710
names of everyone I ever worked with and
every training I've ever taken.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.350
It's rare that anyone besides
the government will want to know this

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.570
much about you.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.370
In fact, a guiding rule of thumb in this
lesson is to keep resumes to one page if

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.470
at all possible but what I submitted to
this institution wasn't a normal resume,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.940
it's what I later called
my master resume,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.480
a seven page tome of
all of my experiences.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.570
What was really helpful,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.760
is that as long as I kept my master
resume up to date, I could use it as

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
a data source to populate any kind of
one page resume I wanted to write and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.470
as a project manager I often needed to
tweak my resumes depending on the job.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.890
For example, when applying to Udacity,
I was able to pull out

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
all of my education experience as well
as my experiences managing products of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.160
international scale and
technology companies.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.080
It's that kind of targeting
that gets you an interview.
