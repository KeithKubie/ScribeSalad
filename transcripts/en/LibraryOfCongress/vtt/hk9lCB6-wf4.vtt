** Got quiet really fast.  I 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.536
think Dr. Hayden said it well, 
it's like we're in a library.

00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:27.024
[LAUGHTER]
** Welcome.  I'm Leanne potter. 

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:30.626
I direct educational outreach 
here.  And welcome to this very 

00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:32.971
special day.  It's special for a
number of reasons.  For 

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:35.434
starters, it's special because 
it's here at the library of 

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:40.479
Congress, and as many of you 
know the library is the largest 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.480
library

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.528
in the world.  Did you know -- 
I've got good notes -- did you 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.492
know that the library's 
collections contain almost 164 

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:55.223
million items in a wide variety 
of formats, languages, and 

00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:57.224
subjects

00:05:59.784 --> 00:06:01.768
.
And did you know these 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:03.578
collections are the single most 
comprehensive accumulation of 

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:08.233
human expression ever assembled?
And if that doesn't give you 

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:12.834
goose bumps, then maybe the 
weather does.  The collections 

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:17.170
are broad.  They are broad in 
scope and they include materials

00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:22.053
in more than 470 different 
languages, more than 35 

00:06:22.054 --> 00:06:25.945
different scripts, and many 
different media formats, from 

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:30.081
photographs to maps to drawings 
to manuscripts, to sound 

00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:36.216
recordings and more.  The 
collections even include books.

00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:44.875
** I say that because sometime 
we assume and not the others.  

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:51.158
We are here in the members room.
Not your typical meeting room, 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.754
huh?  The members room in the 
Thomas Jefferson building in the

00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:57.801
Library of Congress is a good 
reminder to all of us that the 

00:06:57.802 --> 00:07:00.598
like of Congress is the main 
research arm of the United 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:07.238
States Congress.  And today is 
extra special because today's 

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.002
event is not the kind of event 
that happens every day.  In 

00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:17.231
fact, it only happens once every
two years.  Today as you know we

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:21.618
are inaugurating the new 
national ambassador for young 

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.511
people's literature who will 
serve in this position until 

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:30.608
January of 2020.  As you 
probably know, an ambassador is 

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:33.517
someone authorized to be a 
representative or messenger of 

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:38.643
something, a great ambassador is
smart, knows what he or she is 

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:43.742
talking about, is a champion of 
an important cause, and is a 

00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:50.029
supporter and a promoter of 
others others.  Hmm.  You could 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.426
almost say that the Library of 
Congress is an ambassador of 

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:58.997
sorts.  I am honored to 
introduce you to Dr. Carla 

00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:04.470
Hayden, the 14th librarian of 
Congress.  She earned her Ph.D. 

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:06.887
from the university of Chicago. 
She began her career as a 

00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:11.767
children's librarian.  She led 
the library in Baltimore with 

00:08:11.768 --> 00:08:17.843
the president of the American 
library association and is 

00:08:17.844 --> 00:08:20.240
absolutely aware of the power of
reading.  She knows the magic of

00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:27.717
a good story and is a tremendous
ambassador for the Library of 

00:08:27.718 --> 00:08:31.653
Congress.  Dr. Hayden.

00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:36.600
** Well, good morning.  And 
thank you, Leanne.  I was all 

00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:38.632
ready to sprint up and you 
started doing what my mom always

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:45.232
loved to hear.  They never tire 
that.

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:50.689
This is a wonderful event and 
just want to say welcome.  I'm 

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.707
especially happy to see the 
young people from Brooklyn 

00:08:56.708 --> 00:09:03.661
middle school, the orange.

** In their wonderful shirts, 
the orange sixth grade and teelt

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.995
seventh grade.  So you should 
know that.  And so welcome and 

00:09:10.996 --> 00:09:15.496
we hope you come back many, many
times.  One of the many 

00:09:15.497 --> 00:09:20.160
pleasures of being librarian of 
Congress is to host events like 

00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:26.434
this.  I have to say, though, 
this one is very, very special. 

00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.824
The inauguration of our new 
national ambassador for young 

00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:33.762
people's literature is 
Jacqueline Woodson.

[ APPLAUSE ]

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:46.625
** Now, I've been saying of Ms. 
Woodson for a long time and in 

00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:52.558
my tenure at the library I was 
very fortunate to work with 

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:56.413
someone who was -- talk about an
ambassador, a champion

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.246
champion, a mentor for young 
people's literature, Ms.  Ms. 

00:10:04.247 --> 00:10:06.344
Deborah Taylor.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:13.261
** She had been an advocate, and
still is, for  respecting young 

00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:18.029
people by giving them the best 
in literature.  And being the 

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.152
person who also was able to

00:10:25.282 --> 00:10:33.044
spot talent early on.  She was 
the one and -- the youth 

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:39.605
ambassador, Jin Yang, when she 
said, oh, my, God, Carla, she's 

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:43.142
going to be youth ambassador and
she'd been following him and 

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:52.042
then Jacqueline wood Woodson in 
2004 Taylor selected miracle 

00:10:52.043 --> 00:10:56.492
voice and I have my copy to the 
Baltimore book and the library 

00:10:56.493 --> 00:10:59.018
purchase copies for all young 
people in the city

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:07.517
and this was the book in 2003.  
She also, and I'm going to 

00:11:07.518 --> 00:11:12.673
embarrass her a little bit, was 
the person who gave Tupac  

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.674
Shakur his first award.

00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:25.004
he took her car and picked up 
Tupac Shakur at home, he was 14,

00:11:25.005 --> 00:11:32.128
to attend, and young people, 
please don't laugh, there was a 

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:39.024
beet to the book beet beat 
contest.  You should see their 

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:45.093
faces.  Yes, a library of rap 
contests, right?  It was the 

00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:53.337
'80s.  We were all boogieing.  
Michael Jackson, it was boogie. 

00:11:53.338 --> 00:12:00.126
And Deb tailor had a library rap
contest and she picked up young 

00:12:00.127 --> 00:12:06.088
Tupac Shakur in her car.  He was
14 and he performed his library 

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:12.481
rap, which is now in a vault at 
the library because it's in his 

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.219
own hand about the library's 
cool and he won the contest.  

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.084
And he also was very smart 
because he put a C for copyright

00:12:19.085 --> 00:12:24.159
on it.  So Deb Taylor, thank 
you, thank you, thank you, 

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.903
because --

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.438

to say this is something that 

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:49.672
the Library of Congress should 
do and also showing that respect

00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:55.482
for our young scholars who are 
coming up.  So John, we thank 

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.344
you for that.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.833
** So

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:08.162
we are so fortunate to have the 
children's book council support 

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:13.435

been wonderful to help the 
library expand this reach and,

Gene, I have to tell you, I have
samples of graphic novels from 

00:13:24.472 --> 00:13:28.714
the folder library and from 
other places that we would love 

00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:34.151

have.  Just saying.  So, please,

day to do our work to bring

to tell you about him just in 

00:21:59.844 --> 00:22:05.558
case you didn't know.  For the 
past two year Jin has served as 

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:09.024
the fifth ambassador for young 
people's literature.  He was 

00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:11.172
born and raised in California 
and is the son of Chinese 

00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:14.557
immigrants.  Has been drawing 
comics since the fifth grade.  

00:22:14.558 --> 00:22:20.496
In 2006 his book, American born 
Chinese was published and became

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:24.136
the first graphic novel to be 
nominated for a national book 

00:22:24.137 --> 00:22:27.380
award.  And it was the first to 
win the American Library 

00:22:27.381 --> 00:22:29.381
Association's prince award.  In

00:22:32.952 --> 00:22:37.005
2013 his two volume graphic 
novel about the boxer rebellion 

00:22:37.006 --> 00:22:40.781
was nominated as well for a 
narnl book award and won the 

00:22:40.782 --> 00:22:44.848
L.A. Times book prize.  In 
addition -- and I could go on, 

00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:49.090
but -- in addition to cartooning
he is also a  teacher.  He is 

00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:54.368
currently teaching creative 
writing and has been a 

00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:57.422
tremendous national ambassador. 
His platform, reading without 

00:22:57.423 --> 00:23:00.279
walls has challenged all of us 
to stretch our reading habits in

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:06.548
very important ways.  Jin.

** Good morning, everyone.  I am
so excited to be here.  Two 

00:23:18.681 --> 00:23:22.044
years ago in this same building 
in a different room, but same 

00:23:22.045 --> 00:23:26.637
building, I got the fanciest 
thing that I own.  I got the 

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:29.351
national ambassador for young 
people's literature

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.225

have been among the most amazing

00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:43.400
of my life.  I want to thank Dr.
Hayden, Carl, and Shayna and 

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:45.586
everyone else for your support. 
I want to especially thank the 

00:23:45.587 --> 00:23:47.981
librarians and teachers and book
sellers that have made these 

00:23:47.982 --> 00:23:55.025
past two years so magical.  Last
two years I've gone around the 

00:23:55.026 --> 00:23:57.986
country to talk to young people 
from all different communities 

00:23:57.987 --> 00:24:02.507
in America.  What I've 
discovered is that kids love 

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:07.730
books.  Despite what what some 
adults might lead to you think, 

00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:12.604
kids still love books.  And they
love books for the same reason 

00:24:12.605 --> 00:24:15.433
we all love books.  It's because
stories help us make sense of 

00:24:15.434 --> 00:24:25.151
our lives, of the world.  That's
why I am so excited to be here 

00:24:25.152 --> 00:24:28.636
today, because today we all in 
this room get to witness one of 

00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:32.731
the greatest story tellers of 
our time receive the

00:24:37.571 --> 00:24:41.033
martial ambassador for young 
people medal.  Jackie Woodson is

00:24:41.722 --> 00:24:44.911
one of my heroes.  She is a 
person that I deeply admire.  I 

00:24:44.912 --> 00:24:51.564
admire her not just as a writer 
but also as a human being.  I 

00:24:51.565 --> 00:24:53.478
believe that her ambassadorship 
is simply going to be an 

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:57.555
extension of the work she's 
already doing.  If you have had 

00:24:57.556 --> 00:25:01.596
the pleasure of reading one of 
Jackie's books, if you had the 

00:25:01.597 --> 00:25:06.856
pleasure of sitting in on one of
her speeches, you know that 

00:25:06.857 --> 00:25:08.857
words, whether they're spoken 
into a microphone

00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:14.266
or written on a page, she 
teaches about the world, helps 

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:21.236
us make sense of life and the 
world.  Her words bring us hope,

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:24.908
bring about change.  Like I 
said, she's one of my heroes.  

00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:28.374
And if she isn't one of yours 
yet, give her a few minutes.  

00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:33.860
Wait until she gets up here.  
She'll be one of yours too.

an inspiration.
** so have you, Dr. Hayden.  

00:30:49.161 --> 00:30:50.898
Thank you.
** Now, I remember my favorite 

00:30:50.899 --> 00:30:55.208
book was called bright April and
it was the first time that I 

00:30:55.209 --> 00:31:00.530
could see myself in a book.  
Little girl, she was brown, had 

00:31:00.531 --> 00:31:07.344
pigtail, all of that.  And I you
talk about not seeing yourself 

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:13.156
reflected and that's why miracle
voice was one of the things that

00:31:13.157 --> 00:31:15.175
wow, what's that mean to see 
yourself.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.785
** Well, I think it's so 
important looking back on the 

00:31:17.786 --> 00:31:21.577
work of Dr. bishop who talked 
about the importance of young 

00:31:21.578 --> 00:31:24.837
people having both mirrors and 
windows.  So they have books 

00:31:24.838 --> 00:31:31.734
where they can look in and see a
brown girl or a young Latin boy 

00:31:31.735 --> 00:31:38.883
or an Asian girl and see some 
part of their identity in the 

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:41.888
book and that's the mirror and 
it makes them aware of their 

00:31:41.889 --> 00:31:45.306
presence in a bigger world.  And
I think we also talk about books

00:31:45.593 --> 00:31:49.122
having windows.  So you see into
other worlds and for me as a 

00:31:49.123 --> 00:31:54.116
young person growing up I had 
many, many windows into white 

00:31:54.117 --> 00:31:59.298
worlds and very few books where 
young kids of color were 

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:02.381
reflected on the pages, until I 
think one of the earliest books 

00:32:02.382 --> 00:32:08.308
I remember reading was Virginia 
Hamilton's -- oh, what's --

00:32:11.837 --> 00:32:15.041
Zeally, about two kids and they 
were going down south and there 

00:32:15.042 --> 00:32:22.221
was so much of me on the page.  
Another one was Mildred's role 

00:32:22.222 --> 00:32:25.818
thunder hear my cry.  Opened to 
see a reflection in myself in 

00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:29.179
Cassie and suddenly realized 
that

00:32:33.181 --> 00:32:37.247
there I was on the page and that
I could be on the page.  Not 

00:32:33.181 --> 00:32:36.251
only could I be on the page but 
I could be -- I could grow up to

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:39.923
be a woman of color who wrote 
because here was am I dread 

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:44.929
tailor, Virginia Hamilton, women
of color telling stories.  I 

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:50.915
think it's -- legitimizes us 
that we don't realize our 

00:32:50.916 --> 00:32:53.885
absence until we see that 
presence on a page.

00:32:54.371 --> 00:33:00.192
** You mentioned wanting to 
write.  How young were you when 

00:33:00.193 --> 00:33:03.631
you said I like this writing?  
Reading but writing.  I want to 

00:33:03.632 --> 00:33:07.494
do that?
** I've known I wanted to write 

00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:11.212
since I was seven.  I remember 
as a young person loving the 

00:33:11.213 --> 00:33:16.431
physical act of writing, of 
holding a pencil and words made 

00:33:16.432 --> 00:33:20.419
sentences and sentences made 
paragraphs and that writing was 

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.076
organic.  All you needed was 
that pencil and paper and 

00:33:24.077 --> 00:33:29.271
imagination and the rest was 
there.  You didn't need any 

00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:31.807
expensive paraphernalia to be 
able to create art.

00:33:32.288 --> 00:33:40.182
** Wow.  Turning to the -- in 
terms of pair nailra and things 

00:33:40.183 --> 00:33:43.779
like that because there are so 
many distractions and things so

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.225
people have said read something 
disappearing and what's going on

00:33:49.504 --> 00:33:51.504
with young people.  What do you 
--

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:59.543
** I don't think --  I think we 
see fewer books sometimes with 

00:33:59.544 --> 00:34:02.520
you I don't think people are not
reading.  I think sometimes we 

00:34:02.521 --> 00:34:05.460
have to wrestle them and get 
their paraphernalia

00:34:08.828 --> 00:34:12.450
out of their hand and remind 
them of the glory of reading but

00:34:14.367 --> 00:34:19.447
I think as Jin said, young 
people love story and they love 

00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:23.118
being engaged that way and there
are many ways in which we read. 

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:28.549
So I think even though we're not
always seeing them with a book 

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:32.062
in their hand, they have one in 
their ear.  Sometimes they're 

00:34:32.063 --> 00:34:33.957
reading on the tablet, sometimes
someone is telling a story, 

00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:38.393
sometimes they're creating a 
story in their head some way.  

00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:42.120
So I think it's definitely got 
more challenging but we're a 

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:48.197
country that has always had to 
shift.  So we figure out ways of

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:51.839
engaging people where they are 
and if they are in a world where

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.935
there's a lot of technology then
what are we going to do to shift

00:34:58.648 --> 00:35:03.072
them toward reading, how do we 
get them to shift from that 

00:35:03.073 --> 00:35:05.212
technology where they're 
engaging with narrative.

00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:10.734
** Poetry as another way, a 
gateway into that.  Now, when 

00:35:10.735 --> 00:35:13.247
did you start with poetry as 
another extension of --

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.149
** You know, I didn't -- I was 
very afraid of poetry when I was

00:35:17.427 --> 00:35:23.488
a kid.  I always thought it was 
just kind of this secret code 

00:35:23.489 --> 00:35:27.616
that I wasn't meant to 
understand and it wasn't until 

00:35:27.617 --> 00:35:30.650
-- I remember hearing an album, 
my mom was playing this album 

00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:37.654
and it was Giovani.  It was 
spoken word and I was like what 

00:35:37.655 --> 00:35:43.117
is that.  My sister was that's 
Nicky, that's poetry.  And I'm 

00:35:43.118 --> 00:35:46.318
like no it's not.  I understand 
that.  That's not poetry.  And 

00:35:46.319 --> 00:35:48.319
then later on

00:35:51.594 --> 00:35:58.458
Lagston Hughes and Claude Mc KAY
unlocked it so that I could 

00:35:58.459 --> 00:36:06.757
begin to understand other poets 
the more kind of incom 

00:36:06.758 --> 00:36:11.206
incomprehensible, but poetry I 
learned to do the work of 

00:36:11.207 --> 00:36:16.610
deconstructing poetry because I 
had the gateway from Langston 

00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:21.413
Hughes and Nicky  Giovanni,

00:36:24.553 --> 00:36:26.863
Gyendolynn Brooks and so many of
the writers that helped me 

00:36:26.864 --> 00:36:28.960
figure that out.
** I remember my grandmother, 

00:36:28.961 --> 00:36:34.040
Paul Lawrence done Dunbar and 
how could you do the dialect.  

00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:40.946
She said I know.  I can do  it.
** Had a great -- yeah, got to 

00:36:40.947 --> 00:36:44.551
love him.
** Now, Tupac we mentioned and 

00:36:44.552 --> 00:36:49.334
rap is another way.
** He was an amazing poet.  I 

00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:52.496
mean, Tupac when you look at the
rose that grew from concrete and

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:58.003
just he was not only a poet; he 
was an activist.  And I think 

00:36:58.004 --> 00:37:04.752
that's what was so phenomenal 
about him as so many of the 

00:37:04.753 --> 00:37:07.288
young people who were wrapping, 
they were telling stories, they 

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:10.162
were telling history.  They were
breaking down where we are in 

00:37:10.163 --> 00:37:12.930
the moment and they were doing 
it in a way going back to 

00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:15.878
shifting where young minds could
understand what they were trying

00:37:15.879 --> 00:37:19.035
to say.  And they were asking 
big questions and I think that's

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:23.475
what all good literature does is
ask questions of the reader of 

00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:26.005
the listener about the moment 
they're in.

00:37:26.507 --> 00:37:31.484
** Speaking of the moment, your 
platform, reading equals hope 

00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:38.159
and change for your time, how do
you see that evolving?  Because 

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.121
this is an interesting time to 
be an ambassador, to work with 

00:37:43.122 --> 00:37:48.563
young people, to ask questions, 
to answer questions.

00:37:49.045 --> 00:37:54.759
** So reading equals hope times 
change is a platform that I came

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.438
up with, that we came up with 
that speaks to the fact that 

00:37:58.439 --> 00:38:02.244
reading does allow -- we go into
a book because we're hopeful for

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.443
something.  We're hopeful for a 
good  story, hopeful to meet 

00:38:05.444 --> 00:38:09.162
some mirrors on the page.  We're
hopeful for great 

00:38:09.163 --> 00:38:12.735
characterization.  And when we 
come out of a book, we're 

00:38:12.736 --> 00:38:19.443
different.  And that difference 
is because we have met the 

00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:22.432
writer halfway.  I'm going to 
talk about this in my very short

00:38:22.757 --> 00:38:25.366
talk after this.  I think that 
books can change us, help us 

00:38:25.367 --> 00:38:30.767
begin to have the bigger 
conversations.  They can help us

00:38:30.768 --> 00:38:36.307
see the world and identities and
ideas that we never thought 

00:38:36.308 --> 00:38:40.949
about before until they have 
been brought to the page and we 

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.920
met them on the page.  So I 
think we come out of a book 

00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:47.241
different than we were when we 
went in it.

00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:51.087
** Now, one of the questions I 
had here that you have been 

00:38:51.088 --> 00:38:55.956
aplawrded and criticized for 
tackling tough issues.  Getting 

00:38:55.957 --> 00:38:59.601
back to respecting young people 
that they can handle discussion 

00:38:59.602 --> 00:39:03.712
about tough issues.  They're 
looking to books sometimes to 

00:39:03.713 --> 00:39:08.100
help them through it, foster 
care, incarceration, and why is 

00:39:08.101 --> 00:39:15.180
that important that we have it.
** I think the first thing is 

00:39:15.181 --> 00:39:19.242
I'm not trying to hear the 
haters.  You know what I'm 

00:39:19.243 --> 00:39:22.508
saying?  From the beginning of 
time people who have had -- who 

00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:26.038
have tried to create change have
been blasted against, right?  

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:29.958
And I think it's because people 
are afraid.  When we look at the

00:39:29.959 --> 00:39:33.210
issue of mass incarceration in 
our country, I think it's a sin 

00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:37.602
not to speak to it and not to 
let the young people who have --

00:39:37.885 --> 00:39:45.023
who know -- who have people in 
their families, in their lives, 

00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:47.378
incarcerated let them know 
they're not alone on that 

00:39:47.379 --> 00:39:50.788
journey and that there is 
nothing wrong with their family 

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:55.553
makeup and there is nothing -- 
you know, when I wrote visiting 

00:39:55.554 --> 00:40:00.637
day is because I had grown up 
with my uncle in prison.  It was

00:40:00.974 --> 00:40:02.954
this kind of thing we weren't 
supposed to talk about.  And I 

00:40:02.955 --> 00:40:06.256
never understood where the shame
came from and looking at it now 

00:40:06.257 --> 00:40:11.111
again going back to mass 
incarceration, how can we try to

00:40:11.112 --> 00:40:16.404
hide something so visible in our
society.  And if we don't talk 

00:40:16.405 --> 00:40:19.584
about it we can't begin to 
change it.  We can just kind of 

00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:24.499
make believe it doesn't exist.  
So I think any writer who's 

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.085
going to try to have harder 
conversations is going to get 

00:40:27.086 --> 00:40:35.863
criticized.  I remember writeing
where an African-American boy 

00:40:35.864 --> 00:40:41.802
gets killed by cops in a case of
mistaken identity, people -- I 

00:40:41.803 --> 00:40:44.022
remember people saying this 
would never happen.  And this 

00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:51.453
was 20 years ago and at some 
point you kind of question your 

00:40:51.454 --> 00:40:54.203
own reality because you think, 
oh, maybe this doesn't happen 

00:40:54.204 --> 00:40:59.396
but you know it does and that 
kind of gas liting can happen 

00:40:59.397 --> 00:41:03.854
when you don't have the proof of
books and experiences in the 

00:41:03.855 --> 00:41:08.029
world so that you can go to that
book and go, yeah, I'm not alone

00:41:08.512 --> 00:41:12.327
in this.  I was right in 
thinking about that because 

00:41:12.328 --> 00:41:12.608
someone else is thinking this 
too.

00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:15.783
** And young people can see it 
and discuss it and they can 

00:41:15.784 --> 00:41:16.833
handle it.
** Mm-hmm.

00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:21.156
** I think they can.
Now, you also said brilliance is

00:41:21.656 --> 00:41:26.755
passion recognized.  This is a 
wonderful phrase.  In 

00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:31.305
termination of encouraging young
readers and authors and poets, 

00:41:31.306 --> 00:41:35.777
that they see that.
** They know -- I think it was 

00:41:35.778 --> 00:41:38.150
so important.  I was talking to 
my book land friends and we were

00:41:38.634 --> 00:41:45.746
talking about their talents and 
their plans for going -- what 

00:41:45.747 --> 00:41:48.970
they do.  It is, I think, that 
sometimes people think there's 

00:41:48.971 --> 00:41:55.265
just one way to be brilliant.  
Maybe only academic brilliance 

00:41:55.266 --> 00:42:00.404
or -- but I think I think our 
brilliance is our passion 

00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:07.486
recognized and celebrated, right
?  I know that I'm kind of a 

00:42:07.487 --> 00:42:11.668
good writer and it's nice 
because it's also what I love to

00:42:12.758 --> 00:42:17.801
do.  And I think because I love 
to do it I want to do it the 

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:21.454
best that I possibly can.  I 
remember having a teacher say 

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:23.455
when you choose a career, choose
something you love doing because

00:42:23.645 --> 00:42:26.697
you're going to be doing it for 
the rest of your life and I 

00:42:26.698 --> 00:42:30.388
think that those words stayed 
with me because I thought 

00:42:30.389 --> 00:42:36.031
hopefully I would live a long 
life and the idea of waking up 

00:42:36.032 --> 00:42:39.179
every day and being unhappy with
the work you're doing was 

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:44.047
heartbreaking to me.  So I honed
the thing that I felt was my 

00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:48.488
brilliance and worked at it 
until it became the thing I 

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:50.949
wanted it to be in the world, 
the stories I wanted to tell and

00:42:52.253 --> 00:42:56.098
I think everyone has that thing 
that they're really good at that

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.262
they really love doing and our 
work as adults is to not kill 

00:43:00.263 --> 00:43:06.753
that fire.  Your work as young 
people is to not let that fire 

00:43:06.754 --> 00:43:11.082
get murdered.  And then we get 
to see all of that brimmans in 

00:43:11.083 --> 00:43:16.844
the world in a way that 
transforms it and transforms us.

00:43:17.734 --> 00:43:21.443
** Can writing help with that?  
You said look through moments in

00:43:21.773 --> 00:43:27.908
time into a more hopeful place 
about writing or expressing it, 

00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:29.909
using it along the way.
** I think writing can help with

00:43:31.123 --> 00:43:39.348
everything (chuckles).  I think 
writing is the bomb.  I talk 

00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:41.974
about writing because I have 
questions and I do think that 

00:43:41.975 --> 00:43:45.768
there is a way when we can sit 
and begin to figure out who we 

00:43:45.769 --> 00:43:52.030
are and who we're becoming and 
what the questions are we have 

00:43:52.031 --> 00:43:57.021
through writing and reading.  I 
believe deeply, deeply and I 

00:43:57.022 --> 00:44:00.643
love when young people want to 
be writers because I know here 

00:44:00.644 --> 00:44:05.139
because of Nicky Giovanni,

00:44:08.474 --> 00:44:13.784
Langston Hughes, gend Lynn 
brooks.  I would not be here if 

00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:16.466
they were not here.  I feel the 
young people are here because of

00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:21.991
us, because of, you know, Gene 
and John and Catherine and me 

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:26.539
and let that circle be unbroken.
Let people keep coming and 

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.680
telling their stories because

00:44:33.074 --> 00:44:35.330
y'all must have some amazing 
stories to tell about this 

00:44:35.331 --> 00:44:38.318
moment in time.
** I see you're nodding.  Do we 

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:43.505
have time for a few remarks?

00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:57.620
** Yes.
** And I'm going to exit.

00:45:01.204 --> 00:45:05.675
** Thanks, Dr. Hayden.  I'm not 
going to be long because I am so

00:45:05.676 --> 00:45:08.653
much more interested in your 
questions.  Maybe I'll answer a 

00:45:08.654 --> 00:45:15.547
few of them but I love when 
young people ask me questions.  

00:45:15.548 --> 00:45:18.082
But I was told I needed to say 
something about becoming 

00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:23.648
ambassador.
Is it still morning because I 

00:45:23.649 --> 00:45:29.469
start with saying good morning. 
Okay.  Oh, I have a -- people 

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:33.998
who are live  streaming is my 
sound okay?  I'm good?  I could 

00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:36.612
keep using this?  I could use 
both of them.  Thank you.

00:45:36.613 --> 00:45:40.221
So it's an amazing honor to 
stand before you in the Library 

00:45:40.222 --> 00:45:45.690
of Congress this morning.  It's 
also an honor to be living in 

00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.634
this time to bear witness to our
countries ' beautiful and 

00:45:47.635 --> 00:45:53.000
complicated history and its 
immense possibility.  Because I 

00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:56.273
do believe we're living in a 
time of great, great, great 

00:45:56.274 --> 00:45:58.274
possibility

00:46:00.247 --> 00:46:02.164
.
What an honor to follow the 

00:46:02.165 --> 00:46:05.672
footsteps of groundbreaking 
ambassadors that came before me,

00:46:06.576 --> 00:46:11.007
Jin Yang, not only my absolute 
hero which makes me think he 

00:46:11.008 --> 00:46:13.771
read my speech because he called
me his hero.

00:46:14.053 --> 00:46:18.443
[LAUGHTER]
** But he's also a hero to both 

00:46:18.444 --> 00:46:24.597
my children and to many children
.  Camillo who was the 

00:46:24.598 --> 00:46:28.971
inspiration for us naming our 
cat Fred, who never fails to 

00:46:28.972 --> 00:46:32.675
make me laugh or choke up with 
each book she writes.  Catherine

00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:36.742
Patterson, one of the  kindest 
people I know.  Walter Myers who

00:46:37.023 --> 00:46:40.647
came into this world and left it
with his untimely passing filled

00:46:40.648 --> 00:46:45.465
with a body of work that changed
consciousness of so many young 

00:46:45.466 --> 00:46:49.660
men and boys of color and so 
many others as well.

00:46:55.431 --> 00:46:58.930
I miss  Walter.  Walter, who 
during his advertisement as 

00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:05.168
national ambassador time as 
national ambassador tirelessly 

00:47:05.169 --> 00:47:09.244
spoke to those who had not 
thought about themselves as part

00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:13.432
of the bigger world or deeper 
narrative.  Beloved pioneer, 

00:47:13.433 --> 00:47:17.183
John Chesta, neighbor, friend, 
and awesome writer sitting among

00:47:17.687 --> 00:47:21.202
us this morning.  I would not be
here without y'all.

00:47:21.687 --> 00:47:25.943
First and foremost I want to 
thank the people who have worked

00:47:25.944 --> 00:47:28.788
beyond hard to bring me to this 
moment, the most fabulous 

00:47:28.789 --> 00:47:33.509
Library of Congress and Dr. 
Carla Hayden, my sister from 

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:41.669
another mother and hisry maker. 
My dear friend Debbie tailor and

00:47:41.964 --> 00:47:46.541
all of my people at Pratt 
library.  It was here doing a 

00:47:46.542 --> 00:47:52.477
reading from my first novel last
summer that I rediscovered the 

00:47:52.478 --> 00:47:54.478
breadth and depth of libraries

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.903
.  Reading, conversations, 
children's programs, program for

00:48:00.223 --> 00:48:04.204
young mothers, adult literacy 
classes, passport renewals, 

00:48:04.205 --> 00:48:12.966
puppet making, all of it was, is
happening at the libraries.  At 

00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:16.153
Pratt and nationwide.  As I 
began to travel I saw in every 

00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:19.672
single state the enormitity of 
what libraries both large and 

00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:27.489
small had to offer anyone who 
stepped through their doors.  I 

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.897
rediscovered libraries aren't 
just for some people, they're 

00:48:29.898 --> 00:48:34.646
for all people.
I like to thank the children's 

00:48:34.647 --> 00:48:37.174
book council, every child a 
reader and the commit that chose

00:48:38.273 --> 00:48:46.621
me to succeed Jin, Deandra, 
Sarah, Earl, Travis, Dara, and 

00:48:46.622 --> 00:48:52.151
Ellen and of course Jin.  I love
your faith in me and I'm 

00:48:52.152 --> 00:48:55.636
grateful, I think.
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:56.136 --> 00:48:58.136
** For it.

00:49:02.251 --> 00:49:06.419
I wouldn't be standing here 
without my penguin family, my 

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:13.234
longstanding editor Nancy 
Paulson, Jen, Felicia, Cecelia 

00:49:13.235 --> 00:49:15.612
and the rest of the crew.  A 
writer writers in solitude and 

00:49:15.613 --> 00:49:18.582
then steps outside of the 
solitude to get the help they 

00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:21.826
need to shape their work into 
something that the rest of the 

00:49:21.827 --> 00:49:26.215
world can understand.
When I wrote brown girl dreaming

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:29.935
there were 31 rewrites before it
became the book so many of y'all

00:49:29.936 --> 00:49:34.222
have read and then some tweaks 
between the first and second 

00:49:34.223 --> 00:49:39.206
edition.  So if you have that 
first edition, hold on.

00:49:39.535 --> 00:49:42.693
My eyes in the world are my own 
eyes and the eyes of those who I

00:49:43.019 --> 00:49:48.763
trust deeply.  Nancy, thank you 
for being my second set of eyes 

00:49:48.764 --> 00:49:51.842
in the world.  I am thankful too
to my amazing family, my partner

00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:58.886
Juliette, our children, Toshi, 
Jackson, and Laroi, all my 

00:49:58.887 --> 00:50:04.662
sisters from other mothers, Jane
Sessing and the ones who 

00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:07.460
couldn't be with us as well.  
There are a lot of them.  Y'all 

00:50:07.461 --> 00:50:08.633
would be sitting here forever.
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:08.634 --> 00:50:12.084
** And I want to thank those who
have been with me on this 

00:50:12.085 --> 00:50:17.256
journey from it feels like the 
moment it began, including Katy 

00:50:17.737 --> 00:50:24.592
Horning, Dr. Radeen intish shop,
Dean Snyder.  In this room with 

00:50:24.593 --> 00:50:27.823
us this morning are those who 
guide us now as ancestor

00:50:31.814 --> 00:50:35.275
, Virginia Hamilton, my mom and 
grandmother.  Let us each take a

00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:38.213
moment and remember someone who 
has left this place for the next

00:50:40.132 --> 00:50:43.935
one, who continues from that 
place to walk with us.  In the 

00:50:43.936 --> 00:50:48.323
afternoon can American tradition
there is a calling of names.  We

00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:51.206
call our ancestors back into the
room where we acknowledge that 

00:50:51.207 --> 00:50:57.775
because of them, we are.  Let us
take a moment and remember 

00:50:57.776 --> 00:51:04.261
friends, loved ones, relives, 
anyone we can think of, writers 

00:51:04.262 --> 00:51:09.244
who have left us and who remain 
important and call out their 

00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:11.245
names.

00:51:16.547 --> 00:51:18.783
** (Away from microphone).

00:51:56.445 --> 00:52:04.925
** Thank you.  Your world is as 
big as you make it.  I know for 

00:52:04.926 --> 00:52:07.925
I used to abide in the 
narrowestnest in the corner, my 

00:52:07.926 --> 00:52:13.352
wings pressing close to my side,
but you cited a distant horizon 

00:52:13.353 --> 00:52:16.588
with the guideline and circled 
the sea and I throbbed with a 

00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:23.745
burning desire to travel this 
immensesty.  I battered the 

00:52:23.746 --> 00:52:27.949
Cordons around me and craideld 
my wingsz on the breeze, then 

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:31.811
sorried with the utter most 
reaches -- I'm sorry, and 

00:52:31.812 --> 00:52:34.981
sorried to the other most 
reaches with raptture, with 

00:52:34.982 --> 00:52:42.048
power, with ease.  I wish I had 
written that poem, but I didn't.

00:52:43.757 --> 00:52:47.763
Tfers written by Georgia Douglas
Johnson who for more than 40 

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:51.498
years hosted a salon right here 
in D.C. on Smith street 

00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:55.725
southwest for those of you who 
don't know a salon is basically 

00:52:55.726 --> 00:53:00.523
a gathering where you come eat 
food, drink good wine and 

00:53:00.524 --> 00:53:06.675
organic milk, young people.
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.676 --> 00:53:11.379
, read your work and the work of
others, maybe get a sypher going

00:53:12.477 --> 00:53:15.748
and share ideas about the world.
Through the sharing of these 

00:53:15.749 --> 00:53:22.369
ideas you begin to change your 
own way of thinking and the way 

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:28.793
others think.  But it starts 
with gathering.  Through 

00:53:28.794 --> 00:53:34.383
Douglas' salon came some of the 
most influential writers of the 

00:53:34.384 --> 00:53:42.545
Renaissance, from Angelina Wells
Gremky, Gene Tumer, poets

00:53:46.311 --> 00:53:48.921
at the end of my tenure -- I 
will know how to pronounce the 

00:53:48.922 --> 00:53:53.453
word, and we will all know them.
Reading equals hope times change

00:53:53.785 --> 00:53:59.558
.  When Georgia Douglas Johnson 
began those writes salons no one

00:53:59.559 --> 00:54:02.204
knew that the Harlem Renaissance
would take a very important 

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:08.430
place in history.  No one knew 
that one day Mildred tailor 

00:54:08.431 --> 00:54:11.576
would write roll of thunder, 
hear my cry, that Jin Yang would

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:16.257
write American born Chinese, 
that same Monday J. or tease 

00:54:16.258 --> 00:54:20.810
would write people shall 
continue or the absolute

00:54:27.799 --> 00:54:29.799
Sherman

00:54:31.183 --> 00:54:37.106
Alexii.  The people in Douglas' 
salon walked into that room with

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:39.295
the books they were writing or 
reads.  They walked into that 

00:54:39.296 --> 00:54:45.652
salon with hope.  They read, 
they talked, they laughed, drank

00:54:45.653 --> 00:54:48.479
beer, wine, and milk, they sang 
and changed the world because of

00:54:48.805 --> 00:54:55.492
them I am.  Because of them we 
are all gathered here.

00:54:55.493 --> 00:54:59.082
Yesterday my family and I spent 
the day at the American museum 

00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:02.102
of African-American history and 
culture again right here in D.C.

00:55:02.808 --> 00:55:10.086
It took over 100 years to make 
that museum a reality.  First it

00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:13.321
was dreams, then it was built, 
then people opened their 

00:55:13.322 --> 00:55:17.094
trungses and suitcases and books
and pulled history from 

00:55:17.095 --> 00:55:19.690
African-Americans in this 
country from the crevices into 

00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:24.489
which that history was 
delicately and lovingly packed 

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.883
away.  They knew a time would 
come when that history would 

00:55:27.884 --> 00:55:34.211
need a home.  Now is the time.  
As national ambassador my hope 

00:55:34.212 --> 00:55:39.109
is to begin a conversation our 
country is hungry but oftentimes

00:55:39.388 --> 00:55:43.264
afraid to have.  Some days this 
place feels like a country 

00:55:43.265 --> 00:55:48.409
divided, a country in despair, a
country hungry for a way out of 

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:55.784
no way.  What the books will 
continue to show us is there is 

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:59.512
magic in this moment we're 
living in now.  There is so much

00:55:59.513 --> 00:56:03.649
possibility.  To the young 
people gathered today, that 

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:10.140
power to create change is in 
your hearts and heads and hands.

00:56:12.158 --> 00:56:14.377
I am often asked about my 
writing.  When you write this 

00:56:14.378 --> 00:56:17.071
book or that book what were you 
trying to teach?

00:56:24.284 --> 00:56:28.929
.  I write to learn.  I write 
because I have so many questions

00:56:29.455 --> 00:56:33.029
that I have to answer and the 
only way I can answer is by 

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.841
putting pen to paper.  The only 
way I can find hope I'm looking 

00:56:36.842 --> 00:56:40.445
for in a particular moment is to
put that hope on the page and 

00:56:40.446 --> 00:56:42.947
when I'm done like many writers 
my hope has been that the reader

00:56:43.229 --> 00:56:45.333
will meet me halfway.  Bring 
their own ideas and experiences 

00:56:45.334 --> 00:56:51.924
and hope to the narrative I've 
created.  My hope for the next 

00:56:51.925 --> 00:56:53.925
two years is we come together in
many rooms to talk, that we meet

00:56:54.266 --> 00:56:58.279
the authors halfway and talk 
about what our hopes are for the

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:04.861
future, our equations, plans for
change, that we hold salons and 

00:57:04.862 --> 00:57:09.462
classrooms and libraries and 
book stores and living rooms 

00:57:09.463 --> 00:57:13.333
around kitchen tables, in 
playgrounds, at hair salons and 

00:57:13.334 --> 00:57:15.787
barber shops, that we find the 
books that tell the stories we 

00:57:15.788 --> 00:57:20.414
need to hear and use those 
stories to write the next 

00:57:20.415 --> 00:57:25.667
chapter in this country's 
history.  We remember a time 

00:57:25.668 --> 00:57:29.141
when people were not allowed to 
learn to read because reading 

00:57:29.142 --> 00:57:38.829
led to freedom.  It's a lot of 
things to be -- it's a lot of 

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:41.926
things in this room at this 
podium in front of all of you in

00:57:41.927 --> 00:57:47.155
this moment in time.  It's scary
, thrilling, mind blowing, 

00:57:47.156 --> 00:57:52.943
imagining the unimagineable.  
The writer activist Audrey Lord 

00:57:52.944 --> 00:57:57.103
said we can sit in our corners 
mute and we will still be no 

00:57:57.104 --> 00:58:00.071
less afraid.  I believe that 
reading equals  hope, hope times

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:06.040
change.  I believe that me plus 
you equals a conversation.  I 

00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:11.144
believe that hope minus fear 
equals change.  I believe that 

00:58:11.145 --> 00:58:15.590
listening plus hearing minus 
judgment equals friendship.  

00:58:15.591 --> 00:58:21.064
These are just a few of my 
equations in the next two years 

00:58:21.065 --> 00:58:25.964
I'm eager to gather and hear 
yours.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:28.450
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:58:59.552 --> 00:59:03.473
** You did good.
** Thank you.

00:59:03.474 --> 00:59:06.827
** Outstanding.  Well, now it's 
time for some questions and my 

00:59:06.828 --> 00:59:11.019
audiovisual team has told me 
there are two mics that we can 

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.268
float around the room if you've 
got one in your hand would you 

00:59:14.269 --> 00:59:18.809
let me see it?  Awesome.  
Perfect.  So how about one of 

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:23.315
you come over to this side and 
one stay on that side.  If you 

00:59:23.316 --> 00:59:25.710
guys could raise your hands when
you've got a question, we'll 

00:59:25.711 --> 00:59:30.584
make sure that you get the mic. 
The reason we need to make sure 

00:59:30.585 --> 00:59:34.147
you use the mic is so that our 
audience that's watching the 

00:59:34.148 --> 00:59:37.361
live stream and our recording 
can hear your question, okay?

00:59:37.844 --> 00:59:43.068
** And if you could say your 
name when you ask the question, 

00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:46.869
that would be so helpful.
** My name is Christian 

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:47.925
Strickland.
** Hi, Christian.

00:59:47.926 --> 00:59:52.039
** what do you plan to do after 
your term is over?

00:59:52.317 --> 00:59:57.685
[LAUGHTER]
** Thanks, Christian.

01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:10.628
Oh, man.  I think it's going to 
go so fast.  I plan to rest.  I

01:00:12.795 --> 01:00:14.598
don't plan to stop writing 
because I talk about how much I 

01:00:14.599 --> 01:00:18.621
love writing.  I plan to be 
right here all willing putting 

01:00:18.622 --> 01:00:22.280
this medal on the next 
ambassador.

01:00:28.474 --> 01:00:37.169
** My name is Louis seaia 
Brisbane.  What do you plan to 

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:43.391
do while you're ambassador?
** I plan to do a lot around 

01:00:43.392 --> 01:00:51.227
trying to get people to gather. 
I don't -- one thing you have to

01:00:51.717 --> 01:00:53.010
do as ambassador is travel 
around the country.  

01:00:53.011 --> 01:00:57.102
Legitimately only have to travel
five times, right?  That was one

01:00:57.389 --> 01:00:59.389
of the promises of being 
ambassador

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:07.967
.  I think there are all kinds 
of ways together.  I think we 

01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:11.593
can Skype.  I think people can 
come to book festivals.  I think

01:01:12.685 --> 01:01:17.483
we can gather in classrooms.  I 
plan to help kind of get the 

01:01:17.484 --> 01:01:23.138
conversation going from wherever
I am.  I hope to meet a lot of 

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:27.021
people, travel to a lote of 
juvenile detention centers and 

01:01:27.022 --> 01:01:30.369
group homes and places like that
to meet people who might not 

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:35.014
have otherwise met authors.  My 
family's going to Mississippi in

01:01:35.015 --> 01:01:38.155
April so I'm planning to go to 
some of the play schools and 

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:41.186
libraries in rural Mississippi 
while I'm there and really just 

01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:44.892
begin having a conversation that
I hope will become a very  

01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.893
nationwide conversation

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.348
.
** My name is Cameron Jackson 

01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:59.634
and I was wondering do you guys 
have anybody in mind to be the 

01:01:59.635 --> 01:02:02.469
next ambassador?
** Cameron's already ready to 

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:07.775
sack me.  He's like do you have 
someone in mind for the next 

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:11.107
impairs door?   Cameron, I'm 
sure they'll take your request.

01:02:13.013 --> 01:02:15.013
** High hi,

01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:23.142
hi, my name is Dionne.  How old 
were you when you published your

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:28.092
first book.
** That was published when I was

01:02:28.574 --> 01:02:34.587
in my early 20s.  It took me 
about four years to write that 

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:39.436
book because I didn't know what 
I was doing.  So unlike many 

01:02:39.437 --> 01:02:43.629
years it took me to do brown 
girlt dreaming, by it was 

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.739
finally published in my early 
20s:  There was a book that was 

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.644
published before that that was 
really bhadly written by me and 

01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:55.575
really badly illustrated by 
Floyd Cooper and that book is 

01:02:55.576 --> 01:02:58.043
not in existence anymore.  
Sometimes a librarian will pull 

01:02:58.044 --> 01:03:02.476
it out and say I got that book 
but last time

01:03:06.717 --> 01:03:10.809
.
** My name is Destiny Perry.  

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:14.300
Out of all books that you have 
read and the characters you have

01:03:14.301 --> 01:03:19.644
met in those books, what book or
character is most like you.

01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:22.378
** That's such a great question.

01:03:25.517 --> 01:03:27.863
Oh my goodness.  It's so funny 
because I feel the person that 

01:03:27.864 --> 01:03:32.495
comes to mind that first said 
that's me was Cathy Logan and 

01:03:32.496 --> 01:03:40.269
roll of thunder, hear my cry.  I
feel like also Franny and daddy 

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:46.834
was a return and Francis Nolan 
and a tree grows in Brooklyn, 

01:03:46.835 --> 01:03:50.324
any time there was a girl around
the age I was when I was reading

01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:54.766
and who had something so for me 
a tree grows in Brooklyn the 

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:57.147
mirror was Brooklyn because 
that's where I live.  Everything

01:03:57.427 --> 01:04:00.673
Brooklyn about that book I was 
like I know this even though it 

01:04:00.674 --> 01:04:06.769
took place probably 40 years 
before I began reading it, but I

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.305
did and still do find myself in 
so many characters and they 

01:04:10.306 --> 01:04:18.310
don't have to be the same -- 
preferred gender, right?  I 

01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:22.906
found myself in characters like 
ghost, Jason Reynold's book.  I 

01:04:22.907 --> 01:04:26.417
read that book and I was like 
yeah I was a runner.  I could 

01:04:26.418 --> 01:04:30.988
probably beet him but -- so 
really so were a lot of 

01:04:30.989 --> 01:04:36.168
characters.
** My name is joes lin Rose and 

01:04:36.169 --> 01:04:40.867
my question is have you ever 
thought about having another 

01:04:40.868 --> 01:04:46.448
career instead of writing?
** I don't know if anyone heard 

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:49.335
the question, have I thought of 
having another career besides 

01:04:49.336 --> 01:04:55.447
being a writer.   No, I don't 
think so.  I would probably want

01:04:55.448 --> 01:04:58.406
to be a singer.  Just kidding.  
My family's laughing because 

01:04:58.407 --> 01:05:00.407
they've heard  me.

01:05:05.182 --> 01:05:14.884
Yeah, no.
** My name isadere.  Did

01:05:15.214 --> 01:05:17.313
you have a place to go where you
write a story.

01:05:17.796 --> 01:05:20.297
** Once my family leaves the 
house I'm usually writing at the

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:24.928
kitchen table, but I tend to -- 
I like writing downstairs in my 

01:05:24.929 --> 01:05:29.523
office because it's quietest.  
Every time I write I put 

01:05:29.524 --> 01:05:34.468
headphones on.  So it helps me 
drown out the rest of the world.

01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:37.564
So even though I don't have to  
physically leave a place, I do 

01:05:37.565 --> 01:05:42.959
have to kind of cover up my ears
so that noise isn't coming in.  

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:48.917
But I have been able to write on
sub waist.  ways, cafes, 

01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:52.657
libraries, as long as I have my 
earphones on.  Because I don't 

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:54.090
want to hear other people's 
conversations.

01:05:54.091 --> 01:05:58.820
** My name is Shakara.  Did you 
ever expect to be the ambassador

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.402
for national young people's lit 
tier?

01:06:00.403 --> 01:06:03.855
** Nope.
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:04.342 --> 01:06:06.342
** 

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:14.136
My name is Louie Redmond.  My 
question is:  Did you have any 

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:17.580
challenges becoming an author 
and how did you overcome them?

01:06:17.581 --> 01:06:20.698
** You know, it's a good 
question.  I always quote 

01:06:20.699 --> 01:06:29.215
Catherine Patterson who says the
main role of writing is  BIC, 

01:06:29.216 --> 01:06:36.777
but in care.  The older I got 
there are more and more things 

01:06:36.778 --> 01:06:39.636
as Dr. Hayden and I were talking
about, there are more things 

01:06:39.637 --> 01:06:43.844
that distract you from writing 
and so as a young person I 

01:06:43.845 --> 01:06:47.888
didn't know writers.  I didn't 
know that someone -- it wasn't 

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:51.497
like now where you could 
actually need a writer and hear 

01:06:51.498 --> 01:06:56.700
them talk or go online and see 
them talk or even look at the 

01:06:56.701 --> 01:06:59.828
back of the book and see their 
photo and know stuff about them.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:04.006
It was a very different time.  
Writers seemed really far away 

01:07:04.007 --> 01:07:07.395
and something unattainable, 
something you couldn't do.  For 

01:07:07.396 --> 01:07:11.659
some reason I knew I always 
wanted to do it and I wasn't 

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:16.132
sure how I was going to.  I 
think the first huge challenge 

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:18.382
for me was faith, right?  
Believing that I could write 

01:07:18.383 --> 01:07:21.778
these stories that might some 
day get published.  But in the 

01:07:21.779 --> 01:07:24.909
process of writing the sphrees I
realized that writing made me 

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.334
happy.  Even if they didn't one 
day get published I loved 

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:32.478
writing them.  And then the big 
challenge was finishing stories 

01:07:32.479 --> 01:07:36.526
and then rewriting stories.  
Because you write something that

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:40.090
you think is  done, right, 
Jackson, and then you realize up

01:07:40.587 --> 01:07:44.526
to rewrite it and rewrite it.  
That was a challenge.  Then once

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:49.246
realizing how rewriting made it 
a better story.  But I think 

01:07:49.247 --> 01:07:53.149
there are always going to be 
challenges and the question is 

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:56.715
when you get to the challenge 
what you do with it because 

01:07:56.716 --> 01:08:00.187
there's always going to be the 
book that falls apart and you 

01:08:00.188 --> 01:08:03.589
could either just stop writing 
and start a new book which is 

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:07.397
going to fall apart and you stop
writing that one and start a new

01:08:07.398 --> 01:08:11.129
book which is going to fall 
apart or you can push through 

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:17.235
when it's falling apart and get 
to the end of it.  I ask my 

01:08:17.236 --> 01:08:19.162
fellow office everything we 
write falls apart.  That's when 

01:08:19.163 --> 01:08:21.449
we know the real work is about 
to get started.

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:26.644
** My name is lorn and my 
question is how do you come up 

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:30.947
with the topics for your book?
** So there's a saying if you 

01:08:30.948 --> 01:08:34.013
survive kindergarten you have 
enough to write about for the 

01:08:34.014 --> 01:08:40.548
rest of your life and I think 
it's true.  I think so many 

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:45.019
things happen to us every day 
and I'm sure John and Jin will 

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.667
tell you this, it's hard to not 
write.  It's hard not to find 

01:08:49.668 --> 01:08:53.103
material.  So, you  know, 
thoughts I have, conversations I

01:08:53.104 --> 01:08:55.820
have, sometimes things I read, 
sometimes other books inspire me

01:08:56.103 --> 01:09:00.285
.  Sometimes questions I -- a 
lot of times it's the questions 

01:09:00.286 --> 01:09:04.476
I have that I'm trying to figure
out.  When I wrote the book 

01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:06.648
feathers that was actually 
inspired by a story called a 

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:10.337
selfish giant by Oscar Wild and 
the book was originally called 

01:09:10.338 --> 01:09:13.577
the Jesus boy because that's 
what I called the main character

01:09:13.857 --> 01:09:17.804
in the selfish giant.  It was 
inspired by something I first 

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:22.161
read in the third grade.  So I 
think that's where the whole -- 

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:26.947
the longer you live the more 
stories you have to write.

01:09:32.994 --> 01:09:36.593
** Is there a specific theme --
** What's your name?

01:09:37.073 --> 01:09:41.403
** Oh, my name is justice.
Is there a specific theme or 

01:09:41.404 --> 01:09:46.109
topic in all of your books or 
are they like different in each 

01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:48.815
one?
** They're pretty different.  I 

01:09:48.816 --> 01:09:54.522
don't write series because I get
bored after like the second 

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:59.373
book.  I've's spider to do it 
and then I either kill the 

01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:03.960
characters off or have them move
away or let they want have a 

01:10:03.961 --> 01:10:10.097
hatchly happily ever after.  I 
write realistic fiction.  That's

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:16.367
the genre.  I write it both in 
verse and narrative.  But 

01:10:16.368 --> 01:10:18.428
usually my characters are 
different.  I've written a trill

01:10:18.753 --> 01:10:20.897
lodgegy.  I've written books 
that have equals

01:10:24.442 --> 01:10:27.878
sequels but that's about as long
as I can get.

01:10:28.365 --> 01:10:33.201
** I'm Dionne and my question is
out of all the books that you've

01:10:33.202 --> 01:10:37.758
written 1:00 is your personal 
favorite?

01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:41.616
** I'm sure again my fellow 
ambassadors will say the same 

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:46.400
thing.  I like them for 
different reasons.  I don't have

01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:50.764
-- do y'all have favorites?  
When you're writing it it's the 

01:10:50.765 --> 01:10:56.171
experience you're having with a 
book.  Sometimes if the book is 

01:10:56.172 --> 01:11:03.122
really old you get tired of it. 
I have books I like less than 

01:11:03.123 --> 01:11:06.459
other books but I don't have a 
favorite yet.

01:11:06.946 --> 01:11:09.788
** Your questions have been 
terrific.

01:11:13.248 --> 01:11:16.905
You need a mic.  It's coming.  
There you go.

01:11:17.434 --> 01:11:21.909
** Carl.  When you first started
writing, did you show it to a 

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:26.083
friend?  You seem preallot 
confident and you knew your book

01:11:26.576 --> 01:11:30.989
was good but what was your first
validation?  My point being one 

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:35.679
of these people from brook rine 
starts writing, would you tell 

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.073
them just go ahead or show it to
a friend?

01:11:39.557 --> 01:11:45.539
** I would say the question is 
who are you writing to?  I think

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.760
you show it to people you trust 
because there are two kinds of 

01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:53.585
criticism, right?  24R's 
constructive criticism that 

01:11:53.586 --> 01:11:56.430
makes people running back to 
your work and there's 

01:11:56.431 --> 01:12:00.293
deconstructive criticism, which 
makes you want to throw it away.

01:12:00.294 --> 01:12:04.048
You want to show it to the 
people who are going to say, you

01:12:04.327 --> 01:12:07.990
know, here's all the things I 
love about this book and here 

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:13.063
are some of the questions I 
might have.  Because that's 

01:12:13.064 --> 01:12:17.925
helpful and makes you want to go
back to it but if someone says, 

01:12:17.926 --> 01:12:21.452
you know, I don't know, this 
sucks or you should never write 

01:12:21.453 --> 01:12:25.266
again, that speaks to their 
criticism.  I don't even know 

01:12:25.267 --> 01:12:28.748
why you're writing that.  But 
one thing I do is I like -- I 

01:12:28.749 --> 01:12:31.778
always think it's really 
important when you have 

01:12:31.779 --> 01:12:35.713
something new and you say to 
them ask me three questions.  

01:12:35.714 --> 01:12:38.680
What three questions do you 
have?  Tell me something 

01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:42.405
positive, oh, I love that 
character, I wonder why he 

01:12:42.406 --> 01:12:46.901
decided to do this.  I wonder 
what's going to happen to him 

01:12:46.902 --> 01:12:51.328
next and that gets you excited 
and makes you want to write the 

01:12:51.329 --> 01:12:55.125
next draft or add to it.  So 
questions, not destructive 

01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:58.331
criticism.
** All right.  I think we're 

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:02.904
going to wrap things up.  That 
was -- just stay right there for

01:13:03.794 --> 01:13:07.166
a minute.  Really, stiewbs from 
Brooklyn middle school, thanks 

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:10.537
so much.
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:13:11.031 --> 01:13:13.031
** Can I just say one thing?
** Yeah.

01:13:13.453 --> 01:13:19.093
** So I am sorry, I just wanted 
to give a plug of the book 

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:23.066
change the narratives of 
literature and I want to thank 

01:13:23.067 --> 01:13:27.755
them for being in the room even 
though they're not in the room.

01:13:27.756 --> 01:13:36.161
** Well, I am confident that our

all of us to think about very 
thoughtfully about reading and

writing and I really can't say 
enough.  This has been a 

01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:56.331
terrific conversation this 
morning and really so glad that

Shawn and our special events 

01:14:28.524 --> 01:14:33.279
person Clay who I don't see but 
events like this at the library 

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.793
don't happen magically.  They 
happen when people come together

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.956
and make things happen.  We are 
briesed at the library to have 

01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:46.521
an amazing team of people who 
pull together events like this. 

01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:50.253
Thank you to all of my 
colleagues for making today work

01:14:50.547 --> 01:14:52.109
