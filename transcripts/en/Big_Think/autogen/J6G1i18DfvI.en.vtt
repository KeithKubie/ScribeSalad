important institution which can actually

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930
important institution which can actually
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.590
important institution which can actually
bring us together now unfortunately the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940
role of United Nations and its
 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.389
role of United Nations and its
effectiveness has been undermined in the

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399
effectiveness has been undermined in the
 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.330
effectiveness has been undermined in the
last few several decades and so we

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
last few several decades and so we
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.580
last few several decades and so we
obviously have to commit ourselves to

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590
obviously have to commit ourselves to
 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.010
obviously have to commit ourselves to
you and reform but if you look at the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020

law now where there is still resistance
as far as countries are concerned is

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360
as far as countries are concerned is
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.350
as far as countries are concerned is
when it comes to for example issues

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360
when it comes to for example issues
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.060

relating to international humanitarian

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070
relating to international humanitarian
 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
relating to international humanitarian
law international human rights law and

law international human rights law and
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.100
law international human rights law and
to some extent broader issues relating

to some extent broader issues relating
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.680
to some extent broader issues relating
to public international law so the point

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690
to public international law so the point
 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.710
to public international law so the point
here is that States I mean always look

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720
here is that States I mean always look
 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810
here is that States I mean always look
at their personal at their interest and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820
at their personal at their interest and
 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.060
at their personal at their interest and
when they're when that when the when

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
when they're when that when the when
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.539
when they're when that when the when
these interests are largely commercial

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
these interests are largely commercial
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.450
these interests are largely commercial
in nature in the context of trade law or

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460
in nature in the context of trade law or
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.160
in nature in the context of trade law or
intellectual property law there is

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
intellectual property law there is
 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.930
intellectual property law there is
little resistance on the part of the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940
little resistance on the part of the
 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.470
little resistance on the part of the
states to subject themselves to a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480
states to subject themselves to a
 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.030
states to subject themselves to a
international tribunal in the form of a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
international tribunal in the form of a
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.539
international tribunal in the form of a
WTO appellate body and but when it comes

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549
WTO appellate body and but when it comes
 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.210
WTO appellate body and but when it comes
to human rights issues or other issues

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
to human rights issues or other issues
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220
to human rights issues or other issues
which I just mentioned there is still

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
which I just mentioned there is still
 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.040
which I just mentioned there is still
resistance so I think in the years to

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
resistance so I think in the years to
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.460
resistance so I think in the years to
come

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
come
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.110
come
states should become much

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
states should become much
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.180
states should become much
more confident about themselves about

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190
more confident about themselves about
 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.300
more confident about themselves about
their actions and should also be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
their actions and should also be
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.979
their actions and should also be
responsible about their actions and

there is I don't see any reason for us

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829
there is I don't see any reason for us
 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.210
there is I don't see any reason for us
to in some ways reinvent the wheel we

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
to in some ways reinvent the wheel we
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.130
to in some ways reinvent the wheel we
just have to make the wheel work better

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
just have to make the wheel work better
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.610
just have to make the wheel work better
it actually worked pretty well because

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620
it actually worked pretty well because
 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.530

which would have been catastrophic for
 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.759
which would have been catastrophic for
the whole world and we have had number

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769
the whole world and we have had number
 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.280
