00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.110
- [Instructor] We have this diagram here,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.850
party divisions of the
United States Congress.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.590
And what this helps us visualize

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.790
is which parties controlled
the various houses of Congress

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.960
as well as which party was in
control of the White House.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.030
So for example, during Lyndon
Johnson's administration,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.540
he was a Democrat, that's
why this colored in in blue,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.700
and then we see in this light blue color,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.200
the Senate leaned towards the Democrats,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.590
and the House in this dark blue color

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.020
leaned towards the Democrats as well.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.950
But then when you get to Richard Nixon,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.280
you have one party, the Republicans,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.680
controlling the White House,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.990
while the other party, the
Democrats, controlled Congress.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.760
And so this situation right over here

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.540
is known as a divided,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.330
divided government.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.740
And as we look down this diagram,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.790
we see that it is not that unusual.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.600
Gerald Ford had a divided government.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.450
Ronald Reagan had a
somewhat divided government

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.970
where the House significantly
leaned towards the Democrats,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.450
although the Senate started to lean

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.140
a little bit towards the Republicans.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.860
But then if we go further down in time,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.920
we see more and more divided governments.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.590
So if we go all the way
down to at least the present

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.890
when this video was created,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.160
we see that George H. W. Bush
faced a divided government.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.470
He was a Republican.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.610
You had the House and the Senate
lean towards the Democrats.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.980
Bill Clinton, at the
beginning it wasn't divided,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
but most of his administration,
he had a divided government.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.420
George W. Bush had a divided government

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.330
near the end of his administration.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.660
And Obama dealt with a divided government

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.020
during the second 1/2 of his first term,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.330
and his second term.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.260
One question is why does it matter

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.000
if you have a divided government

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.100
like we had, let's say, in this
time period right over here?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.270
Well, one negative of it that
some people will often cite

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.380
is that you might have some
form of extreme partisanship.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.360
And partisanship is just a word

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.870
that says that the
various political actors

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.510
will think more about their party

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.080
and their political ideology

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.810
than maybe what is in their
best interest for the people.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.590
Or they would try do things in
order to get political points

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.480
as opposed to just good governance.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500
And one byproduct of partisanship

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.300
would be a phenomenon known as gridlock.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.220
You might've heard the
word gridlock before

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.360
when it comes to traffic.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.610
Gridlock is when there's
just so much traffic

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.110
that nothing is moving, that
people just can't get around.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.860
And it essentially means the same thing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.320
in a political context.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.110
If you have a divided government,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.570
and one party isn't allowing,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.370
if everything that the Congress
passes the president vetoes,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.020
or if everything that
the president wants to do

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.020
the Congress doesn't
wanna work along with him,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.590
well, then nothing might happen,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.400
and you might get to a gridlock situation.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.050
And for a lot of people,
that's a significant negative.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.250
But there are some viewpoints

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.640
that maybe a divided
government isn't as bad

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.410
as it sometimes looks.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410
Some people would argue that
you don't want the government

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.210
always doing exactly what they want

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.720
when you have a non-divided government.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.230
In fact, if you have a divided government,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.710
they'll only do things that
really, really, really,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.790
really matter where there is
more of a broad consensus.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.270
There's also this view
from Mitch McConnell,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.350
who's the current leader of the US Senate,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.400
that it's actually
easier to get things done

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.570
during a divided government.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.930
This is a part of an article

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.440
from the New York Times written in 2011.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.380
It says, "Divided government
is the perfect time

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.460
"to do big things, the perfect time,"

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.020
Mr. McConnell said in a recent session

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.730
with New York Times reporters and editors.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.790
He cited three fairly recent examples

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.950
of major legislative bargains

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.820
that were struck with one
party in the White House

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.620
and another running
things on Capitol Hill,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.220
the 1983 overhaul of Social Security

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.930
negotiated between President Ronald Reagan

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.800
and Speaker Tip O'Neill.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.880
Ronald Reagan was, of course, Republican,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.740
and Speaker of the House,
Tip O'Neill, was a Democrat.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.860
Sweeping 1986 tax law changes.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.480
Once again, under Ronald Reagan.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.750
And the welfare reform package of 1996

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.330
negotiated between President Bill Clinton

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.940
and Congressional Republicans.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.070
Clinton, of course, was a Democrat.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.070
"None of those things in my view

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.400
"would have occurred
in unified government,"

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.160
Mr. McConnell said, referring
to control of Congress

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.650
and the White House by one party.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.790
"The differences are always big,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.670
"but if you can bridge the differences,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.230
"then you can survive."

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.340
The beauty of divided government,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.470
very few people say that,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.380
the beauty (laughs) of divided government,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.310
in the eyes of Mr. McConnell

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.020
is that it provides both parties

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.840
with near bulletproof political cover

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.060
since neither can attack the other

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.090
after legislation is passed,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.240
while it also gives both parties

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.530
the ability to take political credit.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.970
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.410
I want you to think about it.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.880
Do you agree with Senator McConnell

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.050
that divided government can
actually be a good thing?

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.800
Or do you think this notion
of divided government

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.660
and partisanship does lead to gridlock,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.110
and for the most part it is a bad thing?

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.290
And then we could also think
about our system of government,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.270
because our system of
government definitely allows

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.310
for things like gridlock to occur,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.070
while many other systems
like a parliamentary system,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.750
you always have the majority
or a ruling coalition party

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.750
also in charge of the executive,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.640
so you're not likely to
have this type of gridlock.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.473
So think about it.

00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:38.940
Which system do you like?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.760
And is a divided government
a good or a bad thing?
