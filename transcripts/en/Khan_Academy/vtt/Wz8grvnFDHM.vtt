00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.407
- [Voiceover] Lea and Pedro
push two tables together.

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.083
The figure below shows
the new arrangement.

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:10.533
We have table number
one and table number two

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.657
that Lea and Pedro have pushed together.

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:14.570
Maybe they're having a
bunch of people over for a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.835
fancy breakfast and so
they've pushed one, two tables

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.457
together to have a lot of
room for people to sit.

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:25.624
We're asked, what is the
perimeter of the new figure?

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:29.982
Perimeter is the distance
around the outside,

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:34.149
so all of this space around
the outside is the perimeter

00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:38.375
and we need to figure that out.

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:40.160
What we could do we could
say, "Here we know there is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.064
three meters around the
outside, here is another meter,

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:46.363
so that's four meters around the outside."

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:50.442
Then we get to here and oh,
oh we don't have this one

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:52.265
and we don't have this side
length, through this length,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.645
through this length, so we
can't know the entire distance

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:57.766
around the outside until we figure out

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.966
what those missing side lengths are.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.460
Let's fill in some of those first.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.811
These tables are rectangles,
opposite sides are equal.

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.508
If this side down here is one meter,

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:12.660
then the side up here has to be one meter.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.165
Same here if this is three meters,

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.795
the opposite side is also three meters.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.056
We have one meter on the end of this table

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:23.769
so that inside this length from

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:26.352
here to here is also one meter.

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:31.528
That's an interesting
one, this one meter here

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.867
because this part now right here,

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.980
that's on the inside of the arrangement.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.682
That's not the outside,

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:40.765
so that is not part of the perimeter.

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:45.427
This one meter will not be
included in our perimeter

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:49.670
but it is still important
to us and here is why.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.653
This length and this length
are part of the outside

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:55.674
and we need to know how long those are.

00:01:55.674 --> 00:02:00.488
What we can say is, if this
entire length is three meters,

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:03.739
then this entire length is three meters,

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.122
but one of those meters
was moved to the inside,

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:12.289
so how many meters are still
left here on the outside?

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:18.465
We had three meters over here,
we moved one to the inside,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.724
so we have two meters left on the outside.

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:29.048
This length and this length
are a total of two meters.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.538
We can't know for sure, they
look pretty evenly divided,

00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:33.453
we can't know for sure
that they're both one meter

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.462
but we do know for sure that it's a total

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:39.403
of two meters when we combine them.

00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:42.922
Again this one meter
is not on the outside,

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.522
it's not part of our
perimeter but it did help us

00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:47.689
to find the other lengths.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:51.540
Now everything is labelled,
so we can get back to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.778
finding the perimeter, the
distance around the outside

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:59.008
will be all of these lengths put together.

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:03.175
Here we have one meter plus
moving down the outside three

00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:09.868
more meters, plus one more,
plus one here on that side

00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:15.298
we just figured out, plus
another three, one on the end,

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:23.309
another alongside of three and finally

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.059
one more meter going up the side.

00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:29.760
We can add these lengths.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.171
When we combine these
lengths they'll tell us

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.470
the total distance around the outside.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.541
One plus three is four,
plus one more is five,

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.331
plus one more is six,
six plus three is nine,

00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:47.262
nine plus one is 10, 10 plus three is 13

00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:49.512
and 13 plus one more is 14.

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:52.655
The perimeter of the new figure,

00:03:52.655 --> 00:03:56.238
of this new table
arrangement is 14 meters.
