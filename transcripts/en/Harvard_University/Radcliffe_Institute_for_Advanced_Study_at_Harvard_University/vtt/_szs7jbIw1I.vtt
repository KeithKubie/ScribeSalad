00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.436
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.920
- It was exciting
acquiring this collection.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.830
I mean, this is Angela Davis.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.380
This-- the Angela Davis.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.170
Acquiring Angela
Davis' papers it's

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.060
just absolutely remarkable.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.764
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:26.400
It's evidence of a life
of struggle well-lived.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.250
It's evidence that we
can overcome obstacles.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.940
And it's just kind of brings a
sense of hope for the future.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.860
So to be a curator of race and
ethnicity at the Schlesinger

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.530
is essentially just
making sure that as we

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.000
talk about the
women's experience

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750
in America, that we have the
most diverse perspectives as

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.290
possible.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.610
So we're reaching out to as many
different ethnicities and class

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.130
groups, racial
groups to make sure

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.890
that when we say
women in America,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.750
as many voices and faces as
we can have are represented.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.990
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.660
- This acquisition
is so important to us

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.140
on so many levels.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.380
I think the most obvious
is the biographical.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.300
She's a figure in 20th
century American thought

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.100
and political
history, the history

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.010
of organizing that people
want to know about,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.490
and that people want to know
about from the inside out.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.800
We're very lucky that
Angela Davis kept the kinds

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.630
of meticulous records she did.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.822
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:45.180
If I think 10 years
into the future,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
I expect to be looking at
a shelf full of books that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.790
has come out of this
collection that changes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.110
our understanding of 20th
century American politics,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.500
of the history and
directions of feminism

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
and the fights within it,
of black power, which--

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.650
whose history is
now beginning to be

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.340
told in ways that incorporate
central female figures,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.640
but has been a mostly
male dominated history

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.230
from the '70s to its
early chroniclers,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.160
to the burgeoning history
of mass incarceration

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.040
and the pushback against it.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.890
- I'm so excited that Angela
Davis' collection is here

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.280
at the Schlesinger, and the fact
that her papers will be around

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.980
forever, and that
story will not be lost.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.600
It's priceless.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.750
It's priceless.
