RACHEL O'MARA:
I'm Rachel O'Mara.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.210
I'm based in San Francisco.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.680
And I'm here today with
a very exciting speaker.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm really excited to bring Jia
Jiang here from Austin, Texas.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.239
He flew in all the way just
to be here with you today.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.890
And we are going to talk about
how awesome rejection is.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.685
Who's excited to
talk about rejection?

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:23.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.365
RACHEL O'MARA: Yeah cool.

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:30.700
Well, rejection means a lot
of things to many people.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.870
But I think what we'll learn
today is how you can really

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.740
think about rejection
differently.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.390
A lot of times rejection stirs
up not the nicest emotions

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.810
for people-- maybe a little
bit of fear in there,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.920
a little bit of anxiety,
all kinds of things.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
And what Jia has done is really
mastered this as an art form,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.180
I would say.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850
It's actually an art form now.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.880
And what I think is really
interesting is that if you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
shift how you think
about rejection,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.620
and actually jump into
the fear, lean into it,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.230
and use rejection to
learn about yourself--

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.440
whether it's what you are afraid
of or what you may not have

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.590
done but want to take a risk
-- you learn a little bit more

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.440
about yourself.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.900
And you learn about what, maybe,
is stirring that up for you.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.730
And you get an
opportunity to work

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.986
on yourself and
personal development.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:21.610
So that's why I think
it's pretty cool.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.750
So I actually wish
all of you to have

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.610
as many rejections as possible.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.290
RACHEL O'MARA: Whether
it's today or one a day,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.150
like Jia, or whatever it is.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.610
And think of it like an
opportunity for yourself.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.730
And when you jump into
that and think about it,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.089
it's really a way to work
on yourself really, and not

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.130
tiptoe around something
that you may have thought

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.588
wasn't necessarily something
that you were in to or wanting

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:47.130
to look into before.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.690
So embrace.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.700
It love It.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.200
And Jia is here to
talk about it and what

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410
he does for it on a daily basis.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.430
And then just a
quick note as well.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.010
I met Jia last summer at
the World Domination Summit.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.540
Has Anyone actually
heard of that?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.450
Has anyone actually been to it?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.570
Good, good.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.680
So the World Domination Summit
is hosted by Chris Guillebeau

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.700
up in Portland, Oregon.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.365
And last summer, we had about
300 bloggers, travelers,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:16.580
and just life
enthusiasts gathering.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.420
And so Jia was one of
our keynote speakers

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.720
who got a standing ovation.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.400
He's also on a TEDx talk
where he spoke about rejection

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.972
in Austin.

00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:26.430
So we all loved
what he had to say.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.990
So that's why I thought it was
really important to bring him

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.500
here.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.333
He's also working on a
book about rejection,

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.250
so there's no books
for sale today.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.210
But it will be
available in the future.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.500
So with that, I will
pass it off to Jia.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.269
Thanks.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.159
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:49.886
JIA JIANG: Thank you.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:54.060
So it was a warm
November afternoon.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.675
It was Sunday in Austin Texas.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.240
A man in his 40s just sitting
in his living room just minding

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.420
his own business.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.030
Actually, the Dallas
Cowboys was on.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.560
And it was actually
going to overtime.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.030
And then the doorbell rang.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.700
And he was like, that's odd.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.690
Because his kid
and wife are away.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.770
Who could that be?

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.890
And is that a sales person?

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.220
Who does sales on Sundays?

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.360
Then the doorbell rang again.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.370
Well, there must be some
really motivated sales person.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.670
So he got up kind of
reluctantly and opened the door.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.000
Instead he saw a 6 foot
tall guy with a soccer ball

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.420
with a uniform, and cleats,
and shin guards, and all

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.210
decked out.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.560
And he's asking, "Can I play
soccer in your backyard?"

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.910
And the guy's name is Scott.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.300
And the guy who was asking
the question was me.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.400
But by now you've probably
figured out what I was doing.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.825
But you might be asking why?

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.930
Why did you do this?

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.000
What were you doing?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.160
What were you thinking?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.050
It was a love story.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.910
It was really my story.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.550
I was in a love
story with rejection.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.300
When people run
away from rejection,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.550
I really love rejection.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.460
For a period of 100 days, I
dated rejection every day.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.420
And the end of me almost
here was rejection.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.470
It was like we're a
married couple now.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.960
But just like all
good love stories,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.940
it didn't start with
me embracing it.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.310
It started with me running away.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.540
It started when I was a
teenager boy growing up

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.870
in Beijing, China.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.910
Some people want to ask what
I want to do in the future.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.200
What's the meaning in life?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.790
And I got that figured
out pretty early.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.600
I want to be entrepreneur.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.180
I want to someday build
a company like the one

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.520
I'm standing in right now.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.920
I had that dream.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.160
And when I was 14,
Bill Gates actually

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.540
came to my hometown to speak.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.200
And it was a big deal.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.100
It was the first time
he visited Beijing.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.350
And I remember he was
in Peking University.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.110
And there were people hanging on
trees just listen to him talk.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.860
I had no idea what he said
because I don't know English.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.034
But you all sounded
so good to me.

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:23.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.110
JIA JIANG: I thought
he was the prophet.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.710
He knows everything.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.120
There he is.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.070
I have no idea what
he held in his hand.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.710
I'm sure it's not an
Android or an iPhone.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.110
It's probably not
Windows Phone either.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.830
But I was mesmerized
by his story.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.360
And ever since I want to
be a great entrepreneur.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.450
In fact, I wrote a letter to my
family telling them by age 25

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.310
I will build the
greatest technology

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.370
company in the world.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.000
I will buy Microsoft.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.770
Yes, I really embraced
his spirit of domination.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.062
I didn't make it up.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.270
I actually wrote that letter.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.820
I found it.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.002
And you don't have know
Chinese to read this.

00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:08.210
It's not good writing anyway.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.833
I marked some key words.

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:13.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.490
JIA JIANG: So I didn't
just have a dream.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.330
I actually acted on it.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.640
When I was 16, I was
given the opportunity

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.340
to come to the United States to
do cultural exchange program.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.310
It's idea is for me to live
with a American host family.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.800
And I go to high school.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.200
Then go to college later on.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.800
Funny thing is in
that letter I talked

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.060
about I want to go to Houston.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.220
Somehow I want move to US.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.920
I want to go to Houston
to achieve that dream.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.930
I have no idea why
picked Houston.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.890
It's probably because that
was the year the Houston

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.600
Rockets win the
NBA championship.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.490
And I am a fan so I'm
like, Houston sound good.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.370
It's all about
branding, you know.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.980
But when I came here,
and I landed in the US,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.100
I went to the host family.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.740
And it's a place I
did not sign up for.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.420
It's not Houston.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.760
It's not Silicon Valley.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.860
It's not LA or New York.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.250
It's rural Louisiana.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:22.020
So I'm not sure any of you
are from there or been there.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.490
It's a town of 500 people.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.520
There are more cows than people.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.670
You get on Google Earth.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.790
You type in Simpson, Louisiana.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.560
And you zoom in and zoom in, and
do that about 10 times you'll

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.960
start seeing some streets.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.740
There's only a few streets.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.860
But the thing is at
the time, I thought,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.520
this is the start of a dream.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.780
I'm just starting small.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.780
This is small town.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.040
I'm from Beijing-- 50 million.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.720
That's OK.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.220
I'm here.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.130
I here in America now.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.530
And then over the subsequent
years I did achieve a dream.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.700
I did.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.380
But actually it's
a different dream.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.030
It's not the dream I thought.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.820
It's not the dream I
wrote on this letter.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.260
It's called the American dream.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.910
Basically, I went to
school, got a job,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.570
made money, went to a better
school, got an even better job,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.580
made even more money, got a
care, got a house, got a dog,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.900
got married, and everything.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.650
And one day I woke
up, I'm 30 years old.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.270
I didn't achieve--
I was comfortable.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.539
I was living in
a situation where

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.970
99% of the people
on Earth would envy.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.860
But I didn't achieve this dream.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.510
Instead I actually chose a path
of security and conformity,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.200
and looking for family approval.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.170
The thing is no one
rejects you when

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.880
you are 30 years old
making a lot of income

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.590
at a Fortune 500 company.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.470
They think you're doing great.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.630
In fact, some people
would ask me for a job.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.220
And I'm sure people here
get that all of time.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.000
People think you
are doing great.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.130
But I'm not saying everyone
should an entrepreneur.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.070
But for me, this is my dream.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.420
And I didn't go for it.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.670
And I really kind of run away
from the risk and rejection.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.100
And in the end I
rejected myself.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.920
I couldn't stand myself anymore.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.400
It felt so shiny on the
outside, so wrong on the inside.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:38.390
I remember, it was last year
2012 just about 15 months ago,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.110
July 4th weekend.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.280
I was going to community
park, sit on the grass.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.830
There were families
all around me.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.180
Dogs, kids, and ice
creams, and laughters.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.120
And I was as depressed
as I could be.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.950
My wife was, at the time,
nine months pregnant.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.700
And I was watching the
colorful explosion in the sky.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.520
When everyone was
enjoying it, what

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.800
I saw was a mental slideshow
of what's the rest of my life's

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.970
going to be.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.130
I'm going to have more
responsibilities at work.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.220
I'm going to develop
more processes.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.280
And I'm going get promoted
and build a big 401(k).

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.560
And at home, we're going to
have two or three more kids.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.060
That's always our goal,
two or three more kids.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.810
Our life will be in a
cycle of sending them

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.660
to school, summer vacation,
send them to school, and then

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.590
holidays.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.280
And then we're going to through
that cycle about 18 to 20 times

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.770
and we'll be old.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:46.190
And I would not make no
real impact in the world.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:51.790
The slideshow ended with
a picture of my funeral,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.780
of my eulogy.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.014
That eulogy is very touching,
but I would hate to have it.

00:10:57.014 --> 00:10:57.680
I would hate it.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.040
And I cussed.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.230
And I'm not an actual cusser.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.930
So when I cussed, my
wife was concerned.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.830
It was like, what's
going on with you?

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.780
And I told her I would die
full of regret some day.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.440
And she's really concerned now.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.310
JIA JIANG: It's like,
lady, what's going on?

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.200
And I told her about
this situation of me

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.300
right now, this dream I had
and why I'm not pursuing it.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.880
And then I actually expected
her to give me a lesson.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.720
I expected to tell me that,
hey, our life is great.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.059
You should be grateful.

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:38.850
Be a great husband.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.200
You're going to be a great
father in about a month or so.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.500
But actually no.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.020
She told me, you know why I met
you and fell in love with you?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.800
It's because you
told me the first day

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.330
that you're going to be
entrepreneur some day.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.480
And I need that man in my life.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.652
How come you're not doing it?

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:00.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.010
JIA JIANG: And if you're
not happy, I'm not happy.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.620
We can have another car, another
house, another great job.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.200
But you cannot have
your life back.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.730
So why don't you try this?

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.700
Go out and for six months,
build your company.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.050
Just go give it a try.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.460
At least to do your best.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.540
Six months.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.320
At that moment, I
knew I married up.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.030
So I did.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.480
This is the day my son was born.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.620
And four days before,
that I quit my job.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.285
And I turned in my badge.

00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:42.210
And I asked my manager
to take a picture.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.550
I don't think she was happy
because it wasn't good picture.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:51.160
But I remember that day I
walk out my office building.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:59.300
And this moment of joy but
also nakedness came to me.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.540
Because before I could
always blame that,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.950
hey, I have a company.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.740
I'm making money.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.117
Now, the only thing in
between me and my dream is me.

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:12.950
I've no more excuse.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.390
It's all on me now.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.880
So I hit the ground running.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.960
I did.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.210
And I formed a team.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.730
It's a lot of rejection,
but I used LinkedIn.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.230
I used a local network, and I
built a team of five engineers.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.745
I'm the only engineer guy.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:35.710
But I built a team
of five engineers

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.020
and across the country,
actually across continents.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:46.620
And we used the Lean
Startup methodology.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.070
Interviewed customers.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.150
Built MVP.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.210
We did all that.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.720
We built our prototype
and a lot of people

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.370
like what we're doing.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.974
Four months into
my venture-- really

00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:57.140
I didn't have a lot of time.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.110
Four months into
my venture, I was

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.140
presented with a major
investment opportunity.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.100
And I actually thought, this
is the answer to my prayers.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.950
I'm going to get it.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.850
This is fate.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.570
This is dream come true.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.210
This is destiny.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.600
I believe in destiny.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.480
I thought, there's no way
I'm not going to get it.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.520
I even dreamed about on,
five different occasions,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.740
I dreamed about getting
that investment.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.240
And I remember vividly
in those dreams I woke up

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.390
and got the investment.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.800
I called my wife.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.000
I call my parents and
telling them the good news.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.200
I remember those
feelings still today.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.800
But then those were dreams.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.920
The reality hit.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.757
One day, I was at the
restaurant celebrating

00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:46.590
a friend's birthday.

00:14:50.415 --> 00:14:52.150
It's a bunch of friends.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.230
And then my phone vibrated.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.830
And I pulled it up
and I saw email.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.290
The email was from the investor.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.580
It's a very simple
letter basically said no.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.440
And I had to just walk
out of that restaurant

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.880
so other people wouldn't
see me cry in front of them.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:17.100
It felt personal and
impersonal at the same time.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.940
And I don't know why
I was hurt that bad.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.110
Because I thought
I'm mentally tough.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.730
I'm well-educated I'm
actually prepared for no.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.462
I know there's a
possibility for no.

00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:28.170
I prepare for it.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.020
But still when it comes,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.410
I want it so bad,
it really hurt.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.560
And I started thinking,
maybe this is not to be.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.310
Maybe this is some sort
of Higher Being telling me

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.690
that this is not your destiny.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.050
You should go back to work.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.990
I'm like, if I
look for a job now,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.640
I could save two more months.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.600
And it's a lot of income.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.700
So I told my wife.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.480
I started talking with my wife.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.120
My wife's like this
quarterback grabbing

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.420
the offensive lineman's face
mask like he gave up a sack.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.160
She's like, I gave
you six months.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.840
I didn't give you four.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.380
So you have two
more months left.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.930
You got to keep trying.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.700
Leave no regret.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.310
And but I try.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.620
But, you know, I don't want
to go through the whole thing

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.150
and get rejected again.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.920
I learned how easy it is for
investors to reject ideas.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.800
They're presented with ideas
all-- great presentation--

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.790
all day long.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.290
So I'm like, more than
likely I will get rejected.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.230
And I don't have enough time.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.140
But I thought,
would Bill Gates get

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.800
crushed like I was with
a single rejection?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.520
Would Thomas Edison
get crushed like that?

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.040
So I started thinking.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.640
It's not just about
this investment.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.800
If I want to be a
better entrepreneur,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.010
if I want to be a better
professional if I go back

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.190
to work, want to be a
better father a husband,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.290
I need to not be
afraid like this.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.000
Not be afraid of rejection.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.710
So I started searching
online and using, guess what?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.540
Google.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.290
Google is my friend.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.720
And I searched how can I
overcome the fear of rejection.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.280
I came across a website
called Rejection Therapy.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.740
It's a game that
basically asks you

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.980
to go out and look
for rejection.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.470
The goal is to
desensitize yourself

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.690
from the pain of rejection.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.550
And you know what?

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.980
I love the idea.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.690
I'm like, this is a great idea,
one the greatest I've heard.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.310
Let's do it.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.250
Let's blow this out.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.280
Instead of doing this just
kind of a half-heartedly,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.070
I'm going to build a blog.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.990
I'm going to record the process.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.780
And I'm going to do this
for 100 days every day.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.630
So the world will
keep me accountable,

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.470
and I wouldn't quit halfway.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.320
So I did.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.220
This is the original blog.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:55.750
And I started asking for some
crazy stuff to get rejected.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.780
You see I was asking to play
soccer in someone's backyard

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.340
as day six.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.652
For example, one day I
saw a police officer.

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:07.860
I flagged him down saying,
hey, can I drive your car?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.940
It's my revenge for pulling a
police officer over, you know?

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.200
And then one day I thought,
what would it be like to fly?

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.720
So I went to an air field
and saw a pilot and say, hey,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.440
can I fly your plane?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.060
He's like, do you
have a license?

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.566
And I was like, no.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.066
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.940
JIA JIANG: I don't know
anything about flying

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.330
I just want to fly your plane.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.470
But the crazy thing happened.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.000
People start saying
yeses to these requests.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.820
The three things I said,
they say yes to all of them.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.710
And here's the proof.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:55.410
So and now I'm all like, whoa.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.460
I'm looking for rejection
but I'm getting yeses.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.335
What I do?

00:18:59.335 --> 00:19:00.760
I'm confused.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.300
And then there's one
instance where it actually

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.750
made national news,
that it really

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.620
encompasses the idea of looking
rejection and not getting it.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.490
And here it is.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.970
-I'm driving toward
Krispy Kreme.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.560
I'm going to ask them to make
me some specialized doughnuts.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.327
And we'll see what happen.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.785
-What kind of
specialized doughnuts

00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:23.780
are you talking about?

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.139
-I like to have getting--
you link the five

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:30.430
doughnuts together make them
look like Olympic symbols.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.920
-And when are you
looking for these?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.356
-Huh?

00:19:36.356 --> 00:19:36.856
-When?

00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:43.335
-The next 50 minutes?

00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:44.460
-Let me see what I can get.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.198
-OK.

00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:49.448
-But what do you think?

00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:49.947
-Wow.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.210
That is really good.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.590
That's really good.
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.167
All right, so do I pay there?

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.291
-Don't even worry about it.

00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:01.225
That one's on me.

00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:03.603
-Are you serious?

00:20:03.603 --> 00:20:04.565
You serious?

00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:05.527
-Yeah.

00:20:05.527 --> 00:20:06.490
Extremely.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.910
-Wow.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:08.410
-Extremely.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.350
-[INAUDIBLE] today.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.040
All right.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.555
Thank you.

00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:11.070
-You're very welcome.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.591
-All right.

00:20:11.591 --> 00:20:12.090
See you.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.220
Give me hug. [LAUGHS] OK.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:14.720
-Enjoy.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.170
-All right.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:15.490
Thank you.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:15.973
See you.

00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:16.639
-You're welcome.

00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:20.904
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:20.904 --> 00:20:22.820
JIA JIANG: I will never
forget that doughnuts.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.520
It's very sweet.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.290
But the spirit is
better than it tasted.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.934
So I couldn't believe it.

00:20:31.934 --> 00:20:32.850
I couldn't believe it.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.700
And then I posted it online.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.470
And in about a week or so,
it got over 5 million views

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.280
on YouTube.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.250
And the Krispy Kreme
stock actually went up.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.210
JIA JIANG: I cannot prove
this scientifically it's all

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.310
because of this.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.980
But I'm sure this didn't hurt.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.760
People who saw this and they
started following my blog.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.790
And they started finding what
I'm doing somehow inspiring.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.890
And they started sending
me thousands of emails.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.420
Today, I got over 3,000
emails from people,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.440
just from strangers
all over the world.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.490
And on social media--
on the Twitter,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.240
everywhere-- they send me
stories about their rejection.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.320
Why they are afraid
of rejection.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.440
So for example, there
is an artist in Austin.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.540
Her art is beautiful
and profound.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.604
But no one noticed.

00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:45.020
She didn't tell anyone because
she's like, this is my art.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.260
It's my baby.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.670
I don't want to share
with the world because--

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.979
But one day she saw this.

00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:52.770
It's like, those
doughnuts are pretty nice.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.255
But I'm real artist.

00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:57.280
If that video can go
viral, why shouldn't I

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.010
share my art with the world?

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.610
And she did it.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.810
And then it made national
news pretty soon.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:11.860
She went to Washington,
DC and has own show.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.810
Then there's this man.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.360
He's afraid of rejection
his whole life.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.750
And he said for things
like going to a restaurant

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.310
and ask for ketchup
would churn his stomach.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.210
And so he sent
his kids to do it.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.310
But just last year, his wife
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.690
And he learned, for
good and for bad,

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.360
the in the American
medical system,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.200
you have to keep
pushing for things.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.760
You have to keep asking
the doctors, the nurses,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.130
the hospitals to
get things done.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.000
And he's like, if
you have the courage

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.340
to us crazy stuff for some
sort of rejection therapy,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.520
I'm trying to save
my wife's life here.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.230
You know, why shouldn't I ask?

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.650
So he did and he thanked
me with a letter.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.450
It's me getting these kind
of a letters every day

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.850
that give me a chance to
see rejection face-to-face.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.190
I thought this is
some sort of monster

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.290
that everyone's afraid of, but
I started reading more on it.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.290
I started talking to people--
talking to successful people--

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.310
how they see rejection, how
they overcome rejection.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.960
And here's what I found.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.170
Rejection is not what
I thought it was.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.870
One it's constant.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.440
Rejection is constant.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.730
And some people write me
emails saying, yes, I'm

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.600
afraid of rejection.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.430
But I might want to try
something on my own.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.440
I might want to
try some new idea.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.500
But let me get to a certain
place in life first.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.890
Let me get that promotion.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:46.910
Let me get higher in the
corporate ladder somewhere so I

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.950
cannot get rejected as much.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.470
Actually, that's not true.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.260
In fact the higher you go,
the more you'll get rejected.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:01.530
For example, President
Obama, right?

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:05.350
He gets rejected
more than anyone.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.550
Think about it.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.720
Even in the last
presidential election,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.430
he won 51% of the popular vote.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.760
All right, he won.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.660
He's a big winner.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.000
He's cover of "Time" magazine.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.100
He's the most
powerful man on Earth.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.579
But he got rejected by
half of his country.

00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:24.620
And think about this is
the leader of free world.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.840
He got rejected
61 million times.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.790
And I'm sure Google is probably
the pinnacle of technology

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.310
world.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.270
And I'm sure you
guys get rejected.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.120
It's not like there's no
place that's rejection proof.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.110
And then I learned that
rejection is actually

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.700
just a number.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.245
There's no mathematical
way, statistical way for you

00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:51.780
to have an idea and get rejected
by everyone in the world.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.590
No way.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.420
No matter how crazy, how
good or how bad you idea is.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.070
You'll find someone who
would agree with you.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.790
And it's true.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:07.010
And I just learned a few
days ago J.K. Rowling, her

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.610
work "Harry Potter"
was rejected 12

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.920
times before the first
publisher would take it.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.260
And it was because of the
chairman's granddaughter.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.500
She insisted on it.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.400
It was like, this has got
to be-- Grandpa, please.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.480
But think about if she quit any
of the 12 times when she got

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.790
rejected.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.550
We would not know who won the
fight between Harry Potter

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.940
and Voldemort, right?

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.772
And we wouldn't know he existed.

00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:37.960
No wait, he doesn't exist.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.490
But anyway, we would
not be introduced

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.390
with that amazing world.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:49.700
And there's also you think
about Abraham Lincoln.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.900
We heard the story that he
got rejected eight times

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.670
before he was elected
a president, right?

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.515
He lost in the election, local
election, state election,

00:25:57.515 --> 00:25:58.570
the national election.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.950
Then he became the president.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.490
But what I was interested
was the movie "Lincoln".

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.560
Last year, it almost
won the Oscar's.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.100
It came in second, I think.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.700
The director, Steven
Spielberg, he actually

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.800
tried to convince
Daniel Day Lewis

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.670
three times before the actor
would say yes to be Lincoln.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.130
He got rejected three times.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.680
All right, this is not some
up-and-comer in Hollywood.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.470
This is Steven f-ing Spielberg.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.390
And he can get
rejected three times.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.130
But every time
instead of saying,

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.190
how can you say no to me?

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.690
He actually re-wrote the script,
completely re-built the script,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.300
and went back to
Daniel Day Lewis.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.440
It's like, so does this work?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.450
It's like oh, thank
you for doing this.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:46.960
It's great.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.710
But for some reason, I can't.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.590
He went back, re-wrote it again.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.220
He did that three times.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.420
And in the end, the
movie was a masterpiece.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:03.390
And lastly rejection is
nothing more than opinion.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.110
I feel the world
needs many things.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:10.650
It needs more trees
and love and sympathy.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.450
Definitely more free
drinks and bathrooms.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.760
Google has that
covered, I'm sure.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.700
But one thing we'll have
plenty of is opinions.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.390
Everyone has them,
and they're more than

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.210
willing to give you for free.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.680
But somehow, when
they get rejected,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.420
rejection is really nothing
more than the preferences

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.930
and opinion of the rejector.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.620
It actually says
more about the person

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.720
who'll give the rejection than
the person who receives it.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.820
It's about the fear,
how he grew up,

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.840
his opinion, his preferences.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.520
It's about that person.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.800
It's a lot about that person.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.650
But somehow, we twisted it.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.740
When we get rejected,
we think about that

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.770
as some sort of objective
truth about who we are.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.610
And we take it so personally.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.740
Rejection is really
like chicken.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.630
It's either yummy or yucky,
depends on how you cook it.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.810
But it's the fear of rejection
that really cripples us.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:13.070
So much so that we're more
willing to reject ourselves so

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.530
others wouldn't reject us.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.780
Have you had idea
that you thought

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.950
is a really cool idea
that you want to try it.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.700
But you thought, this
is kind of far-fetched.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.230
There's no way
it's going to work.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.850
Or maybe you take it out.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.180
You ask for opinions.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.359
People tell you,
that's a stupid idea.

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:32.400
That's not going to work.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.490
Then you're like, OK
that's not going to work.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.260
Then maybe a few years later,
you saw someone else did it.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.230
You'll start kicking yourself.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:44.225
Or a more common example,
have you had a crush on a girl

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:48.440
or see a girl or
guy that you like

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.710
that you're afraid to
ask that person out

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.070
because you don't
want to get rejected.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.480
I heard people writing
me this email a lot.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.670
They're like, I know this
girl and, oh my gosh,

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.210
I'm leaving school
in about two months.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.110
What do I do?

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:09.180
I feel like I'm not going
to see her again afterward.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.420
And then you don't do it.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.636
And you thought
about what's it like?

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.790
You always fantasize,
oh, what it's like

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.930
if my life I spent
with that person?

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.304
Actually I had these thoughts.

00:29:20.304 --> 00:29:21.970
Sometimes I have those
thoughts as well.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:31.480
But the thing is when
whatever happens,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.850
you have to leave no regret.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.010
You have to keep
asking for things

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.440
so you don't get rejected.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.460
So you don't leave regrets
saying, would that ever happen?

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.500
I've never heard of
one person who actually

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.520
say I regret trying something.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.110
I regret asking someone out.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.690
I regret making this initiative,
making that conversation.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.300
I haven't heard it.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:02.010
So I learned a lot
about things-- business,

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:06.300
communication, sales through my
rejection therapy for 100 days.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.560
It's actually amazing the
body of knowledge, actually,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.670
I'm rang into.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:16.920
Because I have a camera, I
talk to a stranger and asking

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.990
something crazy.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.340
I started learning
it's like, wow.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.170
Actually, if I do
with this-- and I

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.910
started analyzing other
people's reaction.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.450
I found actually
you can say things,

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:36.130
you can act a certain way, and
get people to say yes to you.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.017
I'm going to write
this in the book "What

00:30:39.017 --> 00:30:40.600
I Learned From 100
days of Rejection".

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.460
I'll just share one thing.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.510
For example, we thought
about sales, right?

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.220
We thought about
sales is about maybe

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.800
trying to convince other people.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.050
Trying to do something.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.310
Trying to buy something.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.280
We watch movie like
"Glengarry Glen Ross", right?

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.690
There's, "Always be closing,"
you know the rah rah talk.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.820
Actually I found that to be
the opposite of my experience.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.530
When that company I'm trying
to be closing something, trying

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.050
to convince someone
to do something,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.290
I started feeling anxious.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.480
I started trying to
analyze the reaction.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.650
I started trying to say
things I didn't mean.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.160
I started becoming who I'm not.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.440
So instead of actually
trying to convince someone,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.856
I learned I try to make a good
argument, make a good case.

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:28.480
They sound like
they're pretty similar.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.813
They're actually very different.

00:31:29.813 --> 00:31:32.190
Because the metrics, one,
is on the other person.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.430
You get a yes or a no.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.920
The other one is for myself.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.100
I can totally
control what I say.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.920
I can totally control
my body posture.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.340
I control my confidence.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.840
I cannot control that person
say yes or no because that's his

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.610
preference and opinion.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.250
But I found out if I focus
on who I am and what I do,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.910
I'm liberated by other
people's opinion.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.130
I'm liberated by this
desire to get a yes.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.360
And it turned out, I
will get more yeses.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.500
In this 100 days,
I got almost 50%

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.990
yes with no matter
how crazy I went.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:11.250
This is just one small things I
learned and they're a lot more.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.820
But I'm actually start to
work with some professionals,

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.880
and sales professionals, and
people in customer service

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.400
about how actually to turn
this into helping them

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.900
to not be afraid
of which rejection,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.880
how to be better salesperson.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.800
But the most important thing
I learned are just two words.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.180
Just ask.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.850
Just ask.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:38.410
Remember I told you I asked
the pilot to fly his plane?

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.567
When I think about
flying, they I

00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.150
think about going
through the airport,

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.260
and taking off my belt, and
make sure my pants don't drop.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.580
And I walk through that
cancer-inducing bone scanner.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.210
And charging my phone
on the dirty carpet.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.080
That's what I
think about flying.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.020
But that day, I had the
best flight of my life.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.170
I've never forget it.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.770
For a minute I was two
feet above the cornfield.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.260
I was just skimming through.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.720
I felt like I was a seagull.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.120
I was looking for
fish above ocean.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.550
And then the next minute,
I was 1,000 feet into air.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.750
I felt like an eagle.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.780
And all this time, I just kept
looking back and thought, wow.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.360
What if I didn't ask?

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.290
What if I wasn't crazy
that day and asked

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:28.380
them to fly someone's plane when
I have no permit or nothing?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.720
I would have none of this.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.630
Then I thought about my life.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.070
What if I didn't ask?

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.730
Or people who write me emails,
what if they didn't ask?

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.280
Companies might not be built.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.830
Or they might be
quit prematurely.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.230
Art might not be shared and
appreciated by the world.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:53.310
And lifesaving treatment might
be delayed or not even happen.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.260
When we think
about rejection, we

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.380
think about as something
so negative, so terrifying.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.880
So by actively avoiding that
rejection, by not asking,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.380
we're avoiding a
negative feeding

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.370
so it's and positive, right?

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.020
That's actually a lie.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.219
That's a lie that people
say to themselves every day.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.429
I say that to myself too.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:19.080
But I learned that if I'm not
going out there and getting

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.380
rejected on a daily basis,
I'm actually rejecting myself.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.840
And as a result, I'm getting
ignored by the world.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.269
I might get rejected,
I might get accepted.

00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:33.560
I won't let someone else do it.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.659
Not myself.

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:40.210
As a result, I will not
let the world ignore me.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.920
So what's next for me?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.159
This "100 Days of Rejection",
I've completed it.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.130
I am actually writing a book.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.087
I just not too long
ago I got a book deal.

00:34:52.087 --> 00:34:53.420
It will come out until the 15th.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.490
But that's actually
not the most important.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.170
Like writing a book,
being and inspirational

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.050
speaker or keynote speaker.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.270
That's actually
just sounds good.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.040
But what I really want to do is,
when I think about rejection--

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.930
now I know what a
rejection-- is I start

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.430
thinking about
rejection in history.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.120
And I found that
the people who made

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.560
the most impact in the
world in this history

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.550
are the people who get
rejected, sometimes violently.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:30.180
We think about Mahatma Gandhi,
Martin Luther King, Jr,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.940
Nelson Mandela,
even Jesus Christ.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.560
They met the most violent
and gruesome rejection

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.140
in the world.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.520
But in turn, they made history.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.050
They changed history.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:46.010
And I want to do that as well.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.920
Remember I wrote this letter?

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.500
I said I want to
conquer the world

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.030
and be like next Bill Gates?

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.540
Actually I don't want to
conquer the world anymore.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.090
I want to make it better.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.930
I want to find a new
world in this world

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.050
where no one is
afraid of rejection.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.510
I want to see what it's like.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.380
I want to see, out
of this curiosity,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:11.190
I want to see how many more
lives will be fulfilled.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.900
I want to see how many more
ideas will be realized.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.140
How many love stories
will be written.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.910
I want to see that world.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.150
Being an entrepreneur
is not about making

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.420
a whole lot of money
or having a cool idea.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.330
It's about finding a
need and developing

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.300
solution for that need.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.490
And by accident, I found
one of the biggest need

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:36.650
in the world which is
we're afraid of rejection.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.700
And I want to find
a solution for it.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.400
Now, I'm at Google.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.220
This is where the
smartest people are.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.420
And I'm going to give
you two challenges.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.160
One is-- I, personally,
I will write a book,

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.890
and I will continue blogging.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.040
I'll be a speaker.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.830
But you know what?

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.760
Deep down, I'm a technology guy.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.860
That's why I quit my job before.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.570
I want to build the
greatest technology company.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.770
I want to ask you for ideas.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:11.020
How can I use technology
to develop solutions

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.291
so people are not
afraid of rejection?

00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:15.790
It's not just, yeah
let's do a game.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:16.506
Let's do an app.

00:37:16.506 --> 00:37:17.880
It's actually what
are the goals?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.880
How can I actually
make that happen?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.420
How can I encourage people?

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.650
And two, if you have
friends or loved ones,

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.110
or family members who's
also afraid of rejection,

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.870
share my story with them.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.370
Just tell them that this guy
actually so scared of rejection

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.420
he went out there for 100 days.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.360
In the end he changed his life.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.500
Share story with them
and see how they react.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.620
And it's going to help.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.770
It's going to help.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.710
If it doesn't help, buy
them a box of doughnuts.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.430
It will always help.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.860
All right, thank you.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:38:00.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.020
JIA JIANG: Yeah, I guess
I have a few minutes

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:09.120
to do a quick Q&amp;A. So if
you have any questions,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.591
let me know.

00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:11.090
Go ahead.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:11.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.618
JIA JIANG: Right.

00:38:12.618 --> 00:38:13.700
How do I record?

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.130
I own a iPhone.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.940
The thing about iPhone
is it's small, right?

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:23.010
So I hang it on my chest and
I don't actively hide it.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.050
I just hang it there.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.090
And so most people
will think it's just

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.200
an iPhone that I would
listen to music to.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.350
But actually, when they
ask me, I always tell them.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.680
So--

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.700
Why didn't I try to be an
entrepreneur in Beijing?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.750
Do you know what Beijing
was like in 1995?

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.830
It's different from
Silicon Valley.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.140
A lot has changed.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.650
But I learned where
Bill Gates is.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.942
And actually I thought,
I might knock on his door

00:38:49.942 --> 00:38:51.150
and be his partner something.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:55.510
But America has
this-- if you want

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.960
to be technology entrepreneur
you had this dream of coming

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.630
to the US and
making that happen.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:04.380
So that's why I
wanted to come here.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.450
Go ahead.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.300
Yeah, so the
question is if I get

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.672
rejected, most of
the things I've done

00:39:09.672 --> 00:39:11.380
are not going to be
life-changing things.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.720
They're going to be like,
rather if it didn't happen,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.070
it's OK, right?

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.960
Well first of all, it's hard to
have life changing rejections.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.730
A hundred of them.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.865
But I see this as in like
practicing basketball.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.830
The games are won and
lost not on the court when

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.540
they're 20,000 people watching.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.270
It's in the dark gyms where
you are practicing free throws.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:43.560
And I see the courage
and I see the gumption

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.060
to ask these questions,
not to be afraid.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.510
It's almost like a muscle.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.280
You have to keep practicing.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.960
So I use these type of
things to practice myself.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.390
And you can try some of them.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.080
These are the things, some
of them are just frightening.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.510
Like small things, am I going
to lose my live after this?

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.470
No, it's not.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.670
But before you do it,
it's actually frightening.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.120
But gradually I found
out, toward the end,

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.215
I'm not afraid of
asking anything.

00:40:08.215 --> 00:40:09.470
I'll ask anyone anything.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.370
I'm not afraid.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.060
But at beginning, I
was a different person.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.170
So I see this as a practice.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:20.250
I see this as a course for
myself to develop more courage.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.130
Go ahead.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.800
That's actually a
very good observation.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:32.400
The thing is-- OK, the question
is what about a sports analogy.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.710
In baseball, you take a swing.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.720
You might miss and, I
guess, strike out, right?

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.250
In basketball, sometimes
you take shots or you pass.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.321
When do you pass?

00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:42.320
When do you take a shot?

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.560
Is that the question?

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.320
So I feel like instead of
worrying about making shots,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.090
instead of worrying about strike
outs, I worry about my form.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.460
I worry about my mentality.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.940
I worry about the posture
when I stand up plate.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.190
I worry about making
the best decision when

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.770
the ball comes to me.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.650
And in basketball, I worry
about in that situation,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.040
should I shoot or should I pass?

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.260
So it's not about
getting that score.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.400
That's not my metrics.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.066
I worry about making
the right decision.

00:41:17.066 --> 00:41:20.250
And somehow, this
rejection therapy thing,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.410
after I'd done
this for 100 days,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.530
I started making decisions
a lot more clearer.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.240
Because in the past,
when you are afraid,

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.710
we are wanting to win so bad,
you want to get a yes so bad,

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.340
you started trying to--
it does cloud your mind.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.650
You started trying things
that you didn't mean.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.910
But now, I learned
that I actually

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.800
don't care about yes or no.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.770
I care about making
the right decision.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:50.700
So I think that's how I would
answer that sports analogy.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.200
Go ahead.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.116
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:52.116 --> 00:41:53.950
JIA JIANG: Absolutely.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.540
The comment is I
should be talking

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.050
about doing this more on a
more academic approach, right?

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.100
Doing more research and
experiments, and with test

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.930
groups, and find the
right sample size,

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:10.170
and start experimenting
to see how it would work.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:10.820
Actually, yeah.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.440
That's in my plan.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.410
A couple of things.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.236
One is the most thing
that I know is my story.

00:42:17.236 --> 00:42:18.360
I know this from firsthand.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.440
I know the impact it made on me.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.184
And I know the impact it made on
the people who actually go out,

00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:24.350
and they saw what I'm doing.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.470
They start trying this.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.150
And they came back to me
to say, this is amazing.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.010
That's a lot anecdotal evidence.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.750
And that's actually
very strong evidence.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.920
I see this in the
mirror every day.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.890
But as you were
mentioning, as someone

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.830
who wants to develop
technology, this

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.020
is highly crucial
to me to someday

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.630
to actually be able
to do the research,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.160
be able to have the data
to back it up as well.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.420
So it's not just anecdotal.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.320
Here and there.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.030
So the question is
when I get rejected,

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.710
how do I repair myself?

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.040
One is I see rejection
differently now.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.870
I used to think you equate
rejection with a failure.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.590
And I use to equate
rejection as something

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.400
that says bad about me.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.340
But now, because of how I
see rejection differently,

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.530
I get rejection I almost laugh
at it, almost celebrate it.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.860
Just because, again it says
more about that person than me.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.260
In fact, I found that
rejection, actually,

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.640
is a lot a way to
qualify that person.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.430
Do I want to do business
with that person?

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.300
My goal, I found, is not
trying to convince someone

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.020
who doesn't like me,
doesn't like my stuff.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.300
My goal is to find a person
who is open to my idea,

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.460
and then to try that.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.620
And I don't get hurt anymore
because of how I see rejection.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.289
And also I should start
trying to celebrate it.

00:43:51.289 --> 00:43:52.080
And here and there.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.590
Go ahead.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:57.850
So the question is what do with
my kids with the rejection,

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:58.350
right?

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.820
So that's a great question
because the rejection

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.920
is so relevant in any area.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.759
Parenting is a huge area, right?

00:44:06.759 --> 00:44:08.550
You don't want to get
rejected by your kid.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.860
But you ought to have
your kid to learn

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.280
how to deal with rejection.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.880
Because I feel like
in modern society,

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.620
especially in a rather
affluent upper middle class

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.270
or middle class,
that our goal is we

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:23.710
try to make the kids feel good.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:26.490
That's our only goal, trying to
feed him and make them happy.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.590
I think that's important.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.130
But also one very
highly important thing

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.790
for being a parent, what I
learned from my experience

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.210
is I actually need to
expand his comfort level.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.080
I need to tell him
that it's OK to get no.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.630
Actually, why don't you go out
and keep trying and getting

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:44.330
no's.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.940
And I wish I've done
this when I was eight

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.500
instead of when I was 30.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.730
So I hope it answers question.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.710
Yeah, I do.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:45:00.170
Because the whole thing
is to look for rejection

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.800
by ridiculous request.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.610
But when I get there, I
try my best to negotiate.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.414
And I have again, I've
developed a body of language.

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:09.830
There's a couple
things I learned.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.112
For example, when
someone's saying no to you,

00:45:12.112 --> 00:45:14.070
instead of turn around,
instead of just looking

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.420
for a place a hide, you
actually start a conversation.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.852
You ask why.

00:45:18.852 --> 00:45:20.060
Why would you say no to that?

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.330
And sometimes the why is a lot
more important than the what.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:28.380
If you can find out the reason,
and if you started negotiating,

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.810
started trying to tackle
the reason he has fear,

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.270
it turned out more
than likely they

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.540
would come back and say yes.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:39.050
And sometimes they think
you are crazy asking this.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.530
That's why I did say no to this.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.800
But then when you
start talking, it's

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.175
like, huh, this
guy looks normal.

00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:44.070
He's very respectful.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.460
Let's talk about this.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.060
So you have a style.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:56.750
And also there are things like
when someone said no to you,

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.120
one of the ways, you can
actually provide alternatives.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.800
Ask them, what about this?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.440
If you can't do this,
what about that?

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.630
And then what I
learned is sometimes

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.970
when the people start
collaborating with you, instead

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.730
of negotiating, instead
of sitting across table,

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:17.090
if you sit on the same side
and trying to tackle a problem,

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.910
the solution is actually
better than what

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.360
you thought you would get.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.170
Because that person
has the expertise.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.251
And he has a resource
that you need.

00:46:25.251 --> 00:46:25.750
All right?

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.250
Go ahead.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.410
So the question is as
a Chinese American,

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:34.810
how culturally does that
have an impact on me?

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.180
This is very deep question.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.140
I actually got
this question a lot

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.961
with especially people
international, like immigrants,

00:46:42.961 --> 00:46:45.210
first generation immigrants
or even second generation.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.780
They send me letters saying,
wow, what you're doing

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.360
is great.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.580
But actually, what's more
awesome is you're actually

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.490
are talking to white people
and black people and every one.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:59.402
And to me, that's actually
to allow deeper issue

00:46:59.402 --> 00:47:00.360
on cultural difference.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.000
Because someone wrote
me letter saying,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.630
I'm afraid to talk
to people that's

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.880
not my race because my
mom told me don't ever

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.450
talk to a black guy or white
guy because they have guns.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:14.760
I literally heard this.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.420
And that sounds
laughable, right?

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.030
But when you are told like
this in the beginning, when

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.950
you are young, it
does have an influence

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.740
of how you behave in the future.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.060
Even subconsciously.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.530
Even now you think is laughable.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.380
Even your colleagues are
people from different race

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.730
and culture.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.810
So what I have
found is deep down,

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.790
I can't believe
how similar we are.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.162
Yes, people look different.

00:47:39.162 --> 00:47:40.620
Yes, they have
different languages.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.120
Yeah, they're from
different places.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.370
But deep down, we
have the same fear.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:47.660
We have same aspiration which
is we just want to do better.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.160
Right?

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.900
We want to do better.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.380
Mostly, we are kind.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.470
So I started looking
past the race.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.890
I started looking
past the culture.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.610
Actually, it never
started with me

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.500
that looking at people
who are different.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.860
I just see people
are human beings.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.030
And in that way,
the connection is

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:08.300
a lot stronger than I thought.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.010
Great point.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.610
So the question is
he wants to think

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.574
about things in the other side.

00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:15.990
It hurts to get rejected, but
what about rejecting others?

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:20.630
And I found how unwilling
people are to reject you.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.380
I found firsthand.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.550
Because people are generally
nice, it's hard to say no.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.890
And then I learned
in few instances

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:33.700
where someone said no to
me, but the way they said it

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.277
make me a fan of them.

00:48:35.277 --> 00:48:37.360
And this has a big implication
in customer service

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.010
because in customer service
you got to say no all the time.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:43.370
You can't just say
yes to every request.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:46.610
But how do you say no
and improve your brand?

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.070
That's very important.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.390
So it's a couple things.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:55.010
Instead of saying
no, make it upfront.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.940
We can't do this.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:59.750
And tell them why you cannot
do this and be very honest.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:02.750
We can't do this because
of here are the reasons.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.390
But here's how you
can get to a yes.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.596
There are alternatives, and
they're a path to a yes.

00:49:10.596 --> 00:49:11.720
And here's what you can do.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.330
Now you put the ball into
the other person's court.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:15.930
And it's on him to
actually fulfill

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.800
those requirements to get a yes.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.340
So it is tough to
give a no sometimes.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.960
But if you learn
how to do it, you

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.680
can do it and still
make people like you.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.980
No and because when I do
it, I'm very respectful.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.490
And I don't expect a yes.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.530
And I don't come
in and I would say,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:40.210
I will make you feel
bad if you say no to me.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.510
This is what I
learned very early

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:45.130
is I don't want put
people in a situation

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.570
where they would feel
bad saying no to me.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.450
I want to make it like,
it's OK to say no.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.940
It's really OK to say no.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.010
I'm all about having this
playful spirit when I do this.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.590
In a lot of cases I
actually become friends

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.700
with these people,
strangers I met.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.380
And some of them are
like-- for example Jackie

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.100
from Krispy Kreme who did this.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.340
I talked to her many
times after this.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.860
And she was grateful that I
would ask this kind of question

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.150
because it's like,
my job is boring.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:14.750
Like, I would love to
be challenged like this.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.080
Just come on out.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.530
I hope everyone tell me
to make something good.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.710
Yeah the most
common reason people

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:26.340
fear rejection is they
take it very personally.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.520
It sounds very easy.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.170
We talk about research.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:35.930
The fear of rejection goes way
back to our hunter gathering

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:40.070
states where you get rejected
by your tribe, well you're out.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.140
And you cannot
survive on your own.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.250
Right and that fear stayed
with us for over the centuries,

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.930
over the millenniums.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.020
We in here know
actually the people

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.549
done study in their
brain and they're

00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:56.090
both psychological
and physiological.

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.876
They find out when
you get a no, the pain

00:50:58.876 --> 00:51:00.250
is the same type
of pain that you

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:04.300
will get if you're kicked
somewhere or get hit somewhere.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.970
So it's psychological
but physical reaction

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:08.619
is the same as physical.

00:51:08.619 --> 00:51:09.410
RACHEL O'MARA: Yes.

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.710
JIA JIANG: OK.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:10.010
All right.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.510
Thank you.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:15.783
[APPLAUSE]
