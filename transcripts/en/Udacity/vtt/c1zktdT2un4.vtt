00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.710
Matt, what are you doing? Crafts?

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.400
&gt;&gt; no, I'm actually working on a demonstration for random selection.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.380
I have selected some beads to represent the people. And I have

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.840
three different colors. Red, white and blue representing a single trait.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.930
But I have three different versions: the red, white and blue version.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.060
&gt;&gt; But why did you put them in the bottle?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.050
&gt;&gt; Well, the bottle is representative of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.070
the whole population of people living in a

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.510
region, for example. We have roughly equal

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.840
frequencies of all the colors in our population,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.480
though there's a slight increase in the number of

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.930
red individuals living at this sort of top of

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.400
the bottle. Now, for this representative of random selection,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.480
we need an event to happen that's completely random.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.250
&gt;&gt; How about a meteor?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.650
&gt;&gt; A meteor, that sounds great. So a meteor strike

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.760
is coming to earth, and it comes in this region and.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.400
Now notice what happened, is all these people, oops a couple

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.830
are still trying to survive there. Everybody that survived ran away

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.630
and got away from the meteor. And those that weren't able

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.310
to run fast enough stayed in the bottle, and unfortunately they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.610
didn't survive. And so, the people who survive were able to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.379
run away due to the glass dish, and those that couldn't,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.430
still here in the, in the bottle. Unfortunately these didn't survive.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.820
And what I want you to notice, if we see here,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.480
is that, tell me the frequency difference between the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.170
individuals in the bottle and those in the glass dish.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like most of the red

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.200
survived, but not as many blue and white beads did.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.990
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's because there was a change

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.600
in the allelic frequency due to a random selection event.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, the bottleneck effect.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.990
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You can see here we represented that quite literally.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.770
And so, those in the bottle didn't survive,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.650
we changed the allelic frequency. More red in the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.640
dish, those that survive. And now we have

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.920
a change that resulted from a completely random event.
