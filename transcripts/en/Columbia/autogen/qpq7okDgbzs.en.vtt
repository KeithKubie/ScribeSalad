deeper what jazz musicians did in the

deeper what jazz musicians did in the
 

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.030
deeper what jazz musicians did in the
beginning and still do is they use these

you're seeing so not only did you see
the rehearsal you saw the dress

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.090
the rehearsal you saw the dress
 

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.190
the rehearsal you saw the dress
rehearsal and also the performance right

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200
rehearsal and also the performance right

unfolding that's what jazz is

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:35.770
 

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.250
so you guys might want to sit relax

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:39.260
so you guys might want to sit relax
 

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.169
so you guys might want to sit relax
gonna so I'm gonna share a little bit of

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:44.179
gonna so I'm gonna share a little bit of
 

00:27:44.179 --> 00:27:45.730
gonna so I'm gonna share a little bit of
neuroscience with you and try to make a

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:45.740
neuroscience with you and try to make a
 

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.250
neuroscience with you and try to make a
connection to between thought and art in

connection to between thought and art in
 

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.320
connection to between thought and art in
general and I think we'll try and bring

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:53.330
general and I think we'll try and bring
 

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.580
general and I think we'll try and bring
it closer to jazz via Chris's expertise

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:56.590
it closer to jazz via Chris's expertise
 

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.039
it closer to jazz via Chris's expertise
so the way I think about it I've already

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:00.049
so the way I think about it I've already
 

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:02.680
so the way I think about it I've already
introduced the concept that our brains

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:02.690
introduced the concept that our brains
 

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.110
introduced the concept that our brains
are undergo a kind of directed

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120
are undergo a kind of directed
 

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.390
are undergo a kind of directed
exploration now I'm going to say that we

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:07.400
exploration now I'm going to say that we
 

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.100
exploration now I'm going to say that we
do that in situations where it's not

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.110
do that in situations where it's not
 

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.080
do that in situations where it's not
even obvious let me give you an example

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.090
even obvious let me give you an example
 

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.310
even obvious let me give you an example
I mean I'm gonna what I'm gonna bring

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320
I mean I'm gonna what I'm gonna bring
 

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.539
I mean I'm gonna what I'm gonna bring
you through our two concepts about

00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:16.000
you through our two concepts about
prediction and resolution and time is an

mean so here's a picture

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.690
mean so here's a picture
 

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.810
mean so here's a picture
my son thirty years ago and I'm gonna

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:22.820
my son thirty years ago and I'm gonna

fool your brains into seeing some motion

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.130
fool your brains into seeing some motion
 

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.730
fool your brains into seeing some motion
now this is just a film loop but most of

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:27.740
now this is just a film loop but most of
 

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.460
now this is just a film loop but most of
you are seeing him kind of expand yeah

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:30.470
you are seeing him kind of expand yeah
 

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.820
you are seeing him kind of expand yeah
here's another one same same starting

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:33.830
here's another one same same starting
 

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.440
here's another one same same starting
picture but it's a four frame loop and

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:35.450
picture but it's a four frame loop and
 

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.850
picture but it's a four frame loop and
you're probably seeing clockwise

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860
you're probably seeing clockwise
 

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.090
you're probably seeing clockwise
rotation Y without getting into details

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.100
rotation Y without getting into details
 

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.450
rotation Y without getting into details
because we know something about how the

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:43.460
because we know something about how the
 

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.159
because we know something about how the
brain processes motion and we put a

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:45.169
brain processes motion and we put a
 

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:47.590
brain processes motion and we put a
little energy out there that you will

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600
little energy out there that you will
 

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.419
little energy out there that you will
interpret as a little bit of motion and

00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:49.429
interpret as a little bit of motion and
 

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:51.070
interpret as a little bit of motion and
then what the brain does is it doesn't

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080
then what the brain does is it doesn't
 

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.690
then what the brain does is it doesn't
just process it it doesn't just do

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:52.700
just process it it doesn't just do
 

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.159
just process it it doesn't just do

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:46.660
I think in the interest of time I might
 

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.330
I think in the interest of time I might
show this illusion to you at the end if

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:48.340
show this illusion to you at the end if
 

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.590
show this illusion to you at the end if
we have time that we can get back to the

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600
we have time that we can get back to the
 

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.080
we have time that we can get back to the
music a little quicker now sorry we'll

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.090
music a little quicker now sorry we'll
 

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.600
music a little quicker now sorry we'll
come back to them time I would argue

00:29:59.600 --> 00:29:59.610
come back to them time I would argue
 

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:04.560
come back to them time I would argue
time is really the key to thought now in

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:04.570
time is really the key to thought now in
 

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.080
time is really the key to thought now in
my lab when we study decision-making and

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.090
my lab when we study decision-making and
 

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.840
my lab when we study decision-making and
we do this by recording from neurons and

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:09.850
we do this by recording from neurons and
 

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:14.100
we do this by recording from neurons and
brains of animals what we noticed is

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.110
brains of animals what we noticed is
 

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.200
brains of animals what we noticed is
that in the big parts of the brain that

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.210
that in the big parts of the brain that
 

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.120
that in the big parts of the brain that
connect the sensory information to the

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.130
connect the sensory information to the
 

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.680
connect the sensory information to the
what are we going to do about it in

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:22.690
what are we going to do about it in
 

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.330
what are we going to do about it in
other words as I said before the stuff

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:24.340
other words as I said before the stuff
 

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.370
other words as I said before the stuff
of thought that intervenes between

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:26.380
of thought that intervenes between
 

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.620
of thought that intervenes between
information processing and actually

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:28.630
information processing and actually
 

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.510
information processing and actually
using that information believing in it

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:30.520
using that information believing in it
 

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.580
using that information believing in it
deciding that these neurons have a sense

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:35.590
deciding that these neurons have a sense
 

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.310
deciding that these neurons have a sense
of time in fact we just have a paper

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320
of time in fact we just have a paper
 

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.580
of time in fact we just have a paper
that came out today about this topic and

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:40.590
that came out today about this topic and
 

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.630
that came out today about this topic and
it's kind of interesting that they have

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640
it's kind of interesting that they have
 

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.770
it's kind of interesting that they have
a sense of time they don't have time

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:43.780
a sense of time they don't have time
 

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.630
a sense of time they don't have time
sense and like a clock does they have a

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640
sense and like a clock does they have a
 

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.850
sense and like a clock does they have a
time sense in an anticipation way okay

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860
time sense in an anticipation way okay
 

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.830
time sense in an anticipation way okay
so again the sense that something is

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840
so again the sense that something is
 

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.010
so again the sense that something is
predicted to occur in the near future

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020
predicted to occur in the near future
 

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:59.220
predicted to occur in the near future
say I'm ganas playing a note and I have

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.230
say I'm ganas playing a note and I have
 

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.690
say I'm ganas playing a note and I have
a sense because his time sense is so

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:00.700
a sense because his time sense is so
 

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.030
a sense because his time sense is so
amazing that the next one's gonna come

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.040
amazing that the next one's gonna come
 

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.950
amazing that the next one's gonna come
at some point but we're he swings it a

at some point but we're he swings it a
 

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.360
at some point but we're he swings it a
little bit and it's a little bit delayed

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.370
little bit and it's a little bit delayed
 

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.330
little bit and it's a little bit delayed
or a little bit anticipatory and makes

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.340
or a little bit anticipatory and makes
 

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.890
or a little bit anticipatory and makes
this you know shiver a little bit you

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:10.900
this you know shiver a little bit you
 

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.170
this you know shiver a little bit you
know it's all subtle right but what our

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:13.180
know it's all subtle right but what our
 

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.080

want to show you a very simple

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:19.780
want to show you a very simple
 

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.230
want to show you a very simple
demonstration it's the only science

thing I'm going to do really in terms of

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:23.890
thing I'm going to do really in terms of
 

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.980
thing I'm going to do really in terms of
showing you brain things but you're

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:25.990
showing you brain things but you're
 

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.600
showing you brain things but you're
going to get to hear we did title this

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:27.610
going to get to hear we did title this
 

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.220
going to get to hear we did title this
the sounds of science and one of those

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.230
the sounds of science and one of those
 

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.100
the sounds of science and one of those
sounds is that when we record electrical

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.110
sounds is that when we record electrical
 

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.320

activity from the brain we can play it

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:34.330
activity from the brain we can play it
 

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.850
activity from the brain we can play it
to you through a loudspeaker like it's

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:35.860
to you through a loudspeaker like it's
 

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.740
to you through a loudspeaker like it's
music it's not very pretty music it just

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:37.750
music it's not very pretty music it just
 

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.630
music it's not very pretty music it just
sounds like a bunch of clicks I'm gonna

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:39.640
sounds like a bunch of clicks I'm gonna
 

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.310
sounds like a bunch of clicks I'm gonna
play you that because it's a think it's

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320
play you that because it's a think it's
 

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.680
play you that because it's a think it's
a fun thing to get to listen to cells in

this is a very simple experiments

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.750
this is a very simple experiments
 

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.820
this is a very simple experiments
probably the simplest one we've ever

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:50.830
probably the simplest one we've ever
 

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.190
probably the simplest one we've ever
done in my lab and what we do is we ask

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200
done in my lab and what we do is we ask
 

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.250
done in my lab and what we do is we ask
the animal to time and interval sees a

second spot okay that's it now the thing
 

00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:08.519
second spot okay that's it now the thing
is the amount of time he's waiting for

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:08.529
is the amount of time he's waiting for
 

00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:11.489

trick we show him times that are short
 

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.749
trick we show him times that are short
like around a half a second we never

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:39.759
like around a half a second we never
 

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:41.789
like around a half a second we never
show him times around a second and we

00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799
show him times around a second and we
 

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:44.069
show him times around a second and we
also show times around two seconds so

00:32:44.069 --> 00:32:44.079
also show times around two seconds so
 

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:46.199
also show times around two seconds so
the technical term for this is a bimodal

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:46.209
the technical term for this is a bimodal
 

00:32:46.209 --> 00:32:48.119
the technical term for this is a bimodal

happens now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:32:54.989 --> 00:32:54.999
happens now what I'm going to do is I'm
 

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:56.729
happens now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you what a neuron in the

00:32:56.729 --> 00:32:56.739
going to show you what a neuron in the
 

00:32:56.739 --> 00:33:00.979
going to show you what a neuron in the
brain does when when the animal knows

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:00.989
brain does when when the animal knows
 

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:04.109
brain does when when the animal knows
that it's very likely things are going

00:33:04.109 --> 00:33:04.119
that it's very likely things are going
 

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:06.599
that it's very likely things are going
to occur in that first mode something

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:06.609
to occur in that first mode something
 

00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:08.009
to occur in that first mode something
around a second and what I'm going to do

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:08.019
around a second and what I'm going to do
 

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.359
around a second and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you a case where

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:09.369
is I'm going to show you a case where
 

00:33:09.369 --> 00:33:11.489
is I'm going to show you a case where
you had to wait around for a second and

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:11.499
you had to wait around for a second and
 

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:13.769
you had to wait around for a second and
a half and what I hope you hear I'm kind

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:13.779
a half and what I hope you hear I'm kind
 

00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:17.039
a half and what I hope you hear I'm kind
of I'm sort of leading the witness here

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:17.049
of I'm sort of leading the witness here
 

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:18.869
of I'm sort of leading the witness here
but what I hope you hear is that the

00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:18.879
but what I hope you hear is that the
 

00:33:18.879 --> 00:33:20.639
but what I hope you hear is that the
activity of this neuron these clicks

00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:20.649
activity of this neuron these clicks
 

00:33:20.649 --> 00:33:21.989
activity of this neuron these clicks
you're going to hear on the loudspeaker

00:33:21.989 --> 00:33:21.999
you're going to hear on the loudspeaker
 

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.940
you're going to hear on the loudspeaker
if everything works right are going to

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:23.950
if everything works right are going to
 

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.039

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:26.049
increase in frequency and intensity as
 

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:29.219
increase in frequency and intensity as
if the brain is is anticipating this the

if the brain is is anticipating this the
arrival of this go signal that's listen

00:33:39.619 --> 00:33:39.629
 

00:33:39.629 --> 00:33:41.909
the increase in the frequency a bit like

00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919
the increase in the frequency a bit like
 

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.469
the increase in the frequency a bit like
a crescendo but it's more of a crescendo

00:33:43.469 --> 00:33:43.479
a crescendo but it's more of a crescendo
 

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:45.389

away now let's consider another one now

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919
away now let's consider another one now
 

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:49.619
away now let's consider another one now
we go to that other context and in this

00:33:49.619 --> 00:33:49.629
we go to that other context and in this
 

00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:52.289
we go to that other context and in this
context the animal knows that time

00:33:52.289 --> 00:33:52.299
context the animal knows that time
 

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:54.299

either of those times and once again
 

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.609
either of those times and once again
we're going to ask okay what happens if

00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:02.619
we're going to ask okay what happens if
 

00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:04.109
we're going to ask okay what happens if
he's sitting around waiting for one of

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:04.119
he's sitting around waiting for one of
 

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:05.579
he's sitting around waiting for one of
those long times what's the brain doing

00:34:05.579 --> 00:34:05.589
those long times what's the brain doing
 

00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:07.589
those long times what's the brain doing
as the waiting is going on and again

00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:07.599
as the waiting is going on and again
 

00:34:07.599 --> 00:34:09.149
as the waiting is going on and again
just to sort of feed you the intuition

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159
just to sort of feed you the intuition
 

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.460
just to sort of feed you the intuition
is that maybe anticipating

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:11.470
is that maybe anticipating
 

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:14.099
is that maybe anticipating
early but if that doesn't come then stop

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:14.109
early but if that doesn't come then stop
 

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:15.810
early but if that doesn't come then stop
anticipating and then anticipate again

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:15.820
anticipating and then anticipate again
 

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.810
anticipating and then anticipate again
so kind of a triphasic rise fall rise

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:18.820
so kind of a triphasic rise fall rise
 

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.629
so kind of a triphasic rise fall rise
again okay so see what see if you can

00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639
again okay so see what see if you can
 

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.849
again okay so see what see if you can
hear that in this recording of a neuron

00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:23.859
hear that in this recording of a neuron
 

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:36.599

in the brain came up it went down and it

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:36.609
in the brain came up it went down and it
 

00:34:36.609 --> 00:34:39.000
in the brain came up it went down and it
came up again everyone okay so that's

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.010
came up again everyone okay so that's
 

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.760
came up again everyone okay so that's
what you're hearing is a cell in the

what you're hearing is a cell in the
 

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.560
what you're hearing is a cell in the

brain that's keeping track of time
 

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.260
brain that's keeping track of time
why because keeping track of time is

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:46.270
why because keeping track of time is
 

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.030
why because keeping track of time is
what makes us be able to think it makes

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040
what makes us be able to think it makes
 

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.980
what makes us be able to think it makes
us infer cause and effect as a child

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:49.990

something hits the floor and then the

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:51.940
something hits the floor and then the
 

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.349
something hits the floor and then the
noise comes okay and so forth or you did

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359
noise comes okay and so forth or you did
 

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.940
noise comes okay and so forth or you did
something silly and then the pain comes

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:56.950
something silly and then the pain comes
 

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.800
something silly and then the pain comes
okay so we have to learn about the

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:58.810
okay so we have to learn about the
 

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.170
okay so we have to learn about the
structure of time and I would say that

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:01.180
structure of time and I would say that
 

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.609
structure of time and I would say that
in general time is sort of the core of

00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619
in general time is sort of the core of
 

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.780
in general time is sort of the core of
higher brain function and I'm going to

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:06.790
higher brain function and I'm going to
 

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.089
higher brain function and I'm going to
say in a moment the aesthetic so I like

00:35:09.089 --> 00:35:09.099
say in a moment the aesthetic so I like
 

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:11.660
say in a moment the aesthetic so I like
to think about the this secret of

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.120
thought of cognition or really many many
many mental processes is a kind of

many mental processes is a kind of
 

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.240
many mental processes is a kind of

lots of things it's true when we looked
at that movie of the rotating baby okay

there was some sense that our brains

there was some sense that our brains
were led to predict something and it was

were led to predict something and it was
 

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.990
were led to predict something and it was
the fulfillment of that prediction that

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000
the fulfillment of that prediction that
 

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.030
the fulfillment of that prediction that
led us to in this case the illusory

on this and that is the the the step

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:10.360
on this and that is the the the step
 

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.710
on this and that is the the the step
that's missing into my mind that gets us

you had an answer prepared about what

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.210
you had an answer prepared about what
 

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:41.420
you had an answer prepared about what
your favorite color was and you didn't

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:41.430
your favorite color was and you didn't
 

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.800
your favorite color was and you didn't
expect that that's what I was going to

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:42.810
expect that that's what I was going to
 

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.410
expect that that's what I was going to
ask you to do so you actually had to

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420
ask you to do so you actually had to
 

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.120
ask you to do so you actually had to
form a duet and interact with one

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:47.130
form a duet and interact with one
 

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.800
form a duet and interact with one
another

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:47.810
another

another
that's what jazz musicians do when they

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:50.250
that's what jazz musicians do when they
 

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.210
that's what jazz musicians do when they
play they have to get to that place the

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220
play they have to get to that place the
 

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.310
play they have to get to that place the
only difference is is our conversation

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:55.320
only difference is is our conversation
 

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.200
only difference is is our conversation
is with five separate people

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.210
is with five separate people
 

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.540
is with five separate people
simultaneously as opposed to just one

00:46:59.540 --> 00:46:59.550
simultaneously as opposed to just one
 

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:08.600

sitting next to you so maybe we should

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:08.610
sitting next to you so maybe we should
 

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.050
sitting next to you so maybe we should
play another tune and do you guys want

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060
play another tune and do you guys want
 

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.700
play another tune and do you guys want
to clap while we play no please don't do

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:13.710
to clap while we play no please don't do
 

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.980
to clap while we play no please don't do
that but but maybe we could do something

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:15.990
that but but maybe we could do something
 

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.890
that but but maybe we could do something
else though and see the band these guys

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900
else though and see the band these guys
 

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.490
else though and see the band these guys
I mean you know these these people are

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500
I mean you know these these people are
 

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.070
I mean you know these these people are
just incredible and they communicate I

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:25.080
just incredible and they communicate I
 

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.030
just incredible and they communicate I
don't know if you heard all the

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040
don't know if you heard all the
 

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.160
don't know if you heard all the
communication going on in turnaround the

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.170
communication going on in turnaround the
 

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.380
communication going on in turnaround the
tune we played first but we'll play a

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:30.390
tune we played first but we'll play a
 

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.740
tune we played first but we'll play a
slower tune now right and and see if you

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:33.750
slower tune now right and and see if you
 

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.440
slower tune now right and and see if you
can catch the back-and-forth and the

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:36.450
can catch the back-and-forth and the
 

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.930
can catch the back-and-forth and the
exchange of ideas that goes on during

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940
exchange of ideas that goes on during
 

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:39.680
exchange of ideas that goes on during
this tune

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:39.690
this tune
 

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.840
this tune
it's a Thelonious Monk tune called round

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:41.850
it's a Thelonious Monk tune called round
 

00:47:41.850 --> 00:54:17.850
it's a Thelonious Monk tune called round
about midnight

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:17.860
 

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.290
well do any of you have any questions

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:20.300
well do any of you have any questions
 

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.590
well do any of you have any questions
you'd like to ask about the band about

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:23.600
you'd like to ask about the band about
 

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.140
you'd like to ask about the band about
the music about what happens other

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:26.150
the music about what happens other
 

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:27.730
the music about what happens other
neuroscience anything you like anything

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:27.740
neuroscience anything you like anything
 

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.560
neuroscience anything you like anything
that's on your mind thank you that was

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:32.570
that's on your mind thank you that was
 

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:43.570
that's on your mind thank you that was
very nice yeah great yeah I'm just

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:43.580
very nice yeah great yeah I'm just
 

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.840
very nice yeah great yeah I'm just
curious so you you discussed this idea

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:46.850
curious so you you discussed this idea
 

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:50.170
curious so you you discussed this idea
of one of the basis of cognition being I

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:50.180
of one of the basis of cognition being I
 

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.790
of one of the basis of cognition being I
think the term used was freedom from

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:51.800
think the term used was freedom from
 

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.530
think the term used was freedom from
immediacy right

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:53.540
immediacy right
 

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.900
immediacy right
whereas I felt like what Chris was

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:55.910
whereas I felt like what Chris was
 

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:58.780
whereas I felt like what Chris was
saying about his about music and about

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:58.790
saying about his about music and about
 

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:00.880
saying about his about music and about
you know what he feels when he plays

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:00.890
you know what he feels when he plays
 

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:02.710
you know what he feels when he plays
music is almost the exact opposite of

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720
music is almost the exact opposite of
 

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.710
music is almost the exact opposite of
that is a freedom to engage in sort of

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720
that is a freedom to engage in sort of
 

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.260
that is a freedom to engage in sort of
the immediacy of the experience so I was

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:08.270
the immediacy of the experience so I was
 

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.640
the immediacy of the experience so I was
wondering if you could talk a little bit

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:09.650
wondering if you could talk a little bit
 

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:14.890
wondering if you could talk a little bit
about that and well I think that the two

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:14.900
about that and well I think that the two
 

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.770
about that and well I think that the two
are compatible I mean the what allows us

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:17.780
are compatible I mean the what allows us
 

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.880
are compatible I mean the what allows us
to use the information at various levels

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:21.890
to use the information at various levels
 

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.370
to use the information at various levels
not just the next beat the measures the

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:24.380
not just the next beat the measures the
 

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:28.990
not just the next beat the measures the
phrases the section the cadence is using

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000
phrases the section the cadence is using
 

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.970
phrases the section the cadence is using
the past in order to inform where we

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:30.980
the past in order to inform where we
 

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.230
the past in order to inform where we
hope the future is going to go including

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240
hope the future is going to go including
 

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.940
hope the future is going to go including
when we're creating the future with an

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:33.950
when we're creating the future with an
 

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:36.010
when we're creating the future with an
improvisation now of course I think

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:36.020
improvisation now of course I think
 

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.420
improvisation now of course I think
Chris is just spot-on

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:37.430
Chris is just spot-on
 

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.420
Chris is just spot-on
with the idea that we have to do that in

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:40.430
with the idea that we have to do that in
 

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:44.560
with the idea that we have to do that in
time in music and we in a sense

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:44.570
time in music and we in a sense
 

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.770
time in music and we in a sense
experience its so immediately in the now

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:47.780
experience its so immediately in the now
 

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.500
experience its so immediately in the now
that it just you know it brings us right

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:50.510
that it just you know it brings us right
 

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.600
that it just you know it brings us right
there there's no it's there's something

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:52.610
there there's no it's there's something
 

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.430
there there's no it's there's something
very special I think Chris rose to the

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440
very special I think Chris rose to the
 

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.020
very special I think Chris rose to the
challenge what's special about jazz and

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:56.030
challenge what's special about jazz and
 

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.430
challenge what's special about jazz and
what's special about jazz it makes it

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440
what's special about jazz it makes it
 

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.070
what's special about jazz it makes it
different from literature or you know

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.080
different from literature or you know
 

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.630
different from literature or you know
having a conversation with your friend

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640
having a conversation with your friend
 

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.100
having a conversation with your friend
and all of these things happen when we

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.110
and all of these things happen when we
 

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.630
and all of these things happen when we
do that doing mathematics we have a

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640
do that doing mathematics we have a
 

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.820
do that doing mathematics we have a
sense of completion we complete it we

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:06.830
sense of completion we complete it we
 

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.350
sense of completion we complete it we
work through the proof later in our mind

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:08.360
work through the proof later in our mind
 

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.090
work through the proof later in our mind
it had a sense of completion before we

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:10.100
it had a sense of completion before we
 

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.400
it had a sense of completion before we
started yeah but there's something very

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:12.410
started yeah but there's something very
 

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.830
started yeah but there's something very
special about jazz where things are

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:14.840
special about jazz where things are
 

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.440
special about jazz where things are
really right there then I don't know I I

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:17.450
really right there then I don't know I I
 

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.780
really right there then I don't know I I
don't get to do this very much and I

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:19.790
don't get to do this very much and I
 

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:21.160
don't get to do this very much and I
mean to be able to play with these guys

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:21.170
mean to be able to play with these guys
 

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.990
mean to be able to play with these guys
it's just like it's such an incredible

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000
it's just like it's such an incredible
 

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.340
it's just like it's such an incredible
treat you have no idea I watched these

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:24.350
treat you have no idea I watched these
 

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.790
treat you have no idea I watched these
guys in clubs all the time but that's

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:26.800
guys in clubs all the time but that's
 

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.250
guys in clubs all the time but that's
what they're doing it with the sounds

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:30.260
what they're doing it with the sounds
 

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.730
what they're doing it with the sounds
and the idea is it's just it's it just

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:33.740
and the idea is it's just it's it just
 

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.800
and the idea is it's just it's it just
takes you to a different place and I

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:35.810
takes you to a different place and I
 

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.150
takes you to a different place and I
mean so thank you guys because you've

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160
mean so thank you guys because you've
 

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.280
mean so thank you guys because you've
just taken me to a different place so I

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:39.290
just taken me to a different place so I
 

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:44.110
just taken me to a different place so I
also I also think that to respond to

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:44.120
also I also think that to respond to
 

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.020
also I also think that to respond to
your question is that I love to disagree

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.030
your question is that I love to disagree
 

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:48.910
your question is that I love to disagree
with Mike but I actually we have to

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920
with Mike but I actually we have to
 

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.550
with Mike but I actually we have to
think about two different sets senses of

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:51.560
think about two different sets senses of
 

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.560
think about two different sets senses of
immediacy because one thing that I've

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:53.570
immediacy because one thing that I've
 

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.240
immediacy because one thing that I've
learned with my conversations that Mike

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:55.250
learned with my conversations that Mike
 

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.340
learned with my conversations that Mike
is the time in the neuroscience sense

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:57.350
is the time in the neuroscience sense
 

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:59.710
is the time in the neuroscience sense
it's a little bit different than what

00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720
it's a little bit different than what
 

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.560
it's a little bit different than what
