studies at Brown University and the
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.940
studies at Brown University and the
whole summit has been a fascinating

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
whole summit has been a fascinating
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.220
whole summit has been a fascinating
exercise in thinking about how

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
exercise in thinking about how
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.289
exercise in thinking about how
government leaders corporate leaders and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
government leaders corporate leaders and
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.050
government leaders corporate leaders and
civil society leaders are able to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
civil society leaders are able to
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080
civil society leaders are able to
collaborate and imagine not just new

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
collaborate and imagine not just new
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.840
collaborate and imagine not just new
solutions to existing problems but even

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
solutions to existing problems but even
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.980
solutions to existing problems but even
think about the ways in which we can

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
think about the ways in which we can
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070
think about the ways in which we can
rethink what the problems are and I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
rethink what the problems are and I
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.050
rethink what the problems are and I
think one of the most interesting things

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
think one of the most interesting things
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.630
think one of the most interesting things
for me as an academic is to think about

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
for me as an academic is to think about
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389
for me as an academic is to think about
the place of the university as such as

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
the place of the university as such as
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880
the place of the university as such as
one of the enterprise's within civil

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
one of the enterprise's within civil
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180
one of the enterprise's within civil
society within government and within the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
society within government and within the
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.729
society within government and within the
corporate sector I just came from a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
corporate sector I just came from a
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.229
corporate sector I just came from a
session on corruption and one of the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
session on corruption and one of the
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.330
session on corruption and one of the
things that that suggests is that we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
things that that suggests is that we
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.200
things that that suggests is that we
each tend to think about the diagnosis

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
each tend to think about the diagnosis
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.990
each tend to think about the diagnosis
of corruption and the solution to

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000
of corruption and the solution to
 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.060
of corruption and the solution to
corruptions problems mainly through our

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
corruptions problems mainly through our
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.910
corruptions problems mainly through our
own lens and so the ways in which we can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
own lens and so the ways in which we can
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.369
own lens and so the ways in which we can
think about how to move beyond our

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
think about how to move beyond our
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830
think about how to move beyond our
existing frames it's one of the ways in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
existing frames it's one of the ways in
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.880
existing frames it's one of the ways in
which we can make a difference that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
which we can make a difference that
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330
which we can make a difference that
here's the key issue how can we think

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
here's the key issue how can we think
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.840
here's the key issue how can we think
about corruptions address without

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
about corruptions address without
 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
about corruptions address without
invoking a hypocritical stance this is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
invoking a hypocritical stance this is
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969
invoking a hypocritical stance this is
the key issue that comes not only from

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
the key issue that comes not only from
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460
the key issue that comes not only from
the discussion here but obviously from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
the discussion here but obviously from
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.200
the discussion here but obviously from
the discussions in the north of Africa

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
the discussions in the north of Africa
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.409
the discussions in the north of Africa
so this is a good start
