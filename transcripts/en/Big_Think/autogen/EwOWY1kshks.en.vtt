taking in the information and what do we
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.520
taking in the information and what do we
really need to live our lives more

librarians but what's interesting for me
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.229
librarians but what's interesting for me
is that the forays are applicable to all

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239
is that the forays are applicable to all
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.840
is that the forays are applicable to all
of them and what they are is any new

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850
of them and what they are is any new
 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.239

what information is here I want people

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269
what information is here I want people
 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.910
what information is here I want people
to go beyond the four corners of what

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
to go beyond the four corners of what
 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.700
to go beyond the four corners of what
they think they see so this is what's in

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710
they think they see so this is what's in
 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.319
they think they see so this is what's in
front of me this is where I am

front of me this is where I am
 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.809
front of me this is where I am
ask someone yes this is my situation

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819
ask someone yes this is my situation
 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.729
ask someone yes this is my situation
here's where I am this is what I see is

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
here's where I am this is what I see is
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.590
here's where I am this is what I see is
there something here I might be missing

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600
there something here I might be missing
 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.440
there something here I might be missing
because by asking someone else we

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450
because by asking someone else we
 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.270
because by asking someone else we
realize that no two people see anything

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280
realize that no two people see anything
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.340
realize that no two people see anything
the same way so of course that doesn't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350
the same way so of course that doesn't
 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.109
the same way so of course that doesn't
work all the time but if you're in an

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119
work all the time but if you're in an
 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.999
work all the time but if you're in an
office situation if you're in a medical

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009
office situation if you're in a medical
 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.859
office situation if you're in a medical
situation and you have the opportunity

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869
situation and you have the opportunity
 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.030
situation and you have the opportunity
to collaborate you'll get the biggest

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040
to collaborate you'll get the biggest
 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.190
to collaborate you'll get the biggest
picture of your assessment if you ask

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
picture of your assessment if you ask
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.139
picture of your assessment if you ask
other people what they see as well the

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
other people what they see as well the
 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.730
other people what they see as well the
second step is to analyze the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740
second step is to analyze the
 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.010
second step is to analyze the
information that's where you break it

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020
information that's where you break it
 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.499
information that's where you break it
down and you say what's important what

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509
down and you say what's important what
 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.600
down and you say what's important what
do I need to prioritize what's most

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
do I need to prioritize what's most
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.819
do I need to prioritize what's most
important and what don't I really have

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829
important and what don't I really have
 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.580
important and what don't I really have
to worry about at all I find that when

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
to worry about at all I find that when
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.740
to worry about at all I find that when
you make a mental list in your head okay

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
you make a mental list in your head okay
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.690
you make a mental list in your head okay
here's my situation and you divide it

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700
here's my situation and you divide it
 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.920
here's my situation and you divide it
into two categories information I need

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
into two categories information I need
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.959
into two categories information I need
information I might need an information

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969
information I might need an information
 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.999
information I might need an information
I definitely don't need and for the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009
I definitely don't need and for the
 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.200
I definitely don't need and for the
information that you definitely don't

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210
information that you definitely don't
 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.230
information that you definitely don't
need put it away because our brains are

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240
need put it away because our brains are
 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.990
need put it away because our brains are
so cluttered with so much information

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
so cluttered with so much information
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.999
so cluttered with so much information
that if you can from the outset get rid

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009
that if you can from the outset get rid
 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.880
that if you can from the outset get rid
of some information do it but keep that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890
of some information do it but keep that
 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.980
of some information do it but keep that
middle category information that you

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990
middle category information that you
 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.020
middle category information that you
might need because you might not have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030
might need because you might not have

you might be have to draw on it when you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280
you might be have to draw on it when you
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.370
you might be have to draw on it when you
don't realize that it's important it

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380
don't realize that it's important it
 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.630
don't realize that it's important it
could become more important as the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640
could become more important as the
 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.479
could become more important as the
process goes on and then the third a I

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
process goes on and then the third a I
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.100
process goes on and then the third a I
think is actually the most important

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110
think is actually the most important
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.030
think is actually the most important
it's how you articulate what you observe

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
it's how you articulate what you observe
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.070
it's how you articulate what you observe

idea of putting into words what your
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.820
idea of putting into words what your
observations are is the most important

because I tell all my groups I don't
know why this is but something gets lost

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600
know why this is but something gets lost
