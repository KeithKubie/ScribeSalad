00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.570
We already know a good
bit about exponents.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.930
For example, we know
if we took the number 4

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.770
and raised it to
the third power,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.590
this is equivalent
to taking three fours

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.040
and multiplying them.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.670
Or you can also view it
as starting with a 1,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.600
and then multiplying the 1
by 4, or multiplying that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.470
by 4, three times.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.850
But either way, this is
going to result in 4 times 4

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.050
is 16, times 4 is 64.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.210
We also know a little bit
about negative exponents.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.810
So for example, if I were take
4 to the negative 3 power,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.830
we know this negative
tells us to take

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.280
the reciprocal 1/4 to the third.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.050
And we already know
4 to the third is 64,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.250
so this is going to be 1/64.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.470
Now let's think about
fractional exponents.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.712
So we're going to think about
what is 4 to the 1/2 power.

00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:51.295
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:54.550
and at least take a guess
about what you think this is.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.031
So, the mathematical
convention here,

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.530
the mathematical definition
that most people use, or in fact

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.190
that all people use here,
is that 4 to the 1/2 power

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.200
is the exact same thing
as the square root of 4.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.190
And we'll talk in the
future about why this is,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.023
and the reason why this
is defined this way,

00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:15.760
is it has all sorts of
neat and elegant properties

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.090
when you start manipulating
the actual exponents.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.590
But what is the
square root of 4,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.950
especially the
principal root, mean?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
Well that means,
well, what is a number

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.362
that if I were to
multiply it by itself,

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:31.070
or if I were to have
two of those numbers

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310
and I were to multiply
them, times each other,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.240
that same number,
I'm going to get 4?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.210
Well, what times
itself is equal to 4?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.150
Well that's of
course equal to 2.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.560
And just to get a sense of why
this starts to work out, well

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.460
remember, we could
have also written

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.400
that 4 is equal to 2 squared.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
So you're starting to see
something interesting.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.420
4 to the 1/2 is equal to
2, 2 squared is equal to 4.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.310
So let's get a couple
more examples of this,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.110
just so you make sure
you get what's going on.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.515
And I encourage you to pause
it as much as necessary

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:11.370
and try to figure
it out yourself.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130
So based on what
I just told you,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.385
what do you think 9 to the
1/2 power is going to be?

00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:19.010
Well, that's just
the square root of 9.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.412
The principal root of 9, that's
just going to be equal to 3.

00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:23.870
And likewise, we
could've also said

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.830
that 3 squared is, or
let me write it this way,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.160
that 9 is equal to 3 squared.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.150
These are both true statements.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.350
Let's do one more like this.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.900
What is 25 to the
1/2 going to be?

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.430
Well, this is just
going to be 5.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.655
5 times 5 is 25.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:47.602
Or you could say, 25
is equal to 5 squared.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:50.060
Now, let's think about what
happens when you take something

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.310
to the 1/3 power.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.280
So let's imagine taking
8 to the 1/3 power.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.380
So the definition here
is that taking something

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.270
to the 1/3 power
is the same thing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.535
as taking the cube
root of that number.

00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:11.660
And the cube root is just
saying, well what number,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.390
if I had three of that
number, and I multiply them,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.970
that I'm going to get 8.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.990
So something, times something,
times something, is 8.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.980
Well, we already know that 8 is
equal to 2 to the third power.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.690
So the cube root of
8, or 8 to the 1/3,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.176
is just going to be equal to 2.

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:29.550
This says hey,
give me the number

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.680
that if I say that number, times
that number, times that number,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.080
I'm going to get 8.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.490
Well, that number is 2 because
2 to the third power is 8.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.250
Do a few more examples of that.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.220
What is 64 to the 1/3 power?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.390
Well, we already know that
4 times 4 times 4 is 64.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.100
So this is going to be 4.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.285
And we already wrote over here
that 64 is the same thing as 4

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:56.027
to the third.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.610
I think you're starting to see
a little bit of a pattern here,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.650
a little bit of symmetry here.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.370
And we can extend this idea to
arbitrary rational exponents.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.630
So what happens if I were
to raise-- let's say I had,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.240
let me think of a good number
here-- so let's say I have 32.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.451
I have the number 32, and I
raise it to the 1/5 power.

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:25.950
So this says hey,
give me the number

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.450
that if I were to
multiply that number,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.360
or I were to repeatedly
multiply that number five times,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.460
what is that, I would get 32.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.270
Well, 32 is the same thing as
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.170
2.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.920
So 2 is that number, that
if I were to multiply it

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.150
five times, then
I'm going to get 32.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.770
So this right over here
is 2, or another way

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.790
of saying this kind of same
statement about the world

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.280
is that 32 is equal to
2 to the fifth power.
