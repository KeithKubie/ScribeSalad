00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.830
Next, we're going to travel
all the way to Baltimore to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.211
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health to speak with Dr.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.220
Gerard Anderso.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.030
A professor there and the first
author of the paper I site more than

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.570
any other during this course, The Rising
Tide of Chronic Disease in America.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.760
Gerard, thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.300
It's a thrill to meet you.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; I'm glad to be here.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; Great.
A decade ago, you and

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.974
your colleague Jane published
what I view as a seminal paper,

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.400
A Growing Version of
Chronic Disease in America.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.286
The students of the course,
if they've been paying attention,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.814
are quite familiar with it by now.

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:43.149
And, it opened my mind to
the aggregate problem of

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.272
chronic disease in a way that really,
no previous paper had done.

00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:52.511
Which is why I view it the way I do.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:57.144
So we're ten years later,
have we made progress?

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:58.098
Where are we?

00:00:58.098 --> 00:00:59.780
&gt;&gt; Well, we have made progress.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.214
I think what you knew already is that,
you saw that patients

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:07.687
of that chronic disease, but you didn't
know how many patients there were.

00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:11.855
And now, we know that there are 150
million Americans, almost one out of

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.453
every two Americans, that have one or
more chronic conditions.

00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:19.933
And that is sort of the new information
that we were trying to bring ten

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.713
years ago.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:25.167
Now what we're trying to do, now that
we have the attention of policy makers,

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.749
is to start changing In
the delivery system.

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.006
That starts with prevention, but
it goes to care and cure for

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.018
these chronic conditions.

00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:36.886
And there,
we're making a lot less progress.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:40.079
I was more optimistic ten
years ago than I am now.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.960
Most everything that we've tried
recently has just not worked very well.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.728
&gt;&gt; Well, here in the last few years,

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:52.793
we've tried to make the healthcare
industry adopt Health IT.

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:57.260
And we've tried to create
health information exchanges.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.170
We're still really early in that, but

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.366
are you optimistic that that will happen
and that it'll make a difference?

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:09.441
&gt;&gt; Well, it is happening, so
I'm very optimistic that it will happen.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.424
What I don't think we've
solved very well so

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.258
far is that dashboard
problem of a doctor.

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:18.778
I have ten minutes to take
care of a patient, and

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:21.510
she has seven things wrong with her.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.400
She's seeing nine other doctors,
and I have ten minutes.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.710
If I spend most of that time
looking at her medical record,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.400
I now have five minutes to talk to her.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.210
And so the challenge is,
how can we get that information

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.940
out to the physician in a timely
fashion for that complex patient.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.110
For the patient that only has diabetes,
it's pretty easy.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.880
But for that patient who has diabetes,
and congestive heart failure,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.980
and beginning Alzheimer's,
and arthritis Brightest.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.510
And seeing all these different doctors,
and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.550
taking lots of different medications,
that's the challenge.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.480
&gt;&gt; I hope the students remember
that comment because that's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.450
basically what we're going to talk
about in Lesson 6 of the course.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.990
&gt;&gt; Great!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.690
&gt;&gt; Well, you also mentioned incentives.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.160
Clearly, the healthcare system
has never been incented.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.220
Do you see that working?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.470
Are you optimistic that that's
actually going to happen in this

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.310
endlessly complex adaptive
healthcare system?

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.880
&gt;&gt; So I was just amazed when I
started this work in the 1990s.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.790
That Australia had tried care
coordination programs, and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.360
they had all failed.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.280
And then, I support the United States
can do it differently,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940
or the UK could do it differently.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.820
And so,
I've been looking around the world for

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780
those models and
I just don't see them yet.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:46.445
We know what we need to do which is
to get everybody on the same team,

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:50.895
probably with a nurse practitioner,
talking to all the doctors.

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:52.865
But we haven't been
able to figure it out.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:57.025
So almost all of the demonstrations
that we've tried,

00:03:57.025 --> 00:04:00.925
both in the public sector and in the
private sector, just haven't been able

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:07.070
to save money, improve outcomes,
and improve satisfaction.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.780
We just don't have very many
of those things that hit

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.090
all three of them very well.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.860
And we're still working.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.350
And so,
I'm optimistic that we will find it.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.980
But so far,
we just haven't been very successful.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.010
&gt;&gt; Your paper actually ends
on an optimistic note.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.070
You point to the re-engineering
of the healthcare system

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.020
a century ago around new
knowledge in public health.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.230
Is it so fundamentally different now
that that optimism might be misplaced?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.850
&gt;&gt; No, but I think if you read
it a little more carefully,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.300
what you'll see is I said we move
in 50 years from a system oriented

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.720
around infectious disease to one that's
oriented around acute illnesses.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.780
And then,
we got that done by about 2000.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.210
And I said it's going to
take us 50 years to reorient

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.730
the healthcare system
around chronic disease.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.322
We have to start with the evidence base.

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:07.481
We have to know how to take care of
somebody who has seven things wrong with

00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:13.060
her when the NIH and the FDA exclude
all those people from clinical trials.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.170
We don't have the educational system
in the medical schools oriented

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.540
around that.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.270
We don't have the financing.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.280
And so right now,
there isn't a real strong incentive for

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.030
hospitals and doctors to really
go after these people to take

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.290
care of them in an effective way.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.320
In fact,
because they dont know how to do it,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.990
they want to run away
from them in most cases.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.965
But this is where the money is.

00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:41.290
Two-thirds of Medicare spending
is by people with five or

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.930
more chronic conditions.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.540
We've gotta get the system right for
these people.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.730
We just don't know how to do it yet.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.010
&gt;&gt; So I can't speak to 50 years ago.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.040
But 40 years ago, I was a medical
student first getting into this.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.920
And I remember going into meetings.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.870
And they would say, well,
here's where we are.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.130
And if these trends continue, and we
don't do anything, by right about now,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.430
health care will be consuming 20%
of the gross domestic product,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.390
a number that's absolutely
not sustainable.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.730
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Now, I've seen projections

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.940
from OMB and others that if we don't
do anything, it'll be 40% in 50 years.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.000
Do we have 50 years?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.830
&gt;&gt; Well, when I started working and

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.720
trying to control healthcare costs in
the 1970's, I said that we'll never

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.710
be able to sustain 10%
on GDP on healthcare.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.540
Now, it's close to 20.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.630
So, I've stopped making
projections as to whether or

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.130
not we can afford to do something.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.220
What we know is that by
the time it gets to almost 30%,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.550
which isn't that far along,
almost all the growth in the economy.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.050
All the productivity growth
in the economy will, in fact,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.560
go to support the growth in healthcare,
and that's probably not sustainable.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.380
But, we don't know what's
going to turn this ship around.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.170
Maybe it's IT.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.430
Maybe it's changing
the financial incentives.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.980
But since everybody's making so

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.710
much money in healthcare and
jobs are important and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.470
financial security is important,
it's going to be a really tough change.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.220
&gt;&gt; So, many of us speculate that

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.790
eventually with our
backs against the wall

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.750
we'll adopt a single payer system
like every other country on Earth.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.470
You think that's going to
happen here in the US?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.630
&gt;&gt; I was more optimistic
in the 90s than I am today.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.230
Basically, Americans love choice.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.190
All you have to do is go to the grocery
store and go down the cereal aisle.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.610
&gt;&gt; And look at 40 to 100
different choices of cereal.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.910
Whereas if you go to France,
you will see two or three in most cases.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.760
Choice is what makes America, and

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.920
it's going to be really hard to get the
private insurance industry out of it.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.810
We can't even get right now many
of the states to embrace Medicaid.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.465
So, if they can't embrace Medicaid,
which is free money.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:09.965
To them, why would we think that
they would go to a single pair?

00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:11.575
I mean, I think it makes sense.

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:15.795
It means that we pay a lot more for
healthcare than other industrialized

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:21.270
countries because of this choice, but
America seems to really like choice.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.640
Well, thank you very much.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.820
It's been a pleasure.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.370
&gt;&gt; And maybe we'll be able to get
together in ten more years and

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.790
see what's happened.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.770
&gt;&gt; Hopefully,
it'll be more optimistic that time.
