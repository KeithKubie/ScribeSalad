so there's two main parts to the
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.050
so there's two main parts to the
University there's the research

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
University there's the research
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.920
University there's the research
enterprise and there's the educational

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930
enterprise and there's the educational
 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.390
enterprise and there's the educational
enterprise and I definitely see both

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
enterprise and I definitely see both
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.949
enterprise and I definitely see both
parts of it changing a lot in the next

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959
parts of it changing a lot in the next
 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.020

decade or so so speaking about the

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030
decade or so so speaking about the
 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.019
decade or so so speaking about the
educational Enterprise it's not enough

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
educational Enterprise it's not enough
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000
educational Enterprise it's not enough
for people to learn the skills that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
for people to learn the skills that
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609
for people to learn the skills that
they're learning today as valuable as

they're learning today as valuable as
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.710

they may be but it's it's going to be
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.849
they may be but it's it's going to be
very important for them to learn

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
very important for them to learn
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560
very important for them to learn
innovation skills that enable them to

innovation skills that enable them to
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.560
innovation skills that enable them to
better communicate their ideas and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
better communicate their ideas and
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780

is that it's because they lack the

it's a three course sequence unlike any

it's a three course sequence unlike any
other program that we're aware of and we

other program that we're aware of and we
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.160
other program that we're aware of and we
think it's really really valuable for

keep them as researchers and at the
cutting edge of their field and that's

goal is to become the absolute best in a
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.940
goal is to become the absolute best in a
discipline and there have been some

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
discipline and there have been some
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.640
discipline and there have been some
criticisms that academics don't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
criticisms that academics don't
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410
criticisms that academics don't
understand the bigger picture or they

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
understand the bigger picture or they
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120
understand the bigger picture or they
don't they're too specialized the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
don't they're too specialized the
 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.710
don't they're too specialized the
reality is if you're going to be the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
reality is if you're going to be the
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050
reality is if you're going to be the
absolute best you have to be very

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
absolute best you have to be very
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970
absolute best you have to be very
specialized but that doesn't preclude

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
specialized but that doesn't preclude
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.620
specialized but that doesn't preclude
you from understanding how to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
you from understanding how to
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750
you from understanding how to
communicate with others that can take

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
communicate with others that can take
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.200
communicate with others that can take
your idea and make it into something

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210
your idea and make it into something
 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.600
your idea and make it into something
really impactful so it's sort of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610
really impactful so it's sort of
 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.760
really impactful so it's sort of
bridging that gap by making both the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770
bridging that gap by making both the
 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.590
bridging that gap by making both the
academics aware and then of course we'd

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
academics aware and then of course we'd
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.930
academics aware and then of course we'd
like to focus on the the business

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
like to focus on the the business
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.400
like to focus on the the business
community as well to bring them closer

community as well to bring them closer
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.250
community as well to bring them closer
to academia

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
 
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.800
 
there's a lot of changes that are

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810
there's a lot of changes that are
 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.479
there's a lot of changes that are
happening now that are really going to

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489
happening now that are really going to
 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.619
happening now that are really going to

increasingly in open access journals and
 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.930
increasingly in open access journals and
in fact I think they've been about 5,000

new open access journals that have
popped up online in the last couple

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
popped up online in the last couple

and that's really having that will have

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620
and that's really having that will have
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.830
and that's really having that will have
some significant effect I think in the

some significant effect I think in the
 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.479
some significant effect I think in the
future and it's not just a matter of

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
future and it's not just a matter of
 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.379
future and it's not just a matter of
open access to the papers but also

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389
open access to the papers but also
 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.360
open access to the papers but also
there's been a greater drive towards

there's been a greater drive towards
 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.180
there's been a greater drive towards
open access towards the the data itself

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.170
controversial because there's definitely
an interest by faculty with all the work

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
an interest by faculty with all the work
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.509
an interest by faculty with all the work
that they put into collecting that data

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519
that they put into collecting that data
 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.420
that they put into collecting that data
and this has been a challenge for for a

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
and this has been a challenge for for a
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.180
and this has been a challenge for for a
while but it's exacerbated by this new

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190
while but it's exacerbated by this new
 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.580
while but it's exacerbated by this new
open access is how do you get the get to

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590
open access is how do you get the get to
 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.710
open access is how do you get the get to
benefit from your own data that you've

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720
benefit from your own data that you've
 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.220
benefit from your own data that you've
worked so hard to collect and then and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230
worked so hard to collect and then and
 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.069
worked so hard to collect and then and
publish on so how long is it appropriate

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079
publish on so how long is it appropriate
 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.050
publish on so how long is it appropriate
to hold back that data before you share

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060
to hold back that data before you share
 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.879
to hold back that data before you share
it with other people obviously the

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889
it with other people obviously the
 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.920
it with other people obviously the
sooner you get the data out there the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930
sooner you get the data out there the
 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.930
sooner you get the data out there the
more people will benefit and at the same

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940
more people will benefit and at the same
 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.750
more people will benefit and at the same
time you need to motivate faculty to be

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760
time you need to motivate faculty to be
 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.189
time you need to motivate faculty to be
collecting that data in the first place

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199
collecting that data in the first place
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.629
collecting that data in the first place
and so that's that will be an

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639
and so that's that will be an
 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.300
and so that's that will be an
interesting thing to see also digital

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
interesting thing to see also digital
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.029
interesting thing to see also digital
scholarship is changing the output of

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039
scholarship is changing the output of
 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.439
scholarship is changing the output of
research so it used to be that you can

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449
research so it used to be that you can
 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.180
research so it used to be that you can
do some research you can write it up in

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190
do some research you can write it up in
 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.870
do some research you can write it up in
a thesis or a paper publish it or put it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880
a thesis or a paper publish it or put it
 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.240
a thesis or a paper publish it or put it
on a bookshelf and and that was your

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
on a bookshelf and and that was your
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.490
on a bookshelf and and that was your
publication that's not going to cut it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500
publication that's not going to cut it
 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.439
publication that's not going to cut it
anymore you have digital multimedia

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449
anymore you have digital multimedia
 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.570
anymore you have digital multimedia
output that how do you archive that so

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
output that how do you archive that so
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.839
output that how do you archive that so
for example we have this program this

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849
for example we have this program this
 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.360
for example we have this program this
the system that was developed at USC and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370
the system that was developed at USC and
 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.469
the system that was developed at USC and
collaboration with some other

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479

universities called hyper cities it was

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400
universities called hyper cities it was
 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.730
universities called hyper cities it was
developed by historian in fact

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740
developed by historian in fact
 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.230
developed by historian in fact
at USC and Phil ethington and what it is

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240
at USC and Phil ethington and what it is
 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.839
at USC and Phil ethington and what it is
is you can put geo rectified maps and

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849
is you can put geo rectified maps and
 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.260
is you can put geo rectified maps and
geo tagged photographs into the system

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270
geo tagged photographs into the system
 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.680
geo tagged photographs into the system
and you can look at for example I can

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690
and you can look at for example I can
 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.510
and you can look at for example I can
look at my neighborhood and then click

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520
look at my neighborhood and then click
 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.730
look at my neighborhood and then click
on a button it's a it and it goes from

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740
on a button it's a it and it goes from
 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.240
on a button it's a it and it goes from
the view from the from the sky of

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250
the view from the from the sky of
 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.089
the view from the from the sky of
satellite view down into well let's see

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099
satellite view down into well let's see
 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.089
satellite view down into well let's see
what the map looked like from 1986 now

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099
what the map looked like from 1986 now
 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.279
what the map looked like from 1986 now
let's see this other map from 1920 and

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289
let's see this other map from 1920 and
 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.689
let's see this other map from 1920 and
you realize my god there's no marina

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699
you realize my god there's no marina
 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.580
you realize my god there's no marina
there and you can really go through it's

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
there and you can really go through it's
 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.930
there and you can really go through it's
almost like going through time and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940
almost like going through time and
 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.760
almost like going through time and
seeing how things were you can look at

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770
seeing how things were you can look at
 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.129
seeing how things were you can look at
different photographs and very much in a

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139
different photographs and very much in a
 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.140
different photographs and very much in a
crowdsourcing fashion it enables other

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150
crowdsourcing fashion it enables other
 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.149
crowdsourcing fashion it enables other
historians now its platform where other

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159
historians now its platform where other
 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.120
historians now its platform where other
people can add to this archive of

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130
people can add to this archive of
 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.830
people can add to this archive of
information so it brings up some

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840
information so it brings up some
 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.360
information so it brings up some
interesting questions one of the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370
interesting questions one of the
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.529
interesting questions one of the
questions is how do you how do you store

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539
questions is how do you how do you store
 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.249
questions is how do you how do you store
and that kind of output if it's not a

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259
and that kind of output if it's not a
 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.990
and that kind of output if it's not a
piece of paper that you can put in the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000
piece of paper that you can put in the
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.600
piece of paper that you can put in the
library or you can scan in how do you

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610
library or you can scan in how do you
 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.879
library or you can scan in how do you
archive this how do you enable people to

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889
archive this how do you enable people to
 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.070
archive this how do you enable people to
access that information and if you are

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080
access that information and if you are
 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.899
access that information and if you are
allowing people to contribute to it then

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909
allowing people to contribute to it then
 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.999
allowing people to contribute to it then
how do you give proper credit to those

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009
how do you give proper credit to those
 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:19.980
how do you give proper credit to those
individuals that are contributing to

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990
individuals that are contributing to
 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.040
individuals that are contributing to
this piece of scholarship if there's now

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
this piece of scholarship if there's now
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.480
this piece of scholarship if there's now
hundreds of people that are contributing

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490
hundreds of people that are contributing
 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.459
hundreds of people that are contributing
to this so this is very different a

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469
to this so this is very different a
 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.899
to this so this is very different a
little brave new world it's different

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909
little brave new world it's different
 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.749
little brave new world it's different
from the way it was say 20-30 years ago

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759
from the way it was say 20-30 years ago
 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.439
from the way it was say 20-30 years ago
and it's going to continue to change

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449
 
 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.369
 
it is an interesting challenge that in

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379
it is an interesting challenge that in
 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.179
it is an interesting challenge that in
order to motivate people to excel and do

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189
order to motivate people to excel and do
 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.649
order to motivate people to excel and do
things it's part of human nature that

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659
things it's part of human nature that
 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.239
things it's part of human nature that
you need to there needs to be some sort

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.249
you need to there needs to be some sort
 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:50.019
you need to there needs to be some sort
of incentive so in the market economy

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:50.029
of incentive so in the market economy
 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.379
of incentive so in the market economy
it's very much based on financial

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389
it's very much based on financial
 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.799
it's very much based on financial
rewards in academia it's very much based

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:56.809
rewards in academia it's very much based
 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:00.549
rewards in academia it's very much based
on reputation and so either way there's

00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:00.559
on reputation and so either way there's
 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.369
on reputation and so either way there's
competition I do think in academia it's

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:03.379
competition I do think in academia it's
 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.350
competition I do think in academia it's
much more collaborative so I think that

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
much more collaborative so I think that
 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.579
much more collaborative so I think that
although people can criticize academics

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:09.589
although people can criticize academics
 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.249
although people can criticize academics
at times for holding back certain

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:12.259
at times for holding back certain
 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.659
at times for holding back certain
research results and it's not ideal

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669
research results and it's not ideal
 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:16.390
research results and it's not ideal
that's not optimal at the same time I do

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400
that's not optimal at the same time I do
 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.329
that's not optimal at the same time I do
think that that there is a real sense of

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:19.339
think that that there is a real sense of
 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.239
think that that there is a real sense of
collaboration and the desire to have

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:22.249
collaboration and the desire to have
 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:25.149
collaboration and the desire to have
great 22 to create great results

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159
great 22 to create great results
 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:27.939
great 22 to create great results
together but I do think that there we do

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949
together but I do think that there we do
 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.100
together but I do think that there we do
have to be collaborating more and we are

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110
have to be collaborating more and we are
 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.549
have to be collaborating more and we are
collaborating more perfect example is

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:33.559
collaborating more perfect example is
 

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:36.189
collaborating more perfect example is
the human genome project so that would

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199
the human genome project so that would
 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.170
the human genome project so that would
not have come together unless you had

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180
not have come together unless you had
 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.110
not have come together unless you had
there's many universities and

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120
there's many universities and
 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.089
there's many universities and
researchers that came together to work

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099
researchers that came together to work
 

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.939
researchers that came together to work
for the greater good on this project and

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:45.949
for the greater good on this project and
 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:48.820
for the greater good on this project and
ultimately it was clear who the big

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830
ultimately it was clear who the big
 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.339
ultimately it was clear who the big
contributors were it's really a part of

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:51.349
contributors were it's really a part of

the whole ethic is to try to be able to

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389
the whole ethic is to try to be able to
 

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.929
the whole ethic is to try to be able to
track that but there are challenges

00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:55.939
track that but there are challenges
 

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:57.939
track that but there are challenges
because if you're if you're starting to

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:57.949
because if you're if you're starting to
 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.010
because if you're if you're starting to
bring together lots of other people you

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.020
bring together lots of other people you
 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.689
bring together lots of other people you
want to make sure that you we need to

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:01.699
want to make sure that you we need to
 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:03.850
want to make sure that you we need to
make sure that we maintain that ethic

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:03.860
make sure that we maintain that ethic
 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.480
make sure that we maintain that ethic
for providing acknowledgement to the

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.490
for providing acknowledgement to the
 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.329
for providing acknowledgement to the
people who contribute we have lots of

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:10.339
people who contribute we have lots of
 

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.550
people who contribute we have lots of
big challenges ahead of us whether it's

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560
big challenges ahead of us whether it's
 

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.989
big challenges ahead of us whether it's
trying to reduce the cost of solar

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:13.999
trying to reduce the cost of solar
 

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:16.959
trying to reduce the cost of solar
energy or trying to deliver clean water

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:16.969
energy or trying to deliver clean water
 

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:21.579
energy or trying to deliver clean water
so the whole world or you know renewable

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:21.589
so the whole world or you know renewable
 

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:25.929
so the whole world or you know renewable
energy in general and global warming all

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:25.939
energy in general and global warming all
 

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:29.019
energy in general and global warming all
of these things are going to really need

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:29.029
of these things are going to really need
 

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:32.469
of these things are going to really need
to have large collaborations and I don't

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479
to have large collaborations and I don't
 

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.939
to have large collaborations and I don't
know that we've completely figured that

00:08:33.939 --> 00:08:33.949
know that we've completely figured that
 

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:36.399
know that we've completely figured that
out yet I also think that it will cause

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:36.409
out yet I also think that it will cause
 

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.709
out yet I also think that it will cause
a bit of it is just a prediction that

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719
a bit of it is just a prediction that
 

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.360
a bit of it is just a prediction that
will cause some pressure and some

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.370
will cause some pressure and some
 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.980
will cause some pressure and some
challenge for some meat from four

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:41.990
challenge for some meat from four
 

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.839
challenge for some meat from four
universities because right now

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:43.849
universities because right now
 

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:45.939
universities because right now
especially the larger elite universities

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:45.949
especially the larger elite universities
 

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:47.980
especially the larger elite universities
they have large research enterprises

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:47.990
they have large research enterprises
 

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.850
they have large research enterprises
that they can

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:48.860
that they can
 

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.310
that they can
build on and they can they can build on

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320
build on and they can they can build on
 

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.690
build on and they can they can build on
the reputation by bringing in more

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:55.700
the reputation by bringing in more
 

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.319
the reputation by bringing in more
research dollars and to be doing more

00:08:58.319 --> 00:08:58.329
research dollars and to be doing more
 

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.840
research dollars and to be doing more
exciting research and at the same time

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:01.850
exciting research and at the same time
 

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.180
exciting research and at the same time
if universities and universities are

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.190
if universities and universities are
 

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.699
if universities and universities are
collaborating more on programs then the

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:09.709
collaborating more on programs then the
 

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:11.740
collaborating more on programs then the
universities will maybe be asking

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:11.750
universities will maybe be asking
 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.690
universities will maybe be asking
themselves well how do we preserve our

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:13.700
themselves well how do we preserve our
 

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.690
themselves well how do we preserve our
brand because brand is important in that

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:16.700
brand because brand is important in that
 

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.490
brand because brand is important in that
collaboration so there needs to be the

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:21.500
collaboration so there needs to be the
 

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.860
collaboration so there needs to be the
universities as individual universities

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:23.870
universities as individual universities
 

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.800
universities as individual universities
need to have a value proposition so that

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:26.810
need to have a value proposition so that
 

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.430
need to have a value proposition so that
it's not just a place where faculty sit

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440
it's not just a place where faculty sit
 

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.980
it's not just a place where faculty sit
and get a paycheck you know it's really

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:32.990
and get a paycheck you know it's really
 

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.440
and get a paycheck you know it's really
the because faculty can take their

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.450
the because faculty can take their
 

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.150
the because faculty can take their
research and they can move to another

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160
research and they can move to another
 

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.060
research and they can move to another
place so it will put more pressure on

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.070
place so it will put more pressure on
 

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.910
place so it will put more pressure on
universities to ensure that they're

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920
universities to ensure that they're
 

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.340
universities to ensure that they're
doing their jobs and creating that

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.350
doing their jobs and creating that
 

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.680
doing their jobs and creating that
environment that innovative environment

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:47.690
environment that innovative environment
 

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.319
environment that innovative environment
that enables people to collaborate and

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:50.329
that enables people to collaborate and
 

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:52.240
that enables people to collaborate and
work together and that's really one of

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.250
work together and that's really one of
 

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.250
work together and that's really one of
the huge values of universities and a

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.260
the huge values of universities and a
 

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.860
the huge values of universities and a
place like USC for example we've been

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:56.870
place like USC for example we've been
 

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.610
place like USC for example we've been
around for almost 130 years absolutely

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.620
around for almost 130 years absolutely
 

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.769
around for almost 130 years absolutely
integral to the local community and also

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:02.779
integral to the local community and also
 

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:04.449
integral to the local community and also
within our own you know we've built up

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:04.459
within our own you know we've built up
 

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:08.259
within our own you know we've built up
this faculty over the years and that

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:08.269
this faculty over the years and that
 

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:10.210
this faculty over the years and that
enables us to get the absolute best

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:10.220
enables us to get the absolute best
 

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.759
enables us to get the absolute best
students to come through and so it's

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:12.769
students to come through and so it's
 

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:15.310
students to come through and so it's
it's based on a real foundation and we

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320
it's based on a real foundation and we
 

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.069
it's based on a real foundation and we
need to know as an example we just need

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079
need to know as an example we just need
 

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:19.990
need to know as an example we just need
to make sure that we maintain that and

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000
to make sure that we maintain that and
 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.910
to make sure that we maintain that and
we keep growing and we keep increasing

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920
we keep growing and we keep increasing
 

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.650
we keep growing and we keep increasing
that or else we're not going to be

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660
that or else we're not going to be
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.959
that or else we're not going to be
relevant
