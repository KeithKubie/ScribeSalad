00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.341
So now that we have seen
the concept of multi level caches,

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:06.887
let's see how L2 and L1 compare.

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:09.186
So which of these statements are true?

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:13.423
The L1 capacity is
less than L2 capacity.

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:18.148
The L1 latency is less than L2 latency.

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:22.812
The number of accesses that go to
L1 is is less than the number of

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:24.662
accesses that go to L2.

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:30.130
And the L1 associativity has to
be equal to L2 associativity.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.860
So again, check all of
the statements that should be true.
