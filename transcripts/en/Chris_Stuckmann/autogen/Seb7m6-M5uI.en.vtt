well but I think my biggest issue with

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
well but I think my biggest issue with
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.980
well but I think my biggest issue with
the movie is that the second act sets up

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
the movie is that the second act sets up
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.980
the movie is that the second act sets up
an arc that once the third act comes

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990
an arc that once the third act comes
 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.010
an arc that once the third act comes
which I won't spoil it makes the second

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
which I won't spoil it makes the second
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020
which I won't spoil it makes the second
act less interesting it makes the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
act less interesting it makes the
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.510
act less interesting it makes the

build-up seem rather inconsequential
 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.190
build-up seem rather inconsequential
because now that you know things that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
because now that you know things that
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.500
because now that you know things that
are going on everything that was set up

in the second act seems like it's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
