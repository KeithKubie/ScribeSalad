00:00:00.925 --> 00:00:04.008
(electronic beeping)

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:13.859
- Dr. Miller is back to speak about

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.655
adverse childhood
experiences and associations

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:18.994
with developmental disabilities.

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:19.911
Dr. Miller.

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:25.252
- Well, thank you.

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:28.439
That was a short break. (chuckles)

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.272
I will have to mention

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:34.786
that though I work for the California EPA,

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:37.181
that none of my comments today represent

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.098
the state of California in any way.

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:44.130
And as far as disclosures,

00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:47.816
I do get funding for our
pediatric environmental

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:51.796
health specialty unit
from two federal agencies,

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:52.629
the ATSDR,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.730
Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.228
is part of the CDC now,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.478
and the US EPA.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.577
And I think this is the third time

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:10.009
in about six years

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.509
that I've been honored to be invited here.

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:18.362
These are objectives that I put out.

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:20.621
This is very kind of specific things.

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:22.871
But really what I'm here is

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:25.984
to introduce issues

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.669
about the environment

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:32.146
as might be relevant to people that are

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:34.768
involved in dealing with

00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:38.393
various developmental
issues and disabilities.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:42.809
And I think it's, if I
could get some interest,

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:44.925
then what you do with that as

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:48.175
a profession or a group of professions,

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:51.299
you know, that's for you people.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.862
I don't really have
that particular answer.

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:57.725
So this is the third time around

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.322
in a few years.

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:03.072
I'd like to thank Lucy
for inviting me again.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.206
So if I do it enough times,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:08.053
one of these times I'll get it right.

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:10.249
(chuckles)

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.557
The perspective that I have,

00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:15.950
and I think I want to introduce here,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.667
is this ecologic framework for health.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.794
So this is what I would think of

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:25.100
as truly integrative medicine.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.536
So things happen that are important

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.343
from the molecular level,

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:31.398
the cellular level,

00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:34.345
organ system, and the individual,

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:36.345
but the persons involved

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.162
are nested within their family,

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.179
their home, their community,

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.428
in society in general.

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:47.095
And those influences

00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:52.212
also impact our health and interact with

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:55.532
chemical exposures that we might have.

00:02:55.532 --> 00:02:58.220
And then these events happen over

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.804
the life course.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.554
So from preconception

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:03.969
through old age,

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.875
and then even in some cases

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:09.419
there's evidence of
multi-generational impacts.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.214
Just as there are in the social world.

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:16.018
So I think that we need to be considering

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:18.696
and thinking about these things

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:19.779
as a total...

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.412
unit.

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:31.170
So one of the first concepts
that I think's important

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.114
is critical windows of development.

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.781
So there are times when children

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.375
may be particularly susceptible,

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:46.005
and the kinds of things that might impact

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:49.142
their development include nutrition,

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.892
access to healthcare,

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:54.723
social stressors including

00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:56.723
racism and other things.

00:03:58.882 --> 00:04:01.549
I think you're all familiar with

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:05.604
the adverse developmental consequences

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.717
of early major stressors in the house.

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:15.007
But finances, chemical exposures,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:17.272
educational support, et cetera.

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:21.028
These all are important and they interact.

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.504
I think that's the key.

00:04:23.504 --> 00:04:26.967
So critical windows actually occur

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.634
throughout childhood

00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:31.661
and there's windows of

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.441
vulnerability, okay?

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.079
Here's an example.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.395
This is a stress example.

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:46.062
Now these, they took adult women

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:51.081
and they went back and got information

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:54.417
about their prenatal time period

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:56.334
when they were a fetus.

00:04:57.707 --> 00:05:01.177
And they used some very simple measures

00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:03.427
to look at major stressors,

00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:07.856
ones that would not probably be

00:05:07.856 --> 00:05:09.773
remembered incorrectly.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.237
A divorce of your parents.

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:17.934
A death close in the family.

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:19.196
Refugee status.

00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:20.979
Things like that.

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.114
And then they looked at these adult women

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:25.506
and measured a number of things

00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:29.456
and they saw an increased
response to stress,

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:32.263
the hypothalamic pituitary access

00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:35.247
was functioning differently.

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:38.397
Increased reaction to stress.

00:05:38.397 --> 00:05:40.480
They had a biased toward

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:46.817
an allergic phenotype, Th2 phenotype.

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:50.984
They had increases in a bunch
of inflammatory markers.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.081
These are adult women and the thing

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:58.498
they were looking at was prenatal stress.

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:04.495
So something that happens early

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:06.995
can affect you into adulthood.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:12.535
Without showing anything before that.

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:16.341
These are bio markers
that we're looking at.

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.654
These aren't something
you're gonna see directly.

00:06:19.654 --> 00:06:22.391
And this relates to an important

00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.157
comp set called allostatis.

00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:28.078
So you're all familiar with homeostasis,

00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:31.137
how we regulate our
bodies physiologically.

00:06:31.137 --> 00:06:33.498
Well, allostatis takes that idea and says,

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:36.167
well, the way we do that is by these

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:37.584
active mechanisms

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:39.995
and that those

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.399
are how we adapt.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.213
And that's good,

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:48.934
but then think of it like
if your thyroid gland

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:51.601
may be ceasing to function well,

00:06:53.018 --> 00:06:55.771
you're able to kick out from your brain

00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:58.384
enough thyroid stimulating hormone

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:01.660
to flog your thyroid gland for awhile

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.686
and keep your thyroid
hormone levels normal.

00:07:04.686 --> 00:07:07.269
But eventually you get a goiter

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:11.323
and eventually you may end up with

00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:14.446
a not totally,
non-functioning thyroid gland.

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:16.613
So that's over the buildup

00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:21.779
over time of these adaptive mechanisms

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.785
can result in harm.

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:26.702
That's called your allostatic load.

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:30.995
And that's mediated by neuroendocrine,

00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:33.464
immune,

00:07:35.408 --> 00:07:38.495
autonomic nervous system mechanisms.

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:40.433
These are all things that are important

00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:42.066
and important for adaptation,

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.855
and it has a cost.

00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:47.855
So the person who developed this idea,

00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:51.519
largely Bruce McEwen, talks about it,

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:54.343
stress getting under your skin.

00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.139
And the results can be metabolic,

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.405
cardiovascular, immune system,

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.822
and behavioral disregulation.

00:08:02.989 --> 00:08:05.406
So neurodevelopmental things.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.984
There's also windows of opportunity.

00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:11.282
So those are vulnerability.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.782
There are times when given the

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:16.963
positive environment,

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:20.407
you might be able to mitigate
some of these issues.

00:08:20.407 --> 00:08:22.740
So one of the ways that led,

00:08:24.574 --> 00:08:26.799
caused these problems, there are multiple,

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.724
but one of the ways is by impacting

00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:33.219
the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:36.753
These are associated
with learning and memory.

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:39.203
These are glutamate receptors.

00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:40.786
And lead and stress

00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:47.442
are potent inhibitors of these.

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:50.904
So it's just to say that a chemical

00:08:50.904 --> 00:08:52.237
and stress work,

00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:56.197
not only did they have the same effect,

00:08:56.197 --> 00:08:58.262
they work by the same mechanism

00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:01.679
and they could be additive to each other.

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.769
Well, this is a beautiful experiment

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:07.269
where Tom Guilarte

00:09:09.864 --> 00:09:13.158
took rodents and he exposed them

00:09:13.158 --> 00:09:15.414
to lead at what's equivalent

00:09:15.414 --> 00:09:17.902
to 10 micrograms per deciliter

00:09:17.902 --> 00:09:20.235
in our children as neonates.

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:24.107
And then followed them to old age.

00:09:24.107 --> 00:09:25.190
So as adults,

00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:30.246
the lead exposure results in

00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:32.949
decreased number

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.543
of NMDA receptors,

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:40.547
as well as decreases
in learning and memory.

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.047
Also brain-derived

00:09:43.677 --> 00:09:45.822
neurotrophic factor.

00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:48.239
So that alone is interesting,

00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:53.059
but then he took and
divided the lead exposed

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.685
into two groups along with a control.

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:59.727
And one group he put in
an enriched environment.

00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:01.977
So for a rodent that's more

00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:05.129
other friends to play with in the cage

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:07.996
and a wheel and maybe a few other things,

00:10:07.996 --> 00:10:10.891
a little bit more handling.

00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:14.174
Those in the enriched environment

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:17.977
performed in their memory and learning

00:10:17.977 --> 00:10:20.044
the same as the controls

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:21.623
that didn't get any lead.

00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:24.290
And their NMDA receptor activity

00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:27.491
was the same as controls.

00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:28.908
So this indicates

00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:32.752
there's an opportunity during

00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:34.973
this developmental period

00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:37.063
to at least mitigate some of

00:10:37.063 --> 00:10:38.813
the negative effects.

00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:42.974
So this talk really was designed around

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:47.815
and powered around the idea
of resilience in children,

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.472
and so that's part of it,

00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:51.639
that we have opportunities

00:10:52.655 --> 00:10:54.072
to these windows,

00:10:55.611 --> 00:11:00.339
that if you let them go by
then things might be fixed.

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:03.041
So the brain-derived neurotrophic factor,

00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:06.903
same kind of picture
as that NMDA receptor.

00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:09.820
It's altered, lowered by depression

00:11:11.663 --> 00:11:13.422
and these chemicals.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.339
Methyl mercury and BPA.

00:11:17.607 --> 00:11:19.094
These are common.

00:11:19.094 --> 00:11:21.677
It's elevated by antidepressant

00:11:22.672 --> 00:11:25.048
and by physical exercise.

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:28.381
And there's studies looking at combining

00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:32.226
treatment for stroke victims

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.976
with both intensive physiotherapy

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.517
and behavioral therapy and then with

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:41.162
or without the antidepressant.

00:11:41.162 --> 00:11:45.095
The antidepressant increases this ability

00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:48.817
of the neurons to connect in a sense,

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:51.475
because that's the function of

00:11:51.475 --> 00:11:56.029
brain-derived neurotrophic
factor is neurogenesis.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:59.612
And so it helps to
increase the adaptation.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.007
Why do I bring it up?

00:12:02.007 --> 00:12:04.504
Well I think that the idea is

00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:06.004
there are chemical

00:12:07.578 --> 00:12:09.922
and social stressor factors

00:12:09.922 --> 00:12:11.869
that both interact

00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:14.410
and they're things in critical windows

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.636
when you might make some difference.

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:20.623
So how about with disabilities?

00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:21.456
What do we know?

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:22.462
Well, not a lot.

00:12:22.462 --> 00:12:25.708
The environmental health
world doesn't have,

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.335
I mean it has these kinds of things,

00:12:27.335 --> 00:12:30.874
we have this exposure that might affect

00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:32.876
attention deficit disorder incidents

00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:34.374
or something like that.

00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:35.707
But how about in

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:40.044
children or even adults

00:12:40.044 --> 00:12:42.794
that have any kind of disability?

00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:47.082
Is the exposure to methyl mercury

00:12:47.082 --> 00:12:48.631
more or less of a concern?

00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:50.678
Well, we don't really have much

00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:52.426
information on that.

00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:56.967
But here's one study that
looked at this testing

00:12:56.967 --> 00:12:59.343
in North Carolina, I believe,

00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:01.200
that they do an exit testing at

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.950
certain grade levels.

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.680
They make it really simple.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.680
This bottom line here is

00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.877
the impact of increasing your blood lead

00:13:15.877 --> 00:13:19.377
from one to five micrograms per deciliter.

00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:21.596
And these are

00:13:22.432 --> 00:13:25.984
the lower scoring on the exit exams,

00:13:25.984 --> 00:13:28.336
and these are the higher exams.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:31.724
The impact of lead on those who were

00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:34.718
already higher scoring is less than those

00:13:34.718 --> 00:13:38.287
that were in the lower scoring group.

00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:39.537
So I think that

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:44.118
to me that's an indication that

00:13:44.118 --> 00:13:46.368
yes, you should be paying attention

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.020
to some of this stuff, you know.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.597
This is potentially important.

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:52.072
So preconception, we know that people

00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:54.217
are exposed preconception.

00:13:54.217 --> 00:13:55.300
They can find

00:13:56.658 --> 00:14:00.293
PCBs, polychlorinated
biphenyls, for example,

00:14:00.293 --> 00:14:01.293
in the fluid

00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:04.081
around the egg.

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:07.079
They...

00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.083
we know that

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.401
sperm can be affected by exposure

00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:15.162
to various chemicals.

00:14:15.162 --> 00:14:18.712
In the work that I do
with childhood leukemia,

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:21.691
paternal smoking preconception

00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.017
is associated with increased risk

00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:26.503
of childhood leukemia.

00:14:26.503 --> 00:14:30.670
So that indicates there's
some germ line alteration.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.131
I think prenatal mother's health

00:14:37.131 --> 00:14:39.800
and mother's chemical exposures

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.803
we're pretty familiar with.

00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:44.426
I don't think I have to
say too much about that.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.255
But certainly nutrition,
health, and medicines

00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:48.630
are important.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.130
But here's a study

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.275
that I think is pretty impactful.

00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:56.259
They looked at chlorpyrifos,

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:58.176
which was the most used

00:14:59.417 --> 00:15:02.250
insecticide in households up until

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:04.546
around 2004

00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:07.620
when those (mumbles) were removed

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.565
partially because of these studies.

00:15:10.565 --> 00:15:13.131
But is still used in agriculture.

00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:16.099
And they measured core blood levels

00:15:16.099 --> 00:15:18.113
of chlorpyrifos

00:15:18.113 --> 00:15:20.315
and then they followed up these children

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:21.531
and then they have

00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:24.150
three and seven years of follow up.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.535
And so the more highly exposed,

00:15:26.535 --> 00:15:27.951
still this is not high.

00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.856
This is New York City residences.

00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:32.905
These are not highly exposed people.

00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:36.003
These are kind of average exposures.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.836
There were delays in psychomotor

00:15:38.836 --> 00:15:41.919
and mental developmental indexes.

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:43.086
Was related to

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:47.520
behavior checklist symptoms

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.853
of ADHD and PDD.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.391
And there were declines in working memory

00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:55.938
and full-scale IQ at seven years of age.

00:15:55.938 --> 00:15:59.191
Well that alone is concerning, right?

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:02.236
But then they did this follow up

00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:05.549
looking where they did
these functional MRIs,

00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:08.966
very sophisticated MRI kind of exam,

00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:11.119
and just looked at volume.

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.254
And there were these volumetric changes

00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:15.783
in the surface of the brain

00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:17.580
in a number of areas

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.327
in those with the higher exposures

00:16:19.327 --> 00:16:21.660
compared to lesser exposure.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.154
So remember what we
talked about with ADHD,

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:29.571
PDD, these behavioral things.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.320
So here's the areas

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.242
that there was

00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:37.742
its increase in surface matter

00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:41.476
underlying white matter largely,

00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:43.910
which according to the paper,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.211
you might possibly consider that

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:49.705
to be like scarring for some cells.

00:16:49.705 --> 00:16:53.557
But so you got the
posterior, middle temporal,

00:16:53.557 --> 00:16:56.002
inferior post lateral gyri bilaterally.

00:16:56.002 --> 00:16:57.393
What's that associated with?

00:16:57.393 --> 00:16:59.386
Attention and receptive language.

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:02.262
Superior frontal gyrus, et cetera,

00:17:02.262 --> 00:17:03.679
social cognition,

00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:05.986
gyrus rectus,

00:17:05.986 --> 00:17:09.612
reward, emotion, inhibitory control,

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.296
executive function.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:14.269
So these areas are physically different

00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:17.864
in the children with
these prenatal exposures

00:17:17.864 --> 00:17:20.197
when they're older children.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:24.775
So...

00:17:26.364 --> 00:17:28.853
childhood has multiple windows,

00:17:28.853 --> 00:17:31.130
things are developing at different times.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.995
When you have rapid cell development,

00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:37.947
that's a time period where a chemical

00:17:37.947 --> 00:17:40.912
or potentially a social stressor

00:17:40.912 --> 00:17:42.912
might be more impactful.

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:47.708
I think it's important,

00:17:48.751 --> 00:17:50.021
I'm trying to stay on mostly

00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:53.300
neurocognitive kinds of issues.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.467
Air pollution,

00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:57.618
now there's increasing number

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:59.028
of studies that show

00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:00.363
that air pollutants are associated

00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:02.262
with a variety of problems

00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:03.512
including some,

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:06.553
now I don't think this is conclusive,

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:08.460
but some that would put

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.978
autism in a higher risk factor

00:18:10.978 --> 00:18:12.144
with your air pollution,

00:18:12.144 --> 00:18:13.653
including studies from

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:15.236
the MIND Institute.

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:18.567
But things have been

00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:19.796
associated in studies.

00:18:19.796 --> 00:18:21.039
Developmental delay,

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.376
inattention, ADHD,

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:23.924
anxiety,

00:18:23.924 --> 00:18:26.579
actual volume changes in the brain

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:29.305
and neuro-inflammatory markers.

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:31.889
So a variety of things.

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:32.981
And for PAHs,

00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:35.752
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,

00:18:35.752 --> 00:18:37.123
those are things that any time

00:18:37.123 --> 00:18:39.558
you burn things including fuel

00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:42.133
in your cars or your diesel trucks,

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.368
you're creating these

00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:45.865
and we're breathing them in.

00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:48.852
There's not only an impact on

00:18:48.852 --> 00:18:50.949
cognitive and behavioral outcomes,

00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:53.572
but there's evidence of an interaction

00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:54.572
between that

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:59.785
and maternal hardship, family hardship.

00:19:02.157 --> 00:19:02.990
So...

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.186
in the environmental world

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:09.471
just like in the infectious disease world,

00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:12.629
we want to think about prevention.

00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:15.363
Actually let me go back one slide.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.207
I want to point out TENDR,

00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:20.296
the Targeting Environmental

00:19:20.296 --> 00:19:22.463
Neuro-Developmental Risks.

00:19:25.322 --> 00:19:26.572
This is a group

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:30.258
that has been convened

00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:33.193
by Irva Hertz-Picciotto,

00:19:34.088 --> 00:19:35.576
is a epidemiologist

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:38.409
at the MIND Institute at UC Davis.

00:19:39.372 --> 00:19:42.142
And the Learning Disabilities Association

00:19:42.142 --> 00:19:43.428
have been really involved.

00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:44.845
There's clinical,

00:19:46.396 --> 00:19:49.542
like many different nursing,

00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:53.125
physician and other
health groups involved.

00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:56.109
The researchers that are doing

00:19:56.109 --> 00:19:58.133
a lot of this (mumbles).

00:19:58.133 --> 00:19:59.750
They've put out some statements

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.678
and they're continuing to work on this.

00:20:02.678 --> 00:20:05.704
Leslie and I have both been involved

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.339
and I have their website at the end.

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:09.746
I think it's important.

00:20:09.746 --> 00:20:12.624
So their idea is we should be

00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:15.558
trying to prevent these things.

00:20:15.558 --> 00:20:18.141
Specifically we need to add to,

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:21.728
like the air pollution discussion,

00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:25.926
well, this impacts
neurocognitive development.

00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:30.325
This impacts things that
you are all concerned about.

00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:31.844
Can we do something about it?

00:20:31.844 --> 00:20:34.427
Well, there's not good studies.

00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:36.660
There's one study in China,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.410
but kind of marginal.

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:42.548
About neurocognitive outcomes

00:20:42.548 --> 00:20:45.158
with decreasing exposure

00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:46.823
to air pollutants.

00:20:46.823 --> 00:20:48.909
But this is lung development.

00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:50.936
And this is the Los Angeles Air Base.

00:20:50.936 --> 00:20:53.382
And so you have particulate matter

00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:55.516
and ozone, which decreased fairly

00:20:55.516 --> 00:20:57.251
dramatically over the 20 years

00:20:57.251 --> 00:20:58.751
from 1990 to 2010.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.674
And the group that studies this

00:21:01.674 --> 00:21:04.253
down in the LA area had three

00:21:04.253 --> 00:21:06.949
separate cohorts that were growing up

00:21:06.949 --> 00:21:09.376
during different time periods

00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:12.875
of air pollution in Los Angeles.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:15.287
And what you see is a decrease

00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:16.961
over those time periods

00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.486
so that those that grew up

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.895
with the cleaner air

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:22.139
had half of the number of kids

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:24.159
with decreased lung function.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.206
Under 80% of predicted values.

00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:28.456
Halved by that.

00:21:29.432 --> 00:21:31.106
I think that it's likely

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:32.713
that that may be something

00:21:32.713 --> 00:21:36.358
we will see with neurocognitive impacts

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.054
if we could,

00:21:38.054 --> 00:21:41.367
it's more complicated to try to study.

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:43.700
So this is about resilience,

00:21:46.617 --> 00:21:48.850
this is a model or

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.068
a communication tool

00:21:51.068 --> 00:21:53.254
the Frameworks Institute developed

00:21:53.254 --> 00:21:54.981
and it's just to say

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.906
okay, well, resilience has a lot

00:21:57.906 --> 00:22:00.239
of different inputs into it.

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:04.257
And you can think of it like a scale.

00:22:06.278 --> 00:22:09.813
If the scale balances to one side,

00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:12.307
you may end up with a negative outcome

00:22:12.307 --> 00:22:13.906
or a positive outcome.

00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:17.269
So you can add together
these various factors.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.678
Abuse, neglect, chemicals.

00:22:19.678 --> 00:22:20.974
So that's what we add to it.

00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:24.141
They talk about a lot of other things.

00:22:24.996 --> 00:22:26.594
I'm adding chemicals

00:22:26.594 --> 00:22:27.902
and you can see why.

00:22:27.902 --> 00:22:28.981
I've just been talking about it.

00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:33.556
You can have things that
support a positive outcome.

00:22:33.556 --> 00:22:35.826
Opportunities for skilled development,

00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:37.675
supportive relationships,

00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:40.380
things your involved with your patients,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.119
identifying early intervention.

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:45.613
We're talking about
early intervention here.

00:22:45.613 --> 00:22:48.189
That can have an impact.

00:22:48.189 --> 00:22:51.882
So even in the presence
of some negative factors,

00:22:51.882 --> 00:22:55.753
yes, you can have a positive outcome.

00:22:55.753 --> 00:22:58.430
It's also based on this fulcrum here.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.560
So every person is a little different.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.524
We come with different genetic makeup

00:23:02.524 --> 00:23:06.417
and things can change where the fulcrum is

00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:09.920
so that lesser or more amount of weight

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.753
on a side may drive it

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:14.310
to negative outcome

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.077
or to a positive outcome.

00:23:16.077 --> 00:23:18.712
Well, think about if
your are exposed to lead

00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:20.471
very early in life,

00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:23.007
that moves your fulcrum.

00:23:23.007 --> 00:23:25.355
Then you're more susceptible.

00:23:25.355 --> 00:23:29.268
The same thing, you have
that enriched environment,

00:23:29.268 --> 00:23:32.185
you might favor a positive outcome.

00:23:33.738 --> 00:23:36.653
So again, back to what are these things?

00:23:36.653 --> 00:23:39.320
Stressors that include finances,

00:23:40.478 --> 00:23:42.895
built environment, chemicals,

00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:46.553
education, social support.

00:23:46.553 --> 00:23:49.720
A whole mish-mash of, it's everything.

00:23:52.004 --> 00:23:54.908
So we have in our society

00:23:54.908 --> 00:23:57.491
of individualism this idea that

00:23:58.352 --> 00:24:00.622
positive outcomes are the result

00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:03.789
of people bootstrapping themselves up.

00:24:05.355 --> 00:24:08.369
All you gotta do is work hard enough.

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:10.046
Dale Carnegie.

00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:13.379
You'll be a billionaire just like Trump.

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:18.005
Well, or that it's just a matter of

00:24:18.005 --> 00:24:19.732
having enough will power.

00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:21.727
Grit is a popular one now.

00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:23.794
We're gonna teach our kids grit.

00:24:23.794 --> 00:24:27.190
That's what's gonna make the difference.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.607
We're gonna blame the victim.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.521
Or the idea that resilience has no limit.

00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:37.276
It doesn't matter how
many hardships you have.

00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:39.378
If you work hard enough,

00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:40.328
you're gonna take care of it.

00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:42.936
The facts are that resilience is shaped

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:45.568
by these powerful factors including

00:24:45.568 --> 00:24:49.032
social, physical, environmental factors.

00:24:49.032 --> 00:24:51.498
And they're not easily overcome.

00:24:51.498 --> 00:24:53.616
Yes, some people overcome the worst

00:24:53.616 --> 00:24:56.470
of possible imaginable things.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.049
And usually I think
you'll find that they have

00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:02.549
some mitigating factors somewhere in that.

00:25:03.938 --> 00:25:05.995
We can help the strength and resilience

00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:08.938
by ensuring that we provide a healthy

00:25:08.938 --> 00:25:12.453
environment both for
prenatally and in children.

00:25:12.453 --> 00:25:15.286
The stuff you try to do every day.

00:25:16.735 --> 00:25:18.647
So this comes to the background.

00:25:18.647 --> 00:25:19.970
That's the background for

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.407
what is environmental justice?

00:25:22.407 --> 00:25:24.113
Well, we had a slide in the morning

00:25:24.113 --> 00:25:27.247
about this, a lot of things,

00:25:27.247 --> 00:25:28.487
the Lanterman Act,

00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:31.570
the coming out of the 1960s and '70s.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.032
The environmental
movement came out of that.

00:25:38.032 --> 00:25:41.018
And the environmental
movement then combined really

00:25:41.018 --> 00:25:44.591
with the civil rights movement because

00:25:44.591 --> 00:25:48.660
there were communities
that were highly impacted.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.953
It turns out the same communities

00:25:50.953 --> 00:25:53.116
that experienced

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:55.449
economic problems and racism

00:25:57.512 --> 00:25:59.706
also are the communities

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:02.142
that are much more likely to be

00:26:02.142 --> 00:26:04.731
next to a superfund site

00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:07.338
or surrounded by freeways

00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:09.650
or all these kinds of things.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.376
So environmental justice was this idea

00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:15.638
that everybody, regardless
of their background,

00:26:15.638 --> 00:26:17.489
deserves fair treatment

00:26:17.489 --> 00:26:19.322
and input and respect.

00:26:20.403 --> 00:26:22.903
It started from an observation

00:26:23.887 --> 00:26:25.848
that superfund sites

00:26:25.848 --> 00:26:28.585
were both more prevalent in lower

00:26:28.585 --> 00:26:31.835
socio-economic and communities of color

00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:35.532
and also that they were waiting

00:26:35.532 --> 00:26:38.199
far, far longer to get clean up.

00:26:40.113 --> 00:26:42.860
So California EPA has this program called

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.299
CalEnviroScreen.

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:48.332
It's actually now on
the 3.0, just came out.

00:26:48.332 --> 00:26:50.082
But it's an idea that

00:26:51.347 --> 00:26:54.289
to combine all of these different factors.

00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:57.866
So there's exposures to chemicals,

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.536
things like being near clean up sites,

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:02.519
sensitive populations,

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:05.240
and these socio-economic societal factors,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.429
including things like
linguistic isolation.

00:27:08.429 --> 00:27:10.299
So they map these things,

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:12.484
overlaid for the entire state.

00:27:12.484 --> 00:27:13.951
And then they come up with, okay,

00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:15.879
well, here these red communities

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:18.046
are in the top 20% of

00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:22.305
exposures both societal, social,

00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:23.805
and environmental.

00:27:24.937 --> 00:27:28.937
And what we see is that
if you're a white child,

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:33.775
one in 14 are in one of those top 20%.

00:27:33.775 --> 00:27:36.253
But if you're Latino or African American,

00:27:36.253 --> 00:27:38.753
one in three of these children

00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:42.314
in these communities.

00:27:42.314 --> 00:27:44.558
So there's a dramatic difference.

00:27:44.558 --> 00:27:47.473
And we see that that's actually

00:27:47.473 --> 00:27:51.018
representative of the
United States in general.

00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:54.122
The US EPA has a similar kind of program.

00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:56.560
So just to say, well, just one thing.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.163
Here's a study, I'm looking at schools.

00:27:59.163 --> 00:28:02.150
If you live downwind,
close downwind to a school,

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.105
you have more traffic-related
air pollutants.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:08.266
And then this study showed that

00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:10.950
if your school was around these

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.105
traffic related air pollutants,

00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:17.105
you had increased risk
of bronchitis and asthma.

00:28:18.879 --> 00:28:22.092
Well, this is just looking at SES.

00:28:22.092 --> 00:28:22.925
As SES,

00:28:25.553 --> 00:28:26.811
well, this is,

00:28:26.811 --> 00:28:30.120
this is a marker of school lunches.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.398
So low SES.

00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:34.558
As you go to lower to higher

00:28:34.558 --> 00:28:35.975
traffic exposure,

00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:39.030
you get more and more kids

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.447
that are low SES.

00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:43.158
But beyond that,

00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:45.528
this is going from low to high.

00:28:45.528 --> 00:28:49.208
Traffic exposure and
then by ethnic groups.

00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:51.875
And you can see for the Latinos,

00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:56.703
the higher the traffic exposure,

00:28:56.703 --> 00:28:59.065
the higher the percentage of Latinos.

00:28:59.065 --> 00:29:02.950
Same thing for African American children.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.764
And just the opposite for white children.

00:29:06.764 --> 00:29:09.469
And this has been correlated with

00:29:09.469 --> 00:29:11.627
academic performance.

00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:13.481
So as you go,

00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:15.648
if you go from low to high

00:29:18.784 --> 00:29:20.437
air pollution levels,

00:29:20.437 --> 00:29:22.859
academic performance decreases as well.

00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:24.459
And they try to control for everything.

00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:27.922
And trying to wrap up some of this,

00:29:27.922 --> 00:29:29.589
this is from a study

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:33.142
of early intervention.

00:29:33.142 --> 00:29:35.309
These are the 1960s, '70s,

00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:41.841
early childhood education studies.

00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:43.189
Kind of the precursors

00:29:43.189 --> 00:29:45.967
or the beginnings of Head Start.

00:29:45.967 --> 00:29:47.717
And those at this one

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.653
which was at Brookline, Massachusetts,

00:29:52.653 --> 00:29:55.917
being in an enriched environment,

00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:58.783
as this model's program was,

00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:00.689
ended up in increasing

00:30:00.689 --> 00:30:03.595
your high school graduation,

00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:04.845
decreasing your

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:08.138
eventual involvement

00:30:08.138 --> 00:30:10.534
with juvenile detention

00:30:10.534 --> 00:30:11.701
and et cetera.

00:30:14.055 --> 00:30:16.485
So this is your early childhood.

00:30:16.485 --> 00:30:18.039
This is well demonstrated to

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:19.539
be cost effective.

00:30:20.564 --> 00:30:22.813
And what were they studying?

00:30:22.813 --> 00:30:25.347
I would say we don't exactly know.

00:30:25.347 --> 00:30:26.955
This is SES.

00:30:26.955 --> 00:30:28.212
Those are also the same kids

00:30:28.212 --> 00:30:29.673
that were more likely to be

00:30:29.673 --> 00:30:31.727
exposed to high lead levels

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:33.654
or any of these other things.

00:30:33.654 --> 00:30:35.549
So are you possibly treating those?

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:37.330
There's been no intervention study

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.063
to date yet that looks at

00:30:39.063 --> 00:30:40.146
the impact of

00:30:42.124 --> 00:30:44.207
all this kinds of special

00:30:45.381 --> 00:30:46.575
programs you might have

00:30:46.575 --> 00:30:48.279
for children that are lead-exposed

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:51.804
to see does that alter the result.

00:30:51.804 --> 00:30:52.637
So...

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.581
there are these critical windows.

00:30:56.581 --> 00:30:58.586
Exposures can be chemical, physical,

00:30:58.586 --> 00:31:00.169
social, historical.

00:31:01.642 --> 00:31:03.486
Low income children,

00:31:03.486 --> 00:31:04.709
communities of color

00:31:04.709 --> 00:31:07.104
are disproportionately exposed

00:31:07.104 --> 00:31:09.111
to both the social stressors

00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:11.212
and to toxic environment.

00:31:11.212 --> 00:31:12.492
And it's really important,

00:31:12.492 --> 00:31:16.292
if you want to see the impact of things,

00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:20.459
you gotta address more than
one of the multiple causes.

00:31:21.707 --> 00:31:23.580
So then what does,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.311
this is really trying to conclude,

00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:28.687
what is somebody who's
a health professional

00:31:28.687 --> 00:31:29.865
supposed to do?

00:31:29.865 --> 00:31:30.874
I know this is overwhelming.

00:31:30.874 --> 00:31:33.957
One, Leslie and I work for these PEHSU.

00:31:33.957 --> 00:31:35.843
We not only do education,

00:31:35.843 --> 00:31:39.343
but we help people work through questions.

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:43.692
Sometimes there's simple answers

00:31:43.692 --> 00:31:44.982
and there's a lot of material

00:31:44.982 --> 00:31:46.862
on our PEHSU website,

00:31:46.862 --> 00:31:48.834
which is down here somewhere,

00:31:48.834 --> 00:31:51.542
including fact sheets and

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:52.750
pesticides.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.406
What would be one thing to come out with?

00:31:55.406 --> 00:31:57.210
Integrated pest management.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.279
That's trying to use less pesticide.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:00.828
Doesn't say you wouldn't use any,

00:32:00.828 --> 00:32:03.988
but it's approaches to
reduce pesticide use.

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:06.553
Lead, you might want to be screening.

00:32:06.553 --> 00:32:09.509
Children with, it has been said

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:11.087
that anybody with
developmental disabilities

00:32:11.087 --> 00:32:13.436
really should get a lead test.

00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:15.175
Tobacco exposure.

00:32:15.175 --> 00:32:17.072
You want to, that's pretty simple.

00:32:17.072 --> 00:32:19.366
We all know about what to do.

00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:20.554
Consumer products.

00:32:20.554 --> 00:32:23.161
Here's a website, couple websites

00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:24.080
with information,

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.857
one about cosmetics,

00:32:25.857 --> 00:32:27.542
which are significant exposure to

00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:30.978
endocrine disrupting
chemicals for young women

00:32:30.978 --> 00:32:34.145
who are likely to be getting pregnant.

00:32:35.225 --> 00:32:36.520
And then the last thing,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.456
and you've got all this in your syllabus,

00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:40.835
but the Story of Health.

00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:44.254
That's a continuing education program

00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.633
that we developed with
a bunch of partners.

00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:49.888
You can get quite a few
credits for doing it.

00:32:49.888 --> 00:32:51.555
It follows a family,

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:56.294
different members of the family

00:32:56.294 --> 00:32:57.741
with different illnesses

00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:59.390
through the multiple kinds of things

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.551
that might impact.

00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:02.632
One, so there's a story about asthma,

00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:03.620
a child with asthma.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.888
There's a story about a child
with learning disabilities.

00:33:05.888 --> 00:33:07.495
And a child with leukemia.

00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:11.245
And we'll be releasing
in the next few months

00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:14.015
one about infertility

00:33:14.015 --> 00:33:15.662
and reproductive health.

00:33:15.662 --> 00:33:17.458
And then other resources here.

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:20.472
I'll throw in National
Medical Legal Partnership.

00:33:20.472 --> 00:33:22.013
If you're not aware of it,

00:33:22.013 --> 00:33:23.881
that would be a good one because

00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:25.200
a lot of environmental health things

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.899
turn out to be housing issues,

00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:30.490
just like other things
we've heard about today.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.406
Medical Legal Partnership.

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:34.295
There are over 200 of
'em around the country

00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:36.598
where doctors and lawyers work together

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:37.700
to help address,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.200
'cause we can't do everything.

00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:42.222
Thank you.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.380
(audience applause)
