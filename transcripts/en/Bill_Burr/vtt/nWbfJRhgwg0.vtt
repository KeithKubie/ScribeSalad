00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.610
Hey,

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:05.950
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.820
just checking in on you,
seeing how your week's going.
Oh,

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.490
happy Valentine's Day to you.

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.250
Happy Valentine's Day to you.
Boop,
boop,
boop.

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.170
Happy Valentine's Day dear lady.

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.720
<v 2>The fees.</v>

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
<v 0>Why don't want to you brave strong warriors.</v>

9
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.160
Pick up the check.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.810
You fucking tightwads.

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.340
You know I was watching TV the other day cause I'm not a big reader,
you know,

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
unless it's got a lot of pictures and they sound out the words for me.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.870
And there was this woman on TV,
right?

14
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.910
One of these daytime talk shows us some shit.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.740
She was just like Happy Valentine's Day week guy.
I fell.

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.830
I think we should celebrate that week.
It's a week of love.

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.831
It's just like how much free shit are you trying to get and stop acting like

18
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:12.780
you're celebrating love.
You're not.
You're celebrating you.
Yes.
Selfish.

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.500
Why is she a whore bill?
Cause she's on television with too much makeup.

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.510
All right.
I mean Jesus Christ,
why aren't you just out there walking the block?

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.603
Um,

22
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.000
<v 3>Oh man,
I'm in a grumpy ass fucking mood cause I want to go to</v>

23
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.380
<v 0>B to the motherfucking Ed.
I want to go to bed bitches.</v>

24
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.490
I don't know why I'm talking like a fucking old white housewife right now who

25
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:42.280
watched a hip hop video,
but I am
motherfuckers.

26
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.330
Um,
I uh,

27
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.680
<v 3>yeah,
I want to go to bed,
but I got to go on and I got to go run my hour.</v>

28
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
<v 0>I got to go run it cause I'm doing the special soon I've got to hit the con</v>

29
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
comedy gym and all I want to do is try out my new fucking ideas.

30
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.350
Right?
That's what I want to do.

31
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.020
<v 3>But I can't,
I gotta fucking dude.
I gotta I gotta be,
I gotta be like,
you know</v>

32
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.810
militant about it.
I know it's weird.

33
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:11.020
What I have to do is do my new ideas and then start with a joke.

34
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm going to fucking maybe start with and then run the fucking shit and then in

35
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.590
the end I'm not going to do it.
I just need to be onstage talking.

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.700
That's all I need to do.
Okay.
I don't know how these fucking people do it,

37
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.630
where they write the whole thing out,
have the whole thing memorized or whatever.

38
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.340
Um,
I dunno if it's on lazy or maybe that's not how my brain works.

39
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:34.790
I have no fucking idea.
All I know is I'm running it tonight and then that's it.

40
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.450
Then I'm coming home and going to bed and then a buck and waking up the next
day.

41
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.140
I got it.

42
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.160
<v 0>Table read for F is for family episode four.</v>

43
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.720
Fucking season has been great so far.

44
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.160
We got some new writers and they're crushing it.

45
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760
And um,
I don't know.
We're almost next week.

46
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:56.790
Next week we'll do four oh five maybe right there.

47
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.000
Then we halfway through the season already.
And now

48
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 3>will,
you're thinking,
well shit,
Bill,
what's it going to come out in June?
Oh,</v>

49
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.820
I mean just halfway through.
Just the first initial writing of it.
Well,

50
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:09.010
how does it work,
Bill?
What would you like to know?
How it works in case?

51
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.040
So you write the fucking thing,
right?
And as you're writing the episodes,

52
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.620
they come back with something that's known as an animatic.

53
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.060
Now an animatic is basically,
it's just basically black and white sketched.

54
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.940
And they're like,
well,
this is how we're going to draw what you wrote.

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.050
Does this look good?
And Mobility,
like we like this,
don't have that chair there.

56
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.100
Have him stand up,
have him move his arm like this up and down when he says,

57
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.300
what the fuck is going on in here?
Right.
You do that and then it comes back,

58
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.520
it's a little more drawn in,
a little more color,
you know,

59
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.730
that's how it goes just like that.

60
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.120
But we're in the fourth season so they know what we like,
we know what they like.

61
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.920
So it moved like last season moves along quickly.
So I'm,

62
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.790
I'm hoping we can get this fucker done,
um,

63
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.750
as soon as possible.
So,
uh,
anyways,
um,

64
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.270
and I'm going to take my lady out for fucking Valentine's Day.

65
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.110
That's what I'm going to do.

66
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.790
And I'm going to try to be a nice guy and try not to get into a fight.

67
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.450
Try not to have any appeared yet.

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.223
<v 4>MMM.</v>

69
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.530
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
you know what,
I'm,</v>

70
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.950
I'm doing so much shit right now that I want to fucking go off on,

71
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:18.680
but I can't go off on it because other people's lives will be affected.

72
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.270
You know what?
Are you talking about?
Some top secret shit built?
No,
I'm not.

73
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.680
I'm just talking about,
you know,

74
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.873
<v 4>I dunno.</v>

75
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.160
<v 3>Just bullshit in my fucking life.
Like,
uh,
you would never know it,</v>

76
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:35.150
but I am not in a good mood right now.
All right.

77
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.420
I'm not in a good fucking mood,
but I gotta do this.

78
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:42.680
I have a responsibility to you.
Okay.

79
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.280
I answered the call 12 years ago to start podcasting.

80
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.593
Okay.

81
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.430
The same way somebody answers the call to defend the freedom of this country.

82
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.703
<v 4>All right?</v>

83
00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.820
<v 3>Now,
God dammit.</v>

84
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.820
If white women in this country can somehow enjoy white privilege and then yet

85
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.150
also make themselves victims than God dammit,

86
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.260
I can put myself on the same level as someone who's fighting,

87
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.440
you know,
what are they saying?
They're doing it.
Fighting for our freedom.

88
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.820
That's right.
Fighting for our freedom,

89
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.553
<v 4>right?</v>

90
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.390
<v 3>As a podcast warrior,
living my truth.</v>

91
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.950
I think I'm slowly going insane.
Um,
anyways,

92
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.350
I don't have any advertising here.
I don't know what's going.

93
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.450
So fucking podcast has been going off the rails lately.

94
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:41.820
I'm not gonna lie to you and you don't want to think.

95
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:43.560
A lot of the biggest fucking problem is,

96
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.750
you know what the biggest fucking problem is right now,

97
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:50.751
aside from the fact that I have no guests and that sitting here by myself,

98
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.040
you're listening to one of one of,
I'm like a conc cunt right now.
Right.

99
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.270
Um,
the biggest fucking problem I life right now is I'm sober.
You know,

100
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.090
I don't know how the puck and people do this shit.

101
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.510
I'm trying to think back to my life before ever drank

102
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.710
because I had a hell of a run.
I went,
I went,

103
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:13.780
I didn't start drinking until I was like 17,
you know,

104
00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.310
I had a couple sips of beer here or there,

105
00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:19.240
but basically I spent the first 16 years of my life sober.

106
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.620
I don't know how I did it,
but I think back,
I didn't have any,

107
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.160
there was no pressure.
You had to get up and do my paper route.

108
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.440
That was the biggest thing.
Occasionally you had to go collecting,

109
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.040
maybe it rained out,
some of the papers got wet.
Maybe there was that.

110
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.580
Maybe he had a book report.
I mean those were the pressure days.

111
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.390
I wonder if kids over in Europe,
you know,

112
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:42.850
when they got a big book report the next fucking day,
you know,

113
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.890
after they give the book report,

114
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.730
do they drink like a fucking couple of shots just to unwind?

115
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.410
You know,

116
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.720
cause there's just so much more progressive over there and they can allow their

117
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:56.330
kids to booze.
I don't fucking know.
I don't know how it works.

118
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:00.500
I don't pretend to know.
Um,
but anyways,

119
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.860
I'm committed to this shit though.
I'm not drinking this year.

120
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.710
<v 5>Okay?</v>

121
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.780
<v 3>Now I know those animals in Aa,</v>

122
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.970
they tried to say you gotta go day to day.
All right?
But there are different,

123
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.200
they're a different group of people.
All right?

124
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.330
If you ever think you're an alcoholic,

125
00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:22.050
go to an AA meeting and just listen to the fucking stories and you know,

126
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.160
come out the other side and tell me your as fucked up as those people.

127
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.710
I,
I,
I double dare you to fucking do it.
You know,

128
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.180
you're just come out of there and be like,
oh,
you know,

129
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:35.850
I'm a fucking binge drinker.
That's what I am.
You know what I mean?

130
00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.600
Once I start losing teeth,
you know what,
I kind of dial it back.

131
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.050
I'm not standing outside the fucking liquor store waiting for it to open.

132
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.590
Fucking chug and mouthwash.

133
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.150
You ever go to an AA meeting?
You want to feel good about yourself?

134
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:55.800
You go to a fuck at AA meeting.

135
00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.080
Just look at those fucking animals just sitting there.

136
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.640
Goddamn cigarette ashes.

137
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:06.641
Fucking all over the e the yellow fingers just shoving donuts down there.

138
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:13.310
Fucking pie halls.
It's unbelievable.
That's funny.
I haven't been on a,

139
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.850
I went to two AA meetings.
Was it one?
Yeah,

140
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:19.580
to like 30 years ago

141
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.870
only cause the court told me I had to.
Um,
it's a whole other fucking story.

142
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.020
Eli's got until the Stag stag get out guy or a tag.

143
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.770
But I gave it a fucking license back.
All right.

144
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.310
I'll go to these things and that was every fucking story.

145
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.590
They would say the most fucked up shit ever jaw on the ground.

146
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.590
Like you gotta be fucking kidding me.
How did you live through that?

147
00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:47.560
And then right after that,
and they'd be like,
and then the craziest thing is,

148
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.930
you know how they want to do is have another drink.

149
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.360
Jesus Christ.
I love making fun of alcoholics.

150
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.980
I really do.
Alcoholics,
feminists.

151
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.640
Who else?
The Obamas.

152
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.360
I was fucking people.
Jesus Christ.

153
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.440
I don't know what fucking deal with the devil that they signed that they just

154
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:22.520
fucking get off Scott fucking free out there with all that corporate money

155
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.470
hanging out of their fucking pockets.

156
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.490
Everybody out here is looking at him like they're fucking,
I don't know what.

157
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.693
<v 4>MMM.</v>

158
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.780
<v 3>Anyways,
I,
why do I talk politics?
I don't pay attention to it.</v>

159
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.500
Every time I start to look at it,
it just fucking,
I don't know,

160
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.250
it either bores me to tears or scares the shit out of me.
You know?

161
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.020
It's either like somebody filibustering

162
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.380
on the fucking floor or it's like,
I dunno,

163
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.960
you just watch them,
you know,

164
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.930
building up a new candidate.

165
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.290
And so much of it has nothing to do with their message.

166
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:02.420
It has to do with the way,
the way they look.

167
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.490
<v 4>Uh,</v>

168
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.380
<v 3>you know,
it goes back to Clinton,</v>

169
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.970
he played the saxophone on fucking our scenario,

170
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.830
this watershed fucking moments in politics that changes it forever.

171
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.640
You know,
like,
uh,
as far as the age of television,

172
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:25.110
you had Nixon sweating sitting there like a fucking catcher.

173
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.950
You know what John F.
Kennedy was all tanned up with this fucking legs crossed.

174
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:29.191
You know,

175
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:33.600
like he was hanging out at a fucking country club and people who listened to the

176
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.310
debates said Nixon won.
And people who watched it said,
Kennedy won.
You know,

177
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.320
Nixon with his sweaty upper lip.

178
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:42.940
<v 4>MMM.</v>

179
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.430
<v 3>Yeah.
That was it.
That was a moment.</v>

180
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.680
Michael Dukakis sticking his head out of that fucking tank.
That was a moment.

181
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.150
Bill Clinton playing the saxophone.
And then I would say,

182
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.370
uh,
Donald Trump,

183
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.060
this last one where he didn't really debate as much as he just sort of trash she

184
00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:07.990
just sorted was doing a roast.

185
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.173
<v 4>MMM.</v>

186
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.350
<v 3>That's what I want to see just as a standup comic is how are People gonna</v>

187
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.220
fucking debate.
That guy,

188
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.443
<v 1>you know,</v>

189
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.720
<v 3>takes me back to like,
when Patrice was alive,
we just couldn't beat the guy.</v>

190
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.830
So you'd literally walked down to the comedy cellar and I would have like

191
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:33.320
fucking four insults.

192
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.420
I would just be thinking about his face was something I saw them do on stage and

193
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:41.030
I would have like four fucking insults ready to go,

194
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.143
<v 1>you know,</v>

195
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.410
<v 3>just so I could get to the table and sit down and order some fucking food.</v>

196
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.100
I feel like Trump,
you got to do the same thing.

197
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 1>Like</v>

198
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.860
<v 3>Hillary should've just abandoned,
you know,</v>

199
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.410
whatever fucking horse shit she was going to say.
Right.

200
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.700
And just fucking attack this to pay,
you know,

201
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.000
and just this stupid look on his face and should've just sat there and imitate

202
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.770
it.
She should just fucking,
uh,
I believe that the,
the,

203
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:13.600
the youngsters call it clowned him.
He should,
he should've just trashed him back.

204
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.830
Um,
I dunno,

205
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.550
that was such a fascinating fucking thing to see happen.

206
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.260
There was all these fucking rules and he just came in there like a Goddamn bull

207
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:30.800
in a China shop and traipsed right through all of it.

208
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And those people all had no answer.

209
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.060
All those years I watched those debates in these fucking guys running the

210
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:38.600
debates,

211
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.600
acting like they had this fucking control that if you fucking broke these rules,

212
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.010
that something was going to happen,

213
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.860
that there was some sort of repercussion for it.

214
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.250
So no one ever did for the most part.
You know,

215
00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:53.870
they talk a little bit over their time.

216
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.400
Trump completely fucking ignored all of them.
And when he did,

217
00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:02.450
they had nothing.
Absolutely fucking nothing.

218
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.470
So I dunno,
what is he like?
He said,

219
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.740
only two years in a little over two years.

220
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.080
So you've got this year,
you got next year and then the show starts again.

221
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.550
What do you guys think?
Let's fucking handicap this

222
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.450
like a football.
It's the beginning of the season.

223
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:26.180
Who Do you think's gonna win the super like how I wanna know how will you guys,

224
00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:27.710
even if you were into Donald Trump,
cause the guy,

225
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.920
he's a fascinating fucking problem in a debate

226
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.400
cause it's like this guy is just like,

227
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.500
his style is so fucking not what there you all of these fucking politicians,

228
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:46.680
unless they hosted a reality show,
maybe that's his strength.

229
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.820
He didn't take debating classes so he doesn't know that he just fucking goes in,

230
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:53.060
you know?
I don't know.

231
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.820
I found it as a standup comedian.
Fascinating.

232
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.620
Mikey was this heckler that you just couldn't get.
I can't shut them.
I just,

233
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.000
when I looked at all those other candidates,

234
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:07.780
they were like these comedians and they were facing this heckler

235
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.110
that was just funnier than,

236
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.580
than the comic on stage or just wouldn't shut up and there was no security.

237
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.130
They couldn't shut them the fuck up.

238
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.280
The only other time I saw something like that,

239
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.670
I saw bill O'Reilly when he went on the view and he just said whatever the fuck

240
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:28.650
he wanted and he made them so mad.

241
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:32.970
Two of them got up and left and he was literally two fucking

242
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.910
hosts away from the hosting the I O'Reilly factor on the fucking view,

243
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.690
you know.
But Babs was fucking old school

244
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.770
and she called the ladies back in.
She's like,
what are we doing?

245
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.510
I sit the fuck back down.
You know,

246
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.840
it's just a man in a shirt saying things relax.
Okay.

247
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.880
And they all fucking relaxed and then that was it.
Um,
anyways,

248
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.310
I love when they walked out too.

249
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:05.570
Like that meant something like I'm getting up and walking out like all of show

250
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:10.190
business was gonna was gonna stop,
you know?

251
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.683
I don't know.

252
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.520
<v 3>I don't know what the fuck's been going on with me lately,</v>

254
00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:15.690
but this is maybe my thought,

255
00:15:15.691 --> 00:15:19.020
like if I've learned anything in my 50 years on this planet is nobody gives a

256
00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:19.854
shit.

257
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.550
Occasionally when somebody gives a shit,
they,
they,
it's,

258
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.610
it's so fucking rare that they actually will do like a piece about it on the

259
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:33.490
news.
Like we found somebody that gives a shit.

260
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.940
We found somebody who is doing the right thing.

261
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.390
This is what they do and they're doing it the right way.

262
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.990
Why is my voice cracking?
You know,

263
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.850
when they make a documentary about somebody,

264
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.390
there's so few people doing

265
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.990
good things.
I feel that they actually,
that's why they created the documentary.

266
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.300
So it came about,
it's like,
why don't we just make a movie about this person?

267
00:16:03.301 --> 00:16:04.980
Well,
now that there's such a good person,

268
00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:06.960
like it's not going to come off as a believable movie.

269
00:16:06.961 --> 00:16:11.190
You literally have to fucking film this guy or this woman doing this nice shit.

270
00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:13.560
So anybody believes it.
Right.

271
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.470
Am I dreaming this podcast right now?
Is this podcast actually happening?

272
00:16:19.471 --> 00:16:20.304
I have no idea.

273
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.830
I watched a little bit of the Bruins and a little bit of the Celtics.

274
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.320
I've decided that,
uh,
at some point

275
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.960
I do have to put my foot down a little bit and take a little bit of control of

276
00:16:30.961 --> 00:16:33.990
the TV.
You know,
my daughter's just so adorable.

277
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.340
It's hard for me to,
uh,
you know,
say no,
but I,

278
00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:41.670
I know I have to write.
So,
you know,

279
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.670
last night the Bruins were playing the Black Hawks.
So it's just like,

280
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.640
I just want to watch one period of hockey,

281
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:53.940
I'll watch third period of hockey,
you know,

282
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.140
so I got to put the TV on and I really try not to,
you know,

283
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:01.740
do the screen time thing with my kid.
Uh,
I,
I,

284
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.380
I believe in that whole thing that have in them,

285
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.380
especially with smart phones and all that Shit.
It's just,
it's fucking,

286
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.430
I don't think it's good for him initially.
Um,

287
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.770
and I'm basing that on shit.
I've overheard other people say,
um,

288
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.550
not to mention last weekend when the TV wasn't on and I didn't have my phone and

289
00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:24.900
I just took out a deck of cards and I just had a great fucking time and I was

290
00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:28.470
like,
Oh yeah,
I remember that.
Looking at another person and connected with them.

291
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.553
<v 4>MMM.</v>

292
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.280
<v 3>Anyways,
I,
uh,
the fuck is my point here.
Oh yes.</v>

293
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.220
I go to put on the hockey game and the second the TV goes on,

294
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:47.300
she starts yelling out her shows,
you know,

295
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.790
Mimi Mouse Minnie,
right?
I'm like,
no,
no.
Many miles.
She went to bed many miles,

296
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:56.840
went to bed,
then she does this crying.

297
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.050
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

298
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.610
<v 3>You know,
just forcing it out.
And I'm like,
we're going to watch hockey.
That'd be,</v>

299
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.600
thinks she sees now that sports,
she goes,
football,
football,
my daughter hockey,

300
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.250
hockey.
So Chico was upset for a little bit,
but then,
then she was cool.

301
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.320
And then,
uh,

302
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.270
tonight I put on the Celtics and then she pointed the TV.
She's like,

303
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:23.560
hockey,
hockey.
I'm like,
no basketball.
So then she,
you know,

304
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.620
said basketball,
we watched that a little bit,

305
00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:28.360
but then she wanted to do the alphabet.

306
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.130
So I put it on mute and I was doing the alphabet with her and then she was kind

307
00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:37.390
of looking at the TV.
So I said,
fuck it.
And I shut it off and just did the whole,

308
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:40.360
you know,
a apple B bad.

309
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.530
See Cupcake d dinosaur,
rob,

310
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.150
I forget what he is,
you know,
and I go through the whole fucking thing.
Um,

311
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.980
anyways,
um,

312
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.800
so now I'm sitting here,
it's Wednesday night.

313
00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:04.801
I'm doing this fucking podcast cause tomorrow is Valentine's Day and uh,

314
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.770
I have to somehow stay awake.

315
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.680
It fucking go out and go do my spot tonight.
Run my God damn hour.

316
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.590
All I gotta do is just get behind the wheel of the car and that'll wake me up.

317
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.810
I'll stick my head out the window like fucking ace Ventura pet detective

318
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.250
that run down to this little fucking hole in the wall.

319
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:28.940
I'm gonna run my fucking set and then that'll be it.
I'll be good.
But with,

320
00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:30.680
the thing is,
is I've been getting up,

321
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.330
I've been going to the fucking gym again in the morning.
All right.
And I slowly,

322
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:41.720
I'm to the point where my shoulder is strong enough where I'm almost to the

323
00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:46.721
point I can do a dip after this rotator cuff fucking nightmare is finally

324
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.780
eyesight.
I,
I did,
I did it so fucking wrong.

325
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.240
I kept babying my shoulder still.
I had that frozen shoulder shit.

326
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:59.840
Right now I've had to go all the way back and I just keep having setbacks.

327
00:19:59.841 --> 00:20:03.140
But when I finally learned is when I go on the road and I can't go to the gym

328
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.850
when I come back,

329
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.720
I can't pick up where I left it left off.

330
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.640
And I can't even just go five pounds down.

331
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:13.580
I have to go 15 pounds down or this thing flares up again.

332
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:18.110
So I finally figured that out.
So now I'm to the point where I take the,
the,

333
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.740
the dip bar,
he can adjust it all the way down.
So on,

334
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:26.240
basically my feet are on the floor and I'm just sort of bending my legs doing

335
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:29.380
the dipping motion.
So now I've got it to the point where I'm just sort of,

336
00:20:29.381 --> 00:20:32.930
you know,
when Michael Jackson would come up on his toes,
I'm kind of like that.

337
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.010
So I'm supporting most of the weight of my legs,

338
00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:39.710
but more and more the upper body is going to support it.

339
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.640
And I gotta tell you the day I fucking do a dip,
then I on,

340
00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:46.520
I know I'm getting close and I've been doing,
I disguise,

341
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:51.010
sent me an about some shoulder exercises and I've been doing this thing where I

342
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.330
just sort of hang from the chin up bar,
you know,
with my feet on the ground.

343
00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.010
But every day I do a little more of the upper body holding the weight,

344
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.150
you know,
incrementally every so fucking slowly.

345
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.510
And then I think eventually,
um,

346
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.170
the person I'm working with is telling me because of my body weight,

347
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:14.710
I need to basically be able to do the lat pull down machine,

348
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.120
like 120 pounds,
three reps of 15.
And when I do that,

349
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:20.860
then I can attempt to do a pull up without

350
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.550
<v 5>okay.</v>

351
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.970
<v 3>Fucking up my rotator cuff and starting all over again and spend a long,</v>

352
00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:30.620
slow fucking road
for an old bastard like myself.

353
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.710
Um,
but anyways,

354
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.250
I'm very excited about slash apprehensive about doing this.

355
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.910
Uh,
this special coming up.
I just,
I fucking,

356
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.970
this is the part that I hate is having to be disciplined because like tonight I

357
00:21:46.971 --> 00:21:47.680
would just go down,

358
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.740
I've just fucking go off and I have to go down and actually work and I'm a lazy

359
00:21:51.741 --> 00:21:55.640
fucker,
so I don't,
I don't like working at being a big goddamn baby about it,

360
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:57.770
but I'm going to go down,
I'm going to fucking get it done.

361
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.360
And then next week everybody,
uh,
is the Patrice O'neil comedy benefits.

362
00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:07.070
So I'm going to be in New York City doing that benefit.
The next night.

363
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:12.130
Wednesday I'm actually going to be doing nine o'clock show at Caroline's on

364
00:22:12.441 --> 00:22:16.930
Broadway.
I've not headline there and probably a decade.
And that is the,

365
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.690
the first place that headline to me in New York City,

366
00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:25.430
they used to have to pull the curtain and I would draw like 30 or 40 fucking

367
00:22:25.431 --> 00:22:29.060
people,
anybody they could drag off the Times Square.
Um,

368
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.100
and that's when me,
Patrice Norton,
um,

369
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.210
everyone from my graduating class was just starting to like close out a show on

370
00:22:41.871 --> 00:22:42.704
a uh,

371
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.193
<v 5>okay,</v>

372
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.250
<v 3>on like a Tuesday night or whatever.
Man,
it's a really cool thing.</v>

373
00:22:47.251 --> 00:22:51.780
So it kind of takes me back to all of all of those times.
So,
um,

374
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.350
uh,
and then I think I'm in New York for the rest of the week,

375
00:22:55.351 --> 00:22:59.930
so I'll be bouncing around doing spots all around the city,
just stay in shap.

376
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.930
And then I go out from New York,

377
00:23:03.931 --> 00:23:06.390
I'm going straight over to Great Britain,

378
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.900
and then I just bang out about five or six shows there.

379
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.150
And then I do,
uh,

380
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.440
I do two nights at Royal Albert Hall on the fourth and the fifth.

381
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.030
And I knocked this fucker out.
And after that,

382
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.710
oh,

383
00:23:22.711 --> 00:23:27.330
all this fucking crazy political talk and all this negative shit that I've been

384
00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:29.190
doing right now,
it's just because I'm under the pressure.

385
00:23:29.191 --> 00:23:30.720
Don't even fucking listen to me.
Okay.

386
00:23:30.721 --> 00:23:34.860
The world is not as bad as I'm fucking say to this.
I just,
you know,

387
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:39.480
I just got to get on the other side of this fucking thing.
And once I do,

388
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.950
then I'm good.
Finish.
Right.
The rest ofF is for family.

389
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.330
And then the rest of my year is just opened up.
And then it's my favorite,

390
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.110
favorite fucking time.
Right after a special,

391
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.610
you have no fucking act.

392
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.960
I get to go on stage and just fucking bomb.

393
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.110
It's my favorite thing in the fucking world.
And then also be like,

394
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.970
I don't have to put out another special for a couple of years.
This is beautiful.

395
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.750
Oh,
gives a shit.
If I'm doing a fucking Ronald Reagan impression.

396
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.410
Oh,
I did the ice house the other night.
I had a fucking last night,

397
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.160
ran the hour out there.
Whatever the fuck I did.
Um,

398
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.500
had a great time out there.

399
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.790
<v 3>You know,
worked with Bart,</v>

401
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.670
Nick Fucking Joe to Rosa J K to braid it.
Can't appraise them.
Um,

402
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.590
trying out some new shit.
I always have to trap the new shit.

403
00:24:43.591 --> 00:24:45.780
I can't just like do my fucking act.
I swear to God.

404
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.730
Then I feel like I'm doing my God damn taxes.
Um,
so anyways,
so you know what,

405
00:24:50.731 --> 00:24:53.210

I get to start having more guests on this fucking show.

408
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:01.640
I think I've exhausted everything I can fucking talk about,
about myself here.

409
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.200
All right,
here we go.
Oh,

I'm looking at UK openers.

410
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.850
This is,
uh,
Ian so and so.

411

This is a fucking something,

All right,
Google,

412
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.320
Google news.
All right,

Oh,
by the way,

413
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:23.270
you know something,
I just saw the original,

414
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.410
do you know the original intellectual fucking children's book?
Chicken little,

415
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.970
you know that stupid Goddamn,
uh,

416
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.700
the fuck is it that,
that God damn chicken nae acorn falls on his head.
He says,

417
00:25:38.701 --> 00:25:43.080
the sky's falling.
He runs around and gets everybody off,
you know,

418
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.560
got all in a fucking panic regional chicken little story.

419
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.520
And I got to type in Fox.
Okay.

420
00:25:54.521 --> 00:25:59.350
The original chicken little was a story called Henny penny.

421
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.910
All right,
now chicken little,
I don't even know how that fucking story ended,

422
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:08.840
but it didn't end up with anybody fucking dying button.

423
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.200
Henny penny chicken little has an acorn falls on his fucking head.

424
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.900
And uh,
whatever your Henny penny,
any penny had a fucking blah,
blah,
blah.

425
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.530
And then he runs into ducky Faqih and he said,
oh,
the sky's falling.

426
00:26:22.531 --> 00:26:26.550
And then Ducky fucking in a Henny penny went up to when went to fucking Loosey

427
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.340
Goosey.
And then there the sky's falling.

428
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:33.030
And then Lucy Goosey fucky Douggie and Henny penny.
That's how they do it,
right?

429
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.250
It's every fucking bird you could possibly goddamn eat,

430
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.810
freaking out that the fucking sky is falling.
And then they run into a,

431
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.130
<v 0>the Fox like,
hey man,</v>

432
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.660
what do you guys all freaking out about any penny ducky Faqih and uh,

433
00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:58.200
the,
the fucking Loosey Goosey.
I'll go,
I the sky's falling.
Jesus Christ.

434
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.660
And he goes,
Oh,
you know what?
I live in a cave.

435
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.770
Come on over here and we'll fuck it.
Be Safe.
And uh,

436
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:09.771
then the story just ends with the Fox in his little fucking Fox cubs,

437
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:12.810
whatever you call them,
with big smiles on their faces,

438
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.980
cause they fucking hate him.
That's how it ended.

439
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.530
That was the original.
And uh,

440
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.310
people were saying that it was too,
um,
you know,

441
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.930
to fucking dark or whatever the fuck it was.
But uh,
you know,

442
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:35.280
I have a theory about those old original or some of the old stories like,

443
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.150
or Disney shit like Bambi and why the parents die and all that shit.

444
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.790
You know why that is?
Why it was so fucking dark back then.

445
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.200
Cause people fucking died.
People were hungry.

446
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.590
He had to go out and kill an animal.
You didn't just go down to fucking,
you know,

447
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.280
Goddamn Ralph's and get a chicken breasts.
You had to kill that fucking thing.

448
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.360
Watch it,
flap it's wings for the last time.
Take out the end trails,

449
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:02.010
be covered in blood and all of that shit.
It was a fucking gory mess.

450
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.300
People got tuberculosis,
they got fucking,
uh,

451
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:10.890
they got a polio.
All kinds of horrible shit happened back then.

452
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.270
They had gross on their goddamn faces.
It was fucking difficult.

453
00:28:15.271 --> 00:28:18.480
So that was probably a cute story,

454
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.280
you know,
cause they knew so much about wildlife back then,
like,
yeah,

455
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:27.060
you know the fox,
the Fox is fucking smart man.
You know,

456
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.010
I have no idea.
I don't know.
I just found that fascinating that,
you know,

457
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:36.270
nowadays,
if you do that,
oh my God,
that's gonna fucking,
there'll be a tragedy.

458
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.050
Oh look at those conference.
All stars.
Please have at my size.
They got the,

459
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:45.000
they brought the old doctor Jay back.
Please have my size.
How does the Internet,

460
00:28:45.001 --> 00:28:49.380
no,
all right.
There it is.
Oh,

461
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:53.400
there's an ad.
Let me see.
They got my size.
They never have my size.

462
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:57.480
It's always fucking sold out.
Oh,

463
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:00.060
this is so why did they wait so long to bring the old fucking doctor

464
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.780
Jay Leather Converse all star back.
It's such a clean look and fucking sneaker.

465
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.910
All right,
all sizes.
What do you got?
What do you got?

466
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.380
They got my size.
Get the fuck Outta here.

467
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.920
All right,
I'll fucking buy it.
I'm going to click on buy.

468
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.750
Here's how it work.
Make a bid.
Make an author.
Hey,
here's how it works.
Fuck you.

469
00:29:28.751 --> 00:29:30.660
Sneakers.
How about that?
Your cons.

470
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.120
The fuck was that all about you want this sneaker?
We have your size.
All right,

471
00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:39.240
I'll buy it.
All right.
Here's how it works.
What do you mean this is how it works.

472
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.100
All right,
let's get back to the fucking

473
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.930
<v 3>news here or get to the news.</v>

474
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:48.931
I haven't got the Google maps is using giant virtual arrows to stop people from

475
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:53.920
getting lost.
Jesus fucking how much worse can they help you with this thing?

476
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.710
Well,
this is my new pet peeve.
You don't,

477
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.120
when you scroll past the fucking video they want you to watch and then it just

478
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:04.390
goes down with you stalking you.

479
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.761
Um,
anyways,
here we go.

480
00:30:07.761 --> 00:30:12.110
Google maps wants to make it easier for people to find their way to busy urban

481
00:30:12.111 --> 00:30:15.890
spaces and it thinks large cartoon arrows can help.

482
00:30:15.891 --> 00:30:19.730
August is when you're walking down the street related article,

483
00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:24.650
how Alexa knows the difference between a breaking window in a wine glass.

484
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.090
Oh,
Jesus.
Should I just embrace this shit?

485
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:34.040
Should I just bring this robot bitch into my fucking house now,
Tommy a batch.

486
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.740
Uh,
all right.
On Monday,

487
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.930
Google Max begin maps began letting some users test a new augmented reality

488
00:30:41.931 --> 00:30:46.730
feature and it's mobile app that shows graphics such as highlighted Arrows and

489
00:30:46.731 --> 00:30:51.731
street names floating in midair over a live view from their camera on their

490
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.003
smartphone screens.

491
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.440
It's meant to help them navigate city streets that Jesus Christ could there be a

492
00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:02.510
more boring fucking article.

493
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:06.200
What kills me is that there's an entire generation of kids that get excited by

494
00:31:06.201 --> 00:31:07.034
this.

495
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.700
<v 4>Um,
all right.</v>

496
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.570
<v 3>Deck of cards with my face on it.</v>

497
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.280
Okay.
This is more exciting to me.
All right.

498
00:31:20.281 --> 00:31:23.640
Custom photo cards.
Oh,
he can actually do this shit

499
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.170
and fucking take a picture.
My God damn nuts.

500
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.653
<v 4>MMM,</v>

501
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.570
<v 3>of course.
It's a mother hugging her child.</v>

502
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:37.720
Who the fuck's gonna put that on a deck of cards.
These cards,

503
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:41.790
these things are dirty.
They're filthy.
People lose money.
All right.

504
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.360
They lose the relationships with these things.

505
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:47.020
Let's let the luckiest deck of card Jay ever going to design.
Wait a minute.

506
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:48.700
Wait a minute.
Let me,
let me let this up here.

507
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.703
<v 4>Uh,</v>

508
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.170
<v 3>booze.
Picture,</v>

509
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.380
deck of cards is what kills me is fucking stupid as this is.

510
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.960
This is going to actually hit something,
right?
It's,

511
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.370
someone's going to have already done this.
All right,
here we go.
Images

512
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.050
just here for the booze.
So we've got that on their fucking cards.

513
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:18.330
I'm like a chocoholic but for booze.
So look at me.

514
00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:20.970
It all comes back to booze.
Just here for the booze.

515
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.670
Let's,
let's let that something else I like to do.

516
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.670
I'd like to just Google search asshole things are

517
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.770
al Ko holics just weak.

518
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.710
Oh my God.
Somebody said,
are they selfish apps?

519
00:32:36.711 --> 00:32:41.120
A fuckin lutely are alcoholics selfish?
Here we go.
Let's,

520
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.350
let's read this trashy

521
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.680
a deeper look at what into why alcoholics are so selfish.

522
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.980
It's a disease man.
Um,

523
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.431
all right.

524
00:32:57.431 --> 00:33:01.030
Many people seem to think that addicts and alcoholics are quite selfish,

525
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.420
especially when they're using,
oh,
did they?
Do they fucking get me here?

526
00:33:04.421 --> 00:33:05.890
That they're not going to say they're selfish?

527
00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.780
Chances are if you had a loved one who is in an active,

528
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.720
active addiction,
we've,

529
00:33:13.721 --> 00:33:17.080
we'd like to invite all active addicts to board next,
please.

530
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.210
Then you've experienced the selfishness of an addict firsthand.
Um,

531
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.710
no.
I'm talking about just like even when they're dry.

532
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:28.450
<v 7>Okay,</v>

533
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:33.070
<v 3>we'll,
we'll all recovering alcoholics become less selfish,
unfortunately.
No.
Oh,</v>

534
00:33:33.071 --> 00:33:33.910
I love this site.

535
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.390
Not all recovering alcoholics will be willing to address their selfishness.

536
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.150
In reality,
there will be some super selfish people,

537
00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:43.150
including narcissists that we'll continue to being self.
Well,
I mean,

538
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:46.390
they could say that about anybody,
right?
I'm just being a dick.

539
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:52.470
Are Elko holics
weak?

540
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.000
This is actually fun searches to just search shit that alcoholics are not

541
00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:59.610
powerless.
Human weakness behind alcoholism.

542
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:02.880
It's not a good one.
Let's,

543
00:34:02.881 --> 00:34:05.340
let's let one last search here and then I gotta wrap this up.

544
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:11.700
Are Most feminists fam,

545
00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:14.850
I can't even spell it.
Feminist dumb.

546
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:21.600
It's not feminist to pour bleach on man.
Spread is,
it's just stupid.

547
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.100
Whoa.
Jesus really do that.

548
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.150
Why anti-feminism is illogical,

549
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.490
evil and incredibly unsexy.
Well,
I want to be sexy.

550
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.820
I thought being a feminist meant I couldn't wear lipstick or crave men with

551
00:34:38.821 --> 00:34:41.130
small behinds.
I thought that,
oh my God.

552
00:34:41.131 --> 00:34:45.350
Can you imagine actually clicking on that and why the fuck would I read that?
Uh,

553
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.900
why did,
why,
what team did to her teacher,

554
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.470
what team did when her teachers said not to be a feminist to people just make

555
00:34:55.481 --> 00:35:00.010
these stories up.
The results of this bay surprise.
You all right.

556
00:35:00.011 --> 00:35:03.940
It's not feminist to pour bleach on man.
Spreaders is just stupid.

557
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.983
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

558
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.360
<v 3>I had no idea that that bothered women's so much.
Did just sit there.</v>

559
00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:18.190
It's like we got dick and balls.
We have stuff hanging off of us.
You know,

560
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:21.820
you've got to make some room there.
Um,

561
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.020
so then all tucked away all nice and fucking tidy.
Like your shit.
I'm all right.

562
00:35:26.021 --> 00:35:31.021
Feminism does not deserve to be undermined by idiotic acts that set men against

563
00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:33.670
women.
Oh my God.
God bless this woman.

564
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.730
Now here's a nice rational fucking person you could talk to.

565
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.090
This is my new video manifesto,
dedicated to the problem of man's spreading,

566
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:47.450
the disgusting act that is being fought with around the world and it is hushed

567
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.780
up in us.

568
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.860
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

569
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.860
<v 3>Men demonstrating their alpha manhood in the subway with women and children</v>

570
00:35:56.111 --> 00:36:00.490
around it has nothing to do with that,
which is sitting there.

571
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:06.810
You built the whole back story like you sitting there looking at my dick and

572
00:36:06.941 --> 00:36:07.840
balls.

573
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:13.570
I will take up as much space as I want with my private.

574
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.090
Um,
if you quickly show what kind of macho you are,

575
00:36:19.091 --> 00:36:21.160
we will publicly cool you off.

576
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:26.190
This video manifesto was created in the assistant with friends who share my

577
00:36:26.321 --> 00:36:29.470
position.
I guess this is,

578
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.390
I guess it's a video of a woman pouring bleach on guys.
All right.

579
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.050
Anyways,
did you hear the one about the Russian student who was so fed up with

580
00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:41.290
manspreading that she took to the subways of Saint Petersburg?

581
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.330
To spray diluted bleach on men's crotches.
Hilarious.
Right?

582
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.640
I got to admit,
that's fucking funny.

583
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.300
And this woman says wrong.
Look,

584
00:36:52.301 --> 00:36:56.410
I hate man spreading as much as the next unreasonable feminists.

585
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.870
It's antisocial,
it's rude.

586
00:36:58.871 --> 00:37:03.871
It's displays an arrogant disregard for this people sitting around you.

587
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.260
It's behavior that women just wouldn't get away with.

588
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.220
What are they talking about?
You use the fucking men's room.
The,

589
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.330
the,
the line is too long in the ladies from you use the mat.

590
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.930
You have no respect for our personal space.
These fucking women,

591
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.850
they're out of their fucking minds.

592
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.820
I'm not saying they don't have some legitimate bitches,

593
00:37:24.821 --> 00:37:27.160
but the way they're acting like they're not doing anything wrong.

594
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.700
It's just straight fucking.
Anyway,
so let's,
let's,
let's read a little more

595
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.460
and to be clear,

596
00:37:33.461 --> 00:37:38.140
I don't mean that I'm advocating for men sitting with their legs clamp together,

597
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.890
lady.
I don't give a fuck what you're at,
what you're acting like you're,
you're,

598
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.880
you're

599
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.713
<v 5>okay.</v>

600
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.400
<v 3>You,
you're like,</v>

601
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.950
you've got some sort of legal legislation here that just got passed and then I

602
00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:54.280
have to adhere to this anyways.
I don't eat.

603
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.160
I don't either unless I'm wearing a short skirt.

604
00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.260
Nor am I insisting that men should cross their legs at all times.
Oh,
thank you.

605
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.123
Thank you for that.

606
00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.460
And that existing that the existence of their penis is no barrier to doing this.

607
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.310
Some may say crossing there,
some men say crossing the legs is fine.

608
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:16.780
Some men say it isn't not having a penis myself,

609
00:38:16.781 --> 00:38:21.100
I don't feel in a position to be the final arbitrator on this pressing matter.

610
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.850
Uh,
this is not a,
this is one of the dumb,
this is just like,
you know,

611
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.320
global warming.
Who gives a fuck up out that

612
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:36.640
is dictating our foreign policy.
Who gives shit about this?
Men

613
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.640
<v 8>trying to sit comfortably on the subway.</v>

614
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.493
<v 4>MMM.</v>

615
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.050
<v 8>Anyways,
I think that's the end of the pot.
Yes.
This was a very weird podcast,</v>

616
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:47.884
but you know what it did

617
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:48.843
<v 4>got me</v>

618
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.400
<v 8>two within two hours of one and a half to go and I got a late in that spot</v>

619
00:38:52.401 --> 00:38:56.830
tonight as home saying I'm an old man.
Oh,
Badu,
dope,
dope.

620
00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.660
[inaudible] sitting in the fucking rain to do to to me undies me on days they're

621
00:39:02.661 --> 00:39:05.900
nice and soft.
So there is no pain.
Robin,

622
00:39:05.901 --> 00:39:08.300

623

626
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:23.270
I'm going to fucking car right now.
I'm parked.
I'm doing this safely.

627
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.900
Me undies as yourself.
One fucking important question.

628
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.810
Is your underwear making you happy at this very moment?

629
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.280
What a question to ask on Valentine's Day or were you not thinking about your

630
00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:35.020
underwear?

631
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.880
When do you like to be wearing underwear that is so soft that you feel like

632
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:42.290
you're making love to an actual cloud all day long?
Uh,
Jeez.

633
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.700
You fucking the hemisphere there.
Well,
I've got one word for you.

plant babies and shamrocks.
Speaking of Prince,

639

All my favorites here.
What's your block butcher box?
My favorite,

672
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:58.064
I can't even say it.

673
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.500
What's your box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef free

674
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:08.150
range.
Organic chicken and heritage breed pork,
not bread.

675
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.200
Heritage breed pork.
So tasty.

676
00:42:11.201 --> 00:42:14.960
The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to

677
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.961
raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones.

678
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.260
Listening to the feminist manifesto before they're slaughtered.

679
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.730
Cook with p the peace of mind knowing you are eating healthy,
high quality meat.

680
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.320
Each box comes at least two with at least eight,
eight,
two 11 pounds of meat,

681
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.090
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.
You Fat Fox,

682
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:43.070
she get 24 meals out of that,
you can choose from five different box types.

683
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.200
All beef,
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box.

684
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.660
We ain't about that around here.
You stay with your own,
uh,

685
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.920
custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

686
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.610
My favorite cut of meat is the heritage breed pork.
Oh,

687
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.150
you do that?
A little bit of mashed potatoes,
right?

688
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.390
Little bit of fucking all natural Gornick or,

689
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.110
or going organic fucking apple sauce.

690
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.510
Sear it on both sides.
Finish it in the oven.

691
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.010
Take it out with a little rosemary garlic Beth butter bath.
Oh Jesus.

Thank you for listening to this absolute fucking bullshit</v>

700
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:55.720
of a podcast.
Um,
I'm actually having,
um,
oh,
I have a,

701
00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.760
I have a big guests coming on for the Monday morning podcast.

702
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:02.571
Uh,

703
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:07.571
I got Jason Reitman who I was lucky enough to work with on the front runner and

704
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.840
um,
that movie is coming on to all the streaming services.

705
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:15.410
I believe maybe today it came on or,
or sometimes soon.

706
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:17.030
So Jason was nice enough to agree.

707
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:20.930
I asked them to come on the podcast so we could come on and promote that movie.

708
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.780
Um,
it's one of my favorite things that I've done.

709
00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:26.930
So we're going to talk that we're going to talk movies,
he's going to be,

710
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.530
I think directing the next ghostbuster movie and all that type of stuff.

711
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:32.130
So that's

712
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.850
<v 9>what I'm going to have for you on Monday.
And um,
other than that,</v>

713
00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.290
we've got a little bit of music here and after that we'll have another half hour

714
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:44.100
of a throwback Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

715
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.440
God bless all of you,
especially all the strong brave women who listen to this.

716
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.450
Um,
without you,
the world would be nothing.
Okay.

717
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:55.740
And I'm closing my leg

718
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.590
<v 10>as I fucking hit stop on my recorder.</v>

719
00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:34.670
[inaudible]

720
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.740
<v 0>last week,
you know,
I was bitching about Valentine's Day.
You know,</v>

721
00:45:36.741 --> 00:45:38.410
I always tease you about,
you know,

722
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:42.650
how we go out to celebrate our relationship except iPad by the way.
How,
how,

723
00:45:42.651 --> 00:45:45.890
how much fun was it going out on the 12th?
It was really nice.

724
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.760
It was great doing that from now on.
Right?
It was still going to be our nice,

725
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.820
quiet,
romantic.
Yep.
There was none of the hype.

726
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.600
We went to a really nice place.
I'm not gonna lie,
it wasn't actually cheap,
but I,

727
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:00.530
I can't imagine what that would've caused.
We would've been standing outside.

728
00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.850
Oh yeah.
You know,

729
00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:05.000
you and your little glitter dress looking at the other girls in there.

730
00:46:05.001 --> 00:46:08.540
Glitter dress is going to you like Mike Literature.
I as much as her,

731
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.940
I should've gotten mine in poofy shoe shoe colors.
Um,
so anyways,

732
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.700
so I've been bitching about the ladies on this thing,
right?

733
00:46:16.701 --> 00:46:17.690
Like what do you guys do?

734
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.710
And they're talking about this steak and a blow job day.
Yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,

735
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.570
yes.
All right.
I like it.

736
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.570
I'll tell you when you were in heaven,
when not only can they not,
I can't say it.

737
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.440
Yeah.
When,
when they're,
when they're proficient in both of those categories,

738
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.330
because there's a lot of people out there,
they're going to say,
all right,
steak,

739
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.740
get a blow job day.
And one of them is it going to be up to snuff.

740
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.960
And there is,

741
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:50.330
there is a prevailing attitude amongst women that they are just automatically

742
00:46:50.331 --> 00:46:55.331
good in bed because they're there and there's the prevailing attitude that men

743
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.510
don't know what's going on.
We don't know what's going w where anything is,

744
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:01.160
we're just happy to be at.
It's a privilege,

745
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.570
which is why this lady says the Valentine's Day,
this is,
this is from a lady.

746
00:47:05.571 --> 00:47:06.404
She said,
hey bill,

747
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.220
I heard what you were saying about women and Valentine's Day and how we don't

748
00:47:10.221 --> 00:47:14.510
buy our men gifts and we expect a whole day to be about us.
Well,

749
00:47:14.511 --> 00:47:18.200
here's what I did from my husband.
Uh,
by the way,

750
00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.170
I'm honestly not trying to sell you anything.
He goes,
she goes,

751
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:25.970
I bought him the liberator Wedge Ramp Combo set.
Uh,

752
00:47:25.971 --> 00:47:26.451
what's that?

753
00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:29.000
You might ask actually know about this from the European Anthony Show.

754
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.320
They refer to it as a bedroom,
as bedroom,
adventure gear.

755
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:37.530
It's a set of cushions designed to help you achieve more positions during sex as

756
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:41.260
well as deeper penetration.
So no,
we didn't go out to dinner.

757
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:45.100
No stupid cards were exchanged.
We simply stayed home and fucked all night.

758
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.350
Choke on that.
You douchebag.
I love your bill.
Go Fuck Yourself.

759
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.470
I like this girl.
Yeah,
but you know what's funny about that?

760
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.790
As she's patting herself on the back,
she bought something for herself.

761
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.310
It's for both of them.
No,
it isn't.

762
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.580
What do you mean it is she going to do with it without him?

763
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.380
I don't need deeper penetration.
That's feel wealthy.
Again,

764
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.310
that's,
that's the difference.
What is the difference?
She knows.

765
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:16.150
I'm not saying that guys don't satisfy their women properly,
that they,

766
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:18.430
that their dick isn't big enough.
I'm not talking about that.

767
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.470
I'm talking about how she's patting herself on the back.

768
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:25.690
Like she went out and bought this guy,
the NFL package for next season.

769
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.900
Like she actually went out and bought something for him.

770
00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:32.470
She didn't at the very least she bought something for them.

771
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.060
But the real thing about that,

772
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.470
that's for the woman so he can hit it at that angle that you liked so he can hit

773
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:42.580
your spot so we can get in there deeper.
Guys don't appreciate that.

774
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.150
I'm not saying I don't appreciate it and I'm not saying it's not a great

775
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:46.601
invention,

776
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:50.260
but what I'm saying is she's acting as though like this was some sort of a

777
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:54.640
sacrifice that she basically bought him something that would get her better Dick

778
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:57.460
and she's patting herself on the back for it.
It's fucking ridiculous.

779
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.810
I think it's clever.

780
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:03.550
It is clever because she's acting as though she did something but she didn't

781
00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.151
see this is the,

782
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:11.080
this is the thing about that is the genius of women is you guys act like sex

783
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.550
doesn't feel good for you too.

784
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.870
You Act like you guys allowing us to have sex with you.

785
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.540
Like you don't want it and like this,

786
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.260
it's like you like waxing a floor and it's just a big fucking pain in the ass.

787
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.161
You know?

788
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.910
She got some in that in that is like celebrate Tory of their relationship as

789
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:30.850
opposed to like the typical dinner.
It's like it's about our intimacy.

790
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:34.270
It's about our connection.
So why don't we get something that will enhance that?

791
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.290
Yeah,
but this is the thing.

792
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.420
I got to go out and buy you like some necklace or some let me go.

793
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.160
How do I get to wear it?
I got to take you out to dinner,

794
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.620
celebrate and I pay for the whole fucking thing.

795
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:47.050
It's all about the guy going out,
spending money on you,

796
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.730
getting you shit that you want.

797
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.990
And it's the pressures for the guy to show his love to you.
Oh,

798
00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:55.600
I know a white guy who can dunk a basketball.
All right,

799
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.540
let's stop talking about the exceptions.
I'm talking about the fucking rule here.

800
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.980
All right.
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes,
I do.
Okay.

801
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.360
All right.
All right,
fine.
There we go.
Via tapping out.

802
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.300
Fucking tapping out.
Why?
Why?
Why Do Women Act Lik sex doesn't feel good to them?

803
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.160
Why do you,
why do you,
what do you guys know?
I can't answer it.

804
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.740
Can you please talk into the mic?
I'm not like that,
so I don't know.

805
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:21.790
I couldn't tell you.
You don't have any insight.
I can't keep this going.

806
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.150
All right,
let's keep going.
I don't really know.
Women that are like,
Oh God,

807
00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:25.990
it's such a chore.

808
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:30.680
Like maybe in next 10 years women will be complaining about that.

809
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:33.980
I don't know,
but,
well,
when I was making fun of Valentine's Day this weekend,

810
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.600
some girl in the crowd was going like,
you know what?
I said,
well,

811
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:42.320
what did you do for it?
And she goes,
she,
he got to hit this and

812
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.500
<v 11>god,
it's ridiculous.
Yeah.</v>

813
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.980
What can I just show up and be like,
hey,

814
00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:53.220
you get to suck this lady never,

815
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.480
never.
Ain't never got to do that.
Right.

816
00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.120
I don't know what it is complaining about.
This is what it is.

817
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.820
<v 0>If guys could ever stop being such fucking sluts and giving it a well,</v>

818
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:08.810
that's why women women don't respect Dick is because it's so easy for them to

819
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:10.920
get it.
If you'd stop giving it away,
if,

820
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:13.970
if every guy would just start the day and fucking rub one out,

821
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.080
right world would be a lot more peaceful at least until two in the afternoon.

822
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.000
By then your balls fill up again.

823
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.850
Start getting competitive by his cubicle bigger than mine.
Um,

824
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.410
I don't even know what I'm saying here.
It's just,
it's,
you know what it is.

825
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:29.570
It's just one of those things that balances it out.
Right?

826
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:33.860
I can choke slam you on the floor and you could cut off the sex and that

827
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:38.150
balances out,
but it's illegal for me to hit you.

828
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.870
But for some reason it's not illegal for you to cut off the sex and that right

829
00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:46.130
there people is what's known as the tipping point.
That's how you lose.

830
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:47.703
<v 10>Yep.</v>

831
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:12.340
[inaudible]

832
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.330
<v 11>Hey,
what's going on?
It is Belper and it is the Monday morning part</v>

833
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:17.710
<v 0>cash for Monday,</v>

834
00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.660
February 14th,

835
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.420
2011 happy Valentine's Day.

836
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.630
You bunch of fags.

837
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.050
The fuck is wrong with you,
Huh?

838
00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:38.310
All you douchebags out there buying flowers and fucking candy at cvs that is in

839
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:43.450
love.
Huh?
You bunch of fucking shape.

840
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:48.130
What are you doing
the fuck?
What's wrong with you?

841
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.760
Somebody ought to know where it tells you this is the day you got to go tell

842
00:52:51.761 --> 00:52:56.280
that fucking pain in the ass that you love her.
What she doing for you?

843
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.470
Is She paying for dinner tonight?
Did she have to go make reservations?

844
00:53:01.471 --> 00:53:04.710
What the fuck is she going to do other than get ready?

845
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.690
I got news for you.
She's not doing a fucking thing.
All right,

846
00:53:09.691 --> 00:53:12.660
so why don't you save yourself some money?
Pick a fight with their today.

847
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.740
All right,
anything she says,
so you'd just be like,

848
00:53:16.741 --> 00:53:20.040
that's what this is what I'm talking about.
And then just storm out,

849
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.240
you know,
and just let her leave 40 messages.

850
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.950
You're not picking up and it's scaring me.
Okay,
let's,

851
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.490
let's work it out and just wait till tomorrow.

852
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.680
Just wait till tomorrow.

853
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.510
There's plenty of reservations that fucking candy 75% off.

854
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.390
Come on people.
Come on fellas.
You better than this.

855
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.950
You're better than this.
Don't get,

856
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.980
don't get sucked into this stupid ass fucking holiday.

857
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.520
I know what you're thinking.
Well,
what are you going to do?
Work to fuck?

858
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:54.870
I'll tell you what the fuck I'm doing.

859
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:59.820
I sat down at a nice mature conversation with my Horman and I said,
listen,

860
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.500
this is fucking stupid.
All right,
this d,

861
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.750
every restaurant's going to be packed.
You know?

862
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.980
Would you care for the heavily Shugar for $900 he went out of my,

863
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.670
can I just grab your fucking weight or face and just shove it in something,

864
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:17.370
right.
Add to whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

865
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.310
I actually worked out with my girl this year.
I said,
listen,

866
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:22.470
I'll take you out on the 15th.
All right,

867
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.450
I'll take you to a nice fine restaurant where there'll be plenty of goddamn

868
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.770
tables.
You know,

869
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.420
there won't be some sad fucking,
uh,

870
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.540
immigrant with flowers coming by with an accordion every five seconds,

871
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.090
you know,
she's taking the night off.

872
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:43.500
We can sit there and actually enjoy the Goddamn meal for raw,
you know,

873
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.310
only 30% markup as opposed to 200%.

874
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.190
What I'm trying to say people is,
uh,

875
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.310
if you want to find out if you're with someone who's cool,

876
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.080
they're just see if they'll celebrate Valentine's Day on like the 16th or the

877
00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:59.130
15th.
You know,

878
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.110
it's like Vegas go there right after the new years,

879
00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:07.560
when new year when everybody's fucking broke.
That's when you go,

880
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.420
you get a hotel room for like seven bucks.
Oh yeah.
I'm telling you,

881
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:17.010
go on fucking orbits.
You think I'm lying to you?
Um,

882
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.060
whatever.
Wa what w what do you,
what are you going,
I just,

883
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.110
I hate this holiday.
All right.
I'm not a fan of love.

884
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.830
So this holiday annoys the shit out of me.
And you know,

885
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.900
fans of my podcast should realize,
do I flip out like this on flag day?
I don't,

886
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.260
I don't care if you have a flag.
I don't know.
I don't have a problem with it.

887
00:55:37.261 --> 00:55:37.770
You know why?

888
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.710
Cause there's no fucking social pressure for me to go out and get one.

889
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.630
What kind of flag did he get you?
Oh,
he only got you that one.

890
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:46.890
Do you know what that one means?

891
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.720
Why don't you fucking shove it up your Twat and dry it out?

892
00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:54.990
Why don't you do that?
Oh,
cheese is bill Jesus.

893
00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:59.790
You're going to get that dirty,
this eat early.
Yes,

That's what the fuck.

913
00:57:15.711 --> 00:57:18.650
I'm trying to sit here and a the,
and by the way,

914
00:57:18.651 --> 00:57:23.180
I keep saying the official website of the Monday morning podcast and I think I

915
00:57:23.181 --> 00:57:24.350
always forget to say the,

916
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:29.530
it's www.themmpodcast.com if you'd like to follow along in your cubicle at work

917
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.170
on a plane,
whatever the fuck you want to do.
So I'm,

918
00:57:37.171 --> 00:57:39.170
I'm actually doing this Sunday night,
once again,

919
00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:42.140
I'm going to put it up nice and early.
So,
uh,
all my,
uh,

920
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:47.200
my 17 fans in Great Britain and my two fans in the Scandinavian area,

921
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.260
we'll actually get it on Monday morning so I don't have to listen to people

922
00:57:51.261 --> 00:57:54.440
fucking bitching at me.
Um,

923
00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.200
I just went to a,
I went to a Grammy's party.
Can you believe that?

924
00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.810
Happy me.
Went to a Grammy's party.

925
00:58:02.811 --> 00:58:06.680
I lasted an hour and 20 minutes and um,

926
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:12.210
I watched the first little number there,
um,
where they had the,
the,

927
00:58:12.211 --> 00:58:16.580
the five whaling whores,
you know,
just

928
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.980
<v 9>reaching like a bunch of God damn alley cats.
Like how did,</v>

929
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.580
how did that become singing?
It's like they,

930
00:58:23.581 --> 00:58:28.060
they are amazing singers.
All right.
The,
uh,
the black chick.

931
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.630
It used to be the fat chick is now the skinny chick.
She's out there.

932
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:33.010
Waylon shaken her fucking,

933
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:37.760
we've around Christina Aguilera with their fucking booze face,
right?

934
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:42.790
And her little fucking special Horry Mike stand.
She's wailing away.

935
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.240
Then they had was that,
that Kathy Griffin,
look and check all of them.

936
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:49.840
The old Whitney Houston look broad.

937
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.841
They dragged out all just hitting every note that they could possibly hit every

938
00:58:56.261 --> 00:59:00.040
12 fucking seconds.
They sounded like a bunch of fucking alley cats.

939
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:01.833
Whoa.

940
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.713
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

941
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.530
<v 0>Shut up.
Alia.</v>

942
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.550
The fuck is wrong with you.
Sing the Goddamn Song.

943
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.003
<v 1>You know,</v>

944
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.180
<v 0>you fucking hold on to it and then you surprise people.
Then you wan Lee Shit.</v>

945
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.160
Just get up there fucking screaming like someone standing on your foot that's

946
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:29.090
not fucking singing
all five of them.

947
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:35.230
Somebody just needed to sit them down.
Oh.
And then they're dead.
Fucking amazing.

948
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:40.370
Created one comes out,
uh,
Lady Gaga.
Right?
You know what?

949
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:44.150
I can't stand.
I hate paint by numbers.
Shock.

950
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.740
I can't fucking stand it.
And uh,
but it's,
it's a,

951
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:52.260
it's a very smart career choice.
She works.

952
00:59:52.261 --> 00:59:56.540
She was on the red carpet and she fucking was in,
uh,
uh,

953
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.330
what the fuck was she in?
What is a proper medical?
An ovary.
What the fuck was,

954
01:00:02.331 --> 01:00:06.140
she was in a womb,
her warm is sopa loaded.

955
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.040
She was in a fucking wome,
right?
I mean,

956
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.100
that is like fucking page one of stupid ass,

957
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.740
like a stupid college student film from like 1963.

958
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.550
That was like shocking when Jim Morrison first started shaving.

959
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.200
All right.
Jesus Christ,
you show up in the fucking thing.

960
01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:34.550
More cues to be in that supposed to be artistic and everybody's supposed to be,

961
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.150
you know,

962
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.840
and I'm a tell you fucking right now she's going to be around for 40 fucking

963
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:43.280
years because people who do that shit,
it's,
I dunno,

964
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.630
I dunno
what's,
what's she going to do next year?
You,

965
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.360
she gonna show up next year and like an old shoe and then come out dressed in

966
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.090
like a socket miniskirt you know,

967
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:55.850
commenting on the shoeless people in the fucking world.

968
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.940
And then she goes out and she sings basically a Madonna Song.

969
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.980
I was at the party and everyone was singing Madonna song over it and it and it,

970
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.480
and it meshed perfectly with it.
Express yourself.

971
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.470
Sounded like what she was singing and then she had all these fucking people

972
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.120
dancing around her,
right?

973
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:19.570
And then they have like that expressionless like a post apocalyptic makeup on,

974
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.350
you know,
that they owe hs was fucking horrific.
And at that point,
you know,

975
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.520
at this point I'm in the kitchen and I'm eating a fucking slice of cheesecake

976
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:33.980
just for what,
what am I eating it for?
You know,
why am I eat?

977
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:38.660
I'm just doing that so I can avoid that other shit.

978
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.110
It was horrific.
And I had a real brutal day.

979
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.260
I got a flat tire on my Prius.
Uh,
fuck.

980
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.810
It was just,
you know,
if one of those deals where,
uh,
the,

981
01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.590
the front left tire was low,
all right.

982
01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.350
And I see that it's low.
So I go to a gas station,
I go,
I'm like,
well that's odd.

983
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.730
So I put air in the tire.
This,
this whole fucking thing was my fault,
right?

984
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:08.520
So I put air in the tire and then I just kind of keep an eye on it.

985
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:12.250
It's went down a little bit,
but not as much as it had in back of my head.

986
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.710
My brain's going like,
dude,
what are you,
what are you fucking idiot?
Take it,

987
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.160
take it over to somebody and check.
You probably got a slow leak.

988
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:20.130
Maybe they can patch it up,
blah blah blah blah blah.

989
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.280
<v 11>And I fucking blow it off.
Start driving 70 miles an hour.</v>

990
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.810
Just completely ignoring the fucking thing.

991
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:28.440
You know in the back of my head the entire time I've owned the car I'm like,

992
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:29.610
you know bill,
you know,

993
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.820
okay you know this thing has one of those pieces of Shit Jacks that you have to

994
01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:37.170
assemble and then it has that little hand crank.

995
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.200
Like I'm trying to start like a fucking model t in the early 19 hundreds right.

996
01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.820
<v 0>I knew that and I knew it was going to have some half ass fucking that l shape</v>

997
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:51.410
lug nut thing that you can get like half a pound of torque on and there's no way

998
01:02:51.411 --> 01:02:52.610
to get the lug nuts off.

999
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:57.150
Cause they fucking put a mom a dad thing and they don't,
they,

1000
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.840
they don't stop after it's tight and they go

1001
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.410
like,
they fucking,
there's no way to get that thing you need.

1002
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.470
I knew what I needed.
I needed a,

1003
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:13.070
you need a big piece of pipe that you fit over that piece of shit,

1004
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.110
right angle fucking lug nut thing and then you can,

1005
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:21.830
you can take them off and I didn't have it.
So whatever.
So I went to go do for,

1006
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.270
uh,
I went to go do the long shot podcasts,

1007
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:31.480
right?
I was doing that fucking thing and I'm driving out

1008
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.030
<v 11>and um,</v>

1009
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:37.220
I just hear this noise and my car wasn't moving smoothly and I was like that,

1010
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.800
do I have the emergency brake on?
What the fuck's going on?
Then I go,
Oh God,

1011
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:46.020
oh Geesh.
And I pull over and there I am riding on the fucking rim.

1012
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.470
So I'm like,
Nah,
I,

1013
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:52.200
and I drive a Prius so I'm already on for spare tires to begin with.
Okay.

1014
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:56.520
God knows what the fucking temporary spares gonna look like.
Um,

1015
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.940
turns out,
it looks like,
you know,
when you used,
when you suck on a fucking

1016
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:05.140
<v 0>lifesaver,
a lifesaver,
you know,
you know when you get to that point,
right.</v>

1017
01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:09.160
We have just tried to keep sucking on it without breaking it and you get to that

1018
01:04:09.161 --> 01:04:12.790
point right before it breaks.
That's,
that's what my temporary spare looks like.

1019
01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:14.590
And the rim is painted bright yellow.

1020
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:16.830
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1021
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:21.480
<v 0>Uh,
I have a picture of it,
which will be up on the m M podcast.com.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

1022
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.930
anyways,
uh,
I pull into a gas station,

1023
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.470
which back in the day 12 guys would attack my car and what have the fucking

1024
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:31.710
thing change before I even stopped.
But now you show up,

1025
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:36.210
there's no garage at a gas station anymore because that entire area is to sell

1026
01:04:36.211 --> 01:04:38.340
fucking Ho hos and snowballs.

1027
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:40.910
<v 11>Um,
and gum.</v>

1028
01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.610
<v 0>So I walk in,
I say,
yeah,
listen,
I got a flat,
can you,
can you call a tow truck?</v>

1029
01:04:45.611 --> 01:04:48.640
He goes,
well,
yeah,
I mean,
you know,
I can basically do what you do.

1030
01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:49.900
I just call information.

1031
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:56.030
<v 11>Sounds like I get it.
I understand this wasn't your dream in life,
was it?
Okay,</v>

1032
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.180
I'll go fuck myself.
So I go back out to the hotel,
a hotel.

1033
01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:03.470
I go out to the fucking,
uh,
the God damn parking lot,
right?

1034
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.460
And immediately,
you know,
homeless people start approaching me like,
like,

1035
01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.190
I mean a Zombie movie,
you know?

1036
01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.780
<v 0>Yeah.
You don't notice if you just go to get gas at a gas station,</v>

1037
01:05:14.781 --> 01:05:18.010
you don't realize all the Weirdos.
But when you're fucking sitting there and you

1038
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.500
<v 11>have a flat and there's nowhere to go,</v>

1039
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:22.630
they just didn't come out of fucking nowhere.
And I'm like,

1040
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:26.560
why are there all these fucking homeless people at a God damn gas station?

1041
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:31.510
I don't fucking understand.
They don't have cars
if fucking homeless.
Right.

1042
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:35.620
Why are they are,
are they at the gas station?
And it turns out,

1043
01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:39.280
I finally figured it out,
especially in La,
which is everybody drives,

1044
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:41.340
there's no one to panhandle to.

1045
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:44.830
You need to get them when they're getting out of their fucking cars.

1046
01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:48.130
So they hang at the God damn gas stations.
These people keep showing up,

1047
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:54.570
you know,
hey man,
can you give me a dollar?
No,
I can't go fuck yourself.

1048
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:58.440
All right,
because you'll look like a drunk,
sir.

1049
01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:02.070
You don't look like a guy who lost his job and he's down on his luck.

1050
01:06:02.071 --> 01:06:07.020
You look like a fucking drunk.
All right.
Fucking loser.

1051
01:06:07.021 --> 01:06:11.250
Get out of here.
Get a job.
You're a bum.
You understand me?
You're not homeless.

1052
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.840
You're a fucking bum.
That was my attitude.
And anyways,
so uh,

1053
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.010
call up,
you know,
I call up the tow truck

1054
01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:23.470
[inaudible] 10 minutes by Fred [inaudible].
That shit,
you know,

1055
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.400
then you call them back.
20 off,
20 minutes later,

1056
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.020
my friend Fred to 20 minutes per tap app.
App App,
right.

1057
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:36.090
Fucking debt goes on.
10 minutes was like an hour and a half and I was a little,

1058
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.740
not already 15 minutes and I was just sitting there going like,

1059
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:45.490
what did I call it?
Like three at like four 10 past four.
I was like,

1060
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.050
if this fucking Douche doesn't get here by four 15,
all right,

1061
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.330
I'm calling a friend,

1062
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:55.150
I'm going over to a hardware store and I'm buying a piece of fucking pipe and

1063
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:57.730
I'm going to,
I'm going to figure out my jack and I'm going to do this myself.

1064
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:02.800
Unfortunately,
this fucking guy finally shows up with his giant Goddamn truck,

1065
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.320
which he leaves running,
which is fantastic,
right?

1066
01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:09.640
So we can just sit there breathing in the fumes and uh,
you know,
whatever.

1067
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:14.500
He fucking changed the tide,
the goddamn tire.
And,
uh,

1068
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.450
this temporary spare is so God damn small.
Um,

1069
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.390
I just drove home with it and I parked the car and I'm like,
that's it.
I'm done.

1070
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.410
I'm dry.
I'm driving this car home and then I'm driving it over to the dealership

1071
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:33.970
tomorrow.
That is it.
That is how small his fucking tire is.
Like the,

1072
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:38.740
what the fuck light was on,
on my dashboard with a temporary spare.

1073
01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:43.330
So,
uh,
I don't know.
That's my fucking,
that was my God damn day.

1074
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:48.580
That's what happened to me today.
People
don't really take me 15 minutes to tell.

1075
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:50.140
You got to fucking flat on my car.

1076
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:54.010
Are you really still listening to this or you may get upset with me.
Um,

1077
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:56.320
somebody sent me this article,
actually the,
the,
uh,

1078
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:59.110
the person who runs the MM podcast.com,

1079
01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:03.550
the official podcast page of the Monday morning podcast,
uh,
sent me this,

1080
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.630
this article here.
Um,

1081
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:12.660
it's called the day of the lout l o u t from the Los Angeles Times and it's

1082
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:15.550
written,
um,

1083
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.910
<v 0>bias actually by some guy,
believe it or not.</v>

1084
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:23.180
And it says unsophisticated,
lazy,

1085
01:08:23.181 --> 01:08:28.181
misogynistic males may be the primary model for today's young American men.

1086
01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.970
Uh,
and I'm sitting there going,
where the fuck is this guy seeing this?

1087
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:38.810
Because all I see is a bunch of pussy whipped fags,
you know?

1088
01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:40.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1089
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:40.951
<v 0>All right.
Since the way he says,</v>

1090
01:08:40.951 --> 01:08:45.510
if you've seen a beer commercial the last two years and how can you avoid them?

1091
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:49.230
Well,
you could read,
you could Tivo shows.

1092
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.290
See Right off the bat,
this guy's a Douche.

1093
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.460
She's trashing men and now he has problems with beer commercials.

1094
01:08:55.730 --> 01:09:00.680
How could you avoid them?
I mean room.
Um,
he says,
you know,
the type,

1095
01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:03.710
he's,
he's a 20 or 30,
something,

1096
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.740
sort of a slacker with a beautiful and adoring girlfriend who just can't seem to

1097
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.920
prize attention away from his suds.
She expresses ardor.

1098
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.660
He looks ardently at his mug or can of beer.
I don't know what art means.

1099
01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:21.230
I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
She wants to talk romance.

1100
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:24.740
He wants to talk anything.
But she gets exasperated.

1101
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.600
He snuggles obviously with his beer and she departs in a huff.

1102
01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Most Martin takes on manhood say that guys will do anything to bed a woman.

1103
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:39.380
But this is a new kind of man and he seems to be everywhere these days,

1104
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.290
not just on beer commercials,
but in movies,

1105
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:47.291
on TV on hundreds of morning radio shows and in bestselling books to the point

1106
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.620
where he's generating a culture of new masculinity.

1107
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:57.290
He may even be the primary model for young manhood in America today.

1108
01:09:58.410 --> 01:09:58.821
All right?

1109
01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:03.821
This guy has clearly decided to just completely ignore how much women are

1110
01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:12.311
fucking pandered to and how you can make a guy look like an absolute retard in

1111
01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:16.750
any commercial.
They always make the,
for the most part,

1112
01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:20.530
so many commercials make the guide look like the moron.
You know,

1113
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:25.240
I'm not saying 100%,
but can't they have a couple ones where the guy is a dick?

1114
01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:30.640
I'm not saying in every,
in every commercial,
every TV show,

1115
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.360
the guy's gotta be cool and he should act like he doesn't give a shit about his

1116
01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:39.300
wife.
But I mean,
I dunno if I should legally be saying this,

1117
01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.290
but,
uh,

1118
01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.780
there's three things that recently,

1119
01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.880
how the fuck can I put this?

1120
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1121
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.860
<v 0>Uh,
show ideas,
pilots that are being made out here in Hollywood.</v>

1122
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:59.650
You want to hear him?
Fuck it.
Who gives a shit?
Okay.
One of them was a,

1123
01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.350
the idea was for a guy who

1124
01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.780
the audition was to play a guy who actually speaks his mind.

1125
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:14.280
But the reason why he speaks his mind is because he got hit on the head and had

1126
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:18.750
a fucking aneurism and he almost died.
So then they're thinking,

1127
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:22.620
is this some weird side effect that a man is actually speaking his mind?

1128
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:23.131
I swear to God,

1129
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:26.940
this is a TV show that they're going to put millions of dollars behind and a,

1130
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:30.690
and this is how he speaks his mind in the pilot.
He actually,
uh,

1131
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.680
uh,
I might get in trouble if I see what the material is.

1132
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.670
He makes a comment about how big the girls asses,
you know,

1133
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.640
but of course he likes it.
He likes it or asked is big.

1134
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:43.410
So it's self serving to women.
Yeah.

1135
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:45.103
<v 13>You know?</v>

1136
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.740
<v 0>Yeah.
It's basically say,
yeah,
it's great that now that we're married,</v>

1137
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:54.840
you've become a dumpy fat.
Fuck sweetheart.
I'm speaking my mind.

1138
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.740
Totally pan or into the broad.

1139
01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:03.030
Then there's another show that's in development.
I guess I can talk about this.

1140
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:06.300
It's in fucking development.
It's not a goddamn secret.
This is the,
this is,

1141
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:10.140
I swear to God,
this is the premise of the show.
Uh,

1142
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.710
two guys realize that it's a woman's world.

1143
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.160
So they decide to dress as women to get jobs at a pharmacy and through dressing

1144
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:23.280
like women,
they become better men.
I swear to God.

1145
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:28.710
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1146
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:31.460
<v 0>All right.
And this is,
I got all of these auditions in a week.</v>

1147
01:12:31.461 --> 01:12:35.300
I said no to all of these.
All right?
Because I would,
I would become a,

1148
01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:39.290
I would become an alcoholic.
I don't give up.
I don't need,
I don't need that.

1149
01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.520
All right.
I'm already a fuck up.
I could,
there's no fucking way.

1150
01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:46.580
And then the last one was a guy who is in the shadow of his spouse,

1151
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:49.880
uh,
his,

1152
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.880
his famous spouse and gets upset because he's always teased that he's the wife

1153
01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.740
in the relationship.
And the guy's first name is Gail,
you know,

1154
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:03.080
that's could go either way.
Like gale sayers.

1155
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:05.510
<v 13>Uh Huh.</v>

1156
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.480
<v 0>Yeah.
So I don't know what the fuck this guy is bitching about.</v>

1157
01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:10.230
And there's plenty of those.

1158
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:13.230
There's all those beer commercials where the women are going like,
yeah,

1159
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.320
well I'll,
I'll tell you what's a good beer when you take your skirt off,

1160
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.240
you half a fucking pussy,
right?

1161
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.410
All those ones in the guys wearing the tight jeans and looking like Douche bags

1162
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:24.540
and having sunglasses on.

1163
01:13:24.541 --> 01:13:29.130
So this guy just chose to look at this very spot.
This is like a guy,

1164
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:30.960
this Guy Neil.

1165
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.260
I bet he got the shit kicked out of him in high school by guys like this.

1166
01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.660
And what kind of a guy really gets annoyed?
Buy Beer commercials.

1167
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.000
Really?
Are they really dumb?

1168
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:45.590
Do they really fucking appeal to the lowest common denominator?

1169
01:13:45.591 --> 01:13:49.670
Of course they do.
Your fucking moron.
You want some art?
Go rent a good movie.

1170
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.910
Well I think,
oh well is,
is he like,

1171
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:57.020
like reminiscing back in the day when they had good beer commercials,

1172
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:58.910
quality beer commercials,

1173
01:13:58.911 --> 01:14:01.310
sweat when they had those fucking lizards talking to each other.

1174
01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.513
<v 13>I Dunno</v>

1175
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:08.990
<v 0>Neal Gabler go fuck yourself.
You got everybody trying to get laid this week?</v>

1176
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.100
Is that what you had to write that loud?
Um,

1177
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.720
<v 11>so anyways,
did that go anywhere?</v>

1178
01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:18.280
Has his podcast going anywhere to 22 fucking minutes in Jesus.
Yeah.
Oh,

1179
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:22.240
fucking geezers.
Um,
what's actually,
let's,
let's read some things here.

1180
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.130
Yeah.
Bill,
that that'll make it better if you actually start to read.
You know,

1181
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:30.700
it was funny,
as I sat there,
I was at that,
that Goddamn a grammy party,

1182
01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:34.690
and I was trashing lady Gaga.
Knowing in the back of my head,

1183
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:36.580
it was annoying the shit out of my girlfriend.

1184
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.400
She absolutely hates my behavior.
When I go to parties.

1185
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.420
She can't stand it.
She thinks I'm antisocial and she thinks when I say things,

1186
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:47.860
I just say douchey things.

1187
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:51.063
<v 13>MMM.</v>

1188
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.150
<v 11>I don't know what it is.
She,
someone who kind of goes,
all I can say,</v>

1189
01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:57.580
she goes along,
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but like,

1190
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.273
<v 13>mmm,</v>

1191
01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.870
<v 11>she's not happy with me right now.
She doesn't like that.</v>

1192
01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:07.830
I made fun of Lady Gaga who was evidently singing express yourself.

1193
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.613
<v 13>I Dunno.</v>

1194
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:14.460
<v 11>What the fuck was I supposed to do?
I walked in there.
I just,</v>

1195
01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.330
I immediately didn't feel comfortable.
I just,
I dunno.
All right,

1196
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:22.560
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
how about some advice?

1197
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:25.110
I haven't done one of these in a while when I give something my bed.
Oh,

1198
01:15:25.111 --> 01:15:28.920
here's a guy bitching about a two drink minimums at comedy clubs,

1199
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:33.330
says a bilge.
Jimmy Norton is my favorite comic.
Um,

1200
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.520
he's getting ready to go on right now at the Melrose improv yet.

1201
01:15:37.521 --> 01:15:42.180
Jim Norton played the Improv right here in Melrose,
right here in Los Angeles,

1202
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:47.700
um,
Saturday night.
So his favorite comedian is Jimmy Norton.
And uh,

1203
01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:50.570
he says,
I guess he's writing this as the show's Bart raid happened.

1204
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.330
He says he's ready to go on right now with the Melrose improv Saturday night.

1205
01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.660
Guess who's not there?
Not just me,

1206
01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:02.280
but probably 50 other assholes that love him and we could,
would kill to see him.

1207
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:07.920
I know it's not Jimmy's fault.
Uh,
it's not any of the performer's fault,

1208
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.840
but are any of these cock sucking club owners are aware that the economy,

1209
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:16.470
that the economy is in the fucking toilet right now?
No Sir.

1210
01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.600
I'm sure they have no idea.

1211
01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:22.500
Considering when the economy goes into the toilet,

1212
01:16:22.501 --> 01:16:26.490
one of the first things people cut out as entertainment.
Yeah,

1213
01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:30.750
I'm sure they're completely immune.
To the economy.

1214
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.210
The economy,
sorry,
my voice is cracking.

1215
01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:38.430
He said I've skipped most of the handful of live type events I've wanted to see

1216
01:16:38.431 --> 01:16:43.140
for the last six months or so because of this exorbitantly priced shit.

1217
01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:46.440
How can these clubs justify selling the place,

1218
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500
selling the place out with $25 tickets to see the guy then charge their two

1219
01:16:52.381 --> 01:16:55.050
drink minimum with their $8 beers,

1220
01:16:55.051 --> 01:16:58.620
$6 bottle waters and $10 mixed strengths.

1221
01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:00.600
So when all is said and done,

1222
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:05.780
you've spent like $40 or more to see a comic who can afford that kind of shit.

1223
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.310
I don't know sir.
With a paper

1224
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:15.230
<v 0>route,
you're really complaining that it costs 40 fucking dollars,</v>

1225
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:18.980
sir.
This is how it works.

1226
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.500
Do you know you have expenses in life?

1227
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:26.240
Club owners also have expenses.
They have to pay the comedian.

1228
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:31.130
All right?
They have to pay taxes,

1229
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.890
they have to pay to get a liquor license,

1230
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.130
they have to pay all of that shit and then they have to be

1231
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.440
<v 11>pay their mortgages and all of that type of stuff.</v>

1232
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.680
And the reason why they have a two drink minimum is because tight fox would go

1233
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:50.370
there and just order waters and they wouldn't make any money and they would go

1234
01:17:50.371 --> 01:17:52.200
out of business.
All right,

1235
01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:57.060
now I'm not mocking you because you can't afford $40 I guess I kind of made

1236
01:17:57.061 --> 01:17:58.380
funny,
but what the fuck,
sir?

1237
01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:04.480
<v 0>$40 how much does it cost to go to a football game?
Costs 20 bucks to park.</v>

1238
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.053
All right

1239
01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.520
<v 11>to go down and see the great Jimmy Norton for Florida.</v>

1240
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:13.360
$40 you're gonna fucking complain about that because you got to buy a couple of

1241
01:18:13.361 --> 01:18:14.870
$10 Shirley temples.

1242
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:16.870
<v 0>You know,
you know what your problem is,
Sarah?</v>

1243
01:18:16.871 --> 01:18:18.370
I don't think you have your priorities straight.

1244
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:23.470
You don't look around your apartment.
You know what?

1245
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:25.990
Are you guys ready to get a George Foreman Grill?
How much did that cost?

1246
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:31.480
You know,
does it really work?
You know,
cooks chicken and fucking eight minutes.

1247
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.480
Yeah.
How does that taste?
Was that worth it?

1248
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:41.770
Do you ever see fucking George Foreman's house?
Just got to get so fucking rich.

1249
01:18:41.771 --> 01:18:45.560
She named all these kids the same goddamn name.
That's how fucking Richie is.

1250
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:47.720
Like he doesn't need to

1251
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:50.600
<v 11>give a fuck that,
that he do something like that.
Sorry.</v>

1252
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:53.880
You're way out of line complaining about that.
Okay.
You know what you sound like,

1253
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.810
you sound like all these kids today who go on Youtube and they get upset when a

1254
01:18:57.811 --> 01:19:02.280
video gets taken down these fuck goddamn copyright crunch.

1255
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:07.200
It's like they,
they don't seem to understand that things cost money.

1256
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.450
So you have to charge for them.

1257
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:14.690
And when you put up hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce a film or saw a

1258
01:19:15.241 --> 01:19:19.950
music or an album that if people just take it and they put it on fucking
youtube,

1259
01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.500
<v 0>you don't get your money back.
You know?
So there you go.
Sir.</v>

1260
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:27.900
Believer it or not a comedy club,

1261
01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:31.760
it costs money to run a comedy club.

1262
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:37.390
And not to mention sometimes they give comedians guarantees like no matter if

1263
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:43.280
five people show up a 500 we still have to pay you this amount of money.

1264
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.600
And then when five people show up,
they lose their goddamn shirts.

1265
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.400
It's not like they're making tons of fucking money every God damn weekend.

1266
01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:56.240
There's a lot of shit that goes into it.
And like I said,
you know,

1267
01:19:56.241 --> 01:19:59.360
people are tight fucks and if he didn't make them buy drinks,

1268
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.440
they would just sit there

1269
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:05.070
<v 11>booze in the parking lot and then they would just fucking sit there and the club</v>

1270
01:20:05.071 --> 01:20:08.310
would go out of business.
So I think 40 to see a

1271
01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.740
<v 0>one of the top comp comics in the country,</v>

1272
01:20:10.741 --> 01:20:14.290
I think that's pretty God damn reasonable.
And uh,
you know,

1273
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.830
I don't want to tell you how much it costs to go to a fucking movie.

1274
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.210
At least half that is John Travolta standing.

1275
01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.200
They alive dancing for you.
He isn't.

1276
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.430
I don't know.
Am I being a Dick here?
Where did I lose the funny on this podcast?

1277
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:35.760
Because I already did an hour long podcast for somebody else today.

1278
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:40.360
I think I'm all podcast it out.
All right,
let's get to,

1279
01:20:40.361 --> 01:20:43.360
is it racist,
racist?
Um,

1280
01:20:43.361 --> 01:20:46.660
this is the new of the new fucking thing here that everybody seems to like.
Uh,

1281
01:20:46.661 --> 01:20:49.240
is it racist?
Um,
Bill,
although I thought,

1282
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:53.290
I also thought I'd share a little game that I used to play.

1283
01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.840
I like this one right here.
This is a great game.
You know,

1284
01:20:55.841 --> 01:21:00.430
I played that older Asian game.
Anytime anybody cuts me off in traffic,
uh,

1285
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.220
somebody says a turnoff.
I,
this is a game I like to play.

1286
01:21:03.221 --> 01:21:06.160
I turn on the TV and without looking,

1287
01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.980
I try to guess the race of the person talking.

1288
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.470
I call it the Tony Gwynn game.

1289
01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.150
Now for those of you who aren't sports fans,

1290
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:21.630
Tony Gwynn is African American and he sounds like a def jam comic imitating a

1291
01:21:23.531 --> 01:21:26.590
White Guy.
If you closed your eyes,

1292
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.930
you wouldn't even think that you were listening to a white guy.

1293
01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:31.990
You would think you were listening to a black guy imitating a white guy.

1294
01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:37.490
He,
he,
he talks like he basically like,
yeah,

1295
01:21:37.491 --> 01:21:41.420
I was talking to Ted Williams the other day and he's really big on headache.
Dad.

1296
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:43.730
Uh,
I'm,
I'm not,
I can't even do it.
I'm not even doing it.

1297
01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.780
Well not even doing it justice.
And I asked him how to hit the other side.

1298
01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:54.180
Curve Ball.
Um,
the Tony Gwynn game.
Yeah.
Cause he is the wild card.

1299
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:58.610
Do you guys tickets racist?
Like,
I remember back in the day when the Oj trial,

1300
01:21:58.611 --> 01:21:59.090
when,
uh,

1301
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:03.260
someone said they heard some yelling and it's sounded like a black guy and

1302
01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:06.020
people tried to say that that was racist and it's like,

1303
01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:09.860
that is not fucking racist.
You know what I mean?

1304
01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.700
If you heard somebody on the other side of a fence going,
ah,
it's,

1305
01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:19.310
it's a petty smart,
right.
Would you be like,
oh,
let's,
I think that they're,

1306
01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:20.680
that guy could be Italian,

1307
01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:26.770
sorry for my Hacky fucking Asian offensive,
uh,
accent there.

1308
01:22:26.771 --> 01:22:29.830
But you know what I mean?
Like if you were to listen to me,

1309
01:22:29.831 --> 01:22:32.770
not only would you know I was a guest that I was a white guy,

1310
01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.260
you would guess that I was from the east coast,
wouldn't ya?

1311
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:41.000
Just cause you can guess who the fuck somebody is.

1312
01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.310
Doesn't mean it's racist.
That's like somebody,
somebody send me an email,
said,

1313
01:22:46.311 --> 01:22:48.320
bill,
he goes,
you're older.

1314
01:22:48.321 --> 01:22:51.380
Asian game is racist as shit.

1315
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:55.790
I'm sorry that that was the person's entire fucking email.

1316
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:59.300
It's like you would call,
can you,

1317
01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.440
can you elaborate a little bit so you can enlighten me?

1318
01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.610
Your game is racist as shit.
Oh,
well,
you know,
thanks for clearing that up.

1319
01:23:08.611 --> 01:23:13.050
I don't know what you're apologizing for.
I hate when people say I hate that.

1320
01:23:13.051 --> 01:23:17.730
That's like that fucking,
uh,
you know,
you know,
I listened to your act.

1321
01:23:17.731 --> 01:23:20.120
I didn't like it.
You know,
I'm,
I'm sorry.
I,
I,

1322
01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:24.840
but I didn't like why are you apologizing?
I hate like that whole,

1323
01:23:24.841 --> 01:23:27.990
like you're assuming that you fucking hurt my feelings.

1324
01:23:27.991 --> 01:23:31.710
I don't give a fuck if you take my game is racist or not.

1325
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.900
I know it isn't.
I don't have,

1326
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:38.490
I don't have any bad feelings towards old people or Asians.

1327
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.620
I'm just addressing the fact that most of the time out here when somebody does

1328
01:23:43.621 --> 01:23:46.470
something fucked up,
you know,

1329
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.560
is it racist to say white people can't dance because we can't.

1330
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.100
There are examples.
John Travolta,

1331
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:01.330
I believe I already brought up that man can dance,
but it's not racist if some,

1332
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.240
if somebody black told me said,
you know what?

1333
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:08.860
White people cannot fucking dance.
You guys don't have any fucking rhythm.

1334
01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:13.240
I,
when I sit there and that's not racist,
I'm sorry,

1335
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:15.220
but it isn't.
Um,

1336
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:17.280
<v 1>okay.</v>

1337
01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.480
<v 0>You know,
that's something I actually,</v>

1338
01:24:18.481 --> 01:24:22.230
that hasn't been brought up in this whole is it,
is it racist,
racist,
um,

1339
01:24:22.231 --> 01:24:24.780
topic than I'm doing here is uh,

1340
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:29.810
I think that before you fly off the fucking handle and get offended,

1341
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.050
you have to at least,
you know,
not all the time,

1342
01:24:34.051 --> 01:24:39.051
but 10% of the time don't you feel that you kind of have to own up to the fact

1343
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:42.583
<v 1>that</v>

1344
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.101
<v 0>Ah,
how do I put this?</v>

1345
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:48.740
It's like when Arabs got upset after nine 11 when they were,

1346
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:53.170
they were getting searched for no fucking reason other than the fact that they

1347
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.400
were Arab.
And that's definitely offensive is definitely fucking annoying and,

1348
01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.330
and all of that type of shit,
but on some level,

1349
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:06.820
don't you feel you have a responsibility to address the 18 Arabs that fucked it

1350
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:08.980
up for you.
You know,

1351
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.000
it's like that white people can't fucking dance.
All right.

1352
01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.460
Are they can't jump or whatever.
I mean,

1353
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.280
<v 1>okay,</v>

1354
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.180
<v 0>what am I supposed to do?
You know how offended he is,
but at some point you got,</v>

1355
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:27.090
you kinda gotta like here's one for you.
Let me run me,
read this shit here.
Um,

1356
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.260
not raise my computer goes out.
Uh,
Bill,
I can't really use names,

1357
01:25:30.261 --> 01:25:35.240
but I have a friend who is alignment for a division one football school.

1358
01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.960
He has a friend who plays in the NFL as a wide receiver.
He,

1359
01:25:38.970 --> 01:25:41.600
the wide receivers also white.
Um,

1360
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:45.920
my friend the Lyman told me that the wide receiver told him that he's tried out

1361
01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:47.450
for four NFL teams.

1362
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.720
Two of the four told him his chances of making the team were not good because he

1363
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:57.140
was white.
I've had a few arguments with people.
Uh,
is it racist?

1364
01:25:57.170 --> 01:26:02.170
Should the NFL should at the NFL teams even mentioned the fact that he has less

1365
01:26:02.721 --> 01:26:04.670
of a,
because he's white.
Well,
no,

1366
01:26:04.671 --> 01:26:07.610
they shouldn't because eventually someone's going to sue over that.

1367
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.820
But that comes to that point I was making were you also got to understand where

1368
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:18.950
the stereotype came from,
all those slow fucking white guys.
You know,

1369
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.001
I mean,

1370
01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:24.660
one of the reasons why I think Dan Marino never won a super bowl was because of

1371
01:26:24.661 --> 01:26:26.460
fucking the black lodge brothers.

1372
01:26:26.461 --> 01:26:31.170
He had two white corn evacs you can't win a fucking super bowl with two of them,

1373
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:34.750
maybe one.
But I don't think he could win.

1374
01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:39.990
I don't think he could win with too.
Right.
Am I nuts?
I remember,
uh,
the,

1375
01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:44.130
the,
the comic strip in a,
in a New York City.
I went down there,

1376
01:26:44.131 --> 01:26:45.990
I auditioned in 1990.

1377
01:26:45.991 --> 01:26:50.991
I went and asked to audition and the guy running the club told me I already have

1378
01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:53.250
enough white guys.

1379
01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:58.140
And I knew a lot of comedians who got upset like that gone too.
That's fucked up.

1380
01:26:58.141 --> 01:27:02.850
He would never say,
I already have enough black guys and soap.
Well first of all,

1381
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.240
there's only like at eight black guys working here.
So he wouldn't say that.

1382
01:27:06.241 --> 01:27:09.610
And uh,
I,

1383
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.190
I understood what he meant.
I knew what he meant.

1384
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:18.310
He meant you better have a fucking point of view because I have enough fucking

1385
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:22.940
suburban white guys that can go on and for 20 minutes be like,
you know,

1386
01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.200
<v 14>soap with Bill Clinton,
you know,
end table.
I mean,</v>

1387
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.060
which end do I put it on once,

1388
01:27:30.061 --> 01:27:33.960
you know scribe is stuff is all in the papers.

1389
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:36.103
Yeah,

1390
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:39.650
<v 0>like he had enough people doing,
I totally understood what he was saying.</v>

1391
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.240
He just kind of cut through the fat.

1392
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:45.440
I got enough fucking white comics go in there and do something different or I

1393
01:27:45.441 --> 01:27:48.980
have no use for you.
I understood that and the only people who fucking complain,

1394
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.320
we're lame ass white comedians.
So what am I saying here?

1395
01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.360
Am I justify?
I didn't want them fucking say it.

1396
01:27:56.361 --> 01:28:00.050
I feel like I'm justifying it here.
I'm not,
I'm not justifying it,
but I also,

1397
01:28:00.051 --> 01:28:03.320
I'm just saying you got to tone down the sensitivity here a little bit.
You know?

1398
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:09.200
Right.
Older Asian is not racist as shit.

1399
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:12.530
There's an element of fucking truth to it and there's no hatred in my heart when

1400
01:28:12.531 --> 01:28:14.450
I do it.
I just do it for the laugh.

1401
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.430
I don't drive around screaming about Asian and old people saying we need to get

1402
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.600
them out of the fucking country.

1403
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:24.860
I've added up to hear what their goddamn driving.
They're ruining this country.

1404
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:28.250
They need these old people need to go back to what from where they came from.

1405
01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:31.430
Um,
there's another one.
Uh,
so anyways,

1406
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.020
built tonight I was watching a TV show and I saw a commercial for the Crisp for

1407
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:36.950
Chris Rock's Broadway show.

1408
01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:42.050
They never said the show's name and simply referred to it as the title,

1409
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:44.810
you can't say.
And on the screen,

1410
01:28:44.811 --> 01:28:49.811
the second word of the title was black was blackened out and it read the blank

1411
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:53.720
with the hat.
I immediately thought the n word with the hat.

1412
01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.360
I was also interested in seeing the show.

1413
01:28:56.361 --> 01:28:59.450
So I promptly googled it with no results.

1414
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:04.320
I then went to Chris Rock's only to find the title to the show was the

1415
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:05.790
motherfucker with the hat.

1416
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:10.690
I proceeded to laugh and then thought of you and your bid.
Is it racist?
Raise.

1417
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:15.270
So,
uh,
was that racist bill?
I was on the edge,

1418
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:16.770
but generally thought it was funny.

1419
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:19.680
We'd love to hear your thoughts and your girlfriends too.
Well,

1420
01:29:19.681 --> 01:29:20.670
a knee is not here right now.

1421
01:29:20.671 --> 01:29:25.230
She's mad because of my behavior at the grammys at the Grammy Party.

1422
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.080
Uh,
do I think it's racist?
No,
that's what I would've guessed.
You know,
such,

1423
01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:33.630
it's such a big deal is made out of that word.
The title.

1424
01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:37.290
You can't say Chris always does edgy stuff.

1425
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.450
That's what I would have gone with.
You know,

1426
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:44.960
I'm surprised you can't say the motherfucker with the hat at this point.

1427
01:29:44.961 --> 01:29:48.470
I watched 60 minutes tonight and Andy Rooney said,
God damn.

1428
01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:54.500
And they didn't bleep it out.
So do I think it's racist?
No,
I,
I think I don't,

1429
01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.950
a lot of people would think it was just because you thought the,

1430
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.150
the n word fit in there,
but I,
I maintain this.

1431
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:08.930
Maybe I'm fucking wrong.
You guys can email me,
but I,
I really think it comes,

1432
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:12.640
what's in your heart when you,
when you,
when you're thinking that,

1433
01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:18.010
I mean you were just thinking all the word.
You can't say the title.

1434
01:30:18.011 --> 01:30:19.060
You can't say.
It's always saying,

1435
01:30:19.061 --> 01:30:23.230
you know the end word white people can't say it.
You can't say that.
You know?

1436
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.090
So I,
I have no,
I don't think that that's racist and I have the,

1437
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:29.360
and I would have laughed too when I've read that.

1438
01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.190
That was actually the motherfucker with the hat.
No,
no,
I don't.
All right,

1439
01:30:33.191 --> 01:30:36.940
here we go.
Uh,
hey,
here's another one.
Hey,
Bill.

1440
01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:41.320
Huge fan of a Pitta Pitta.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh,

1441
01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:44.830
anyways,
I have,
I have it,
uh,
is,

1442
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:49.570
is it racist question at my job,
I work with the guy who's not really Mexican,

1443
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.220
but his father is

1444
01:30:57.370 --> 01:30:58.590
what,
what,
so what does that mean?

1445
01:30:58.591 --> 01:31:02.670
Because he's not 100% Mexican because he's had that would make him half Mexican,

1446
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.990
you know,
what are you saying?

1447
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:09.950
He's like a light beer in the Mexican version of that.
Um,
so anyways,

1448
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.540
he's not really Mexican,
but his father is,
uh,
he's from Arizona,

1449
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:19.570
but he looks the type,
I don't get any of that.

1450
01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:22.600
So he's half Mexican,
but he looks full on Mexican is that's what,

1451
01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:25.240
is that what you're saying?
I don't think this one's going to end good.

1452
01:31:25.241 --> 01:31:28.330
I'm going to go on out on a limb here.
Uh,
were okay friends,

1453
01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:30.680
but he can be a huge dick sometimes.
It,

1454
01:31:30.681 --> 01:31:35.230
occasionally I say something that could be considered racist,
like shut up.

1455
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:37.060
Beaner uh,

1456
01:31:37.061 --> 01:31:40.690
but this one time he was working really hard and I just walked by and said,

1457
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:43.180
you people always,

1458
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.630
you people always working hard for little wage.

1459
01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.340
And he was being a huge Dick that day.
Uh,
before I said that,

1460
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.970
and he just laughed and we moved on.
My question is,

1461
01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:58.420
is it racist to say those type of things if the guys,

1462
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.490
if the guys being a complete

1463
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:03.430
<v 11>jack off and deep down you feel,</v>

1464
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:10.370
you feel like it shows them they're being a dick?
Uh,
yes.

1465
01:32:10.371 --> 01:32:11.750
I do think that's racist.

1466
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:15.530
I think if you just said Shit like that is the joke and you guys were friends

1467
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:20.960
and you were fucking around.
It isn't,
but because of the way you're using it,

1468
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:24.170
like when he's being a Dick,
you feel like it,
it,

1469
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:29.360
it shows them that they're being a dick by saying something racist to them.
Yeah.

1470
01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.940
You're kind of taking it out of the,
uh,

1471
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.300
the joke in arena and I'm going to teach this guy a lesson and put him in his

1472
01:32:35.301 --> 01:32:38.490
place.
So,
uh,
and plus also you're,

1473
01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.960
you're fucking kind of naive statements of he's not really Mexican,

1474
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:46.490
but his father is,
but he looks the part.
Yeah.

1475
01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.040
Yeah.
I'd say I'd be in a,
you know,
in a bar with you and probably a is,

1476
01:32:52.041 --> 01:32:55.580
I dunno about 20 minutes in,
you'd say something that I would be like,
you know,

1477
01:32:57.050 --> 01:33:00.050
yeah,
I can get,
what did you say?
Could you say that?
Could you repeat that?

1478
01:33:00.051 --> 01:33:03.510
You know,
trying to,
with the jukebox noise in the background you have,

1479
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.610
but you haven't had that in a fucking bar.
You just hang it out.

1480
01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.730
Perhaps me all the time on the fucking road.
Back when I was boozing,

1481
01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:13.160
I'd be out there and I would just be a,

1482
01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:17.390
I'll tell you one of the weirdest ones I ever had.
I did this bit on,
uh,

1483
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:23.720
uh,
Jamie Foxx laugh,
a Palooza thing.
Um,
Jamie Fox,
by the way,

1484
01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:27.830
who plays my shit all the time on his channel,
on,
uh,

1485
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:33.230
on Sirius Xm,
the foxhole.
I've had more goddamn people come up to me saying,

1486
01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:36.860
I heard you on the Fox hole.
I thought you were funny.
That's why I came up to my,

1487
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:41.780
uh,
out to your show.
So thank you to everyone over there.
Um,
but anyways,

1488
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:46.810
so I did this bit and it was a story that happened to me when I was at,

1489
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.870
when I was in Nashville,
Tennessee.
I was,
uh,

1490
01:33:50.871 --> 01:33:53.780
I was drinking in the bar by myself.
God,

1491
01:33:53.781 --> 01:33:58.370
that sounds like such a great fucking idea.
Hundred 20 days in people.
Oh,

1492
01:33:58.371 --> 01:34:01.290
does that sound like a good idea of drinking by myself?
And I got damn bar.

1493
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.890
I had a couple of fucking years.
Um,

1494
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.600
I'm in Nashville,
Tennessee and Terrell Owens,
this is like,

1495
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:13.390
I don't know how many fucking years ago,
but he was doing what he always does.

1496
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:18.270
Starts off good,
but the team then it becomes a total fucking cunt.
So I said,

1497
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:20.650
I said something to effect of,
can you believe this fucking guy?

1498
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.010
How much goddamn money do you need to make before you're not a dick?
Like,

1499
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:25.510
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

1500
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:27.950
<v 13>And uh,</v>

1501
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:31.510
<v 11>Oh God,
it's been so long since I remember.
This is the guy,</v>

1502
01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:35.380
I'll tell you what the fucking problem is because the guy's a fucking end.

1503
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:36.880
He just dropped the n word

1504
01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:39.650
<v 13>and [inaudible]</v>

1505
01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:45.040
<v 11>I had a fucking know and I immediately was just like,
I immediately though,</v>

1506
01:34:45.041 --> 01:34:47.320
how was it?
I immediately looked around,
I was like,
Oh fuck,

1507
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.240
I'm going to get fucking some black dude is going to punch this guy in the face

1508
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:55.570
through my head cause I'm standing next to him like I'm going to get fucking,

1509
01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.030
they're gonna think I'm with this guy.
So that,
that was,
that's right.

1510
01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.220
This has been a long time since I've told a joke.
That was the joke.

1511
01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:06.020
So the joke was basically he dropped the fucking inward.
Uh,
that's right.

1512
01:35:06.021 --> 01:35:09.260
He didn't say what the Aa,
he said what the R and he didn't pull up on the yard.

1513
01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:12.920
He fucking stuck the landing.
That's how the joke went.
And I felt like,

1514
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:17.690
I just wish there was somewhere I could just act like they wish there was some,

1515
01:35:17.691 --> 01:35:20.240
something that I could have done in that moment to immediately say like,

1516
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:24.920
I didn't know this fucking guy.
You know,
I had no idea.
Everything was normal.

1517
01:35:24.921 --> 01:35:28.280
We would talking football and out of nowhere he starts with his clan rally

1518
01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:31.220
bullshit.
So,
uh,

1519
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.280
and I remember too,
like

1520
01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:39.050
I didn't roll with what he said and I forget what I said,

1521
01:35:39.051 --> 01:35:44.051
but he clearly knew that I was annoyed by him and then he tried to fix it real

1522
01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:51.470
quick and try to say like,
I'm not saying they're all like that.

1523
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:54.760
There are some good ones.
And then it was fuck,
it was like a fucking Sitcom.

1524
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:58.490
And then five seconds later some black dude comes walking in,
right?

1525
01:35:58.491 --> 01:36:00.110
And then he's like,
Oh hey,
how are you doing?

1526
01:36:00.111 --> 01:36:03.980
He's trying to be over-friendly to the guy in some way to make up for the fact

1527
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:05.510
that he dropped the n word to me

1528
01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.020
and the whole fucking thing was phony.

1529
01:36:09.021 --> 01:36:10.820
And then I felt like he was dragging me into it.

1530
01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.510
And I wanted to say to the guy at that point like,
hey,

1531
01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:17.120
why don't you tell that guy some of the shit you were just saying to me five

1532
01:36:17.121 --> 01:36:19.490
seconds ago.
You know all that classic shit.

1533
01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:21.950
When you think of all the funny stuff you should've said in the moment,
you know,

1534
01:36:21.951 --> 01:36:26.300
20 minutes fucking later.
Um,
so anyway,
so I basically,

1535
01:36:26.301 --> 01:36:29.180
I turned that into a bit and I did it on the laugh of Palooza thing.

1536
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:35.110
So like three years later I'm in a North Carolina work in this club and a

1537
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.520
afterwards I'm standing there and I'm talking to this dude who is like the most

1538
01:36:43.521 --> 01:36:47.650
stereotypical redneck guy ever.
You know,

1539
01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.980
he's talking a lot the edge,

1540
01:36:48.981 --> 01:36:53.981
but paper per like if if like if someone from the north did that accent on TV

1541
01:36:53.991 --> 01:36:55.640
would be considered like offensive.

1542
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:59.330
That's like how fucking hardcore this guy was.
You know,
you know,

1543
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:03.240
I was all my tractor the other day and I was listening to,
you know,

1544
01:37:03.241 --> 01:37:05.000
all of my 81 I'm off pigs,

1545
01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:09.770
got out his labs are you stuff I could barely catch them.

1546
01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.230
I mean like telling me stories like that.
Right.

1547
01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.740
But then he starts talking about my comedy and he was really breaking it down

1548
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:23.000
and just talking about
like in a really intelligent way was breaking thing down.

1549
01:37:23.001 --> 01:37:25.640
I was sticking my head like,
this is why I love doing the road,

1550
01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.590
because you meet all these fucking people.

1551
01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:30.770
You have all these preconceived notions.
I'm a fucking looking at this guy.

1552
01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:35.540
Like this guy's a God damn hillbilly and here he is breaking down comedy in my

1553
01:37:35.541 --> 01:37:36.770
act in particular,

1554
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:42.890
like borderline on the level that a comedian could.
So I was like,
oh,

1555
01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.300
and this is why I love doing the road.

1556
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:46.370
This is why this is what makes you worldly.

1557
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:51.110
This is how you know it makes you stop thinking ignorant shit,
you know,

1558
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:53.930
which is hilarious.
All the ignorance should I say in my pocket,
whatever.

1559
01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.990
He makes you less ignorant.
So right

1560
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.950
<v 0>as I'm having that feel good moment thinking about this dude,</v>

1561
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:02.880
I forget what the fuck,
what the fuck happened.

1562
01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:07.350
But then out of nowhere he piece said he was telling his story.
Oh,

1563
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:11.760
he actually alluded to the tea actually brought up the joke that I,

1564
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:14.270
the story that I told about being in Nashville and the,

1565
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:18.360
and the guy dropping the n word and he knew why it was funny and he broke that

1566
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:21.870
whole joke down.
He had this really redneck Yat accent,
and I was like,

1567
01:38:21.871 --> 01:38:22.550
look at that.
See,

1568
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:26.820
then I'll fucking racist right then I don't know where he starts telling some

1569
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:31.560
fucking story,
trying to make me laugh.
And he got,
and then his punchline,

1570
01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.610
he'd gotten himself into some sort of predicament.
And then his punchline was,

1571
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:39.180
I was more nervous than an n war.
Then Mike Tice,
no,

1572
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:43.350
I was more nervous than an n word in a,
in a,
uh,

1573
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.530
in a spelling bee or something.
He dropped the fucking Edward.

1574
01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.150
And I remember going,

1575
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.120
I just said out loud to myself with the fucking music was so loud.
I was just,

1576
01:38:55.121 --> 01:38:57.640
I was just like,
and then that happened.

1577
01:38:59.150 --> 01:38:59.983
<v 13>So</v>

1578
01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:02.240
<v 0>I said to the guy,
I go,
dude,</v>

1579
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:07.270
you just broke down that fucking joke where I talked about somebody doing that.

1580
01:39:09.201 --> 01:39:14.170
And then five minutes later you do it.
And he say,

1581
01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.380
yeah,
I love that joke.
Hey,
like he still didn't get it three times.

1582
01:39:18.381 --> 01:39:22.630
I fucking went in trying to explain to him what the fuck just at,

1583
01:39:22.631 --> 01:39:26.780
why would you do that?
And just never fucking dawned on him.

1584
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:29.980
<v 0>And then I,
I just,
uh,</v>

1586
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:35.310
he was talking to me and I just walked away like mid sentence as he [inaudible]

1587
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:41.040
fear and I just fucking walked away.
And uh,
wow.

1588
01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:41.531
What else?

1589
01:39:41.531 --> 01:39:45.430
Then I went to the other side of the bar and I remember there was these four

1590
01:39:45.431 --> 01:39:48.760
chicks were dancing on the bar during the coyote ugly thing.

1591
01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.710
And one of them was a fat chick who was not sexy but was dancing in a very sexy

1592
01:39:53.711 --> 01:39:57.340
way.
And I remember being annoyed at her.
I was really fucking annoyed

1593
01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:02.500
that she had the confidence to do that.
I was like,
why your horror,

1594
01:40:02.690 --> 01:40:05.650
if you should be off the bar doing setups,
you should

1595
01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.100
<v 13>feel shame and you don't.</v>

1596
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.110
<v 0>And I dunno.
Normally that would've made me laugh,
I guess,</v>

1597
01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:14.620
but maybe because what the fuck happened over that?

1598
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:15.930
You remember being really annoyed?

1599
01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:18.523
<v 13>Uh,</v>

1600
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:22.890
<v 0>I don't fucking know.
Do you know I went on,
I had such a fucked up week.</v>

1601
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.920
I don't even know what that fat chick just reminded me of something I went to.

1602
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:28.560
I went on a couple's date to a cheesecake factory.

1603
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:30.603
<v 13>MMM.</v>

1604
01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:34.600
<v 0>And in defense they said,
look,
we don't have to go there,</v>

1605
01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:36.160
but you know they got kids and shit.

1606
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.130
They just picked something quick and you people know how I feel about the

1607
01:40:39.131 --> 01:40:41.440
cheesecake factory.
But I was like,
you know,
I don't give a fuck.

1608
01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.170
It's better than Apple Bee's.
I'll go over there.
It's,

1609
01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:46.130
you know the talking about going in an hour.

1610
01:40:46.131 --> 01:40:48.730
So I go over there and I just want to tell you guys something just in case,

1611
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.880
just in case you don't know the cheese cake factory fucking sucks.

1612
01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:59.770
<v 11>All right?
It's,
that is horrible food.
Horrific,</v>

1613
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:01.720
horrible fucking food.

1614
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:06.760
And the reason why I'm saying this is because every time I fucking walked by one

1615
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:09.400
of them,
it is jam packed with people.

1616
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:11.860
Line out the fucking door.

1617
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:17.040
Everybody holding those little vibrating things waiting to get called to go into

1618
01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:21.100
to to a fucking table,
which is exactly what happened to us.
And I went in there,

1619
01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.080
I ordered the Kobe beef burger.

1620
01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:28.230
I went as high up on the menu as I could and I still felt like I fucking ate a

1621
01:41:28.451 --> 01:41:33.451
part of my God damn dresser just sitting in my fucking stomach like a Goddamn

1622
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:36.970
old boot.
Horrible fucking food.

1623
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:41.320
Can you people please stop going to that restaurant?

1624
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.160
So he was telling me tonight they don't even advertise on TV.
They don't have to.

1625
01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.910
People just line up.
They just think it's fucking good.

1626
01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.900
I like lady Gaga

1627
01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:59.650
coming in and that fucking egg from the morgue show.

1628
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.690
You know what's going to kill me is,

1629
01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.280
is when people just going to talk about like how outrageous that was.

1630
01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:10.070
You know who thinks like that type of shit is outrageous.

1631
01:42:10.071 --> 01:42:13.610
People who found themselves with their hands when they begin to cry.

1632
01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.360
If you ever seen people like that,
when they start getting emotional,

1633
01:42:17.361 --> 01:42:18.530
they fan their face.

1634
01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:25.610
What the fuck I'm talking about anymore?
Let's get the youtube videos.

1635
01:42:25.611 --> 01:42:27.860
At this point I'm really in a fucking grumpy ass mood.

1636
01:42:27.861 --> 01:42:31.010
I had a bad burger this weekend.
I had a fucking flat tire.

1637
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:37.770
Got It.
God Damn Yellow.
Spare goddamn breath mint for a fucking temporary spare.

1638
01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:41.610
This is just a miserable fucking podcast.
And I was in a good mood too.

1639
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.430
All right.
Youtube videos of the week.
Uh,
NFL trick shot,

1640
01:42:47.431 --> 01:42:51.720
white quarterback a check this,
the,
these are all on the Mlm,

1641
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:56.190
podcast.com.
By the way,
I'm this fucking kid's amazing.
You know,

1642
01:42:56.191 --> 01:42:57.840
I know a lot of them,
you know.
Okay.

1643
01:42:57.841 --> 01:43:00.690
How many attempts did he make to make the fucking throw?

1644
01:43:00.691 --> 01:43:05.070
But there's a couple where he does like to three um,
tricks all in one take.

1645
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:06.900
Very impressive.
Um,

1646
01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:11.930
but at the end of the video got me fucking hiccups at the end of the video.

1647
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.460
Can he read a defense?
Um,
here's another one.
This kid,
uh,
just a,
uh,

1648
01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:21.060
if you want to see just a great fucking story teller.
Um,

1649
01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.620
I don't even know what this is the name of the video,

1650
01:43:22.621 --> 01:43:24.870
but this is Baltimore storyteller.

1651
01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:29.640
The fuck this guy tells a story about a,
Oh,

1652
01:43:29.641 --> 01:43:34.641
his dad sent him to the corner store for some bread and he has to get by some

1653
01:43:35.401 --> 01:43:36.234
gang bangers.

1654
01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.230
And this fucking guy I watched like three of his videos is just phenomenally,

1655
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.540
just a phenomenal fucking storyteller.

1656
01:43:42.541 --> 01:43:46.290
I love telling stories and I let them more I like than listened to a great

1657
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:47.461
storyteller.
This kid's great.

1658
01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:52.130
So check that out and check out all those other videos.
A midget wrestler flying.

1659
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.030
<v 0>All right?
If you ever wanted to see a midget in a,
uh,</v>

1660
01:43:56.390 --> 01:44:00.950
dressed up like a baby gorilla,
get kicked by a fat bald guy,

1661
01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:02.060
I believe the guy's bald.

1662
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:06.230
And then go flying ass over tea kettle in land on another wrestler.

1663
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:09.320
This is the video for you and a funny drum video.

1664
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.180
I love this video because the guy's fucking hilarious.
Uh,

1665
01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.560
English seems to be his third language.

1666
01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:21.200
I put that down that high had that.
They had that one,
the one,
two,
three.

1667
01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:25.880
Okay.
And the,
and the one told three.
Okay.

1668
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:30.440
That's literally,
that's how this guy fucking gives the,
the drum lesson.

1669
01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:33.800
But then he proceeds to play this fucking sick drum groove,

1670
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:39.090
which I still can't fucking play.
Um,
so the guys like awesome.
It's just a far,

1671
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:43.190
it's just like a second or third language.
Um,
oh,

1672
01:44:43.191 --> 01:44:45.680
and if you want to see another great wrestling,
just horrific,

1673
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:50.750
the WCW dungeon of doom,
full segment.
I don't know who wrote this shit.

1674
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:56.180
Um,
but it is horrific in a phenomenal fucking way.
Uh,

1675
01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:58.820
what else do I go on in here?
Um,
oh,
here's some advice.

1676
01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:03.980
Somebody wants a bill.
My girlfriend looks like a centerfold.
Good for you.

1677
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:07.400
She's blind.
She has a beautiful face,

1678
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:12.320
a tiny waists in giant cans.
I have outdone myself.

1679
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:16.880
Well,
what the fuck,
man?
Don't sell yourself short maybe.
Or maybe you're a,

1680
01:45:16.881 --> 01:45:21.860
you're a stud.
So he says,
however,
having a girlfriend of such caliber,

1681
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:26.060
as you might imagine,
comes with its share of problems.
Oh,
Jesus.
Here we go.

1682
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:30.440
Like,
uh,
like your good self.
I battle my battle,

1683
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:34.160
keeping my temper under control at times and particularly struggle when my

1684
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.010
girlfriend and I go out in public together.
In short,

1685
01:45:37.011 --> 01:45:40.160
the amount of male attention she gets is ridiculous.

1686
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:45.200
And at times it's infuriating.
Have you ever found yourself,
uh,

1687
01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.280
found yourself out with a girl and notice that every man within a three mile

1688
01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:54.281
radius from the sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the porky,

1689
01:45:55.131 --> 01:46:00.020
sexually frustrated father of three is blatantly staring at her tits in her ass.

1690
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:05.420
Um,
I've always been of the opinion that if a girl is obviously with a guy,

1691
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:07.190
whether you know them or not,

1692
01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:12.220
it's a gentleman's code not to have a staring contest with there with her,

1693
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:16.520
with her ring piece.
And what that means.
What's that looking at her pussy.

1694
01:46:16.521 --> 01:46:18.730
I have no idea.
This guys from Australia,
um,

1695
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:22.970
if a girl there's a loan or with girlfriends share objectify the shit out of
her.

1696
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:26.990
But I think if a girl is holding hands with their boyfriend and you make it

1697
01:46:26.991 --> 01:46:31.640
obvious that your helmet is pressing against the inside of your front Zipper,

1698
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:35.510
then your account,
um,
nothing serious has happened yet,

1699
01:46:35.511 --> 01:46:37.310
but the weather is getting warmer,

1700
01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:44.890
the outfits are getting smaller and I'm concerned,
I'm gonna wind up with,

1701
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:48.770
I'm going to wind up with some perverts blood and quite possibly come on my

1702
01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.070
hands all

1703
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.690
<v 11>for now.
Um,
all right.
All right.</v>

1704
01:46:54.691 --> 01:46:57.270
This is a tricky situation,
sir.
You know,

1705
01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.950
it's a very tricky situation.
You know,

1706
01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:05.430
there's a price you pay for everything.
All right?

1707
01:47:05.431 --> 01:47:10.230
You're the one who has the centerfold fucking girlfriend with a great ass and

1708
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:14.280
Nice set of fucking tits and a,
you just,
you just have to

1709
01:47:16.210 --> 01:47:19.870
this,
this,
this is,
this is how I look at this shit.

1710
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:22.720
As long as you're,

1711
01:47:22.721 --> 01:47:27.721
a woman isn't going around trying to get attention if she's just fucking

1712
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.100
standing there and she's so goddamn stunning that men are looking at her,

1713
01:47:32.970 --> 01:47:34.680
but you know,
she's not,
Ooh,

1714
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:39.681
I drop my lipstick and then slowly bending over at the waist while looking over

1715
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:42.600
her shoulder.
Um,
if she's doing that,

1716
01:47:42.601 --> 01:47:47.040
I can tell you right now a bang or another couple of times and then fucking

1717
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:51.470
dumper because she's going to be an absolute fucking nightmare and a,

1718
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:53.160
and you don't need that in your life,
okay?

1719
01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.900
But if she's just a stunningly gorgeous woman,
um,

1720
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:01.740
you,
that kind of comes with it.
And,
uh,

1721
01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:05.910
if you lose your fucking temper and you start acting like a maniac,

1722
01:48:05.911 --> 01:48:08.940
that's a great way to eventually annoy the shit out of her.

1723
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.800
And because she can't help it.
Like I said,
if she's not trying to get attention,

1724
01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:18.120
she can't help it,
that she's gorgeous.
And uh,

1725
01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.600
if you then,
it's in this weird way,

1726
01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:24.300
you're giving her shit for being herself,

1727
01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.620
which is not fun for anybody and then you're going to have a problem.
So,

1728
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:34.720
um,
I don't know how to it,
you know what it's like.
It's like a,

1729
01:48:34.721 --> 01:48:38.170
it's like when I whore myself out at the end of my shows and I sell DVDs.

1730
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:40.030
All right?
I don't have to do that,

1731
01:48:40.031 --> 01:48:43.330
but I choose to do it and I'm standing as a choice.
I fucking made.

1732
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.920
And then I stand there and what's going to happen?
I answered this.
Yeah.
This one,

1733
01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.360
these podcast questions.
Alright.

1734
01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.450
Eventually somebody is going to come up and they're going to fucking insult me.

1735
01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:55.450
Tell me.
They didn't like my act.
Tell me.
Uh,

1736
01:48:55.451 --> 01:48:58.870
they didn't think I was as funny as when he saw me on TV and I can't get mad

1737
01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:02.710
because it's my fucking fault for standing there like an asshole.

1738
01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.850
Just,
you know,
I,
I put myself on the dunking store and I got admit sir,
if,

1739
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.340
if you're,
if this,
if your girl is the way that you describe her,

1740
01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.120
you just have to accept that it's,
it's par for the course and uh,

1741
01:49:16.330 --> 01:49:20.170
just give yourself a little halftime speech before you go up.
You know,

1742
01:49:20.171 --> 01:49:24.280
I'm not going to lose my shit.
Um,
but

1743
01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.013
<v 15>okay,</v>

1744
01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.130
<v 11>if it is overt,
uh,</v>

1745
01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.160
there has to be a way that you can fucking address it without pissing her off,

1746
01:49:33.501 --> 01:49:37.940
without getting,
you also don't want to get into a fucking fight.
Um,

1747
01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:44.230
I dunno.
Just say,
hey buddy,
can you eliminate it to like,
you know,

1748
01:49:44.231 --> 01:49:47.020
five seconds shifts of staring at or tea.
I can't say,

1749
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:54.410
uh,
I don't know what you do.
Do that.
That's a rough one.
That's a rough run there,

1750
01:49:54.411 --> 01:49:55.930
man.
That takes me back to being,

1751
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.333
<v 4>AH,</v>

1752
01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.370
<v 11>Jesus Christ.
I was like 21 years old.
I went on this,</v>

1753
01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.480
I went out on a date with this girl who was well out of my fucking league just

1754
01:50:05.481 --> 01:50:07.730
because I didn't have the confidence to fucking be with her,

1755
01:50:07.731 --> 01:50:08.564
you know what I mean?

1756
01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.153
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1757
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:12.021
<v 11>Beautiful Girl.</v>

1758
01:50:12.021 --> 01:50:14.480
And I went out with her and I noticed she just kept looking around the

1759
01:50:14.481 --> 01:50:18.290
restaurant to see who was looking at her and I remembered it annoyed the shit

1760
01:50:18.291 --> 01:50:22.220
out of me,
but I,
I,
I didn't have any experience with beautiful women,

1761
01:50:22.221 --> 01:50:27.020
so I just sort of accepted it.
And um,
but I never went out with her again.

1762
01:50:27.021 --> 01:50:31.130
It just,
it drove it.
I tapped out somewhere through the fucking dinner,

1763
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:33.830
even back then,
I was an angry son of a bitch.
I was like,

1764
01:50:33.831 --> 01:50:34.401
let me get this straight.

1765
01:50:34.401 --> 01:50:37.190
I'm buying you fucking dinner and you're looking around to see who's Elsa

1766
01:50:37.191 --> 01:50:41.420
staring at your tits.
Um,
yeah,
you're a cunt.

1767
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:45.680
Good looking cunt,
but a cut nonetheless.

1768
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:49.430
Someday those looks are going to be gone and I'm just going to be left with the

1769
01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:50.643
content.

1770
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:54.770
You know who's going to be a psycho cunt because you're an attention whore.

1771
01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.390
And when the attention goes away,

1772
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:59.750
you're going to be like some celebrity who fell off the fucking may have fucked

1773
01:50:59.751 --> 01:51:02.870
his bitch.
Fuck this.
You know?

1774
01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:08.660
And that was the end of that shit that his podcast is fucking horrific.
Jeez,

1775
01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:11.090
I didn't even get going,
man.
You know what it is.

1776
01:51:11.150 --> 01:51:14.690
I had a flat tire today and I think that that's,
that's been,

1777
01:51:14.691 --> 01:51:19.340
that's a good symbol.
Uh,
this whole podcast,
I've just been riding on the rim.

1778
01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:23.691
Ah,
fuck.

1779
01:51:23.691 --> 01:51:28.440
I got to start my day tomorrow down at the goddamned dealership is fucking

1780
01:51:28.650 --> 01:51:32.030
Douche bags.
They got everything.
It's all wrapped up.
You know,

1781
01:51:32.031 --> 01:51:33.470
if you do anything to your Goddamn car,

1782
01:51:33.471 --> 01:51:36.650
if I go down to the Goddamn auto zone and I get new wiper blades,
I think that,

1783
01:51:36.651 --> 01:51:41.360
I think that cancels out my warranty.
He's fucking cunts.
Um,
so anyways,

1784
01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:44.510
this was the lane podcast for this week.
I know it had its moments.
Who's kidding?

1785
01:51:44.511 --> 01:51:49.190
Who?
It started off.
Well,
when I was talking about those whaling horse,
um,

1786
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:53.940
I actually had a nice little show biz moment.
A friend of mine got me tickets to,

1787
01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.150
<v 4>uh,
um,</v>

1788
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:02.340
<v 11>the roots do this pre grammy jam where they're just the house band and like</v>

1789
01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.900
fucking,
I don't know,

1790
01:52:04.901 --> 01:52:08.530
20 or 30 of the most legendary insane acts ever.

1791
01:52:08.531 --> 01:52:13.150
Just come on stage and start singing songs with them and doing fucking whatever.

1792
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:17.950
And somebody got me a ticket,
uh,
you know,
hanging out,

1793
01:52:17.951 --> 01:52:22.540
you know,
somehow I got in there and uh,
it was fucking unbelievable.

1794
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:26.650
I think I came home that night and I downloaded like,

1795
01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:30.640
probably about $70 worth of music,
just the,

1796
01:52:30.641 --> 01:52:33.310
the level of talent that was out there.
And I'm an old guy now,

1797
01:52:33.311 --> 01:52:36.050
so I don't know who the fuck,
I don't know who the fuck.

1798
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:39.130
And even Neil was telling me who everybody was,
she was freaking the fuck out.

1799
01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:43.750
Oh my God,
that's fucking
Mc.
So,
and I have no of,

1800
01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.070
I don't know who the fuck they are.

1801
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.910
<v 0>You know what?
I tapped it when they stopped showing videos on MTV.</v>

1802
01:52:49.911 --> 01:52:54.590
I kinda like that last wave.
Jay Z,
m and M.

1803
01:52:56.070 --> 01:53:00.780
Um,
was there any rock like by then it was all that emo shit.

1804
01:53:00.781 --> 01:53:04.890
So I,
I didn't,
I couldn't relate to any of that.
You know what,

1805
01:53:04.891 --> 01:53:09.170
what does that fucking goddamn wining song about not giving up?

1806
01:53:16.770 --> 01:53:17.603
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1807
01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.150
<v 0>they actually play that at sporting events.</v>

1808
01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:24.930
It sounds like a man crying.
I don't know.

1809
01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.220
I know he's saying we will be victorious,
but like just,
it just,

1810
01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:33.810
it could have been a better line,
Rick.
You know,
all that shit.

1811
01:53:33.811 --> 01:53:37.790
That's when I tapped out all that.
My Chemical Romance.
Uh,

1812
01:53:37.890 --> 01:53:39.810
could I have another Kleenex please?

1813
01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.250
Whatever the fuck name other bands where I just,
uh,

1814
01:53:45.930 --> 01:53:50.640
I don't know.
Everybody just sounded like they were crying.

1815
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:55.320
I couldn't handle it.
Your sex is on fire.

1816
01:53:55.321 --> 01:53:59.310
That guy fucking clients were all his songs.
How does that fucking song go?

1817
01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.593
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1818
01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:16.420
<v 0>Rami the cure.
That's how the guy in the cure,
he used to sing</v>

1819
01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:19.940
<v 2>oh ways.
Love</v>

1820
01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:21.363
<v 0>you.</v>

1821
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:24.223
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1822
01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:27.330
<v 0>um,
yeah.
I'm not into that shit.
I'm sorry.
Was that,
there was an annoying,</v>

1823
01:54:27.331 --> 01:54:29.370
was that as annoying as it just sounded in my fucking is what?

1824
01:54:29.371 --> 01:54:32.580
That music is fucking annoying.
So I didn't know who anybody was,

1825
01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:37.050
but uh,
you know,
it was amazing.
Was Booker t came out.

1826
01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.910
What didn't even from booker t and the mgs,

1827
01:54:38.911 --> 01:54:43.440
I didn't even know the fucking dude was still alive and it was such like a Paris

1828
01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:45.210
Hilton air.
My Guy Am I god,

1829
01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:50.190
that's hot kind of fucking crowd that uh,

1830
01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:54.180
that they had no fucking idea who the guy was.
Uh,

1831
01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:58.470
my favorite performer of the night was a chuck Brown came out and sang,

1832
01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:01.800
busting loose,
and he was the shit.

1833
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:07.230
He came out on a leather on leather fucking outfit with the fucking pimp hat.

1834
01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.480
He sang the shit out of the song with the roots in the background and the roots

1835
01:55:12.481 --> 01:55:14.910
of fucking unbelievable.
And for guitarists out there,

1836
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:16.500
everybody knows quests as shit,

1837
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:22.200
but I'll underrated Kirk Douglas,
dear fucking guitarist.

1838
01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.140
That dude is fucking insane.
I'm talking John,

1839
01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:31.840
the ground level plant,
they just fucking,
everybody in that band is just,
it's,

1840
01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.660
they're insane.
And a fortunate,

1841
01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:38.440
we was sitting close enough that [inaudible] I was just awesome.
Like,

1842
01:55:38.441 --> 01:55:40.270
you know me,
I'm like a fucking geek for that shit.

1843
01:55:40.271 --> 01:55:43.890
Like I wish I could be a f if I didn't do this.
I wish I could be a,
so I like,

1844
01:55:43.891 --> 01:55:45.570
I think like anybody,

1845
01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:48.600
you can do that stuff as I've trashed half the people on the grammys,

1846
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:53.200
you know what I'm saying?
But like musicians,
people who play instruments,

1847
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:55.320
I'm absolutely fucking blown away by him.

1848
01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.420
And just being close enough to watch somebody take a solo and just,

1849
01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:03.300
you can just see just going off the top of,

1850
01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.100
they just feeling it and just doing it and coming out of it.

1851
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:12.060
And then just fucking looking back at the drummer like,
all right,
let's,

1852
01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:15.810
let's go back into this next part of it.
And everybody seamlessly goes into it.

1853
01:56:16.710 --> 01:56:21.660
You know,
anybody who's ever played like a fucking garage band,
you know,
and just,

1854
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:24.930
you know,
had the courage to make a tape and you hear how fucking awful you are.

1855
01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:29.550
They actually hear live music and they played for like three fucking hours.

1856
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:32.460
I ended up leaving.
I was so god damn old.

1857
01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.180
Like I'm at the age now where if I stand up too long,
my back hurts.

1858
01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:41.490
Like my lower fucking back,
my feet hurt.
It's,
it's fuck is terrible.

1859
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:44.460
I've got to come home.
And sit in a Goddamn Tabla,
Epson salt.

1860
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.060
But anyways,
uh,

1861
01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:50.970
I downloaded a bunch of Chuck Brown Shit,

1862
01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.410
a couple other rappers I downloaded.
I don't have my iTunes open right now.

1863
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:58.200
I don't even,
I don't know who the fuck they were.
Uh,

1864
01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:01.230
but it's kind of funny rappers now.
They have that odd thing where they,

1865
01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:04.140
they're wearing skinny tight jeans,

1866
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:06.990
which I never thought would come back into style again yet.

1867
01:57:07.130 --> 01:57:11.760
They're still hanging off their fucking ass,
which drives me up the Goddamn wall.

1868
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:18.090
Fuck.
Pull them up.
Um,
anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.
Oh,

1869
01:57:18.150 --> 01:57:22.650
I am going to be in,

1870
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:26.610
uh,
this this fucking week because I'm a God damn big shot.

1871
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.300
Let me see if I can open my website here and let you know where the hell these

1872
01:57:30.301 --> 01:57:33.810
things are.
This really isn't even technically the podcasts anymore.

1873
01:57:33.811 --> 01:57:35.390
This is just the outtakes.
Um,

1874
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:40.430
I am going to be at the Tarrytown music hall in Tarrytown,

1875

New Jersey.

1877

1878
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:57.300

then I'm absolutely loving.

1879
01:57:57.301 --> 01:58:00.060
And every time I do it,
it becomes a couple more minutes.
You know,

1880
01:58:00.061 --> 01:58:02.340
one of those bits started with like four minutes.

1881
01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:07.350
I just keep fucking elaborating and uh,
uh,
planning on having a great time.

1882
01:58:07.351 --> 01:58:09.970
So,
uh,
I hope all you guys can come out to that,

1883
01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:13.290

They're fucking,

1904
01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:38.860
all of them are at the top of their fucking game.
And I'm telling you,

1905
01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:42.690
we did three shows when I was in Atlantic City and you know,

1906
01:59:43.110 --> 01:59:46.270
you know it as Comedians,
we don't watch stand up.
We just don't after a while.

1907
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:50.680
But I stood on the side wall,
watched all of them.
Um,

1908
01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:55.720
I just,
it just,
they fucking phenomenal.
So please come out to those shows.

1909
01:59:55.721 --> 02:00:00.310
That's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
You guys all have a good week.
Uh,

1910
02:00:00.311 --> 02:00:02.320
I don't know what else to tell you.
I fuck,

1911
02:00:02.321 --> 02:00:04.630
I forgot to talk about the Bruins Canadians game.

1912
02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:09.100
Did you see that with all the old school fighting in the goal scoring was like

1913
02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:13.270
fucking 27 to 26,
I think was the final score with all the fighting.

1914
02:00:13.271 --> 02:00:16.660
And I want to know Montreal Canadian.
What the fuck happened?
He had team,

1915
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:20.530
I'm not giving you shit about losing a game was the only one fucking game.

1916
02:00:20.531 --> 02:00:21.100
But I mean,

1917
02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:24.400
you guys always had a tough guy all the way back to fucking John Cortex.

1918
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:28.900
Chris Nilan,
George Larocque.
You had,
that guy was the toughest guy in the league.

1919
02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:32.200
Why did you guys,
all you had was,
you know,

1920
02:00:32.201 --> 02:00:35.590
I know the Bruins kicked the shit out of you guys,
but I'm not an idiot.
We,
we,
we,

1921
02:00:35.591 --> 02:00:40.090
we beat up a bunch of gold scores.
I felt bad for that last guy,
Jesus Christ.

1922
02:00:40.091 --> 02:00:44.680
He took like 20 upper cuts to the face and somehow ended up with two giant paper

1923
02:00:44.681 --> 02:00:47.540
cuts.
Um,
Google it,
man.

1924
02:00:47.630 --> 02:00:51.240
And maybe I'll have that youtube video also on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
Uh,

1925
02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:52.480
but I'm telling you right now,

1926
02:00:52.481 --> 02:00:56.170
if you're a fan of fighting and hockey watched the game on March 8th when the

1927
02:00:56.171 --> 02:00:58.150
Bruins and the Canadians play again,

1928
02:00:58.151 --> 02:01:01.330
because I'm a tell you right now that Canadians are not going to sit back and

1929
02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:05.040
take that fucking physical ass kicking that they took.
I and I can,

1930
02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:09.310
I can't wait to see the absolute fucking animals that they're going to bring up

1931
02:01:09.311 --> 02:01:11.410
for that game.
You know,

1932
02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.620
whatever has a lower

1933
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:19.630
beyond thunder bay is what I'm guessing what they're going to bring up.

1934
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:21.910
Just like some old school fucking guy,

1935
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:26.170
one of those white guys who has like an afro in a porno mustache.

1936
02:01:26.171 --> 02:01:28.720
I'm thinking I'm going to bring up a couple of those guys and it's going to be,

1937
02:01:28.721 --> 02:01:31.180
it's going to be fucking insane.
I hope it is.

1938
02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:34.870
I hope it doesn't fucking not live up to the hype.
Um,

1939
02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:40.070
all right.
That's it.
I'm done.
Okay.
I've had a long fucking day.
All right.

1940
02:01:40.071 --> 02:01:45.071
And I apologize to anybody out there who aspires to be a whaling whore at the

1941
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.270
grammys.

1942
02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:47.620

1944

1945
02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:55.160

1946
02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:00.000
I don't underst I fucking don't understand that kind of singing.

1947
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:02.010
It's,
you're not singing,
you're wailing.

1948
02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:06.810
<v 0>All right.
Just seeing the fucking song,</v>

1949
02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.850
you know,
and then,
and then fucking what's her face?
Lil Booze,
booze face there.

1950
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:19.210
She always gets that son in a voice.
No,
ugh.

1951
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:23.510
<v 11>She got that pasty bloated boost face.
And then just in case you miss it,</v>

1952
02:02:23.511 --> 02:02:26.030
she puts that red lipstick in the,
in the,
in the middle.

1953
02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.610
<v 0>Don't you just want to grab Christina by both a big Java [inaudible] you know,</v>

1954
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:36.290
she got a man's haircut.
She could do like the Winston Churchill Story.

1955
02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:41.270
I've been,
I've actually,
this is just,

1956
02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:43.910
this is totally like extra time on doing,

1957
02:02:43.911 --> 02:02:47.240
on the podcast to try and get something funny in this fucking thing this week.

1958
02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:52.130
I noticed the other day,
um,

1959
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:53.803
you know,
to,

1960
02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:57.890
to people who really look alike is Richard Simmons and the lead singer of the

1961
02:02:57.891 --> 02:02:58.724
Scorpions.

1962
02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:03.170
You notice that they have the exact same awful fucking hair.

1963
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.260
They're going bald in the exact same fucking way.

1964
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:10.070
You know that I just do an awful fucking eighties joke.

1965
02:03:11.190 --> 02:03:15.840
<v 11>Were they separated at birth?
Have you ever seen them together?
Oh,
Bill.</v>

1966
02:03:15.841 --> 02:03:18.840
Quit by your fucking behind.
All right.
This is it.

1967
02:03:18.841 --> 02:03:20.640
How long can you guys still listen to this shit?

1968
02:03:20.641 --> 02:03:22.380
How long are you going to sit there and torture yourself?

1969
02:03:22.381 --> 02:03:25.830
This is like a comedian does not get off the fucking stage as people look slowly

1970
02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:28.080
walking out of the Goddamn club.
I'm still here.

1971
02:03:28.410 --> 02:03:30.420
How empty or your lives shut it off?

1972
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.420
<v 0>Um,
oh fuck.
You know what?
I forgot to play.</v>

1973
02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:37.570
I asked somebody

1974
02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:38.560
<v 11>from England to,
to,</v>

1975
02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:43.620
I wanted to hear a cozy smug cuts in the English accent.

1976
02:03:43.811 --> 02:03:45.760
Here goes,
you want to hear it?
Here it is.
Here it is.

1977
02:03:45.761 --> 02:03:49.150
This is all the way from my fucking people over and ing.
Hang on.

1978
02:03:49.151 --> 02:03:51.370
What the fuck just happened there?
I'm going to play it again.
Here comes

1979
02:03:56.530 --> 02:04:01.110
<v 0>Cousey smug.
Can't every,
a couple of like cozy smug cunts.</v>

1980
02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:03.320
Fucking love that.
Um,

1981
02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:05.600
<v 11>alright.
There you go.
That's the podcast for this week.</v>

1982
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:10.460
I apologize for the meandering.
I apologize this from,

1983
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:13.160
for my excuses.
I went real Peyton manning this week,
didn't I?

1984
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:16.070
We are protection issues.
I had a flat tire,
you know,

1985
02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:20.480
that was a real bitch this week.
Um,
whatever.
I'll make it up next week.
Okay?

1986
02:04:20.481 --> 02:04:21.560
They can't all be gems.

1987
02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:25.270
<v 0>All right?
Everybody has a bad fucking day.</v>

1988
02:04:26.190 --> 02:04:30.060
<v 11>Take it out on me.
I apologize to all the whaling whores out there.
I said that.</v>

1989
02:04:30.370 --> 02:04:34.170
All right?
I don't know how to get off stage this week.
All right?
That's it.

1990
02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:37.110
Have a great fucking weak.
Go fuck yourselves.
Don't take any shit.

1991
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.070
Talk to you next Monday.

1992
02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:19.940
<v 10>[inaudible].</v>
