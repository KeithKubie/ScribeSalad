00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.620
Precomputing, all early
standards were for data.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.420
Physicians would use ICD,
a classification of diseases,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.660
in their notes.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.860
The clinical laboratory would have
a classification for their tests.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.110
And the pharmacy would
have a classification for

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.590
the medications they dispense.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.380
As computers came into use in hospitals,
the various departments needed to share

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.745
information, but were using their
own specialized computer systems.

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:34.135
This led to early messaging standards.

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:37.795
These meant a physician could order
a lab test or medication at the nurse's

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:41.755
station, and that order could be routed
electronically to the appropriate

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:46.215
department to do the test or
send the medication.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:50.810
The next evolution was standards for
clinical documents.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.540
A message might typically be
an order for a lab test or

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.040
medication, but what if you want
a complete summary of a patient's care

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.510
to send to the patient's physician once
they're discharged from the hospital?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.170
This is the role of document standards.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.050
More recently, as computers have become
more powerful, standards have been

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.069
evolving to represent clinical
workflows and processes.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.785
These have often been
targeted at hospitals, but

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.190
have proven to be hard to develop and
implement.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.280
If this could be overcome, they could,
at least in theory, lead to a reduction

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.280
in unnecessary variations in
the way patients are cared for.
