00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.160
How do you know that aspirin will take care
of your headache?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.280
Why do you really want to see the new Marvel movie,
even though you haven’t heard anything about it, good or bad?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.600
Your ability to do things like predict how
a medication will affect you, or what movie

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.190
you might like, or even things like what the
perfect gift might be for your best friend,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.430
or what’s the fastest way to get to campus
–- all of this stuff, you know through induction.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.740
Deductive arguments are great because they
give us certain answers.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.980
But unfortunately, much of the world cannot
be summed up in a neat deductive proof.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.429
Deduction requires a fair amount of general
information to give you a specific conclusion

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.420
that is, frankly, probably kind of obvious.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.420
So, philosophy -- and basically, you know, life as well --
require that you have other ways of reasoning.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.600
In addition to knowing how one fact leads
to another, you also need to take what you’ve

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.889
experienced before, and use that to predict
what might happen in the future.

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.389
And you need to be able to rule out what can’t
be true, so you can focus on what can.

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.469
Through these kinds of reasoning, you’re
not only able to figure out stuff like how

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.129
to fix your headache, and why your roommate
might be acting weird. You can also come up

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
with better, more skillful arguments — and
counterarguments — which are some of the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.609
most important maneuvers in the philosophical
game.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.930
And maybe the best part is, you already know
how to use these techniques.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.970
In fact, I bet you’ve used them this very
day. You know this!

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:29.210
[Theme Music]

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.010
If you possess any ability to really predict the
future, it lies in your ability to reason inductively.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.400
Inductive reasoning relies on the predictability
of nature to reveal that the future is likely

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.020
to resemble the past, often in important ways.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.479
For example, there’s tons of research to
support the knowledge that aspirin -- acetylsalicylic

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.179
acid -- is an effective treatment for pain,
like headaches.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.119
And you probably have personal experience
with the effects of aspirin, too.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.140
So, you believe that this aspirin tablet will
cure the headache you have right now, because

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.659
countless aspirin tablets have cured countless
headaches in the past.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.319
Likewise, you want to see the new Marvel movie,
because you liked most of the other ones,

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.259
so you believe that they’ll continue to
deliver for you, entertainment-wise.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.919
But it’s important to remember that, unlike
deduction, where true premises entail true

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.580
conclusions, inductive premises only mean
that the conclusion is likely to be true.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.800
Inductive arguments don’t provide you with
certainty. Instead, they work in terms of probabilities.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.180
And they’re useful for more than predicting
what’s going to happen. For example:

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.680
Most men in ancient Athens had beards.
Socrates was a man who lived in ancient Athens.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.860
Therefore, Socrates probably had a beard

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.040
This is an inductive argument, because it
starts with what we already know – about

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.239
the grooming habits of ancient Athenian men,
and about the time and place in which Socrates

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.069
lived – and makes an educated guess based
on that information.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.820
There’s no guarantee that the conclusion is correct,
but what’s known would seem to support it.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.640
Reasoning like this is incredibly useful, which is
why it’s so common. But there’s also a problem.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.129
The future doesn’t always resemble the past.
And every pattern has its outliers.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.409
So induction always has the potential to produce
false results. Aspirin might not work on a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.730
really bad headache. The new Marvel movie
might be awful. And, yeah, maybe a specific

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.629
guy in Athens had a beard but it’s possible
he didn’t!

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.429
While the world tends to work according to
predictable rules, sometimes those rules are violated.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.910
And you know what you need when that happens?
A little Flash Philosophy. Off to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.160
Contemporary American philosopher Nelson Goodman
confronts the problems of induction, using

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.430
a thought exercise about a hypothetical substance
called grue.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.280
According to Goodman’s scenario, grue is
anything that’s the color green before a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.469
certain time, a time that we will call t.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.529
And another property of grue is that, while
it’s green before time t, it’s blue after it.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.129
Now, let’s assume that we’re living in
a time before t. T could happen a hundred

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.900
years from now or tomorrow, but we know that
all of the emeralds we’ve ever seen are green

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.659
So, inductive reasoning lets us conclude that
all emeralds are green, and will remain green

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.479
after time t -- since emeralds haven’t been
known to change color.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.660
BUT! All emeralds are grue! Because it's not yet time t,
and they're green, which is part of the definition of grue.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.780
So we have no choice but to conclude that
the emeralds will be blue after time t arrives.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.049
Now we’ve got a problem. Because inductive
reasoning has led us to conclude that emeralds

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.230
will be blue after time t, but inductive reasoning
also tells us that they’ll remain green.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.469
Goodman’s riddle reminds us that inductive
evidence can be flawed, or contradictory.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.829
It can make you think that you can predict
the future, when of course you can’t.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.820
So, there are times when you need to get at
the truth in other ways. Like by eliminating

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.060
what’s obviously not true, and considering
what’s most likely.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.280
And for this, we turn our attention to one
of the most important philosophical figures

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.530
of 19th century England: Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.800
In chapter six of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The
Sign of the Four,” Mr. Holmes says, and I quote:

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.580
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.620
This is probably the best, most succinct description
ever given of the kind of reasoning known as abduction.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.720
Which I know, it sounds like we’re talking
about a kidnapping or something, but abduction

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.280
is a thought process sometimes described as
“inference to the best explanation.“

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.140
Abduction doesn’t reason straight from a premise to
a conclusion, as we’ve seen in deduction and induction.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.980
Instead, it reasons by ruling out possible
explanations until you’re left with the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.780
most plausible one, given the evidence. Consider
this:

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.280
Anna told you she failed her physics midterm.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.740
Anna hasn’t been in physics class since
your teacher graded the exams.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.440
Anna has been in sociology class, which meets
right after physics.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.660
Anna dropped physics.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.360
Now, with only these premises, we can’t
deductively or inductively prove our conclusion

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.720
– that she dropped physics.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.520
But, it’s a justifiable conclusion, because,
given what we know, dropping the class is

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.400
the most plausible explanation of events.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.870
We know she’s not sick – because she’s
still going to sociology – and we know she

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.470
had good reason to withdraw from the class,
because she was unlikely to pass.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.040
Concluding that she dropped the course makes
the most tidy use of our information, without

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.600
leaving any loose ends. So let’s look at
another one:

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.030
You and your roommate ate sushi last night.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.250
You both wake up with violent stomachaches.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.340
You and your roommate ate some bad sushi.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.390
The mere fact that you’re both sick doesn’t
prove that the sushi caused the sickness.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.330
But, given that you both ate the same thing
and you both have the same symptoms – absent

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.280
other information, like that a stomach virus
is going around your dorm – the best explanation

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.440
is that the sushi caused your intestinal anguish.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.100
Now, like induction, abduction doesn’t give
us certainty.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.480
But it is a really useful way to get through
puzzling situations when you don’t have

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.070
clear evidence from the past to help you out.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.180
Doctors use abduction a lot when they’re
diagnosing illnesses, and detectives of course

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.600
use it when piecing together evidence.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.410
You probably use it pretty often too – just
beware, because abduction must be used carefully!

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.130
It uses only information you have at hand
-- that’s why doctors and detectives work

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.110
so hard to dig up more data, and re-create events from
the past, so they can help draw better conclusions.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.250
All right, now that we’ve looked at some
argument types, let’s find out how philosophers

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.610
use arguments to interact with each other.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.240
Because, philosophers don’t argue like other
people do.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.440
It’s not like the conversation you have
around the dinner table about whether the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.720
Patriots are better than the Seahawks, or
why plain M&amp;Ms are superior to peanut, which

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.340
is clearly a preposterous position to take.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.240
Philosophers hold each other to different,
higher standards.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.650
They don’t teach each other get away with
saying, “I reject your argument because

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.410
I don’t like its conclusion.” Or, “That’s
preposterous, peanut M&amp;Ms are so good.”

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.810
Instead, if you disagree with a conclusion,
you need to give reasons, just like the first

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.350
person did when they made their case.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.390
Both people involved in this kind of exchange
are known as interlocutors, because we have

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.020
to name everything. The first one advances
an argument, and the second one can either

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.560
accept it, or offer a counterargument, which
is just what it sounds like – an argument

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.800
offered in opposition to another argument.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.860
Think back to Socrates and the beard.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.070
You think Socrates had a beard, and your reasoning
is that most men in his time and place had them.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.050
I, however, think you’re wrong. So I give
you a counterargument.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.920
Gorgias, a contemporary of Socrates, said
Socrates couldn’t grow a beard and that

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.550
he would sneak into barbershops and steal
discarded clippings to fashion fake beards

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.490
for himself. Therefore, Socrates didn’t
have a (real) beard.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.530
And I just want to point out that this is
an actual philosophy conspiracy theory.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.110
Gorgias was a real guy, who differed with
Socrates on many things, and the dispute was

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.860
said to have gotten personal.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.760
According to accounts of the time, Gorgias
actually spread the rumor that Socrates wore,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.360
like, a beard-wig, in an effort to shame and
discredit his rival. I mean, how could you

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.960
be a good thinker if you weren’t a good
beard-grower.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.900
Gorgias’ gossip didn’t go over well with
everyone, and in this instance, let’s say

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.740
you are skeptical about it too.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.280
So you counter my counterargument with a counter-counterargument.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.840
Gorgias was known for being a gossip, and
for hating Socrates, and trying to make him

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.200
look bad. His fake beard tale seems wildly
unlikely. Therefore, we can’t take Gorgias’

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.880
statement seriously, so we should fall back
on the best information we have, which is

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.870
that most of the men in his time and place
had beards.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.560
And as you can see, arguments of different
styles can be used in the same exchange.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.220
Like, the original argument, about Socrates
probably having a beard, was inductive.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.680
But this last counterargument is abductive.
And that’s fine.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.280
Arguments are meant to be useful, so we don’t have
to use the same kind of reasoning when we argue.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.900
This way of exchanging ideas through dialogue
was popularized by Socrates, and so has become

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.800
known as the Socratic method.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.589
Socrates thought dialogue was the best way
to learn, and to get at truth.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:09:00.759
And it’s important to note that, while philosophers
have a reputation for being an argumentative

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:05.219
lot, they don’t think of the Socratic method as
something that results in a winner and a loser.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.449
Rather, it’s an exercise that brings both
interlocutors closer to the truth.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:13.959
The goal of the philosopher is not to win,
but to find truth, so you shouldn’t be disappointed

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:17.099
if someone presents a counterargument that
you can’t find a response to.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.300
When that happens, a good philosopher will
be grateful to their interlocutor for helping

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.140
them reject false beliefs and build stronger
ones.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.459
Today you learned about two more types of
philosophical reasoning, induction and abduction.

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:33.039
You’ve seen their strengths, and their weaknesses.
And you’ve also learned about counterarguments,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.420
and the Socratic method.
