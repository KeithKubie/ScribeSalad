00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:09.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So boys and girls,

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.476
right now what we're gonna
do is we're gonna log

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:12.556
onto the internet, but I know--

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:15.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The internet has
facilitated a whole new world

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:15.766
of learning.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Where is
Miss Junie to right now?

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.076
&gt;&gt;Costa Rica.

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.136
&gt;&gt;Costa Rica, good.

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:26.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Connecting people and
cultures that are worlds apart.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:27.023
&gt;&gt;[singing].

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Increasingly, the
internet also provides an alternative

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.936
to traditional classroom instruction.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.326
Virtual classes that are open
twenty-four seven to students

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:39.216
like these sophomores
at Daniel Jenkins School

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:40.336
in Haines City, Florida.

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:43.886
&gt;&gt;Pat: Here at Daniel Jenkins, the
students actually come to school

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:45.386
and do their classes online.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:49.526
And normally, most of the students
would actually do this lab at home,

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:52.846
but getting oysters and squids
in this area is kind of hard

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:56.086
for the students, so I was able
to obtain those and bring them out

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:57.956
and actually interact
with the students.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:01.666
&gt;&gt;Does everybody see something
that's kinda silvery shiny?

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.896
&gt;&gt;Out of the close to two
hundred students that I'll deal

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:07.866
with this year, I will only see
maybe ten of those students,

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.216
so this is really a great
opportunity as an instructor to get

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:12.736
to meet my students face to face.

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:15.986
&gt;&gt;This is all part of
the reproductive system.

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:18.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Pat Kretzer believes she
can relate to her students better

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:21.306
in a virtual classroom
than in a real one.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:25.296
&gt;&gt;Pat: Being the online instructor,
you have a more personal relationship

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:27.856
with your students,
because we do interact

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:30.856
with them online, on the phone.

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:33.166
You can really get
to know them better.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.766
And you can also identify
their strengths

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:39.866
and weaknesses much more quickly, I
think, than in the regular classroom,

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:44.496
because I deal with them only
when I'm working with them.

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:47.106
If I need to take two hours
with that student to help them,

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.006
then I take two hours
with that student.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.276
&gt;&gt;Hi, Chelsea, uh-huh.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:54.106
All right, which clues
do we need to do?

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kretzer designs
and teaches her courses

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:58.206
through the Florida Virtual School.

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.286
Established in two thousand,

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:05.116
the nation's first internet based
public school offers virtual learning

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.466
options for grades
seven through twelve.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.376
&gt;&gt;Julie: We offer a full
high school curriculum

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:13.536
and they are all the courses that
a student would actually need

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.536
to graduate to get a diploma.

00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:18.636
Although we don't offer a
diploma and that is by design.

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:22.406
Our role, here in the state of
Florida, is to actually fill the gaps

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:24.266
of our public and our
private schools.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:29.366
For example, our rural districts have
less access to high quality courses

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.506
and high quality teachers.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:33.086
Online learning brings
that to their doorstep.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In rural West
Virginia, schools are now required

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:40.006
to offer foreign languages
in seventh and eighth grade.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:44.216
But in small towns like Fayetteville,

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:47.046
there aren't enough qualified
teachers to do the job.

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:47.546
&gt;&gt;Joyce: [Spanish].

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:54.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: West Virginia Virtual
School provides a solution,

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.336
with teachers like Joyce
McClanahan, who is lead teacher

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.166
for twenty-one Spanish classes

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.206
in fifteen different West
Virginia middle schools.

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:06.396
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Jesus, we must use
the infinitive after [Spanish].

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:13.916
&gt;&gt;Now I actually don't start teaching
till about a quarter till eight

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:19.926
and I teach basically
forty-five minute classes.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.236
My school day generally
ends around three thirty,

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:27.366
and then after a short break,
students will start calling

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.526
if they need extra help at night.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:33.656
So the job usually goes
to about ten at night.

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, good, let's
do a sound check real quick

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:39.706
and if it's all right, then
we'll go ahead and get started.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:42.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There aren't enough
qualified teachers for every course

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:45.286
in the Las Vegas school
system either, in part,

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:49.816
because Clark County accepts fifteen
thousand new students each year.

00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:54.656
To address that shortage, and to
save money on bricks and mortar,

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:59.216
the county offers some forty-five
hundred students virtual courses

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:02.476
in everything from public
health to microeconomics.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:05.436
&gt;&gt;Mike: You had the
full period to do this.

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:06.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many
of his students,

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:10.446
geometry teacher Mike
Patterson now splits his time

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:13.086
between real classrooms
and virtual ones.

00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:17.336
&gt;&gt;Mike: I'm able to interact on a
live white board with the students.

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:21.206
They raise their hand and
I see them in front of me.

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:23.796
We speak through the mic.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.446
&gt;&gt;If you look at your work and see

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:28.046
if you should have been adding
instead of multiplying them.

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:30.586
&gt;&gt;As a teacher, I also
have some flexibility.

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:32.716
I'm not run bell by bell.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.546
I can grade papers
on the front porch.

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.596
It's a very different kind of an
experience, a very fun one for me.

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:42.686
It's very invigorating to my teaching
career to try something like this.

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For students, virtual
schools offer the opportunity

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:49.076
to take courses not available
at their regular schools,

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:52.046
and to fit them into their
individual schedules.

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:59.136
While most of her fellow students
are hitting the books at ten AM,

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:02.716
Zoe McNealy is pursuing
gold medal dreams.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:06.826
She can do much of her schoolwork
any time of the day or night,

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.126
thanks to the online offerings
of Virtual High School.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:14.886
&gt;&gt;Nancy: It really made the
schedule for her skating much better,

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:17.336
because it allowed her to
leave school during the day,

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.256
so that she could skate
on an ice surface

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:25.296
that didn't have twenty
children skating on it.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:27.986
&gt;&gt;Zoe: This year, I'm taking
honors environmental science.

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:32.226
I can log on anywhere that has
internet access, so it allows me

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:37.396
to either access the work at
competitions, or I can access it

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:39.826
when I come home and get
the work done that I missed,

00:05:40.186 --> 00:05:41.356
without really missing anything.

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:45.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Virtual High School
is a nonprofit collaborative

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:48.876
of over three hundred high
schools in twenty-six states

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:52.616
and sixteen foreign countries
that offers more than one hundred

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.126
and fifty high school
courses over the internet.

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:58.766
Each participating school
contributes a course to the mix.

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:01.906
&gt;&gt;Liz: They agree to free up
a teacher one period a day

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:05.866
to teach a course online and VHS
provides the training services

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.326
for that classroom teacher to learn
how to effectively teach online.

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:14.626
I think a really critical element of
a good online course is the ability

00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:17.326
to build a community of
learners in that course.

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.726
We design our courses so
that the students are engaged

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:24.566
in online activities, they're
engaged in online collaboration.

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.976
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: We wanted to provide
opportunities for students

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:31.676
to take advanced courses, to try
to accelerate their learning.

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:35.356
Whether they are having significant
challenges in the classroom,

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:40.106
or whether they're very advanced and
can move rapidly through material.

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:42.166
&gt;&gt;Zubin: This is almost
like a textbook.

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:43.366
All my controls are here.

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:45.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Zubin Patel,

00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:48.586
VHS means taking advanced
computer science courses

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:50.536
like cryptography at home.

00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:54.716
&gt;&gt;Zubin: The VHS basically
allows me to take these courses

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.106
that aren't offered at school.

00:06:56.296 --> 00:07:00.476
It means extra work, it means
staying up some nights till three

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:04.786
in the morning doing
VHS work, but I got--

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:08.616
you know, you have to
do what you have to do.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:08.683
&gt;&gt;[orchestra plays]

00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:14.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Hudson's music
program director, Jason Caron,

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:16.006
VHS meant learning a
new way of teaching.

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.906
He took the Virtual School's
fifteen week teacher training,

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:23.586
covering subjects like how
to foster online discussions,

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:28.186
before developing his own VHS
course in American popular music.

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:34.156
&gt;&gt;Jason: The students get two
compact discs with excerpts of music.

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:38.316
They listen to that music or
watch the video and then discuss

00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:41.806
with their online classmates what
they listened to or what they saw.

00:07:42.876 --> 00:07:45.376
The tone in our voice
doesn't get transmitted

00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:49.476
over the internet connection, so you
have to be very careful with wording

00:07:49.476 --> 00:07:53.926
and really spell out your
expectations, and that's, you know,

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:56.126
the hindrance, I guess,
of being disconnected

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.966
from the students physically.

00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:00.146
But a lot of it's quite the same too.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.706
You build collaborative projects.

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:07.656
You do a lot of community building
activities to try to find the sense

00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:10.536
of the class and the personality of
the individuals in the class too.

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:13.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, you can click right
up here and just drag that title out.

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:15.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The rigorous
teacher training

00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:18.816
and engaging course designs
seem to be paying off.

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:23.286
The completion rate for VHS
courses is ninety percent,

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:27.586
and VHS AP students score
ten percentage points higher

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:30.546
than the national average
on their final exams.

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:33.456
But even its biggest booster warns

00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:36.126
against over reliance
on virtual learning.

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:39.826
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: I don't believe you can
have a completely virtual education.

00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:43.166
I don't think that it's
appropriate for students

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:46.796
to have all their courses virtually,
and I think the social environment

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:48.296
of the high school is an
important environment.

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:51.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And while students see
many advantages to online courses,

00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:55.576
they also recognize that virtual
schooling isn't for everyone.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:57.976
&gt;&gt;Lauren: I think when
you're working online,

00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:00.546
you have to be a lot
more self motivated.

00:09:00.546 --> 00:09:03.146
Your teacher's not sitting there,
you know, "Read these pages

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:05.716
and make sure you have
this done by this time."

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:08.106
You know what you have to do
by the end of the quarter,

00:09:08.106 --> 00:09:09.596
and you just take care
of it yourself.

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:11.966
And I know a lot of
students who don't have

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:17.246
that self motivation do get behind,
because no one's there nagging them.

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:20.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But for
students like Zoe McNealy,

00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:24.056
Virtual High School offers
the best of both worlds.

00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:27.556
The flexibility to fit the
classes into a busy schedule,

00:09:28.086 --> 00:09:29.956
and the time to savor learning.

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:32.766
&gt;&gt;Zoe: It's almost what an
actual class would offer you,

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:36.076
except you're able to do it
on your own, so, you know,

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.016
you can take your time with the book.

00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:42.096
It's almost like you enjoy things
more than you would otherwise.

00:09:43.196 --> 00:09:45.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As technology
continues to advance

00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:50.796
and teacher training improves, online
learning holds even greater promise.

00:09:51.176 --> 00:09:52.886
&gt;&gt;William: The students
are going to be able

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:57.156
to use technology much more easily
and readily than ever before,

00:09:57.546 --> 00:10:02.476
not only taking full online courses,
but taking parts of courses online,

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.546
so that you would have what they
call blended, having teachers

00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:09.186
in the regular classrooms teaching
face to face with their students

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:13.426
for part of the time, and using the
technologies, where appropriate,

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:15.886
to enhance and improve
the quality of courses.

00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:19.146
&gt;&gt;Pat: So you can call me
whenever is flexible for you.

00:10:19.396 --> 00:10:23.916
&gt;&gt;William: We see the potential of
this as being a tremendous method

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.786
of improving the quality
of education,

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:30.976
both in our region and
across the country.
