MIHAI IONESCU: Hi everyone.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.790
Welcome to Payments Live.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.850
We have an office-hours-style
session today.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.880
We will have some product
announcements and feature

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.700
announcements and, of course,
we will take questions from

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.590
Stack Overflow groups
and the moderator.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.950
So let's start with a few
announcements first.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.130
A very exciting one, the new
Merchant Center for Wallet for

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.700
digital goods API merchants
is now fully launched.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.640
If you remember, last year we
had the product manager for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840
the new Merchant Center on the
show and he demoed some of the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.880
new features.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.070
And now it's all reality.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.480
And over the past few months
we migrated everyone.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.019
All new sign ups will now
go directly to the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.060
new Merchant Center.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.230
So I'm going to demo some
of the features.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.060
I'm going to switch to
my screen right now.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.560
And if you see--

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.390
the merchant experience is
completely redesigned.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.810
We have a new, modern UI, and,
in particular, you will see

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.000
features that apply directly
to your API.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.290
In the past, there was
some confusion--

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.880
which features applied to
digital goods merchants, which

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.450
applied to check
out merchants.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.820
That is no more the case.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.280
You will only see stuff that
applies directly to you.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.940
Let's start with looking
at the orders page.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.370
So a very straight design, a
more intuitive way to present

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.900
the orders.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.680
You can see we have some color
coded way to help you decide

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.870
which orders have gone through,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.816
which are still pending.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:04.760
A very nice feature is
the subscription.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.200
I'm going to show a subscription
order right now.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.390
And, very nicely from this page,
you can now directly

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.640
cancel subscription.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.580
It was not possible in the
old Merchant Center.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.666
PENG YING: Very cool.

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:21.580
MIHAI IONESCU: What
else can we show?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.270
PENG YING: I'm glad that we
finally launched this.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.852
It has taken a while.

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:29.770
But we're still steamrolling
along with our products.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.420
So I guess I'll show
off the next

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.560
feature, or feature function.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.060
Whatever you call it.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.760
And that's the ability to really
easily specify taxes,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.520
the taxes that you collect when
you sell a digital good.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.560
So what Google previously
allowed, or what Google Wallet

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.130
for digital goods previously
allowed was for US Merchants,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.060
instead of specifying your tax
rate or collecting your own

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.970
taxes, Google provided a tax
table that you just check box

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.620
next to the states that you
collect taxes in, and we would

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.950
automatically collect
those taxes for you.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.250
And what we've done is we've
expanded that internationally.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.220
So now we can collect taxes on
your behalf for regions in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.740
Canada, and internationally in
various countries in Europe.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.280
And we understand that sometimes
in Europe it's VAT

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.630
versus sales tax.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.080
So that's all handled for
you behind the scenes.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.080
Within your tax tables, just
check the boxes of the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.310
countries that you accept
tax in, or that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.520
you collect tax in.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.076
MIHAI IONESCU: So let's show
something in the [? view ?].

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:29.760
All right.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.720
So in the [? view ?] you can
select the per country tax or

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.720
you can select the global tax
for everyone that shows the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.390
per country tax.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.710
So for, let's say, France, you
can specify the taxing here.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.986
It's probably pretty high.

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:50.170
[LAUGHING]

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.106
PENG YING: It's probably
something like 17.5% or 20%.

00:03:56.106 --> 00:04:01.220
MIHAI IONESCU: You can also go
Canada, by province, and do

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.350
something similar.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.160
One nice thing about the US is
that you don't really have to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.690
know the taxes for each city
or for each state.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.029
You can use our own
predetermined Google tax data.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.324
And then those would
be automatically

00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:23.470
filled in for you.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.700
PENG YING: Yeah, that's
really handy.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.910
So, basically, on our back end
we have a zip level tax table

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.000
that we're using to
collect taxes.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.380
In addition to that, so I think
we recently launched--

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.050
well, we recently launched our
business insights page.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.190
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh yeah,
very exciting.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.650
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.500
Which is kind of like analytics
on your commerce

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.860
sales or commerce business.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.180
We actually brought Mark on, who
was a product manager of

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.420
commerce analytics.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.630
The guy will talk about the
products and some more details

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.075
about the ways to leverage a
product to kind of enhance

00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:02.190
your business.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.220
It's in one of our previous
GDLs, so you can find it on

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.520
YouTube if you look
up commerce GDLs.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.280
At a high level, what it
does is it allows you

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.570
to get better data.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.960
Well, it provides an easily
viewable version of your data.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.150
Right?

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.420
So an easily analyzable
version of your data.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.280
So you can see where your
customers are coming from.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.610
You can see who are your
high spenders.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.480
You can see what regions your
most valuable customers are

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.390
accessing your website from.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.730
And then that will help you, in
turn, target your marketing

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.372
to kind of improve sales.

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.260
MIHAI IONESCU: So I'm
showing here a nice

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.010
chart of revenue plots.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.550
And you can also do orders.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.300
You can change the time period
when that is happening.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.600
And, where available,
you can actually get

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.490
demographics data.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.810
And this is just a
small set of the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.080
features we plan to add.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.480
Stay tuned.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.110
This is one of the areas where
we have plans for serious

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.200
improvements.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.920
And, of course, if there are
any other suggestions or

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.380
feedback you have, please
contact us, and let us know.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.090
All right.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.180
Very exciting launch with
the new Merchant Center.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.410
Let's now move on to another
API-related announcement.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.430
This is for the digital
goods API.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.650
We have made some improvements
and optimizations to the way

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.580
the JavaScript library
is loaded.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.260
If you remember, in the past, we
were using the google.load

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.050
method to load the library.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.640
That was creating some issues.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.680
Depending where you loaded and
how complex your web page was,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.390
it could have changed
a DOM of the page.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.430
And there were some
workarounds.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.710
You could use some call backs
to get around that issue.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.400
But still, it's not ideal
for such a simple API.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.540
We want to make it as simple
as possible to place a

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.620
transaction.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.600
So the new recommended way
is through a script tag.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.370
So now everything is
encapsulated in one library

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.070
called buy.js.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.226
And you just create a
script tag and put

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:19.260
that library in there.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.590
And everything should
work just fine.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.240
If your page is too complex
and you want to do further

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.520
optimizations, like improving
the page load time, you can

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.300
create the script tag
dynamically and insert the

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.920
library at the moment that is
more convenient in your page

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.170
loading or by flow.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.480
Let me switch to our
documentation so I can show

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.570
you an example.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.130
So this is our code snippet in
the demo that we recommend

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.570
everyone to start
playing with.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.380
It actually looks smaller and
much simpler than before.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.020
As you can see, we just
load the library at

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.510
the top of the page.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.160
And then everything works
just as before.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.380
One small change with this new
library loading method.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.640
The signature of the buy method
has slightly changed.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.390
Instead of goog.payments,
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.020
buy is now google.payments
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.940
We recommend that you use
the new signature.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.910
It's also an improvement
and an optimization.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.470
PENG YING: So, do you
know if changes--

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.150
if somebody has used the old
method, and then any upcoming

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.236
changes will only be under the
google.wallet domain space, or

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:40.990
will it be under both
name spaces?

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.690
MIHAI IONESCU: The old method
is still supported.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.698
PENG YING: OK.

00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:46.600
MIHAI IONESCU: If you do not
want to change your code, by

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.000
all means, if it works well,
you don't have to do it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.720
We recommend that,
moving forward,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.660
you use the new method.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.460
And, in particular, if you're
loading the library to the

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.890
script tag, then you have to use
the new signature for the

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.062
buy method.

00:09:04.062 --> 00:09:04.950
PENG YING: Cool.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.730
MIHAI IONESCU: So we updated the
demos to reflect that and

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.600
added the required notes
in the documentation.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.310
PENG YING: A really
simple change.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.680
MIHAI IONESCU: It is
really simple.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.800
But it's helpful depending how
complex your page was.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.640
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.280
MIHAI IONESCU: And it gives you
more control of loading

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.620
the buy flow and optimizing
the experience.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.275
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:26.770
I like that you can--

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.310
so I work on some other projects
as well, and I use

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.110
defer or require.js, which
allows you to kind of defer

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.440
JavaScript loading.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.750
I think that's what Google
load does as well.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.060
But now it allows you to take
more control in when you

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.240
actually load that JavaScript.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.460
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.240
It was an extra step.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.455
You had to read the
documentation for google.load

00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:47.830
and figure out if you need
extra parameters--

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.210
PENG YING: We kind of
just included it.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.740
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.500
Now it's as simple
as possible.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.780
Just include a script, a library
and a script tag.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.190
All right.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.450
Good.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.110
So I think those were the
announcements we had for the

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.620
new Merchant Center and the
library optimizations.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.725
So let's move on to
the Q&amp;A section.

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:07.400
PENG YING: Sounds good.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.710
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.730
Let's switch to the questions.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.170
So I'll take the first one.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.690
The question is related to the
digital goods API, the

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.990
subscriptions in particular.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.200
And the question is, is it
possible to create a digital

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.610
subscription with no
expiration date?

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.880
So that is a good question.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.250
And the answer is, yes.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.470
It's possible.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.410
You can create an open-ended
subscription.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.770
And now, with the new Merchant
Center, it's actually even

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.870
much easier to cancel
it as well.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.320
That's something that was not
possible in the past from the

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.220
merchant side, in an easy way.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.950
So I'd recommend this book in
our documentation for the

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.700
subscription, [? Jason ?]

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.730
Webtalk on field.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.420
And look there for
nonrecurrences.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.170
That's a field in the JWD.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.550
And note that it's an
optional field.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:06.650
So that field specifies how many
times the subscription

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.260
should recur.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.250
If you leave it blank, if you
don't specify it, then it's an

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.560
open-ended subscription with
no expiration date.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.800
So experiment with it a little
bit in the sandbox, and then

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.020
deploy it into production.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.420
And you should have an
open-ended subscription.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.270
You can cancel it at any
time or have the

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.490
customer cancel it.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.100
PENG YING: Very cool I'll
take the next question.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.740
Wallet for online commerce.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.170
Since merchants don't obtain the
cardholders card data, and

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.810
therefore cannot perform risk
analysis, does that mean

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.710
merchants are protected
by Google from charge

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.030
backs due to fraud?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.050
For example, unauthorized
use of card and similar.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.070
So it depends on what you
mean by card data.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.390
So what you'll get is you'll
get a proxy card, a

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.300
one-time-use card, that's an
alias for their back end card.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.260
In addition to that, you'll also
get their billing address

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.960
and their shipping address.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.480
So you can still run your
typical AVS and CVV checks

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.400
against it.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.260
And those should
still validate.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:13.130
I think, if your question is, if
you are doing risk analysis

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.280
based on a specific credit card
number and seeing if that

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.110
credit card number is used by
multiple accounts and that

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.760
kind of risk engine analysis,
then I don't

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.630
think that's possible.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.650
But you should be reassured that
we're also doing a lot of

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.400
risk analysis on our side,
because we do have that card

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.890
and we can associate
the accounts.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.400
We can determine the
accounts that are

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.440
associated with that card.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.730
So I would say a for most of
the transactions, or a

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.330
majority of the transactions,
that they will be secure.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:45.060
In terms of whether or not
Google is handling charge

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.080
backs due to fraud, I will need
to follow up on that one,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.770
because I don't have 100%
accurate information.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:57.055
But I think we'll leave that
answer for the next GDL.

00:12:57.055 --> 00:12:58.770
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.780
I'll take the next.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.090
So it looks like we have
a check out question.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.630
So we already covered
three APIs in

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.010
the first three questions.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.740
So the question is, I am a
merchant from the United

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.940
Kingdom and I use the
Store Gadget.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.720
I want to add shipping costs,
and I get the following

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.810
error-- invalid attribute,
value item weight.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.800
This is not a number.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.610
So it looks from the error that
this is a parsing error.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.950
Probably a typo in your Store
Gadget spreadsheet, because it

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.740
says it's not a number.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.150
So I would check the spreadsheet
and make sure that

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.550
in the weight field you
only have numbers.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.680
You don't have alphanumeric
characters.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.010
The usual errors I've seen is
people say five pounds instead

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.030
of just five or five
kilograms.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.110
So make sure you have nothing
after the number.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:01.330
That being said, once you fix
that, also make sure that the

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.340
weights are actually specified
in pounds.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.000
It's a little bit confusing for
UK merchants, because when

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.580
you go into the Merchant Center
and specify your weight

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.860
table, the weights are
in kilograms there.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.040
But in the spreadsheet,
you have to

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.750
specify them in pounds.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.310
So it's a little bit more work
for the UK merchants.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.220
We realize it's not ideal.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.220
But just to let you know that
there may be more errors down

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.060
the road if you don't specify
the weights in pounds in the

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.120
spreadsheet.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.600
So I think this will fix it.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.191
Just be careful with the
weight conversion.

00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:39.160
PENG YING: Cool.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.010
The next one.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.930
On the roadmap, is there the
ability to assign a nickname

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.870
to each of the cards on your
account so they are more

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.620
easily distinguishable beyond
just the last four digits of

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.870
the card number?

00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.635
MIHAI IONESCU: It's not
clear in what context.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:58.480
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.480
So it depends on the different
purchase flows, or on the

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.900
different flows that you're
entering in the card.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.120
So, Mihai actually showed me
earlier today, in the Google

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.490
Wallet application, if you enter
your card in there you

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.770
can specify a nickname and that
nickname is displayed

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.140
within the Wallet application.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.710
But for the digital purchase
flow, you're only given the

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.280
opportunity to enter in the card
number, CVV, expiration

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.230
date, and your name.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.820
So in that case, you will be
unable to enter in an alias.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.110
MIHAI IONESCU: So it's
a good point.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.175
Since we're allowing you
to do it in one app,

00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.640
but not in the other.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.000
Yeah, maybe we should look
at this and fix it.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.300
PENG YING: Well, so if you're
coming from the merchant's

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.690
perspective, you want the user
to enter in as little

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.020
information as possible for the
highest conversion rate.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.100
But I understand from the user's
perspective it could be

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.180
a little bit confusing.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.630
Maybe there's some optimizations
that we could

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.710
make there.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.000
I'm not quite sure.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.730
MIHAI IONESCU: I think the
default is the card type and

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.325
the last four digits.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:03.540
So if you have an American
Express it'll be AMX 123, and

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.395
you have a Visa, it'll
be VISA 5678.

00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:09.720
So it's not that bad unless you
have multiple Visa cards.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.280
PENG YING: Multiple
AMX and VISAs

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.170
MIHAI IONESCU: It gets confusing
because you have to

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.940
remember the last four digits.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.200
PENG YING: You're just
supporting the economy at that

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.940
point, I think.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.972
MIHAI IONESCU: So then we're
happy for you that you have so

00:16:19.972 --> 00:16:21.185
many credit cards.

00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:22.734
PENG YING: Supporting
the economy.

00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:23.668
MIHAI IONESCU: Yep.

00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:25.540
Cool.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.280
Let's see.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.610
Let me take the next one.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.320
So this is nice.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.250
We already know [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.850
APIs--

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.410
PENG YING: Buy flows, yeah.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.120
A little bit of everything.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.380
Ask more questions, guys.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.070
We're happy to answer any
question that you have.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.020
Or almost any question
that you have.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.430
MIHAI IONESCU: So we have a
question now about check out

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.572
integration.

00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:48.060
It looks like a level
two integration.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.180
So the question is, do I need
an SSL certificate to get

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.090
notifications from check out?

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.080
So this is quite a complex way
to integrate check out.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.360
You need to set up
a web service.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.840
And, to get straight to the
question, the answer is no.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.079
You do not really need to have
a SSL to get notifications

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.150
from check out.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:14.130
Starting with version 2.5 of
the check out API, you can

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.390
skip adding the SSL
certificate.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.670
So when you specify your
settings in the Merchant

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.980
Center, make sure you select
version 2.5 of the API.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.319
And in the API callback contents
that is sent to you,

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.820
make sure you select the radio
button where it says,

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.970
notification serial number.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.820
So that does not
require an SSL.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.880
So, that being said, depending
on how you use notifications,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.720
you may not have to set
up a web service at

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.990
all with an API callback.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.610
If you do not need them real
time, you can just poll for

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.530
notifications.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.730
And we have an API
for that as well.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.230
And then you can get
notifications for specific

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.690
time periods, in bulk.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.030
It's up to you.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.350
So there are various ways to
deal with that, and it looks

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.190
like you have the knowledge
to implement that service.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.600
PENG YING: And that's what's
happening with version 2.5 of

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.430
the API as well, is that
typically you would use an SSL

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.170
certificate of your server
to kind of encrypt that

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.350
transmission when we're pushing
it to your server,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.910
which is what the XML
notification typically is.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.540
But in 2.5, which we call the
basic API, I think, what's

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.510
occurring is that we're sending
you a notification

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.920
telling you that you have
a notification.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.510
At which point, you then make
a request to Google, and to

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.660
pull that notification.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.670
So you're using Google's SSL
certificate to encrypt that

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.300
transaction.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.750
MIHAI IONESCU: So it's
a little bit

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.600
more complex handshake.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.830
But it saves you money and
trouble down the road, because

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.640
you don't have to add
the SSL certificate.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.240
PENG YING: There's also,
I think, a free

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.150
SSL certificate provider.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.840
I believe it's called something
like StartCom.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.290
I forget the name, but there
is a free SSL certificate.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.250
I haven't tried it myself, just
to give you fair notice.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:10.250
But I have seen it, and I've
tried to download a cert.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.445
Didn't complete it for some
reason, I forgot why.

00:19:12.445 --> 00:19:14.470
MIHAI IONESCU: There is
more work involved.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.932
If you can avoid it, if you
don't really need it, then

00:19:17.932 --> 00:19:18.770
don't use it.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.646
Use the 2.5 version
of the API.

00:19:21.646 --> 00:19:22.370
PENG YING: All right.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.390
I'll take the next question.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.990
When will Wallet offer the
ability to save coupons at

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.660
participating merchants?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.630
I could see increased consumer
usage at the point of sale

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.340
once coupons and
deals are saved

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.240
for NFC enabled merchants.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.740
For example $5 off next
purchase, or of $20 or more.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.260
at Duane Reade.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.260
So last year we actually
launched with a few merchants

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.110
of the ability of the tap and
save ability, where you could

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:54.940
tap an NFC sticker and then save
an offer to your Wallet.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.990
And right now, we are
continuously working on

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.550
improving that product, because
I think the API--

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.880
I think we're trying
to make the API a

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.130
little bit more generic.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:14.870
And I don't know how much detail
I can dive into here.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.156
It's something that we're
definitely working on.

00:20:17.156 --> 00:20:20.660
I've done some research about
the space myself.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.930
Something like consumers saved
$4.6 billion dollars by using

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.950
coupons in 2011.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.730
I think that's the stat.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.510
And we completely understand.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.050
We understand that there is a
business need for it or a

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.580
business want for something
like that.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.886
And we're definitely
working on it.

00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:42.920
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.480
So we have a couple
more questions.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.230
So we want to acknowledge that
we receive a lot of questions

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.540
about the future roadmap and
new features that we're

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.310
working on.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.940
So we cannot really give you
details about those, in

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:03.580
particular NFC availability
and new launches.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.220
But we like that you
asked about them.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.050
And we are definitely going
to forward them to all the

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.030
parties involved.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.000
And whenever something new
comes up, you will be the

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.300
first to know on this show.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.450
We usually have product
managers, people from the

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.690
engineering team, come on the
show and give you details

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.230
about new products when we're
ready to launch them.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.110
So it looks like we have one
more question that we can give

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.490
you a definite answer on.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.630
And that one is from a merchant
from Australia.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.440
So merchant from Australia is
asking us, if I'm using the

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.370
digital goods API can I charge
certain users in US dollars

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.520
versus Australian dollars?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.280
And the question is
yes, you can.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.200
And this is a very nice feature,
and one of the nicest

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.960
things about the digital
goods API.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.710
You can charge customers in the
currency of their country.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.040
And this is very convenient for
the customer, because it's

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.630
a very transparent transaction,
and they will not

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.780
incur any currency
conversion fees.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.880
That usually happens when
they're charged

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.950
in a different currency.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.920
And on top of that, there may
be extra credit card fees.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.960
So there is a list of available
currencies that you

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.140
can find in the respective
documentation, either for the

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.450
web API or for the [INAUDIBLE]
billing API.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.000
And all you have to do is change
the currency field in

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.830
the JWD of the order and
specify, in this case, US

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.850
dollars, USD, instead of AUD.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.535
And the customer will see that,
OK, I'm charged $10, 10

00:22:46.535 --> 00:22:48.320
US dollars.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.190
There's a set up of available
currency.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.270
You cannot do this in all
currencies on the planet.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.790
But it's pretty large.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:02.910
And it covers most countries
where you can expect to have a

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.640
good set of paying customers.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.010
And also from your perspective,
it's very nice.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.360
You will not have to worry
at all about currency

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.000
conversions.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.070
Even though you're charging in
US dollars, you will be paid

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.350
in the currency of your
account, which is AUD,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.690
Australian dollars.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.440
Conversion happens automatically
at the same time

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.880
the order is placed.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.550
And money goes straight
into your account.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.780
PENG YING: I think Google syncs
the Forex rate, multiple

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.200
times in the day.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.210
I've heard once an hour, but
don't quote me on that one.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.950
So you'll get a pretty accurate

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.066
conversion rate as well.

00:23:43.066 --> 00:23:46.350
MIHAI IONESCU: So that's
a great way to get more

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.580
customers and definitely
increase the revenue.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.480
When they see that they're not
charged extra fees, they're

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.012
more willing to pay
the transaction.

00:23:56.012 --> 00:23:56.480
All right.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.260
It looks like we're at the
end of our questions.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.530
Thank you, everyone, for sending
questions and sending

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.030
us feedback.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.760
We're looking forward to showing
you new products in

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.290
the upcoming weeks and answer
any other questions you have.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.650
And if you have feedback about
the Merchant Center, please

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:15.035
send it our way.

00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:17.430
PENG YING: We are actually
really excited to show you

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.102
some new products.

00:24:19.102 --> 00:24:19.905
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:22.020
PENG YING: Upcoming weeks.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.780
MIHAI IONESCU: All right Well,
see you next time.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.080
Bye bye.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.330
PENG YING: See ya.
