00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.370
The specific objectives
of this lesson are, one,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.300
we'll talk a little bit about
the concept of Epsilon Photography,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.570
and how we can go from that
concept to Coded Photography.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.220
We'll talk, really,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.440
in much more detail about the concept
of Coded Photography itself.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.350
And we'll talk about coded aperture, and
a flutter shutter camera, two specific

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.990
types of camera that actually can do a
little bit more than a standard camera.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.644
Of course, both these cameras are
examples of computational cameras that

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:30.660
very interested building for
those support computational photography.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.640
Both of these, the coded aperture
camera, and the flutter shutter camera

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.490
are computational cameras that
are partly what we have thinking of,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.110
when we talk about controllable
cameras can be used to capture

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.160
images to support the computational
photography pipeline.
