00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.591
- [Instructor] What
are all positive values

00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:05.009
of p such that the series converges?

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.842
So let's see.

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.721
We have the sum from n equals one

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.837
to infinity of negative one to the n

00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:11.814
plus one, times p over six to the n.

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:13.489
So there's a couple of things
that might jump out at you.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.305
This negative one to the n plus one,

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.771
as n goes from one to two to three,

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.066
this is just going to
alternate between positive one,

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.142
negative one, positive one, negative one.

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:25.499
So we're gonna have alternating signs.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.417
That might be a little bit
of a clue of what's going on,

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:28.759
and actually, let's just write it out.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.834
This is going to be,
see when n equals one,

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:32.618
this is going to be to the second power,

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.819
so it's gonna be positive one.

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.867
So it's gonna be p over
six, and when n is two,

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.450
this is gonna be to the third power,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.950
so it's gonna be minus p over six squared,

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.200
then plus p over six to the third power.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.816
And I could even write to the
first power right over here.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:55.566
Then minus p over six to the fourth power,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.365
and we're gonna just
keep going plus, minus,

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:00.387
on and on and on and on forever.

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:03.857
This is clearly, this is a
classic alternating series

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:05.623
right over here, and we could actually

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.187
apply our alternating series test.

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.454
And our alternating series test tells us

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.273
that if this part of our expression,

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:16.438
the part that is not alternating in sign,

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:18.189
I guess you could say, if this part

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.022
of the expression is
monotonically decreasing,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.854
monotonically decreasing,

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.753
which is just a fancy way of saying that

00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:32.195
each successive term is less
than the term before it,

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:34.678
and if we also know that the limit of this

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:38.994
as n approaches infinity, that
also has to be equal to zero.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.961
So the limit as n approaches infinity

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.128
of p over six to the nth power
also has to be equal to zero.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.779
Under what conditions is
that going to be true?

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.011
Well, to meet either
one of those conditions,

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.294
p over six has to less than one.

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.977
If p over six was equal to one,

00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:02.266
if, for example, p was six, well then

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.010
we wouldn't be monotonically decreasing.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.360
Every term here would just be one.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.442
It would be one to the one,
one squared, on and on and on.

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:12.826
And if p is greater than
six, well, then every time

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:14.643
we multiply by p over six again,

00:02:14.643 --> 00:02:16.710
we would get a larger
number over and over again,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.309
and the limit for sure
would not be equal to zero.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:23.513
We could say p over six
needs to be less than one,

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:25.650
and so multiply both sides by six

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.509
and you get p needs to be less than six.

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.868
And they told us, for what are
all the positive values of p?

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:35.685
So we also know that p has
to be greater than zero.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:38.535
P is greater than zero and less than six,

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:41.435
which is that choice right over here.

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:43.685
Once again, we're not gonna
say less than or equal to six

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.218
because if p was equal to six, this term

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.902
is gonna be one to the
n, and so we're just

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:49.668
gonna have, this would be one.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.535
It would be one minus one plus one,

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.086
on and on and on and on forever.

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.864
So definitely like that first choice.
