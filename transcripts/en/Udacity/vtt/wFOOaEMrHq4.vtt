00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.320
Only few companies are big enough to
supply the needs of an entire market.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.050
Even the large ones must break down
the total demand into segments and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.440
choose those that the company's
best equipped to handle.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.490
Market segmentation is marketing
strategy that involves dividing a broad

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.910
target market into subsets of consumers
who have common needs, wants,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.084
demand, or characteristics.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.120
You'll be developing a marketing
strategy that targets the individuals in

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.890
your chosen segment.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.320
You can learn the basics of it in
the book that become the bible for

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.520
startups 25 years ago.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.890
And it's still valid.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.710
Crossing The Chasm, by Geoffrey Moore.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.520
Let's meet Geoffrey Moore himself
to learn what he has to say

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.589
about market segmentation.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.920
&gt;&gt; Hi, so my name's Geoffrey Moore.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.690
I live in Silicon Valley.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.451
I'm a business author, I'm a member
of a venture capital firm, and

00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.880
I consult and
advise technology companies, largely.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.790
Entrepreneurs tend to have
visions of global domination, and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.150
in that model you want to
segment the whole world.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.290
Because eventually the whole world
is going to buy your product,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.620
it's just a question of
who's going to buy it first.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.320
So, I think the whole world
thing is a great fantasy and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.650
it keeps you going at night and
on the weekends, but

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.800
eventually if you're going to
actually light the fire.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.460
You know when you light a fire,
you don't want to run a match up and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.380
down under a very big log,
you're just going to burn your fingers.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.390
What you want to do when you light
a fire is you get some kindling and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.800
then you get some crumpled up paper,
and you get the match.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.110
And you hold the match in one and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.770
only one place until it
starts to burst into flame.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.380
Then the flame can grow.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.320
But so, the key thing with
the segmentation at the beginning for

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.700
an entrepreneur is, where are you
going to hold the match and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.260
how long are you going to hold
it in place until it lights?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.320
And sometimes you put it,
holding in the wrong place.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.480
You're holding it under a brick and
bricks do not burn, right?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.132
Okay.
So, you've got to move the match but,

00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:49.811
what you don't want to do is just
continually moving it back and forth.

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:53.906
And entrepreneurs who are in love with
their product have a very tough time

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:55.950
with this problem.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340
Entrepreneurs who are in love with their
customer, do not have this problem.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, so how do we start this fire?

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.940
Let's explore the different
types of segmentation.
