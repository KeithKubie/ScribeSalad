00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.126
&gt;&gt;Cindy: And we have a
conversation about it,

00:00:02.446 --> 00:00:05.946
and the conversation
should build on each other.

00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:06.996
So you should build on--

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.116
&gt;&gt;Student: When you're filling out the
college application and you're putting

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:11.116
down each class you did and your grade.

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:14.156
And then you're like, oh wow, if I
would have done just like one more thing

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:16.116
in English, I could have gotten
a little bit higher of a grade.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.486
And I think like, making students
realize that sooner would help them

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.996
and like, decrease the stress.

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:26.006
&gt;&gt;Cindy: An academic seminar block works
because we teach students how to learn.

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:29.096
We started addressing this
metacognitive, these social,

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.336
emotional skills, how
to build relationships,

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:32.646
how to ask questions in class.

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.726
We've been successful to the
point that a hundred percent

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.056
of our seniors this year have been
accepted into post-secondary programs.

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:51.306
&gt;&gt;Our students come from across New
Mexico with varying degrees of skill.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:56.716
So we realized that we needed a place in
the day for them to learn how to learn.

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:01.396
We started down the path
with ninth grade academy,

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:03.396
where students could either
catch up or get ahead.

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:04.686
&gt;&gt;Eric: Good morning, class.

00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:06.506
&gt;&gt;Students: Good morning, Mister Crites.

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:10.266
&gt;&gt;Eric: Just a reminder of the
schedule for the week, okay?

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.646
So today is project work time.

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:16.336
&gt;&gt;Ninth grade academy is a class that
meets every day for thirty-five minutes.

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:20.056
We start the year off getting kids
ready to be high school students,

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:22.146
things like teaching them
how to read their schedule,

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:25.626
and make sure that they know how to find
their classes, how to use school email,

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.586
how to use their planners, how
to organize their notebooks.

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.256
The purpose of it is really to
teach kids the non-cognitive skills

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.356
that they're going to
need to be successful.

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:35.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Use study hall
to the best of your ability.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.906
&gt;&gt;Kara: Although we could kind of
spread that out more, to just using time

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:39.846
to the best of your ability.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:44.196
&gt;&gt;Kara: Ninth grade academy, I find it
really helpful, because we learn a lot

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:49.286
of ways to work on our testing
skills and our studying skills

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:52.626
and it gives us a little bit of
extra time to get help from teachers,

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:54.836
and just working on life skills.

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:58.326
&gt;&gt;Eric: What are the skills and
knowledge that you have developed

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.546
that you want to teach
next year's ninth graders

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.226
through a presentation,
some kind of performance?

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:11.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, so it will be like a
ninth grader's guide to surviving NMSA.

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:11.216
Okay.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.216
&gt;&gt;Student: Our presentation is
called measure twice, cut once.

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:17.406
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't compare yourself
to your friends and peers,

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.516
that one's really important.

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.386
[cheering]

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:24.896
&gt;&gt;Molly: Ninth grade academy did help
teach me how to manage time and be able

00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:26.836
to keep all my classes in order.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:31.556
Skills like these will help me get
through these next three years.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:43.436
&gt;&gt;Cindy: Senior seminar was created with
the purpose of getting every student

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.236
into the college, university or
conservatory of their choice,

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:48.656
by providing them with the
support they needed to get there.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:52.526
&gt;&gt;Acacia: Some students may not
have the vocabulary and the skills

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:54.366
to start the college
application process.

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:55.836
It may just feel too foreign to them.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.976
The objective of senior seminar is

00:02:57.976 --> 00:03:00.786
to have some time set
aside that's dedicated

00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:02.546
to the college application process.

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:05.156
And the time is structured in a way

00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:07.706
that makes the application
process manageable.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.896
&gt;&gt;Anything about admissions essays,
any way to improve that process?

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:13.726
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it was
pretty great this year.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:18.046
&gt;&gt;Student: We had a lot of time
for editing and had a lot of time

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.026
to like, really go in depth.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:23.166
&gt;&gt;Acacia: Some of the things we
do include the admissions essay.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:27.516
We have an English teacher come in and
discuss what good writing looks like.

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:31.606
We look at asking for letters
of recommendation and how to ask

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.986
for a letter that's going to be strong.

00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:37.436
I know that that got some
students motivated to jump in

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:39.926
and start working harder on their
college application process.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.076
&gt;&gt;Do you feel like you have a pretty
good sense, leaving this school,

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:47.036
the difference between the financial
aid offers that you've received?

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:50.446
&gt;&gt;Julia: We talked a lot about
deciphering student loans

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.436
and what it means to take out loans,
and what are the implications?

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:57.316
It's just those sort of things that
really get you thinking like an adult.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:00.396
&gt;&gt;Acacia: I mean, this is like
the goal that we're trying to--

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:03.586
&gt;&gt;John: The application process
is very long and difficult,

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:07.786
and so having that class time and a
teacher who knew what she was talking

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:09.706
about and could help you, really helped.

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:13.816
Because if I had to do that all by
myself, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.486
&gt;&gt;Acacia: Having that time
every day when I can check

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:20.536
in with them gives them the
motivation to eventually find a school

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:22.996
or a career that's satisfying
and interesting to them.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.476
&gt;&gt;Cindy: We're showing a
closing of the achievement gap

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:28.796
for socioeconomically
disadvantaged and Hispanic students.

00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:32.396
From the indicators that we do have,
we know what we're doing is working.

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:33.626
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good to see you.
