00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.970
Clive Wearing was playing the piano alone
in his room.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.580
When his wife came into the room, he immediately
leapt up and embraced her with joyful enthusiasm.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
A minute later, she slipped out to grab a
glass of water, and when she returned, he

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
gave her that same bright greeting, as if
she’d been gone for days.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.990
And then he did again.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.990
And again.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.270
Clive was an accomplished London musician,
until, in 1985 at the age 47, he contracted

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.060
a rare Herpes encephalitis virus that ravaged
his central nervous system.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.570
Since then he’s been unable to remember
almost any of his past, or to make any new

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.570
memories.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.410
His wife is the only person he recognizes,
but he can never recall the last time he saw

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
her.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.880
This may be the most profound case of extreme
and chronic amnesia ever recorded.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.440
Our memory helps make us who we are.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.880
Whether recognizing loved ones, recalling
past joys, or just remembering how to, like,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.190
walk and talk and fry an egg, memory is the
chain that connects our past to our present.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.129
If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable
of leaving the present moment, and unable

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.380
to embrace the future.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.530
But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing,
of course.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.320
Wearing can’t remember any details about
his personal past, but he still remembers

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.180
how to speak English, get dressed, and play
the piano.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.071
Some memories you process automatically, and
they are stored differently than your more

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.280
personal or factual memories, like, your first
kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.850
or who won the Peloponnesian War.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.010
Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help
demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.760
want you to have a look at our Spartan friend
here, and remember his name.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.270
‘Cause we’re gonna test your memory in
just minute.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.049
[INTRO]

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.970
Technically, memory is learning that has persisted
over time -- information that has been stored

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.060
and, in many cases, can be recalled.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.509
Except of course during the exam!

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.670
Our memories are typically accessed in three
different ways — through recall, recognition,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.060
and relearning.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.750
And if you think about all the different kinds
of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.069
all actually designed to size up how you access
stored information in these ways.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.780
Like, recall is how you reach back in your
mind and bring up information, just as you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.500
do in fill-in-the-blank tests.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.260
So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece,
your brain would hopefully recall the answer

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
as Athens.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.160
Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice
test -- you only need identify old information

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.590
when presented with it.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.670
As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient
city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.670
or Sparta.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.980
And relearning is sort of like refreshing
or reinforcing old information.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.130
So when you study for a final exam, you relearn
things you half-forgot more easily than you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.860
did when you were first learning them, like,
say, a basic timeline of the Greek empire.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860
But how?

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.870
How does all of that data that we’re exposed
to, all the time, every day, become memory?

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.890
Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.650
out enough about the process of memory-formation
to break it down into three stages:

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.430
First, it’s first encoded into brain, then
stored for future use, and then eventually

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.780
retrieved.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.020
Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured
out that, just because you take a lot of stuff

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.390
about your mind for granted, that doesn’t
mean it isn’t complicated.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.430
By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first
record things we want to remember as an immediate,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520
but fleeting, sensory memory.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.420
Think back to the image I showed you a minute
ago.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.440
Do you remember his name?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.629
If you do it’s because you successfully
managed to shuffle it into your short-term

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.690
memory, where you probably encoded it through
rehearsal.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.970
This is how you briefly remember something
like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.409
what’s Jenny’s number?

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.409
Okay.

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.409
867-5309...867-5309…

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.050
8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your
head there.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.670
Or in this case, I told you to remember that
guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas”

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.030
repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t
think you were doing it.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.500
But this information really only stays in
your short-term memory for under thirty seconds

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.720
without a lot of rehearsal.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.660
So if you weren’t repeating “Leonidas,”
you’d probably have

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.660
forgotten it already.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.310
Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really
only hold between four to seven distinct bits

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.930
of information at a time--at which point,
the memory either decays, or gets transferred

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.500
into long-term memory.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.859
Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable
and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.089
all your knowledge, skills, and experiences.

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:28.490
Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin,
psychologists have recognized that the classical

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.939
definition of short-term memory didn’t really
capture all of the processes involved in the

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.990
transfer of information to your long-term
memory.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.759
I mean, it’s more than just being able to
remember some Greek guy’s name.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.259
So later generations of psychologists revisited
the whole idea of short-term memory and updated

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.419
it to the more comprehensive concept of working
memory.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.759
Working memory involves all the ways that
we take short-term information and stash it

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.229
in our long-term stores.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.229
And increasingly, we think of it as involving
both explicit and implicit processes.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.940
When we store information consciously and
actively, that’s an explicit process.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.580
We make the most of this aspect of working
memory when we study, for instance, so that

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.469
we can know that Athens is the capital of
Greece, and that Pompeii was a Roman town,

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:09.469
and not a Greek one.

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.770
This is how we capture facts and knowledge
that we think we’re going to need -- like

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.009
I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’
name, you concentrated on that detail and

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.729
filed it away, if briefly.

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.399
But of course we’re not conscious of Every.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.399
Tiny.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.419
Thing that we take in.

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.599
Yet, our working memory often transfers stuff
we’re not aware of to long-term storage.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.770
We call that an implicit process, the kind
you don’t have to actively concentrate on.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.879
A good example might be classically conditioned
associations, like, if you get all sweaty

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.290
and nervous at the dentist because you had
a root canal last year.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.849
You don’t need to pull up that file on the
last time you got your face drilled to think

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.430
oh hey, oral surgery!

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.639
Not my favorite!

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.490
Instead, implicit processes cover all that
stuff automatically.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.770
This kind of automatic processing is hard
to shut off-- unless you’ve got something

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.520
unusual going on in your brain, you may not
have much choice but to learn this way, like

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.520
how you learned how to not put your hand into
a fire.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.960
That learning would have happened pretty much
automatically as soon as you first yanked

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.349
your hand away from an open flame.

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.150
Whether things are lodged in there explicitly
or implicitly, or both, there are also different

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.139
kinds of long-term memory.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.419
For instance, procedural memory refers to
how we remember to do things -- like riding

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.089
a bike or reading - it’s effortful to learn
at first, but eventually you can do it without

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.149
thinking about it.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.879
Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied
to specific episodes of your life -- like

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.149
“remember that time that Bernice fell out
of her chair in chemistry lab and started

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:31.169
laughing uncontrollably?”

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.409
Man, good times.

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.150
There are other types of long-term memory,
too, and we’re continually learning more

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.089
about the biology and psychology of the whole
complex phenomenon.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:45.360
For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic
memories (among others) seem to be deeply

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.969
affected, his procedural memories for things
seems to be in one piece.

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.979
This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t
have time to explore here, and that we don’t

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.429
yet fully understand -- Wearing and others
have a lot to teach us about the different

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:59.089
types of long-term memory storage.

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:02.349
Now, for healthy memories, there are lots
of little tricks you can use to help remember

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:03.349
information.

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:06.839
Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization,
and I’m sure you know a few that take the

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:11.369
form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV for the colors
of the rainbow, for instance.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.010
Mnemonics work in part by organizing items
into familiar, manageable units, in a process

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.289
called chunking.

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.979
For example, it may be hard to recall a seven-digit
number, but it’ll be easier to commit it

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:23.949
to memory in the rhythm of a phone number:
867-5309.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.659
Or you could just, you know, write a song
about it.

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:31.939
Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can
help you with explicit processing, but how

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:36.659
well you retain your data can depend on how
deep you dig through the different levels

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:37.889
of processing.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:42.279
Shallow processing, for instance, lets you
encode information on really basic auditory

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:46.409
or visual levels, based on the sound, structure
or appearance of a word.

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.959
So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas
to your explicit memory, using shallow processing

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:54.319
you might encode the word by recalling the
cool font you saw it in.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.979
But to really retain that information, you’d
want to activate your deep processing, which

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:03.739
encodes semantically, based on actual meaning
associated with the word.

00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:08.969
In this case, you might remember the story
of the mega-tough yet very scantily clad warrior

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:10.360
of ancient Greece.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.499
Or you might remember that “leon” means
“lion” in Greek, that lions are tough

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:18.149
fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough Spartan
warrior-king.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:20.989
And then to really, really make it stick,
you want to connect it to something meaningful

00:08:20.989 --> 00:08:24.279
or related to your own personal, emotional
experience.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:28.339
Like maybe Gerard Butler’s bronzed eight-pack
torso and unconquerable blood-lust helped

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:31.969
lock down the words Spartan and Leonidas in
your forever memory.

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:32.969
I mean, maybe.

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:34.039
If … if that helps you.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.909
In the end, how much information you encode
and remember depends on both the time you

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.000
took to learn it and how you made it personally
relevant to YOU.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.829
Memory is extremely powerful.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:48.519
It’s constantly shaping and reshaping your
brain, your life, and your identity.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:53.380
Clive Wearing is still himself on the outside,
but in his inability to recall who he was,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.540
or process what has happened, he has lost
some critically important part of himself.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.910
Our memories may haunt us or sustain us, but
either way, they define us.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.540
Without them, we are left to wander alone
in the dark.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.670
If you were committing this lesson to memory,
you learned about how we encode and store

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:16.399
memory, the difference between implicit automatic
and effortful explicit processing, how shallow

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:19.850
and deep processing work, and a few types
of long-term storage.
