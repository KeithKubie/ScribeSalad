1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,370
Yeah. Come on. Don't,
don't Hendricks please.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,780
I wanted a, I wanted one of those fringe
jackets when I was in high school,

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:12,390
so I played football until I was a senior
and then when once football season's

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,730
over I have a half a year
left of school and uh,

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,710
that's why I smoked
weed for the first time.

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,620
You started playing guitar and
I want to want a fringe jackets.

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,560
I didn't have one, but I did get a
pair of moccasins for a little while.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,520
I wore moccasins. Did they have
beads? They did not have beads,

9
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,340
but they had the little French too
little tassels. They were like,

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,690
it was just a little fringe. Yeah. No
soul. What's the purpose of fringe like?

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,000
That's like when you think
of a trapper jacket, right.

12
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,830
When I'm Deann Davy
Crockett type dudes style.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,190
Give him wearing that style's really,
yeah.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,730
Why would they have any style back then?
Everybody's got style back then.

15
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:49,270
It seems like they were just trying
to stay alive. Yeah, the weak ones,

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,520
but the cool ones are
still trying to get laid.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,630
I think Daniel Moon wasn't
trying to work it a little bit.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,230
We'll at this buckskins are
often trimmed with a fringe,

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,640
originally a functional detail to allow
the garment to shed rain and to drive

20
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:08,900
faster. One wet because the fringe asses
a series of wix to disperse the water or

21
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:12,440
quills. Interesting. Oh Wow.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Buckskins derived from peers can clothing
worn by native Americans. Oh Wow.

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,630
How about that? That's
genius. Smarter than you now.

24
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:25,550
So it hangs down and the
water goes through all the
tissue in the deer and gets

25
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,660
to the bottom. So those little things get
wet. But the thing that you're wearing,

26
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,830
the touches your skin is dry.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,030
You would think by now the deer would
have had fringe on their outfits.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,260
I think the don't give a fuck you or
really hot or their body temperatures much

29
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:44,240
higher than ours. Oh really? Yeah. It's
one of the weirder things about, um,

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,040
when you put your hands on one
inside of them, the really hot,

31
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,750
like if you're for like 98 degrees, what
are they like? I don't know. I would,

32
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,920
if I had to guess, I'd say it's more than
a hundred. Oh yeah, I'd say that. Yeah.

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,270
I bet they're probably like 105,
something like that. What? What does it,

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,010
which is, what's the body temperature? It
brought up the cooking temperature. Oh,

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,850
it's 350 degrees.

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,710
They're cooking before we even catch them.
That's hilarious.

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,340
That's why people love deer. You
don't have to cook them. Precooked

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,530
they're preheated same as most.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,170
It switches 37.5 38.5 degrees Celsius,
which,

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,980
which we don't understand this
type in pre heated dear me,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,760
38.5 degrees Celsius. When you
think that is, if you had to guess,

42
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:40,210
I don't have a clue. What,
what was the, what was the
number 38 degrees Celsius? Oh,

43
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:43,270
that's 105 is it?
No,

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,230
it's like 90 99.5 to a hundred. Right.
In that same range as they are like us,

45
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,460
one or two higher. They're like
someone with a little bit of fever. Oh,

46
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,700
I did something that you would, you would
enjoy. You might have even done this.

47
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,630
Speaking of body heat. Uh, I was
in San Francisco last weekend,

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,050
brilliant performing. And uh, I
was working with my friend, uh,

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,510
Qras Sultana Bitch, very
funny comedian. She kicks ass,

50
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,590
she's Russian.

51
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,590
She grew up up there and she brought me
to a Russian like bathhouse beat you up

52
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,810
the sticks. Yeah. Do you ever do
that? They call it Banya. Banya man.

53
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,610
Oh Man. You go into a sauna, a two
level sauna. So it's even hotter,

54
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,720
like up at the, at the top, like
an attic in a sauna. Super Hot.

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,410
And you lay down on this bench and they
take these bushes like these sticks and

56
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,130
they were, they wet them and then
they start beating you with them.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,790
Not a lot of pressure.
It's too, it's so hot. It,

58
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,180
you're in a sauna, you're
already like, really? Really?

59
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,530
And then that thing just things hot
too and that thing's hot. And with the,

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,040
with the steam coming off of the branches,
as they're beating your back,

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,540
it creates a little,
a little pocket that gets even hotter.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,570
So it just brings your body to the super
high temperatures they're making and

63
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,520
making whether they really
are anyway and uh, yeah.

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,580
For about 15 minutes and you come out of
there and just feel to jump in the cold

65
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:16,420
afterwards. Yeah. Into a cold plunge all
the way under this really cold water.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,070
Amazing.
Yeah.

67
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,240
The Russians really looked up fade
or a million inco was like one of the

68
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,640
greatest heavyweights, if not the
greatest heavyweight of all time.

69
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,890
One of the things that you'd
see about his training,

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,190
what does it was that it was
very old school. Russian,

71
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,980
like a lot of stuff on the
parking or in a, um, a playground,

72
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,020
just like they did a lot of
stuff in a playground and um,

73
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,850
he incorporated the Banya
that was a part of it.

74
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:43,270
And like you see him lying there
and beaten and what sticks.

75
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:47,350
There you go see it on time.
So yeah, that's what, yeah,

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,640
they figured something out. You know,
all the pretty great invented sauna.

77
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,600
They figured something out.

78
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:55,720
There's something about that
extreme temperature that just,

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,310
it's very good for your, your ability
to recuperate. You feel better?

80
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,790
It reduces inflammation. I felt
great. Like I went in there.

81
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,540
I've been traveling so hard over the
last couple of months have just been

82
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,580
knotted up. I've just
been like, I was like,

83
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:12,370
maybe I'll do this and
then get a massage after.

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,470
Cause that'll really a gentleman. He
like a gentleman and we didn't have time.

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,870
She had to go. She was driving
me. She had to go do something.

86
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,970
So we only had time for that part.
When I came out of the,

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,340
the Banya or Banya,
I didn't need a massage.

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,840
Everything was relaxed. Everything had
changed in just like 15 minutes. Yeah,

89
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,490
it was great, man. I wish it
was a, I don't know if there's,

90
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,950
they have them in la or not,
but I'd like to seek them out.

91
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,320
They know they have them in New York.
One in West Hollywood.

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,040
There is photos spot or something
like that. Yeah, there you go bro.

93
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,450
A lot of dongs keep your pants on. A
lot of dogs. Clothing was optional.

94
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,790
Hey, clothing optional, and I'm with
Keira. You know, we're like, you know,

95
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,220
we're coworkers and she's wearing
nothing. She's has, she's totally naked.

96
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,990
And then there's dogs everywhere.
There's dogs everywhere. He's the dunks.

97
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,940
She sees the dogs. I see
that a girl. We're the old.

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,960
We were the only ones covered up.
Where were they going? Dong skip.

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,720
Staring America. What's that? In America.
You can't do this. Yeah, San Francisco.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,280
Are you sure? Yeah. Girls who's walking
around with dogs. They were naked.

101
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,020
The girls were naked.
He ran.

102
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,810
I are the only ones with clothes on
because we worked with each other.

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Sending immigration

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,810
police send alert. Yeah. There's
something going on there bro.

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,270
It's just dicks everywhere.
Open that door is you.

106
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:34,280
You cool with Dicks in front of
you? I'm not. I was looking here.

107
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,900
I was looking away. Cops just come in
fucking masks on [inaudible] alert. Yeah,

108
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,640
they throw one of those. What are those?
Uh, gas canisters that flash bangs.

109
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,940
Just grabbing guys by their dogs.
Pulling them out until the paddy wagon.

110
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,550
It would all run out. Grab
them there. Dot. That's the
first thing you got to grab.

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,650
Someone throws a tear gas canister.
It explodes in a room cover.

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm wearing pants.

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,630
So I was the only one with pants on and
you can kind of feel like everyone was

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,920
looking at you like you're making us feel
like shamed cause you're wearing pants,

115
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,030
man.
It's just take them off.
