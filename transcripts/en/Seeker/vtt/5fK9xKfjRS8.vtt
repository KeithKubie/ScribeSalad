00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.070
In space, no one can hear you complain…
about that leaky faucet.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.460
Also, you definitely can't call a plumber,
so how do things get fixed?

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.950
Hey tinkerers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.770
Space is only 62 miles away, but it's taken
countless hours of engineering and science

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.500
throughout history to get us there.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.200
But there's one thing all machines do, and
that is fail.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500
They will eventually, and inevitably fail.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.529
A mechanical failure is always an annoyance,
but when it happens in space, that is all

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.429
compounded, and even little things can become
huge challenges.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.929
If anything goes wrong, astronauts are on
their own, and as Astronaut Don Pettit told

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.050
DNews, Mission Control can think of 80 percent
of things, but even they can't cover all of

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.199
it, and when that happens -- according to
Pettit -- you need to become MacGyver.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.199
*sing theme!*

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:58.100
As the ISS is pretty much like going into
the wilderness, in the most awesome science-future

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.589
way possible, Astronauts need to be self-sufficient
and creative thinkers -- which is part of

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.829
the reason they go through years of rigorous
training in medical, engineering, flight,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:07.829
and so on.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.950
So when things DO break, how do they repair
them…

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.950
unconventionally.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.009
In 2006, astronauts on the ISS were testing
experimental heat shield gel by spreading

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.210
it on test surfaces… but they needed to
smooth it out.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.440
Doing that in space proved difficult, so...
they used spatulas from the kitchen.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.009
Yep, regular old spatulas.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.439
On Jan 15, 2003 -- Don Pettit and Ken Bowersox
suited up for an EVA to clean debris off the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.329
outside of the docking port, so they could
safely attach a service module and move cargo

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.450
into the station.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.869
The problem was, sandblasting that had been
going on down on the launchpad in the days

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.299
before the shuttle launched, and had contaminated
the cargo with sand.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.539
The shuttle brought sand with it to space.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.049
Somehow that sand got caught in the lubricant
on the outer hatch -- which would have compromised

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.049
docking.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.640
I interviewed astronaut Don Pettit, and he
said he used wire (not unlike a coat hanger)

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.119
and a t-shirt to wipe the sand off so they
could get a better seal.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.290
True story!

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350
Another major repair device?

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.360
Duct tape -- used on Skylab to help astronauts
boots lock in to the floor, and also a specialized

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.050
Klaxon tape -- sort of like reflective electrical
tape.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.270
During Gemini-Titan 4 astronaut Ed White performed
the first EVA -- or spacewalk -- ever.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.080
And he wrapped his two tethers with Klaxon
tape to keep them neat and untangled.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.030
Obviously these are just a few examples, but
being a MacGyver is part of the astronaut

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.030
mentality.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.130
As Pettit put it, "We've got the best experts
on the ground…and spaceflight is the ultimate

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.360
team sport."

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.810
Astronauts go through intensive training,
they're members of NASA's astronaut corps,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.620
and the requirements are "superior academic
qualifications," but also a certain temperament.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.010
According to a NASA representative, astronauts
need to be cool in "risky" and "isolated environments,"

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.090
they're likely to be gregarious and someone
who'd be considered a "good neighbor," but

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.150
Pettit told me, you need to be a tinkerer
too, because quote, "If you tinker on earth,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.160
you're going to be good at tinkering on orbit."

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.260
Astronauts are the kind of people that when
something breaks, they'll figure out how it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.930
works, and then how to fix it in microgravity
-- with whatever they have around.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.930
Since NASA ended the space shuttle program
in 2011, the International Space Station is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.590
even more out on a limb.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.690
Without the large shuttle to bring replacement
"boxes," as Pettit called them, they're forced

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.360
to repair things that were never meant to
be repaired in space.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.580
Like Pettit did with the on-board refrigerator
during one of his missions.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.280
The ISS is slated to fly until 2024 -- another
8 years -- and things are aging.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.510
Astronauts are testing 3D printing technology
on orbit to make some parts but there will

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.790
always be someone MacGyvering and jury-rigging
to survive in the final frontier.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.550
If you're thinking, why bother?

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.580
Leave it be, we don't need the ISS!

00:03:49.580 --> 00:04:04.190
Lemme try and convince you, with THIS video
about why the ISS even matters at all.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:16.400
One time, I lowered a lead weight with sticky
tape on a fishing line into the space between

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.510
the drywall and outer wall 15 feet to recover
a USB adapter it was so awesome.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.010
What's your proudest MacGyver story -- do
you even know who Richard Dean Anderson IS?!

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.440
GAHD!!!
