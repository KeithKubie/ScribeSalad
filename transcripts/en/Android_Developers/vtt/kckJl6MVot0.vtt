NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.280
where we're going to talk
about what context is

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.863
and why it's critical
to understanding

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:16.390
how people use technology
and how it affects

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.670
their expectations
from this technology.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.750
I'm your host Nazmul
Idris, a developer advocate

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.550
passionate about
design and mobile.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.780
And I have a very special guest
with me on the show today.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.130
PAUL SAXMAN: Thanks, Nazmul.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.650
I'm Paul Saxman also
developer advocate,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.800
and I love everything about
maps, location-based apps,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.880
and likewise, design.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.880
NAZMUL IDRIS: Excellent.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.690
You're on the right show.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.380
There are few main elements of
context, time, goal, location,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.950
an attitude.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.220
A user's context is driven by
the amount of time a user has

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.670
to accomplish a goal, the tasks
that the user needs to perform

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.570
to accomplish this goal using
the right different devices

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.910
and applications, where the
user is physically located--

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.720
are they at home, at
work, at an airport?--

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.110
what the user state of mind
is, and are they happy, sad,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.450
stressed, seeking company,
or wanting to be alone.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.050
All these things
put together drive

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.230
how people choose
the devices they use

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.270
and it also affects
their expectations

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.780
from applications
on these devices.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.800
Users have an expectation
from technology

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.100
and oftentimes this expectation
is not met my current products.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.070
Sometimes this
dissonance is a result

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.770
of creators of
these products not

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.510
understanding how small
changes in elements of context

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.430
have huge impacts on
user expectations.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.020
So to deliver a
great experience,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.130
you have to ensure that your app
meets the user's expectations

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.720
on specific devices
for specific contexts.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.040
To highlight the interplay
between context, device

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.570
selection, and
user expectations,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.010
we will give you some
examples of common scenarios

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.140
that people encounter
in their daily lives

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.390
and how these situations
affect their interaction

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.837
with different devices that they
use to perform various tasks.

00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:55.920
So let's say you're at
home sitting in your living

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.247
room watching "Walking Dead--"

00:01:58.247 --> 00:01:59.580
PAUL SAXMAN: Your favorite show.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.830
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.650
Exactly.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.620
--on your TV.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.990
And you see an exotic
location like Atlanta,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.227
and you want to do some research
on vacation spots in that area.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.810
During the commercial
break, you might

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500
pick up your tablet or laptop
and use your favorite travel

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.050
app to find vacation
destinations in Atlanta.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.130
Now, since you're home
in a relaxed environment

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.610
and are performing a task
that's not really urgent,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.770
you're simultaneously watching
TV and using your laptop

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.886
or tablet to do some research.

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:28.260
You're probably also checking
your email and social media

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.280
on your smartphone.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.330
People are distracted.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.000
Or let's say you're
at an airport

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.376
and you're checking
in for your fight.

00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:37.500
You might want your boarding
pass information, what

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830
gate to go to, and real-time
flight status updates

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.820
all on your smartphone.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.600
Since you're in an airport
in a stressful environment

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.310
and are performing many
tasks that are really urgent,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.110
your intermittently interacting
with your smartphone

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.002
and probably not your
laptop or your tablet.

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:55.460
Even though your
attention is split

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.140
amongst doing different
things, the short bursts

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.420
of interaction that you do
have with your smartphone

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.855
are really intense
in this context.

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.620
Or let's say you're on the go.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.250
You get hungry.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.083
You might want to find
a place to eat nearby

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.557
that meets your
dietary preferences

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.640
and maybe even get
recommendations from people you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.670
trust all on your smartphone.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.075
Since you're out and need
to get some food very soon,

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:20.700
you're not really in the mood to
do in-depth research on places

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.200
to eat or wait around
to make reservations.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.872
You're not really doing any
researching our planning,

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.080
instead you just want to
find the best possible place

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.600
to eat nearby on
your smartphone.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.145
Paul, I will hand
it over to you.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.645
PAUL SAXMAN: So
back to this example

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:35.840
of traveling to Atlanta.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.734
You need to do some
research, plan the trip,

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.150
and then actually
make the journey

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.000
there possibly using
a variety of devices.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.980
So with you as a
user in this example,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.750
let's look in detail
of what context is

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.750
and how it impacts the user
expectations and their device

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.291
selection.

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.790
If you're not in a
rush and you have

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.920
time to do planning
and research,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.690
you would probably use a laptop
or tablet to start these task,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.484
but not necessarily
to complete them.

00:03:57.484 --> 00:03:59.150
You might choose to
continue these tasks

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.240
on different devices
at a later time

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.650
or you might choose to restart
the process on the same device.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.210
The key here is that the user
has a lot of time on their hand

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.360
to complete the task,
so it's easy for them

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.860
to switch between devices.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.450
However, data in the
new multi-screen world

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.413
study published by
Google shows that people

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:18.954
tend to use laptops and tablets
over smartphones for research

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:21.640
or planning tasks likely
because of the larger

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.090
screens and richer input.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.580
That's not to say you
can ignore smartphones.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.610
About 34% of people
will generally

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.910
reach for the device
that's closest to them.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.360
So always keep
smartphones in mind

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.480
when building apps
because although it's not

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.270
the ideal device
for research tasks,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.460
the user might reach for
them out of convenience.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.250
NAZMUL IDRIS: I do
that all the time.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.140
PAUL SAXMAN: Likewise.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.200
If you're not going to travel
soon in a matter of weeks,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.700
then you would probably want
to book your flights and hotel.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.980
This is going from
research to planning.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.510
Again, you might use a tablet
to start these planning tasks

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.010
and complete them on a
laptop or vice versa.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.040
People do tend to use laptops
over tablets for productivity

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.560
tasks, such as booking a
flight, hotel, or rental car,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.580
but it's not uncommon
for people to use tablets

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.480
for augmenting or
wrapping up planning.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.000
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.962
PAUL SAXMAN: On the
day of your travel,

00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:08.670
you might want to get
your boarding pass,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.680
get a taxi to the airport, get
terminal and flight updates,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.780
that type of thing.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.690
These are all types
of tasks that people

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.310
tend to do on their smartphones.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.768
It's not likely that you would
want to pull out your laptop

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:21.090
or tablet while picking
up your boarding pass

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.190
or finding your way
to the terminal.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.410
Also you'd probably expect
to use your smartphone

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.700
to retrieve information
you need when you need it.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.240
Ideally, your smartphone would
make important information

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.840
available automatically
without even asking just

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.070
like Google Now.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.860
When things are
urgent and you have

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.970
lots of tasks to do
that are time sensitive,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.844
people tend to use their
smartphones as a way

00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:43.850
to execute tasks rather
than research or plan.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.590
Also in these
situations, people don't

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.860
have much patience for
hiccups in the user experience

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.650
and is best to provide a
solid and minimal experience

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.810
that allows the user to do what
they want quickly and smoothly.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.882
As we saw in the
time examples, a task

00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:00.860
can be dependent on
both time and location.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.800
Actually, most of the
aspects of context

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.820
are interrelated
somehow, however, each

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.570
can have some
independent influence

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.680
in how you build an app.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.000
So to ensure that you're
covering all possible user

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.440
scenarios, you should try
to consider each variable

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.930
independently.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.749
So continuing with
the Atlanta example,

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.290
let's look what
happens when we focus

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.642
on the task aspect of context.

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:21.850
You're likely to perform
the following tasks possibly

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.454
independently in
order to accomplish

00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:24.870
your goal of
traveling to Atlanta.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.365
Again, travel
research is something

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:31.899
that you'd probably start weeks
before actually traveling.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.690
During the research
phase, you would likely

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.655
try to figure out
what neighborhood you

00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:37.780
want to stay in while in
Atlanta and also check out

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.100
hotels to book.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.760
For research,
people's expectations

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.580
of apps and devices that content
consumption should be painless,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.760
and the amount of
user input is minimal.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.460
In other words, for
supporting research,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.150
an app should be optimized for
content consumption, but not

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.067
necessarily content creation.

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.150
And again, you might want
to switch back and forth

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.233
between these devices to
accomplish these tasks so

00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:01.540
be sure to keep user-entered
data like starred hotels

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.127
or planning places
to visit on a service

00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:05.960
so that it can be
available between sessions

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.190
on different devices.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.690
Planning is something
that you might

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.450
want to do a week or
two before traveling.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.824
Planning tasks
for travel include

00:07:12.824 --> 00:07:15.080
booking flights,
hotels, rental cars.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.130
Your expectations of
an app use for planning

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.690
would likely be that content
creation should be effortless

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.890
since you might have
to input a lot of data.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.580
So apps optimize
planning, should

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.104
allow for easy data entry, and
also easy content consumption.

00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:30.770
And again, you might switch back
and forth between these devices

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.016
to accomplish this task.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.140
You might want to retrieve
critical data a few days

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.120
before traveling,
but you most likely

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.945
need access to critical
data the day of traveling.

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:43.070
This includes information
like flight status, hotel

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.850
reservations, and
boarding passes,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.170
and other information as you
move from one form of transit

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.622
to another until you
reach your destination.

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:52.830
Since you're on the go,
people would use a smartphone

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.690
to accomplish all these tasks.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.560
It's highly unlikely that you
would do any of these tasks

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.750
on tablets or laptops.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.120
Your expectations of apps that
you're using on smartphones

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.540
are quite stringent.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.280
You would want single-handed
navigation, minimal interaction

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.116
with the apps to
get your content,

00:08:10.116 --> 00:08:12.490
and you would want the app to
actually proactively notify

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.060
you of things, of VNotifications
when critical information that

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.275
impacts your itinerary changes.

00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:20.650
What you're not expecting is
a lot of content consumption

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.220
or creation, so the content
has to be presented in a way

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.345
that you can consume quickly
without much attention.

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:27.720
Your interactions
with the device

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.410
is bursty, short, and intense.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.200
NAZMUL IDRIS: We're
definitely going

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.580
to do more episodes on that.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.510
That's a pretty heavy topic.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.314
PAUL SAXMAN: Indeed.

00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:33.820
Yeah.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.120
Location, task, and time
are very critical points.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.886
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yes.

00:08:37.886 --> 00:08:39.594
PAUL SAXMAN: And then
finally, let's look

00:08:39.594 --> 00:08:43.220
at what happens when we focus
on location aspect of context.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.456
Depending on what your
physical location is,

00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:46.955
what task you would
need to perform,

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:49.705
and the time you had to
perform them changes.

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:51.580
You might perform research
and planning tasks

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.344
when you're at home, on
your sofa, or at a desk.

00:08:54.344 --> 00:08:56.385
Your time frame for getting
these tasks completed

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:58.630
can vary for many
weeks to research.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.870
Add a few weeks for
planning, your expectations

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.494
from apps that you're
using is that you

00:09:02.494 --> 00:09:05.220
should have a signed-in
experience where they allow

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.520
you to seamlessly
move between devices.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.730
Another expectation you have is
that content consumption should

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.540
be easy for research tasks and
some content creation should

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.690
be easy for planning tasks.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.190
NAZMUL IDRIS: We're
definitely going

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.375
to do a show on the
signed-in experience.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.540
PAUL SAXMAN: That's a whole
other show within itself.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.402
You might be for retrieval
tasks when you're on the go

00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:27.610
and your time frame for
getting these tasks completed

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.330
can vary from urgent or right
now to some time this week.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.120
User research data
in the study suggests

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.830
that people use smartphones
when the urgency is high

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.260
and they're on the go.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.036
So you have an
expectation from apps

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.410
that you're using
that you should

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.490
be aware of current location and
be able to deliver information

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.800
to you in uncluttered
manner so you don't have

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.170
to spend a lot of
attention on the device.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.490
Another expectation is
that you get notifications

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.815
of important things that
will impact your itinerary,

00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:57.690
but you don't want to
be overwhelmed with too

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.770
many notifications since you're
going to be doing other things

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.286
while interacting with your
smartphone in intense bursts.

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:05.202
NAZMUL IDRIS: Just like
the constant interplay

00:10:05.202 --> 00:10:07.040
between machine
narcissism and self

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.890
awareness for the application.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.040
So again, topics
for other shows.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.950
PAUL SAXMAN: Very cool.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.450
NAZMUL IDRIS: Now,
let's take a look

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.750
at what happens when we focus
on the social aspect of context.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.230
So you've talked a lot about
how time, task, and location has

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.920
an impact on what people
expect, and what we're

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.410
going to show you is that those
three things come together

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.820
and they also drive what
you're expecting out

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.370
of your applications
or experiences,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.100
and devices from a
social perspective.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.790
So when you're at
home or at work,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.950
you might want to perform
some research tasks when

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.390
you have a lot of
time on your hands.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.348
In this scenario, you
might want to collaborate

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:44.320
with coworkers if the trip
to Atlanta is a business trip

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.650
or with family members
if it's a personal trip.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.520
If you're performing
some planning tasks

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.190
and have less time on your
hands than you do for research,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.680
then you might want to share
your itinerary with coworkers

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.670
or family and find out what
restaurants, for example,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.340
people you know would
recommend in Atlanta

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.974
and then actually make
some reservations.

00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:05.640
So people tend to use
a tablet or laptop

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.460
when doing this sort
of collaboration.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.000
Your expectations
for applications

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.730
you're using on
these devices are

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.500
that it should be easy to
consume lots of content,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.740
but do a little bit
of content creation.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.610
But the collaboration aspect
is part of content creation,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.570
and the sharing
of information is

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.470
part of creation
and consumption,

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.179
so basically, you should be
able to do a little bit of both.

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:29.720
Now, when you're on
the go, you might

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.490
want to perform some
retrieval tasks.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.610
And many of these
tasks might be urgent.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.690
In this scenario,
you might just want

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.980
to get visibility into
others' activities.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.234
For example, you might
want to get commute updates

00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:42.650
and see when your coworkers
or family members have arrived

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.100
at their destination, or where
they are in transit, and so on.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.480
That would be a really cool app.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.240
The "Multi-screen World"
report suggests that people use

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.270
smartphones when doing
this, which makes sense.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.180
However, the other
people in this scenario--

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.460
that is your coworkers or
family members or friends--

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.020
might be using tablets, or
laptops, or smartphones.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.730
So managing expectations
around social expectations

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.410
is really complicated, and
there are so many constituents

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.470
that you have to keep
in mind when doing this.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.720
Google Now is a great example.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.330
So if you turn on
commute sharing,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.830
it will notify
people in the circles

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.329
that you've chosen to actually
get these updates without you

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:20.100
actually having to do
anything on your smartphone.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.080
They get notifications, and
you just go about your day.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.670
Finally, let's look
at what happens

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.700
when we focus on the
mood aspect of context.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.510
Where you are, how much time
you have, and what tasks

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.030
you need to perform have a big
impact on your mood or attitude

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.680
when performing these
tasks, and again, this

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.410
drives your expectations
in a big way.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.600
I know this is complicated,
but it's complicated

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.315
because it is complicated.

00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:44.030
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
the crazy interplay.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.540
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.040
Exactly.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.620
It's like every little thing
is related to everything else.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.230
So if you're home or at work and
doing research tasks with lots

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.430
of time to complete them, then
you might be in a relaxed mood,

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.660
you might be lazy, and
open to collaboration.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.360
This drives the
expectations that you

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.140
have around what
social experience

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.390
you want from the
application and the device

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.270
that you're using.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.030
And it also determines
how eager you

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.720
are to select the right
device for the task.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.989
For example, you might just
use whatever is closest to you

00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:16.530
rather than getting to the right
device, the most appropriate

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.340
one for the task at hand.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.540
So you might use a
smartphone that's

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.920
close by instead of
picking up a laptop, which

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.370
might be in the next
room to do heavy content

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.136
consumption or even
content creation.

00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:31.260
However, since you're more
relaxed in this context,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.730
you are more willing to put up
with the more constrained form

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.680
factor.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.800
Now, if you increase the
urgency in this scenario,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.460
then your motivation
to actually get

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.950
the appropriate device
for the task goes way up.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.338
Human beings are complicated.

00:13:44.338 --> 00:13:45.371
PAUL SAXMAN: Yes.

00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:46.870
NAZMUL IDRIS: Now,
imagine if you're

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.540
on the go, the big change
that you have is, in your mood

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.820
is that you might
be more stressed,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.977
simply because they're
time constraints.

00:13:54.977 --> 00:13:57.310
There's a lot of stimulus
from the external environment.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.404
You could be in an
unfamiliar place.

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:00.820
So already, your
cognitive load is

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.540
higher from simply
being outside and not

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.500
being in a relaxed
environment like your home,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.830
assuming your home is
a relaxed environment.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.870
Retrieval tasks that you
might want to perform

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.390
might be quite urgent, and
this adds to your stress,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.850
and this drives your
expectation from the smartphone

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.311
and the apps that
you're using on them.

00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:23.810
They need to be accurate, aware
of who you are, and give you

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.210
updates that you
need in real time,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.220
and the battery can't
be drained either,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.460
and the location readings
should be accurate.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.170
So even though you might be
using the same application

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.460
and device in your living room,
by simply changing your mood

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.230
from relaxed to
stressed, it greatly

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.020
changes the
expectations you have

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.270
from that particular
application and device.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.100
So we encourage you to read this
wonderful research study titled

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.920
"The New Multi-screen
World" that

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.560
has a lot of information that
provides more insights into how

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.380
people use technology.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.450
The report shows us that people
have certain expectations

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.090
from tablets and laptops.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.770
However, on
smartphones, they expect

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.700
a little bit of everything.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.590
So keep this notion
of context in mind

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.560
when you create your
application experiences

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.350
on multiple devices.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.760
There are a lot of constraints
that you should be mindful of,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.770
and we've covered some
of them in this episode,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.930
and we'll do more episodes to
cover them in great detail.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.370
