1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,120
Doco. I struggle with receiving
banter from other guys. Banter. Okay.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,440
I'm naturally a sensitive gut which lends
myself to take normal smack talk from

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:13,000
other guys. Personally, I'm trying to get
after it. I wake up early, I work out,

4
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:14,530
eat healthy,
work pretty hard,

5
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:19,531
but still seem to have some deep seeded
insecurities which flare up when guys

6
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,720
give me stick,
I have some bloody good mates.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,860
Okay.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,150
Yeah,

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,900
and I want to get to the point where I
can take smack talk for what it is and

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,140
even give a bit of stick back to the guys.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,260
What can I do to help this?

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,790
Here's one thing that you can try to
get into your brain and this is one of

13
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:48,171
those things that's hard to get into your
brain and it's even harder to actually

14
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,980
get it in your brain and functionally
use this thought. Here's the thought.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,630
The more, okay? If you're, if
you're paranoid about something,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,610
if you're insecure about something,
the more you let things bother you,

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,140
the more insecure you will appear.
Well,

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,580
let me say that again.
The more you let things bother you,

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,240
the more insecure you are going to appear.
And the worst,

20
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:19,980
whatever that thing that
you're worried about,

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,080
whatever that thing that
makes you feel insecure,

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,570
the worst it's going to
appear to everyone else.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,660
So if you got a big nose and you're
embarrassed because you got a big nose and

24
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:33,720
every time someone says
something about your big nose,

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,910
you get mad and you get offended,

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,810
that big nose it be even bigger.

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,800
So think about that.

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,190
If there's something that bothers
you and you let it be known,

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,750
yeah

30
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,330
and you let it bother you,
divorce, it's going to get.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,740
And also think about this.
Another thing that will help,

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,220
these are things I'm
trying to help help uh,

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,780
sort of smooth the edges of
insecurity. Here's another one. People,

34
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,850
even though you think
evenly think they are,

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,950
and it's kind of egotistical to
think this, but we all do it.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,370
People aren't sitting around and
thinking about you and your weaknesses.

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,140
They're not sitting around and
thinking about you and your weaknesses.

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,940
They're not like, that's
your ego telling you that. So

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,950
don't sit there and think everyone is
looking at your big nose all the time.

40
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,110
They don't care.
They've got their other problems.

41
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:32,070
They've got their own life going on.
You don't care about your big nose wheel.

42
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,190
You know what makes them care about it?
When they know, if they say something you,

43
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,024
it bothers you.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,730
That's the first thing you're gonna
think when they see you again.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Here comes the good time. Some fun.
Yeah. And here's another thing.

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,880
If you want to kind of mitigate that man,
do want to do it.

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,760
Mark doesn't weigh the warrior
kid when Uncle Jake says, hey,

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,080
if you're getting made fun of is in way
the word could call them plate face.

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,760
Yeah. Saint Marco, you got to route
this guy. Nathan James had Telemaco.

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,210
You've got round face.
You look like plate calls him plate face.

51
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,850
That's his insult.
As insults him all the time.

52
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,520
And it bothers him cause he's looking
in the mirror going, right, I do.

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,960
I look like a plane. Let it bother
him. And Uncle Jake says, hey, go,

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,830
go make fun of yourself. And he finally
gets a chance. He does. Uh, they're,

55
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,310
you know,

56
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,570
a class and they have to do a self
portrait and he draws himself as a plate,

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,500
a plate face.

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,720
And when the kid that's been making fun
of it sees and he laughs and then guess

59
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,720
what doesn't make fun of him anymore
about it because he realizes it doesn't

60
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,680
bother and they kind of bond a little bit.

61
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:35,170
Then they kind of modeled what he's going
for in this question. That is, yeah.

62
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,410
Yeah. So you got, um,
and it's, it's this what,

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,320
that's why I said it's hard to do this
because when you're insecure about your

64
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,000
big nose or you're insecure about your
big ears or whenever and you let people

65
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,630
know that, or B, you just
think it's in your brain. You
think if you say something,

66
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,400
let's get even more so
they won't get worse.

67
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,640
It might get worse for an uptick
for a second, right? It might,

68
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,340
you make fun of yourself, you know,
people like, oh yeah, that's right.

69
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,060
I didn't notice that you do it. Then
it'll kind of, no one really cares.

70
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,580
And that's why in the teams and the teams,

71
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:08,581
you never let anyone know that something
bothers you or if they know it bothers

72
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,890
you, you're going to hear about it
forever. That's just going to be how,

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,370
it's just the way it's going to be.
And what that means.

74
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,810
The polar opposite of that or the flip
side of that is it's not fun to harass

75
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,740
some, it's not fun to harass someone
about something that doesn't bother them.

76
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,820
It's not even fun. Right. It's not
fun. Why would you harass them?

77
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,220
One when they don't get it,
when you don't even get a rise out of him,

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,420
this is not fun. You just leave that thing
that you look for something else. Yeah.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,750
So poke a little fun at yourself.

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,330
These guys are going to back
off because they're bored.

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,420
If you show no reaction and like you
said that that kind of self deprecating

82
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,940
humor will formed a little bond.
Yeah.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,640
You can give a little stick back to
the guys. If you start giving stick.

84
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,420
The guys be ready to take it back though.
Yeah, they're going to escalate. Yeah.

85
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,770
And that's just so, I mean,
I grew up with two brothers.

86
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,100
Oh one twin brother.
And that's like a,

87
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,680
like that's literally the foundation of
our relationship is just you tease the

88
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,230
other guy about some lit everything.

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,870
Like he can come in with a new shirt on
that's a seal platoon. Yeah. Like, oh,

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,180
we'll be like, oh no sure.
No, you know like Beth,

91
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,410
not even something to tease someone.

92
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,370
They sell men's shirts where you bought
that. Yeah, whatever. It's literally,

93
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,990
it's so bad to the point
where one, um, when,

94
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,640
when I got with my current life, when we
were, when we started dating or whatever,

95
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,910
like it's just habit, you know? And like
even you like, same thing, you know,

96
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:39,340
like you'll, you'll give me crap,
I'll give you criminal, whatever.

97
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,090
But it's so common that I
do it to her. Oh yeah. Yeah.

98
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,870
And you know, at first she's
like, Oh, what? Like what,

99
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,550
why are you teasing me so much like your,

100
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,350
cause I knew where he'd been
before we were together.

101
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,920
I knew her for years actually. And he's
like, Hey, I kind of annoying, you know,

102
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,030
you'd like teases or whatever.

103
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,530
And I did like reel it back
yourself and yeah, because that,

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,220
because that is so, so much
of how guys do it, you know,

105
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,310
to 100% and I've told this
story before when I got,

106
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,680
when I was going to college and I was
around team guys all day and I started

107
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,880
doing the team guy thing with my
wife after she, she's like, Hey,

108
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,250
I'm not in the teams so you can
be quiet now. And I was like, wow,

109
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:21,740
she's right. And I didn't even realize
it cause that's just, you know,

110
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,880
all day long you show up,

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,610
you show up in the platoon
space and his verbal sparring.

112
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,760
As soon as you walk through the door,
somebody is going to say something,

113
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,740
they're going to bring it. And what's
interesting is Holly, how he's like,

114
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,660
I want to get to the point where, you
know, he can say back to her with things,

115
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,160
I would agree with this.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,190
I'll probably even hundred 10% which is
hard to agree 100% but I feel this way

117
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,030
probably stronger than him.

118
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:48,080
Like you ever been around someone who
like you just can't really joke around

119
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,280
with like,
I'm not,

120
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,460
I'm not the kind guy who all tease
someone and try to like to make them,

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,250
you know, especially if I don't
know him good or whatever. But um,

122
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,550
but if you're around someone who like,
can't really take it,

123
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,700
you can't joke around with
them. It's like, man, I don't
want that guy to be there,

124
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,090
man. I wish he just wasn't, you
know, I'm not mad at him, but I just,

125
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,820
I don't want to hang around with that guy.
You don't want to be that guy.

126
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,560
So even if like, like, especially
at first, like let's say, okay, I'm,

127
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm this guy right here.

128
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,560
The worst is someone that can dish
it out but can't take it. Yeah.

129
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,510
But what do you mean? Yeah, that
is the worst. It's, I, I wouldn't,

130
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,990
the only reason I wouldn't say he's
the worst is what's worse than that.

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,620
If he's dishing it out
and he can't take it,

132
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:26,720
it's kind of you get a pay
off of teasing the guy.

133
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm just saying it lists that he doesn't
do shit up. Let's say he's just a guy,

134
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,030
you just can't joke around with it.
It's like man,

135
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,800
you're making me uncomfortable
kind of thing, you know.

136
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,410
But if this guy cause you to your point,
if it's yeah,

137
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:40,160
if the load is annoying when people can't
take it and you make a joke and they

138
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:44,190
get all fired up and then they're like
actually mad, right? Yeah, that's,

139
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,150
that's what, that's how you end up with
people that aren't really your friends.

140
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,920
Maybe your friends. Exactly. Right.
So, but yes. Yes. So you get there men.

141
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,200
I say get there and at first just,

142
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,680
and you kind of made it
really clear to me how,

143
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,470
you know when you make a change or
something, it's not going to whoop boom,

144
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,950
you're off to the races with the change
going full speed. You know, what'd he say?

145
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,420
Low drag. When weight load hospital, it's
not going to be like they're ready for,

146
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,300
especially with this kind of stuff. If
you, if you already know you're insecure.

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,880
Yeah. Which is a big
step ahead, by the way.

148
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,760
Some people do it or I'm not an insecure,
and meanwhile they're, he's curating it.

149
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,600
They know it, but they just don't admit
it. Yeah. So this guy, he knows so,

150
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,120
but you're going to feel it, man,
when they call you big, you know,

151
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,500
whatever they're calling you,
whatever,

152
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,280
you're going to sort of feel it on the
inside still, but just don't behave,

153
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,580
you know, in a way, just be like,
Oh, I dunno. I don't know what to do.

154
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,500
There's plenty of things
to do, but know, I mean,

155
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,560
you do want to get their
hundred percent check.
