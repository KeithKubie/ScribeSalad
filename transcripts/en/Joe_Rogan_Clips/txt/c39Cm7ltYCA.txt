Speaker 1:          00:00          Weird. And to your point about going up and cleaning up, clean out, you know, an impoverished area at least then you'd get to meet the other people. Yeah. People outside of your circle in your bubble. I mean the amount of times, Hey, when you talk to people about Muslims, LGBT, whatever it is, and you think, oh, it's because you've never met anyone, right. You've actually never met anyone that is x, y or zed, which is, I'm, I moved to Brooklyn five years or six years ago and I moved to Clinton Hill, Fort Greene and I got a few friends that had been there forever and I said, let, this probably sounds like a really stupid thing to say, but it feels kind of segregated here. And they were like, Duh. Of course it does. And I couldn't believe it. You know, I'd grown up on the spike Lee movies and I mean, I guess they do show a kind of segregation, but I thought, you know, this was the place where everyone lived together on the same, I went to each others, but then he goes and restaurants and I lived on the dividing line between the bit that was getting gentrified and the projects you go two blocks that way, pretty much all black.

Speaker 1:          00:56          You got three blocks that way. Pretty much all white with yoga studios and Boujee coffee shops and pet spars and, and the two communities just did not mix. It wasn't necessarily they hated each other or they just did not make different language, different everything. Right. This is Utopian perception that there is a place where everybody's cool. Yeah. Yeah. And I thought it might be New York, it might be Brooklyn or it's probably the only place that's close. Right. At least it has the reputation for it. Yeah. Because at least in Brooklyn, people walk around. I mean, yeah, but, but talking about the amazing pieces of journalism over the last few years, there's Nicole, Hannah Jones wrote, wrote a piece about New York school system, public school system, the most segregated school system in America when New York really, and she had to get her daughter into a public school. And the choice was the, the very good, well supported school in the gentrifying, mostly white area or the bad failing public school in the non gentrified, mostly black area where her kids education might suffer.

Speaker 1:          01:56          And I think I'm remembering correct correctly, but her and her husband had a real fight about it cause she said, no, we got to put our kid in the, in the bad failing school and help it get better and it's gonna take years and our daughter may suffer in the short term, but that's what we have to do if we're living in this neighborhood. Um, it's an incredible piece. Wow. Yeah. That's a, the, the real conflict as a parent. Do you have children? No. When you're possible each. Oh yeah. I'm sure. Right. You're, when you're thinking of your children, you're, you're always thinking of their safety, you're always worried about them and you want to protect them. So putting them in a situation where they wouldn't be as protected is never your first instinct. Oh, she, she was in, in town hall meetings where, you know, progressive white liberal parents who would be very left wing on every other issue.

Speaker 1:          02:38          We're really fighting to make sure their kid went to the good majority white school. Um, and you know, they want a bit of diversity but not, not too much diversity. Right. They want a black friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's when people think of Brooklyn, they do think of it as being like the most diverse place. Yeah. And it's, yeah, I mean, street by street segregated it land is pretty diverse. Atlanta is interesting, you know, because Atlanta has, um, a lot of, there's a, there's a lot of um, pose. It's a lot of everything in Atlanta, but it's a very black city and a lot of ways, but it's also a very white city. You see a lot of black and white people hanging out together and clubs and bars and restaurants and stuff. And it's really like much closer to like a 50, 50 split than a lot of places, at least in some of the neighborhoods that I've been to when I got back to London.

Speaker 1:          03:30          That's why. That's one of the few things. Um, I'm proud of about, about London and certainly New York. It said it's not a big deal for a group of friends, a family, and trying to be, to be genuinely mixed. He sites that you would know. Um, I'd ask you is that because London didn't experience slavery the way the United States did? Um, yeah, I mean obviously we have a, you know, colonial history, right? Of course. But that wasn't in the country itself for a very long time. We've had a huge Pakistani Bangladeshi, Jamaican community and it's, it's, you know, I mean here, if you have black friends or you date a black girl or you know, it's, it's, people think you're trying to prove your work right there. It was just normal, normal [inaudible] in London. I'm not saying England, London. I experienced that when I was in London as well.

Speaker 1:          04:18          It seems like way more integrated. Yeah. Yeah. That, and that's, I mean, still five, six years after I moved to New York, it's, it's still a surprise every day to reinforce a different animal. Now, New York is so fucking expensive. It's so strange. And, uh, my friend, uh, Judah who, uh, Judas Freelander who lives there, said he's, he's lived there for a long time and he's like, it's so changed. It used to be like a lot of artists and a lot of creative people. And he goes, it's now tell finance people like every go to finance. Everybody just wants the most expensive suit and the most expensive watch. And they live in this ridiculously expensive apartment. And I thought that went out in the 80s. I thought that was like Wall Street and Michael Caine still very much exists. That's still prevalent.
