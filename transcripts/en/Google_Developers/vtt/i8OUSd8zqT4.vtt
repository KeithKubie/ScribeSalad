TIMOTHY: How's everyone
doing today?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.840
Are you happy to be here?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.070
I am.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.500
I'm just curious, how many Glass
Explorers do we have in

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.520
the audience wearing
Glass right now?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.280
Woo.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.610
Congratulations,
that's awesome.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.580
OK, so this is a fireside chat
with some of the Glass team.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.480
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.570
I'm a Developer Advocate working
on Project Glass.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.620
And up here I have these
wonderful people.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.670
First off, Isabelle Olson, our
Lead Industrial Designer.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.610
Say hi.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.860
ISABELLE: Hi.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.408
TIMOTHY: Charles Mendis, our
Software Engineering Director.

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:46.658
CHARLES: Hi.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.590
TIMOTHY: And Steve Lee,
our Product Director.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.690
So this is how it's
going to work.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.420
I'm going to start with my
questions, asking Isabelle,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.760
Charles, and Steve some things
that I get asked a lot, and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.570
that we hear a lot from
the community--

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.800
Explorers and non
Explorers alike.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.740
And then after that, we're going
to open up the floor

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.130
right away to hear your
questions and have a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.150
conversation directly
with you.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.020
Does that sound like fun?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.800
I hope so.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.250
We've got like 40
minutes of this.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.950
So you better strap in.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.450
Let's start with Isabelle.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.760
Now, Isabelle, you've been on
Glass since, as you say--

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.610
I love this quote--

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.650
since the prototype was still
"a phone attached to a scuba

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.230
mask." I'm curious how we got
from there to here, about the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.550
design vision that you
established for Glass, how it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.310
brought us here, and
what's next?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.580
ISABELLE: Sure.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.620
You know, when the team started
working on this, it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.860
was very clear that we're not
taking something that already

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.220
existed and making incremental
improvements to it.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.530
The team wanted to create
something that's much more

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.260
intuitive, immediate,
and intimate.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.910
But to create a new type of
wearable technology--

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.910
that's so ambitious, and
very messy at points.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
And I will never forget the
first day on the team when I

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.830
walked into a room full of
people wearing these crazy

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.530
things on their heads.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.870
And I brought the prototype just
you guys can see what I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.120
walked into.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.470
Here.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.720
Comes in a fancy bag.

00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:49.010
So--

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.250
I don't know what you guys
think, but this definitely

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.060
made me a little shaky.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.710
TIMOTHY: You wear it
so well, though.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.120
ISABELLE: You think?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.240
I think the colors of the board
kind of fits my hair

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.730
color, but I don't know.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.770
It's kind of heavy, though.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.740
I think I'm going to
take it off now.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.000
But how do you go from something
like this to what

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.850
we're all wearing today?

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.450
We took a reductionist
approach.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.190
We removed everything that
wasn't absolutely essential.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.110
And then in addition to that,
I formed three principles to

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.350
guide the team throughout this
ambitious, messy process.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.200
And those are lightness,
simplicity, and scalability.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.680
And those are not just
fancy words.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.910
They mean something.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.670
So when it comes to lightness,
it's fairly straightforward.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.950
We are obsessed with weight.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.240
Not in the same way as the
fashion industry is, but we do

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.540
care about every single gram.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.150
Because if it's not light,
you're not going to want to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
wear it for more than
10 minutes.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.440
And it's not only about
lightness, but also about

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.280
balance, and how it's balanced
on your face.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.220
The way we designed it with our
construction methods, and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.730
material choices, and how we
placed the components, it

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.640
weighs less on your nose than
many sunglasses and regular

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.350
glasses on the market--
which is pretty cool.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.089
It's not only about physical
lightness,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.400
but also visual lightness.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600
We took the approach of hiding
some of the largest components

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.310
on the board behind the frame
so we could create this one,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.150
clean, simple appearance
from the side.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.890
When I joined the project, we
thought we needed 50 different

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.380
adjustment mechanisms.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.530
But that wouldn't be a great
user experience, so we

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.780
simplified it down to just this
one mechanism, and this

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.930
is how it adjusts
to your head.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.120
And then to the last point,
which is scalability.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.240
This is what I'm the most
excited about at the moment,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.100
and for the future of Glass.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.150
You walk into any glasses store
and you see thousands,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.520
to hundreds of thousands,
of different styles.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.960
How do we deal with that?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.730
Well, we made Glass modular.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.760
At this stage what this means
is that you can remove the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.050
frame from the main board.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.280
There's a little screw here.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.750
You unscrew it, and you can
remove it, and attach

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.630
different kinds of frames.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.090
This is pretty cool.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.440
This opens up a lot
of opportunities--

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.410
for prescription glasses, to
transform the functionality of

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.740
Glass, but also the
appearance of it.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.880
So I just brought one example
of this, which is our

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.840
prescription prototype.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.620
So you can see how different
this looks from what I was

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.850
just wearing.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.190
So not only are we now excited
about Glass as a software

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.730
platform, but Glass as a
hardware platform as well.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.400
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.180
Thank you, Isabelle.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.350
TIMOTHY: Charles, you're next.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.080
When I first joined the team,
there was something that you

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.660
and I talked about a lot.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.640
It's something that you
felt passionate about.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.320
They make the chairs dangerous
on purpose.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.410
I don't know why.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.900
Glass was both a device
and a platform.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.800
I think that's really
interesting.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.370
I was hoping that you could
speak to the first

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.140
principles--

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.210
your first principles-- for that
platform, what the Mirror

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.960
API was built for, and maybe a
little bit about the upcoming

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.780
Glass Development Kit we touched
on earlier today.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.170
CHARLES: Absolutely.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.480
We want Glass to have a big,
positive impact in the world.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.210
And I'm a platforms guy.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.500
I was lucky to be part of the
Android team in the early

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.200
days, and I was amazed by all
the great things that

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.620
developers built on top of the
Android platform, and all the

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.070
innovation it really drove.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.190
I think most of you actually
have an Android phone in your

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.820
pocket today.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.160
I believe Glass in developers'
hands will have a similar

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.510
impact and drive innovation
again.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.980
We built Glass, not just for
developers, but for us, too.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.740
So the core principle behind
Glass is that we build on top

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.280
of the exact same APIs you do.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.430
For example, let's take some of

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.560
Google's flagship products--

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.530
Google+, Gmail, Google Now.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.880
They build on top of the exact
same APIs that Facebook and

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.050
Twitter release their
apps today on.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.480
We don't have anything extra.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.550
We use the Mirror API
just like them.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.680
And that's our core
philosophy.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.130
Taking that, we want to
apply the exact same

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.120
philosophy to the GDK--

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.160
the Glass Developer Kit.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.440
But for that we need
your help.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.680
We want to know what the Glass
explorers do with the device,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.480
what apps you built on top of
it, what APIs you hack on, and

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.720
see what all the services
you develop.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.300
And then build an API that takes
that into account, and

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.840
help us shape the GDK.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.100
It'll take a while.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.690
It won't be coming out soon
because we really want to

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.140
listen to your feedback
and incorporate it in.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.108
But, honestly, I can't wait
to get it into your hands.

00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:14.960
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.890
Thank you, Charles.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.530
Next up is Steve.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.620
Steve, let's talk about
the Explorer program.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.340
This is a super unique way
to introduce a product.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.780
You could say unprecedented.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.810
Can you tell us what the
Explorer program is, and why

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.760
it makes sense for Glass?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.490
STEVE: Sure, Timothy.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.190
Well, first of all, just
stepping back, I think the

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.700
reason why we're up here and why
the larger Glass team is

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.540
working so hard on Glass is
because we really believe that

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.630
Glass can transform how
people use technology.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.760
We think it's a really
big idea.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.040
And the Explorer program is an
important part of how we're

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.915
bringing Glass to the world.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.950
We see the Explorer program
as a way to learn the

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.870
possibilities with Glass.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.230
One of my most memorable
experiences with Glass

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.370
happened a few weeks ago.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.470
I found myself at Disneyland in
the front row of a roller

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.150
coaster sporting Glass.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.490
I was going, screaming 55 miles
per hour, on this roller

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.320
coaster with a full upside down
loop, hands in the air.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.940
And I was able to capture that
entire experience, and then

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.730
share it later with family
and friends.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.370
I just found that super,
super compelling.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.190
This is one of the many exciting
things that I've done

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.990
with Glass.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.160
And with the Explorer program,
where we're at right now is

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.140
we're now getting into the hands
of thousands of other

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.700
people to see what exciting
things they can do with Glass.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.590
The first group of people that
we're getting it into the

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.940
hands of are developers.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.230
And, as Timothy showed a few
minutes ago with a survey,

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.100
many of you in the audience
are already Explorers.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.510
We know that to fully realize
the potential of Glass, we

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.290
need your help.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.960
We need developers to innovate
on the platform.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.340
About a month ago we started
distributing

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.430
Glass to our Explorers.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.030
I'm happy to say that earlier
this week-- right before

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.540
Google I/O-- we've invited all
2,000 people who signed up at

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.085
last year's I/O to come pick
up their Glass device.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:27.698
We're very happy about that.

00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:31.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.850
STEVE: And the next group of
people that will become

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.640
Explorers are the folks who
signed up for hashtag

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.170
#ifihadglass.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.780
There were 8,000 people selected
from over 100,000

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.760
people who applied.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.220
And we will soon be rolling out
invites to those folks to

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.190
pick up Glass.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.790
What's exciting about that
group of people--

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.120
they're not developers,
but it's a nice

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.040
cross section of people.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.940
We have folks who
are educators.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.050
They're teachers.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.900
We have athletes.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.960
We have DJs, dentists,
hairstylists--

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.580
all kinds of different people.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.230
So we're really excited to see
what a diverse set of folks,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.460
what are they going
to do with Glass.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.050
And the last thing I'd like to
say about the Explorer program

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.170
is that our team--

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.060
we're excited about the Explorer
program because we're

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.690
going to be listening to you.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.630
We're going to be listening to
Explorers, learning from your

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.740
experiences, and improving
Glass.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.010
One concrete thing we'll be
doing is that each and every

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.170
month the software team,
Charles's team, will be

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.320
rolling out software updates
to all Explorers.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.718
And those software
updates will--

00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:50.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.190
STEVE: --those software
updates will have new

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.370
features, will add more polish,
will fix bugs, and

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.310
will specifically be
incorporating changes based on

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.180
your feedback.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.460
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.750
Thank you, Steve.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.830
OK, I have one more question,
and it's for each of you

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.750
before we get to audience
questions.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.760
And that is--

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.640
let's put it this way.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.840
If you could ask the developers
in the room to

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.200
build one thing for you on
Glass, what would it be?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.470
Let's start with Steve.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.450
STEVE: I have a lot of
ideas No, Charles's

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.560
team and the team--

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.210
we've done a good job at
focusing on the core set of

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.710
applications you might want.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.770
But there are so many
possibilities--

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.520
we're just scratching
the surface.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.280
If I have to name one, though,
I'm a big exercise fanatic.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.500
I love to go cycling,
and running, and a

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.010
lot of fitness things.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.370
Today I have a Garmin GPS
sports watch with

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.295
a heart rate monitor.

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:54.200
I wear a strap around
my chest.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.420
I'd love to have a fitness
application on Glass and

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.810
integrate, not only the software
application, but

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.260
integrate it with my heart
rate monitor as well.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.440
That way I could have
information relevant to my

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.210
workout right in front of my
eyes as I'm working out.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.700
I don't have to break stride
while I'm running to look down

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.280
at my wrist.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.990
And if I'm cycling, it'd be much
safer because I can keep

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.260
my eyes on the road.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.670
So that's what I'd love
to see happen.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.770
TIMOTHY: Charles?

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.320
CHARLES: Yeah, for me, I think
I'd love a way to pay easily

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.500
at the cash register.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.220
I have two young kids, like
a five-year-old and a

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.830
three-year-old.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.530
They're grabbing stuff from
all over the shelf.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.960
And I'm like, no, stop that.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.720
You know, trying to
keep it together.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.860
And then on top of that, I have
to pull out my wallet

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.950
which means one of them
will run free.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.570
There's going to be
consequences.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.930
So I'd love to be able to just
have them say, OK, here's the

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.730
price here.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.240
Yup.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.040
Pay, done, and move on.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.780
I think it should be
as simple as that.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.115
ISABELLE: Well, those are
really good examples.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.410
I'm really into karaoke.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.750
Seriously, though, if there
was a way to sing karaoke

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.620
where you actually face
the audience--

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.840
which is usually your
drunk friends--

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.820
instead of staring into a screen
with words on it, I

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.425
think that would be awesome.

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:19.750
Please make it.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.420
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:24.850
OK.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.210
So let's get to your
questions.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.250
A couple of notes
before we start.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.900
First off, you know this
is really common.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.770
We get feature requests
all the time.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.500
That's good.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.370
We definitely want them.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.520
We want to know how we can make
the API better, and how

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.660
we make the GDK that we're going
to release in the future

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.540
the best GDK that
you can have.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.250
However, none of us are going
to be able to comment on

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.380
future plans.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.150
So, whereas we'd love to hear
the feature requests-- please

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.000
say them-- we won't be able to
comment on whether we will,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.850
will not make them, or what
they'll look like.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.100
AUDIENCE: Why not?

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.740
TIMOTHY: As a policy, at Google
we don't comment on

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.680
future looking plans.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.330
All right.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.660
TIMOTHY: And I follow rules--

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.670
at least that one.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.900
Anyway, the next thing is we
don't have an updated timeline

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.240
for Glass release.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.970
Where we're at right
now is that--

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.870
well, let me say this.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.235
I've had a number of people come
to me at Google I/O, and

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:27.280
be like, I want Glass, and
I have this amazing idea.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.190
And my first reaction is, I
want you to have Glass.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.480
And that's our goal.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.640
It's only a matter of time.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.760
Right now we're selling Glass to
the Explorers who signed up

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.870
at Google I/O last year.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.980
Next, it's the #ifihadglass
people.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.350
Next, it could be you.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.560
If you want to make sure that
we contact you when there's

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.010
more availability, go to
google.com slash Glass, and

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.230
there's a form on there
where you can

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.600
indicate your interest.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.050
That said, everything
else is fair game.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.820
during this Explorer period,
we're really interested in

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.000
your feedback, and having a
conversation around how Glass

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.860
can be amazing for everyone.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.540
Fireside chats can be
a little crazy.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.950
But we felt strongly that we
wanted to come up here and

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.080
have a conversation, because
that's what this

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.150
period is all about.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.110
So please, there's two
microphones, one in each of

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.000
these aisles.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.450
We're going to go
back and forth.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.470
Let's hear you have to say.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.466
First right here.

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:29.812
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:32.730
Amir Efrati from the "Wall
Street Journal." This is for

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.470
any of you, but Steve--

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.920
you might want to
take the lead.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.240
I'm curious what you think and
what kind of thinking you've

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.100
done about the privacy
implications of the device,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.300
whether this is different than
a smartphone or not, and how

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.640
much of the data that's captured
by this device will

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.400
be kept by Google?

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.476
How much of the user generated
data will be kept by Google?

00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:53.310
TIMOTHY: OK.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.750
So two questions there.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.810
One is what are the privacy
implications and can

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.610
you speak to that?

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.240
And the second thing is user
data and what we do with it.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.079
STEVE: Sure.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.900
I've been on the project since
the beginning, for almost

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.089
three years now.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.540
So I have a pretty good view of
how the product's evolved

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.579
and what the team philosophy
has been.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.150
And I can definitely say that,
from the beginning, the social

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.109
implications and social
etiquette of Glass--

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.010
of people wearing Glass--

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.800
has been at the top of our mind
in how we designed and

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.670
developed the product.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.590
And, not only thinking about
the people who will buy and

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.910
use Glass-- be wearing Glass--
but really everyone, and the

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.980
implications for those around
the people wearing Glass.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.310
I'm proud of the team for
taking it seriously and

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.240
thinking about that early on.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.510
Let me just give a few examples
of how the design's

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.680
evolved to accommodate
some of that.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.690
One is-- and I think Isabelle
mentioned this earlier--

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:05.290
that the display is up above
the person's eye.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.510
We learned that very
early on--

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.380
some of our early prototypes
actually covered your eyes.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.970
We quickly discovered how
important human eye contact is

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.390
with other people around you.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.540
Another common question
is about distractions.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.060
Is Glass distracting?

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.430
How do I know if you're paying
attention to me?

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.650
Typically people who are asking
that haven't been

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.090
around someone with Glass yet.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.110
Because once you're around
someone with Glass--

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.920
you'll know that they're
paying attention to you

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.360
because they're looking
at you.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.550
You have eye contact.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.660
And if you're looking at Glass,
you're looking up at

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.570
the display.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.690
So that's one example
of design.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.260
A second thing is
with the camera.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.940
A lot of the privacy questions
are around the camera, and

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.430
picture taking, and videos.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:59.010
That's why to start recording a
video, or to take a picture,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.530
the way you do it has
clear social cues

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.020
and a social gesture.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.780
There's a camera button right
here, so I have to raise my

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.280
hand, press the button
to take a picture.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.220
Or speak to Glass and say, OK,
Glass, take a picture, or, OK,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.080
Glass, record a video.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.430
So it's a very clear cue to
other people around you.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.200
The third example that I'd
like to give is that--

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.070
and this is something I want
to really educate people on

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.290
about how Glass works--

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:31.050
is that when Glass is active,
the display lights up.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.495
It not only lights up for me
to see, but other observers

00:19:33.495 --> 00:19:35.350
can see that as well.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:40.190
So right now you can't see a
light emitting from Glass

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.150
because it's not active.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.610
So because of that you can
rest assured that I'm not

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.640
recording you right now.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.470
AUDIENCE: Though it could
be hacked, right,

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.620
just like any device?

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:51.880
STEVE: Yes.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.032
I mean, that's on Charles.

00:19:55.032 --> 00:20:00.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.850
STEVE: We take the trust and
reliability of our software

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.980
very seriously--

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.060
like all other teams
at Google.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.310
So by design, that's
not intended.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.800
Our design is to ensure
the display is active

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.390
when Glass is active.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.502
And that'll be part
of our GDK.

00:20:26.502 --> 00:20:29.600
It'll also be part
of our policy.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.490
So applications won't be
permitted that don't do that.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.520
CHARLES: And just to add to that
on the social cues, if

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.450
I'm recording a video of you
with Glass, I have to be

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.790
staring at you.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.130
If I look anywhere, I'm
recording here.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.740
I have to stare at you.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.025
And as a human being, if
someone's staring at you, you

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:48.180
kind of notice.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.195
CHARLES: Like a girl's walking
down the street, and the guy's

00:20:52.195 --> 00:20:53.317
just like--

00:20:53.317 --> 00:20:56.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.620
CHARLES: Yeah, so I think
there's definitely going to be

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.170
social cues.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.450
And, again, I've heard the
thing about the restroom.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.575
If you walk into the restroom,
even without Glass, if

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:05.600
somebody's just looking
at you.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.030
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to get

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.920
the hell out of there.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.960
AUDIENCE: Not to hijack this
whole thing, but when you have

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.890
facial recognition technology
that's capturing people's

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.020
information, is that something
you think about as well?

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.990
TIMOTHY: OK, so that's
your third question.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.730
We're going to stop there.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.030
So the other question he asked
was about data and I guess

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.535
also about facial recognition.

00:21:27.535 --> 00:21:27.830
STEVE: Sure.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.390
So to the second question,
I think it's fairly

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.720
straightforward regarding
use of user data.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.710
On the Glass team, we're
following the same policies

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.180
and principles that the
rest of Google does.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.800
We're not really deviating
from that.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.360
So I think that's the answer
to that question.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.010
I'll take the face recognition
question as well.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.270
That's something that we've
prototyped early on.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.180
We definitely experimented
with it.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.240
But it's not something that's
part of the product today.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.910
It's not currently in
our product plan.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.430
I think at some point in the
future, whether Google's

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.640
developing it or third party
developers, I can

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.890
imagine that existing.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.240
Me being a product person--

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.820
the way I view it--

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.640
I'm not scared of it, but I want
to make sure that there's

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.010
clear user benefit.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.810
That's just super compelling.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:22.530
And if it's super compelling
for people, then I think

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.830
there's something there.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.450
That's one thing, and
then secondly--

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:30.710
let's be honest and genuine
about the privacy issues and

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.730
what policy would surround
that type of feature.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.200
But currently there's no plans
for us to do that.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.140
TIMOTHY: Great.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.200
All right.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.570
Question from over here.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.600
AUDIENCE: I'm Sheldon.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.700
I had seven questions.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.506
TIMOTHY: You may ask one now.

00:22:49.506 --> 00:22:50.380
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.530
TIMOTHY: And then you can go--

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.840
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of two questions.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.070
First of all, is the
side multi-touch?

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.830
And if it is, wouldn't it be
cool if we could pull down

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.290
with two fingers to
delete cards?

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.980
Because some of the cards
are kind of annoying.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.420
I mean, just because Google Now
puts them in there whether

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.210
you like it or not.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.280
Like you might take a picture
and share it, and then you

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.650
just want it to go away.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.970
There's lots of times where
you want to do that.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.610
And I thought, well, if it was
multi-touch, you could just

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.050
swipe down with two fingers
and get rid of it.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.820
I know you can't talk about
features, or if that's a

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.330
feature or whatever, but
I did talk to somebody

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.880
at the Glass booth.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.270
That was sort of like a decision
about what that down

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.870
gesture was going to
be and how you were

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.710
going to handle that.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.340
So I just want to put
that out there.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.520
TIMOTHY: So I think the general
question there-- and I

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.900
think this is great
for Charles--

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.020
which is gestures on the touch
pad, both in the system

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.280
software and exposed
in the GDK.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.750
CHARLES: Yeah, definitely.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.480
Just keep in mind this is an
early developer version.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.140
We made it for developers.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.580
So there will be a
lot of changes.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.070
As Steve mentioned, every month
we will do an update.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.910
Is it multi-touch?

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.250
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.170
Will we maybe use that gesture?

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.210
Maybe.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.580
It's one of those things where
we want to listen to your

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.770
feedback, take it in,
and really think,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.110
does it make sense?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.560
And in that feature in general,
I'd be thinking, can

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.770
we improve Google Now so we do
show you better cards so you

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:09.690
don't need to do that?

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.030
Because I actually feel like if
you have to do that, in a

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.570
sense we've kind of failed.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.340
Because we've shown you
something, wasted your time,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.750
and with Glass-- again, coming
back to Isabelle's--

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:22.270
it's about simplicity, quick,
micro-interactions.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.590
I worry a little bit if we're
pushing you content and making

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.330
you do that.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.340
AUDIENCE: Well, the case for
that one was I just happened

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.140
to search for Walker Creek Ranch
or something because I

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.160
was looking at going to
a conference up there.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.910
And it wanted to give
me directions there.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.620
I came to San Francisco and
it was like, oh, you're

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.010
only an hour away.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.760
Head on up there.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.250
Usually, almost all of the
time, when I search for

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.270
something, I actually do want to
know the directions there,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.380
and it's really convenient.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.950
But in this particular case, I
was just searching it as a

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.125
research thing, you know?

00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:52.000
So 90% of the time
it's perfect.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.590
And only 10% of the time would
I want to say, oh, I didn't

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.220
really mean that.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.910
Do you know what I mean?

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.160
So don't mess with Google Now.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.210
TIMOTHY: Thank you
for the feedback.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.720
STEVE: I'd also quickly point
out that actually the two

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.445
finger swipe down gesture is
already part of the product.

00:25:06.445 --> 00:25:07.640
AUDIENCE: What does it do?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.240
STEVE: It dismisses
the display.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.980
So one finger swipe down goes
back, which can sometimes

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.070
dismiss the display.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.200
Two fingers--

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.360
AUDIENCE: Always dismisses
[? it? ?]

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:16.837
STEVE: Yeah.

00:25:16.837 --> 00:25:18.268
AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:22.570
AUDIENCE: That was fast.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.390
STEVE: Charles works wonders.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.200
TIMOTHY: Team moves quick.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.900
STEVE: He's coding on
Glass right now.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.550
TIMOTHY: OK.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.680
Question from over here.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:32.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.900
I'm Michael Moussa.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.160
I'm an Android developer.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.410
And I have a question kind
of related to the GDK.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.510
I was in the hacking Glass
session, the last session, and

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.600
my question is--

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:48.050
it was mentioned as a 640 by I
think 360 display, that's 8

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.230
feet out, 25 inches.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.190
And I remember from the
Google TV [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.030
TV experience there's some
conversion to get it.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.630
So my question is what's the
equivalent screen size and

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:05.100
what resolution should we target
for our resources?

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.380
CHARLES: HDPI.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:06.720
AUDIENCE: HDPI?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.866
CHARLES: Target HDPI.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:10.100
Assume you've got 640 by 360.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.700
AUDIENCE: HDPI normal
screen size?

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:15.270
TIMOTHY: Nice.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.270
That was a good one.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.520
OK, over here.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.550
about voice triggers.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:29.450
And I guess specifically, as a
suggestion, I can imagine with

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.510
the API people are obviously
going to want to be able to

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.450
create their own voice triggers
so that you don't

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.030
actually to go to the card
to activate the feature.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.810
So my question is have you
thought about how that's going

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.430
to be managed, and whether or
not you're going to have

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.590
different apps that are kind
of competing for the same

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.980
voice trigger or similar
voice triggers?

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.880
TIMOTHY: That's a great
question, and it's about voice

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.470
invocation.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.440
CHARLES: Yeah, it's definitely
something we're talking about.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.375
We haven't really made a
decision on it, but it's kind

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.030
of top of our mind right now.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.910
So again coming back to we
don't really want to

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.100
foreshadow features, but we
definitely do want a way for

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.340
you to voice trigger things
and we're just exploring

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.320
different ways to do it.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.220
Because like you said, there
could be a lot of apps that

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.830
want to do the same thing.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.400
Uber is a great example.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.680
Should we get a taxi?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.006
But there are a lot
of taxi companies.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:13.450
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.310
Thank you.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.102
TIMOTHY: Thank you.

00:27:15.102 --> 00:27:15.946
Over here.

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:16.790
AUDIENCE: How are you doing?

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.570
Paul Forgione.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.290
I'm just a lowly student.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.240
But this is a question for you,
Isabelle, in regards to

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.660
the industrial design.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.130
You were showing the prototype
that you had, and then you're

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.510
wearing a bright orange
pair right now.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.250
Tim, you have the blue pair on,
then you were showing the

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.990
prescription glasses prototype
you guys have.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.750
Obviously over time the
components are going to shrink

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.040
and soon get smaller.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.550
Are you planning on sort of
trying to incorporate it and

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.680
make it less noticeable?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.930
Or are you going to move forward
with the direction

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.110
with the bright colors and
continue to still have it be a

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.360
statement while you're
wearing it?

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.770
ISABELLE: We've developed five
different colors to kind of

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.800
satisfy different personalities
and also what

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.840
you look good in.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.040
It's kind of counter-intuitive.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.670
A lot of people think,
oh, charcoal.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.790
That's going to go
with everything.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.980
That's my favorite color.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.630
And me, myself, because
I wear a lot of black.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.380
But then after wearing it around
for almost a year,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.640
different colors, we started
to see how important color

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.790
was, and how non-intuitive it
was, and like how people

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.280
develop an attachment to
the specific color.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.950
Every time we do a new prototype
and all the colors

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.935
are not available, people come
and then scream at me.

00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:29.700
I want my tangerine back.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.160
And I'm like, I can't do
anything about that.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.790
We chose five.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.910
We didn't want to overwhelm
people, and there was a range.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.020
So we have a couple of bright
ones and then we have three

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.330
kind of neutrals.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.510
And I think the cotton one is
kind of bold and neutral at

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.680
the same time.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.210
And shale looks great on almost
everybody and is a

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.580
little bit less heavy
than charcoal.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.300
Although Charles--

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.000
CHARLES: I love charcoal.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.570
ISABELLE: --rocked charcoal
because he has dark skin, so

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.090
it looks really good.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:00.400
TIMOTHY: I don't know.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.650
Blue's pretty nice.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.770
STEVE: I think what Isabelle's
saying, though, is that the

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.160
look is very important.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.810
ISABELLE: Yeah, and I think
colors are much more important

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.600
than you would ever imagine.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.860
And if it's up to me, I would
want to keep on doing cool

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.140
colors, and keep
on doing that.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:20.510
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.940
Thank you.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.300
TIMOTHY: Thank you.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.440
Over here.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my question
is about displays.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.670
Can you comment on how does
the display work?

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.370
Is it a projector?

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.990
Or is it a small LCD screen
that's reflecting off a prism?

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.600
And the second part to it is
do you see people using it

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.480
only for micro-interactions,
or is it for long form

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.390
reading, video?

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.440
TIMOTHY: OK, so there's two
questions, and I think it's

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.425
Charles and Steve.

00:29:46.425 --> 00:29:48.450
The first question is, can you
talk about the technical

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.620
specifications of the display?

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.480
CHARLES: Yeah, we don't really
want to get into the technical

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.690
details of that right now.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.280
AUDIENCE: Well, just on the
principle of how does it work,

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.540
is it just reflecting off
or is it a projector?

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.955
CHARLES: Yeah, I really don't
want to comment on the

00:29:57.955 --> 00:29:58.380
technical data.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.230
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.230
TIMOTHY: And then the second
question is to Steve.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.680
STEVE: Yeah.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.040
I mean, while we can't
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.750
the technology, but what the
experience is like is it--

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.160
because a common question for
those who've not tried Glass

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.880
on is, do I have to focus
on something a

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.430
centimeter from my eye?

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.260
And no, you don't
have to do that.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.320
That would be painful.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.323
It projects it out six or seven
feet in front of you, a

00:30:21.323 --> 00:30:23.070
virtual image.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.885
TIMOTHY: That's how it feels.

00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:26.310
STEVE: That's how it feels.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.300
The second question--

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.820
in terms of duration of looking
at the display.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.080
It's definitely true, by putting
the display up above

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.620
your eye, it's not intended to,
for example, watch a full

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.980
length movie or read a book.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.270
It would be uncomfortable.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.880
Humans aren't used to looking
up for that long a period.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.780
So we've designed the entire
experience around brief

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.380
interactions.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.510
We call them on the team
micro-interactions.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.540
And that's not only just
because of the display

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.470
placement, but it also fits with
our goal of the product,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.670
which is really to allow you to
get technology out of the

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.640
way when you don't need it.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.930
When you're trying to experience
life, and do

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.940
activities in life, we don't
want to create zombies staring

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.170
at a display for long
periods of time.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.650
So we really tried to design
Glass to be fast and brief

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.870
moments of experience.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:22.560
TIMOTHY: Cool.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.436
All right, over here.

00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:25.630
AUDIENCE: My name's Tristan.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.050
I'm from Portland, Oregon.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.080
And I was also wondering
about colors.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.990
I was wondering how you settled
on the first five

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.400
colors, and if you tested a
number of different colors

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.990
first and then sort of
winnowed them down to

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.260
what we have now?

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:46.670
And I also wanted to suggest a
green color as the next color.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.680
I was thinking perhaps Pantone
377C is pretty close

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:52.354 --> 00:31:53.665
ISABELLE: Will you
write that down?

00:31:53.665 --> 00:31:55.293
TIMOTHY: Say it one more time?

00:31:55.293 --> 00:31:58.578
AUDIENCE: 377C.

00:31:58.578 --> 00:32:01.560
ISABELLE: Is that [INAUDIBLE]
coated one?

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.810
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.540
ISABELLE: So the question
is how we

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.940
arrived at these colors.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.560
I think one of the benefits
we've had with the way we've

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.120
done the project is we've
built all these monthly

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.750
prototypes.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.060
Every month we would come out
with a new prototype and

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.510
everybody on the team has
been wearing them.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.950
So what we did quite
early on was to

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.200
produce a range of colors--

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.470
just two of each--

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.420
and then I basically looked
at which colors are people

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.010
fighting over.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.190
It's kind of a fun indication.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.475
So that was kind of a way to
see what was really popular

00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:43.930
and what resonated
with people.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.460
I mean, we have a very
diverse team.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.520
So just by observing, seeing
people wearing it around,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.510
seeing what works, seeing
what doesn't work.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.190
I would force people to try
on different things.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:58.080
So it's kind of an intuition,
and having an eye for it, and

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.860
just kind of experimenting.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.530
And, again, we wanted a few
poppy colors for people who

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.860
are like, hey, come
and talk to me.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.450
And then a more subdued for
people who kind of want to

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.950
stand out a little bit less.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:10.675
TIMOTHY: Thank you.

00:33:10.675 --> 00:33:10.950
ISABELLE: Thanks.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:11.690
TIMOTHY: Awesome question.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.220
I liked that one.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.700
Over here.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Eric from
Vancouver, Canada.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.670
My question was mostly
about like--

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.630
and I think I speak for
most people here--

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.900
using such a different device,
and using such a personal

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.990
device, isn't a problem
for most people here.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:39.430
But how does Glass plan to get
to people who aren't so into

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.120
technology and who aren't
so indulgent in

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.480
trying the newest things.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.060
How are you going to show
that Glass is something

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.530
more than just that?

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.450
TIMOTHY: Let me just ask
a specific question.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.180
Do you mean getting them
Glass physically?

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.280
Or do you mean sort of how are
they going to integrate it

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.160
into their lives?

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.770
AUDIENCE: I mean like them using
it, not actually them

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.910
getting hold of it.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:04.980
I mean in the future.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.960
TIMOTHY: Yeah.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.150
Steve.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:06.750
STEVE: I'll take that.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.469
Sure.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.159
We announced our project
a little over a

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.690
year ago to the world.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:18.810
And we did that relatively early
in the development of

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:25.449
Glass, which is not sort of
standard to do it that way.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.659
We did that though for
a couple reasons.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.510
One, we felt like to build the
best possible product, this is

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.090
something we couldn't do in
a secret lab at Google.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.750
We had to get out in the
real world, ourselves--

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.840
wear it, use it, and improve
the product.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.429
And, secondly, is just to
understand the social

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:46.840
applications and reactions from
other people better, and

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.730
educate society on why we think
this is a good thing for

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.929
people and society.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:59.120
One thing that I'm quite
surprised by is how quickly

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.830
that there's been a positive
reaction, not just from people

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:08.100
in Silicon Valley or at Google,
but around the world.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.020
So I'm wearing Glass
all over the place.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.570
Not just here in the Bay Area,
not just in New York and LA,

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.420
but I'm from Iowa.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.935
So I go back home in Iowa.

00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:21.520
I'm from a town of 1,200 people,
and the response from

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.660
folks there is--

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.090
similar to New York, LA, here,
anywhere else-- with

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.060
incredible optimism
and excitement.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.850
These are not developers.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.980
It's not people who read "The
Verge" or "TechCrunch." This

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.880
is normal folks.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:46.150
STEVE: And they are very, very
optimistic, intrigued, and

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.560
curious about Glass.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.780
They can see and incorporate
it in their life.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.650
They're still trying
to understand

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.770
exactly what it does.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.130
And as we slowly reveal what
Glass is, and, frankly, learn

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.690
ourselves what all it can do,
I think they're learning.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.540
But I think there's already
interest and intrigue.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.920
So I actually think there's a
real opportunity for Glass to

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.900
become mainstream.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.010
ISABELLE: And that's also
what [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.755
a Glass program is
about as well--

00:36:14.755 --> 00:36:21.120
a very diverse group, not very
techie, and who'll be our

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.142
first other types of
people using it.

00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.347
TIMOTHY: Thank you.

00:36:29.347 --> 00:36:30.600
And over here.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Rick Merit.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:32.880
I'm a reporter with

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.550
"Electronic Engineering Times"--

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.770
EE Times.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.500
And I guess what my readers
would most like to know,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.920
because they'll be the folks who
are some day building this

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.010
kind of product or building
the components--

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.600
the displays, and the batteries,
and the chips that

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.530
power them.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.200
What they would most like is as
much commentary and color

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.100
that you want to give them
and tell them about--

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.560
I suppose what's working is not
as interesting as what's

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.040
not working-- what you need
better in terms of battery, or

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.470
performance, or display, or
whatever componentry.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.770
What you need from that
community that you're not

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.700
getting or what you most need
in the future, what do you

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.130
most want, your wish list.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.820
TIMOTHY: Charles, I think
this is for you.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.900
CHARLES: I think that's a great
question because I think

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.400
Glass will drive forward certain
types of technologies.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.450
And, at least right now, I
don't think they're any

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.960
different to what you'd want
from a cell phone.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.990
I mean, you guys are probably
power users of your cell

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.910
phone, and one of the biggest
things is the battery.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:35.000
I mean, battery density and
capacity isn't really doubling

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.610
every year.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.830
It's not really becoming smaller
and 10 times more

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.200
powerful like processors
did back in the day.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.720
So I think that battery
technology is kind of key.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.620
Or power technology--

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.300
maybe it's not battery.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.620
Maybe it's some other source.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.980
But I really hope
there's a lot of

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.230
investment in that area.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.980
And I think that's going to be
key to powering a lot of

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.460
great, new experiences, and
having a tiny form factor.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.245
TIMOTHY: OK, I think we
have time for maybe

00:37:59.245 --> 00:38:01.140
one or two more questions.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.450
Over here.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.710
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.870
This is Emerson from Toronto.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.880
I was wondering whether the
Glass team has had any worries

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.490
about parallels to, say,
Bluetooth headset, where it

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.420
was very fashionable
after a while.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.700
But people thought that people
on Bluetooth headsets were

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.090
crazy because they were
talking to themselves.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.900
And eventually Bluetooth
headsets became not so

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.880
fashionable, and aren't
doing so well anymore.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.210
TIMOTHY: So is the question is
Glass going to be fashionable?

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.380
AUDIENCE: I'm sure it will be,
but I was wondering if like

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.130
you predicted ahead and see if
there might be a worrisome

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:43.180
downward trend of Glass after
an initial hot start--

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.170
after the initial burst
of enthusiasm, as

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.455
you mentioned earlier.

00:38:46.455 --> 00:38:49.740
STEVE: Yeah, that's definitely
something we've about, and

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.990
specifically thinking about
Bluetooth headsets.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:00.340
Like I just said, we hope and
expect Glass to become popular

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.330
with mainstream.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.410
To do that, to achieve that, I
think it needs to be thought

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.990
of as something positive.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:13.260
And not just by people who buy
and use Glass, but by those

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.260
around them.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.005
And I do think it's pretty
common with Bluetooth--

00:39:17.005 --> 00:39:20.210
I've yet to meet a person who
says that they like being

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:23.540
around someone who has a
Bluetooth headset on.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.400
It's usually not a
positive image.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.580
And we want to do the exact
opposite with Glass.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.900
So to achieve that I think that
it's really important--

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.000
number one-- some
of the things we

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.920
talked about earlier.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.140
Social etiquette and how can
we design Glass to make it

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.555
more personable and more social,
and not taking you out

00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:41.570
of the moment--

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.030
actually keeping you in the
moment-- with those that

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.800
you're around.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.980
That's number one.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.690
That's a key design
tenant for us.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:53.810
And number two is how can Glass
benefit those around you

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.750
or other people, even if
they don't have Glass.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.890
And so already we have a few
experiences that do that.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.300
Since it's so good at capturing
moments of events

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.390
that you might be at or
activities you're doing, you

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.120
can share them with the people
you're with, and they see

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.660
benefit with Glass.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.070
Another great thing about Glass
is instant access to

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.060
information.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.010
Often when you're with friends
or family, questions will

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.780
arise, or you'd like
to know something.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.255
And Glass is so fast at getting
that information, all

00:40:25.255 --> 00:40:30.820
of a sudden you become the
hero instead of the goat.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.330
Those are just a couple
examples already.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.950
But again, getting back to the
development community, that's

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.400
one thing I'd love to see
developers think about.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.390
How can you not only make Glass
great for the person

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.560
using Glass, but for everyone
they're with?

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.160
TIMOTHY: All right.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.580
And with that we are at time.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.800
There's a couple things I'd
like to say before we go,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.360
because the conversation doesn't
have to stop here.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.890
If you're an Explorer, we have
a community for you online.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.190
It's glass-community.com.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.950
Please join us there.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.000
Let's continue talking
about these things as

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.500
we build Glass together.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.360
If you're a developer, you can
ask questions on "Stack

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.270
Overflow." The tag is Glass.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:11.160
And of course all of us are
available on Google+ if you

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.680
want to join us on there.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.450
Thank you so much, and we look
forward to our next chat.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:19.078
[APPLAUSE]
