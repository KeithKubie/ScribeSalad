00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.420
Most people know or remember from school that
underneath it all reality is not based on

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.180
billiard balls and things that match our experience
in the physical world, but on a system called

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.600
quantum mechanics.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.850
And the rules of quantum mechanics are rather
strange and not very intuitive to us and so

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.890
they don't act like the higher level rules
that we've built computers on so far.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.660
So there's a bunch of research to study whether
or not you can do things in quantum mechanics

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.960
that perform computation in ways that we can't
do at the level of mechanical systems or electronic

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.700
systems that we use.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.780
In particular it seems possible in theory
to do very, very huge amounts of computing

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.560
in quantum mechanics, sort of as some people
would imagine it as though you were tapping

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.469
into millions and trillions and billions of
parallel universes and having computations

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.630
take place in all those parallel universes
until an answer is found in one and is revealed

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.190
to you in your universe.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920
Well, that's a little bit mystical.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.879
I don't know if anyone can give you the true
answer on that, but there are people who believe

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.320
that they can make a computer that uses these
properties of quantum computing to solve some

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.179
very, very specific problems much, much faster
than the way we solve them today with computers.

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.719
And when I say much, much faster, so much
faster that if you were to turn the entire

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:27.799
universe into an ordinary computer like the
one on your desk, it still could not outcompete

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.600
the quantum computer at solving these problems.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.770
Now, one of the problems that can be solved
this way, in theory, yet no one has built

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.770
this computer that we know of, but one of
the problems that can be solved is a math

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.220
problem that we believe to be hard, which
is to say factoring really large numbers.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.619
And because we believe that problem to be
really hard, we have used that as the lock

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.509
in all of the computer security that we use
in the world today, almost all of it.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.899
And if that lock can be broken, because the
quantum computer makes easy what everyone

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.239
else believe to be incredibly hard, the person
with the quantum computer could break most

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.560
of the cryptography, all the traffic you see
going across the web, a lot of the financial

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.030
transaction traffic, a lot of the authentication,
all of that stuff becomes vulnerable to a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.190
computer that's done that.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.730
Now, Edward Snowden has told us that the NSA
does indeed have a research project to build

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.450
this, and I actually feel good about that
because Snowden didn't tell us they already

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.450
had one.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.010
Now, the way you will know that someone has
a quantum computer like this if it's made

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.050
public, is you look out your window on Wall
Street and if you see bankers and stock people

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.450
running screaming in terror waving their arms
you know that someone has developed a quantum

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.450
computer.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.100
There are a few other things that could cause
that.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500
By the way many people are skeptical that
it ever will happen.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.760
There's some people who think something will
always stand in the way of this being true.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.950
But other people are very serious about it.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.320
Now, there's a second type of device, which
is also being called a quantum computer made

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.180
by a company up in Vancouver called D-Wave.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.530
The D-Wave Computer solves other specialty
problems and not the one that affects cryptography.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.350
It's, for example, good at solving a fairly
hard problem.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.101
Imagine you're out in a mountain range and
you're in a valley somewhere in a mountain

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:20.370
range and you're asked what's the lowest of
valley in this mountain range?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.440
Now, if you had to solve that yourself you'd
have to like climb to the top of all the mountains

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.340
and look down because in your valley it's
easy to find the bottom of your valley, but

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.380
you don't know if there's another valley over
next to you that's lower or not.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.300
And their quantum computer they claim is able
to do things like solve that instantly, find

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300
that bottom of the valley.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.410
Why is that useful?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.240
Because that's a problem that we call optimization,
having a really complex system and trying

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.090
to find the most efficient, the lowest energy,
the lowest cost way to deal with it.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.550
And so that type of quantum computer could
help us a lot at solving big business problems,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.600
big data problems.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.540
That's actually very interesting too and they've
actually sold a couple of these computers

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.010
to have people who want to experiment on making
that happen.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.050
So two different things people call quantum
computers.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.760
Both capable of solving some very specific
problems, which could have big consequences

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.629
for our society, but not for example something
that makes your spreadsheet go a lot faster.
