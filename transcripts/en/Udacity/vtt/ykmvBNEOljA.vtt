00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now for a quiz: What are the risks of GUI capture replay tools?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They may capture sensitive information,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which should not go to developers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Recorded scripts may not be replayable in different environments.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Different because of different local, different resolution,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
different font size, or different speed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Recorded scripts may be prone to change

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as the software or the GUI changes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Check all that apply.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Over to you.
