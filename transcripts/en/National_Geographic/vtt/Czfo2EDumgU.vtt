00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.900
So I tried to
get Wayne Shorter

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
to express sounds
of the universe

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.300
through jazz, through
his saxophone.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.633
OK.

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:15.900
So I prepped him for a cosmic
phenomenon to see how he--

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.500
can he roll with it.
- Uh-oh.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.367
This is going to be deep.

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:20.467
Let's check it out.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.467
I want to describe something
astrophysical to you,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.133
and I'm wondering
if you can convert

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.800
that to a musical expression.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.967
In the center of the sun,
energy is created by fusion,

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.600
and a photon of light is born.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.967
This photon of light
careening back and forth

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.567
eventually escapes the sun.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:50.100
That takes hundreds of thousands
of years for that photon

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.633
to get from the center of
the sun to its surface,

00:00:53.633 --> 00:01:01.834
and it takes 8 minutes to
get from the sun to Earth.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.333
Is there music in that?

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.033
Yeah.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.800
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
Can you feel the photon?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.166
Trying to--
- Feel the photon.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.633
Feel the-- oh, I like that.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.700
Feeling-- that's an
album title right there,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.033
feeling the photon.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.100
The photon fears nothing.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.800
OK.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.667
[sustained note]

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:33.166
And if I move in any
direction other than that,

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:41.433
I think this one
thing incorporates all

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:45.200
of the movement and struggles
and everything like that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.633
and all of the short-term goals
and stuff like that that other

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.266
people be looking for, and this
photon is wrapping around that

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.834
whole thing for millions
and millions of years,

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.133
and something else is wrapping
around that, and that's us.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.200
OK, now we know
why people hate jazz.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.000
What the hell was that?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.734
Did you see your
face in that clip?

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.600
He was like, "pah,"
and you were like,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.133
what the hell are you doing?

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.133
What are you doing
Wayne Shorter?
