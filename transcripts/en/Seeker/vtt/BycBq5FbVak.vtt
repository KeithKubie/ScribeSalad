00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.410
When you're poor, it can be hard to go grab
a cheeseburger, or buy the newest video game,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.439
but that's not the worst part.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:19.320
The tough part is that even if you get rich,
the effects of poverty stick with you.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.550
As of 2011, the World Bank estimates 17 percent
of people lived at or below a dollar twenty

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.710
five a day -- that's just over a billion people.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.439
In 1981 it was closer to 2 billion, so weâ€™re
making progress[1]!

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.550
In 2013, the official poverty rate in the
U.S. was 14.5 percent -- totalling around

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.550
45.3 million poor people in the wealthiest
country in the world[2].

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.550
Governments worldwide are fighting poverty
in a number of ways, and not just because

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.210
it's the right thing to do, science says poverty
actually HARMS you.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.500
A 2013 study published in Science[3], explored
how poverty impairs overall cognitive function.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.780
They looked at farmers both pre and post harvest
of a cash crop of sugar cane.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.740
After the harvest of the cane, nutrition wasn't
immediately improved, but the influx of cash

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.009
gave the farmers financial security.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.219
That security gave their cognitive performance
a boost!

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.950
Post-harvest farmers were able to make better
decisions than pre-harvest farmers did[4].

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.420
Poverty is a combination of stressors which,
as a whole, are not fully understood by science.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.049
The findings in Science suggest stress alone
doesn't explain all of poverty's effects on

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.110
humankind, and that being in poverty keeps
the brain from processing information properly.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.880
But how those effects manifest seems to vary.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.060
For example, a study released last month in
Nature Neuroscience[5] found a link between

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.840
physical brain development and poverty level.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.340
In a study of the brain images of nearly 11-hundred
children, adolescents and young adults from

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
around the US, researchers found significant
differences in the brains of children in the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.920
lowest income bracket; even when controlling
for ethnic background; in comparison to those

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.499
in a high bracket.

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.360
Families who lived on less than 25,000 dollars
a year had as much as 6 percent less surface

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.189
area in their brain in areas like language
and decision-making than families who made

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.189
more than 150,000 dollars a year.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.540
Poverty's effects on the brain causes excess
stress on children, both psychological and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.600
physiological!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.650
Poor children can suffer from substandard
housing, homelessness, inadequate child care,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.020
under-resourced schooling, and of course inadequate
nutrition.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.480
All of these can then cause stress leading
to anxiety, depression and low-self esteem,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.310
as well as a tendency toward violence[6].

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.190
In a study of 44 African American infant girls,
brains of those from poorer families were

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.070
smaller than those of wealthier families!

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.940
Even at only one month old, the effects of
poverty can be seen on the physical structures

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.390
of the human brain.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.510
Extreme poverty is a real hardship, affecting
people even after they've risen above the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.510
poverty line.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.910
Familial stressors like "family disruption,
financial stress and maternal poor health[7]"

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.390
can cause obesity in children; which isn't
easy to overcome.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.120
Plus, anxiety, low self-esteem and differing
brain structures all require future attention

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.990
from healthcare, which could be avoided by
raising children and families out of poverty.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.200
In families with a low socioeconomic status,
shifts of even a few thousand dollars of extra

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.570
family income was visible in the brain structures!

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.980
Governments around the world are working hard
to find solutions.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.890
In the U.S. our poverty solutions involve
giving tax breaks, food stamps, and social

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.730
security programs to poorer individuals -- though
many politicians scoff at these ideas, the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.660
poverty rate has declined.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.470
One recent study conducted in Kenya showed
that when poor people are given money, they

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.940
spend it on education, healthcare and housing
improvements, all of which decrease the poverty

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.890
stress on them and their children[8].

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.380
Not to say the problem is solved, by any means,
research is ongoing, but this episode of DNews

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.270
is just one part of the story.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.290
For the full picture you watch TestTube to
learn if policies, like food stamps, actually

00:03:48.290 --> 00:04:10.240
work to raise people out 
of poverty.
