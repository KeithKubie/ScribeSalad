00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
The world feels pretty divided currently 81% of both liberals and conservatives have

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.079
unfavorable views towards those on the other side

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.200
But is there actually a fundamental biological difference between liberals and conservatives on the surface?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.160
we can see some funny differences like

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.340
Conservatives like meat and potatoes more while liberals tend to like trying food from other cultures more in general

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.170
Conservatives prefer purebred dogs while liberals prefer mixed breeds and liberals are ok with free verse poetry while conservatives prefer it to rhyme

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.469
But as we study more we realize that the differences are much deeper when put through MRI brain scans

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.729
It turns out that liberals are more likely to have a larger anterior cingulate cortex

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.960
which is associated with

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.730
Understanding and monitoring conflict while conservatives have a larger, right?

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.390
amygdala

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.320
Which helps process fear and anxiety and that makes sense given the years of research that have shown people tend to become a more conservative

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320
When they feel threatened or afraid?

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.749
After 9/11, for example, the u.s. Became politically more conservative with studies showing increased support for issues

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.589
Like national security and military spending but studies have also found that conservatives and liberals employ different cognitive styles

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.029
Conservatives excel when it comes to more structured and organized problems or questions

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.008
Whereas liberals tend to be more flexible and less likely to commit errors with questions involving conflicting information and requiring fast reaction times

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.979
One study looking at dorm rooms even found that on average

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.519
Conservative students rooms were less messy than liberals

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.790
But they also experienced pain in different ways so much. So that one study was able to predict who is liberal or conservative

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.780
Just by viewing brain scans of them looking at graphic photos

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.989
Containing mutilations in this instance liberal brains were more active in the s2 or somatosensory to region

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
Which is normally activated when you're in pain, but also when you see someone else suffering

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.078
It's essentially scientific evidence for the bleeding-heart liberal stereotype

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.319
Which doesn't mean conservatives are uncaring but that their minds just respond to graphic images differently in America

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.969
This can explain how Democrats and Republicans perceive the world in fundamentally different ways

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:03.759
it's

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.559
difficult to grasp how someone on the other side of politics thinks because we tend to overestimate the extent to which our opinions believe some

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.899
Values are normal so colleges refer to this as false consensus bias. For example, if you heard Yanni in latina vs

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
Laurel debate it may have felt that you were the normal one and it was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.659
insane that anyone could be hearing Laurel apply this logic to politics and you can see why people have such

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
polarizing ideas on issues like immigration

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.799
Abortion gun rights etc

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.759
But where do these differences come from one study revealed that genetics can account for around thirty to forty percent of a person's?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.030
political leanings which may seem like a lot but there are still many other important factors like your environment and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.479
personal experiences which play massive roles in your politics political

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.129
Neuroscience is a relatively new field of study with fascinating results and in a world that's being increasingly characterized by its divisions

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.378
Perhaps an important aspect of unity involves using neuroscience to better understand each other's differences

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.259
On a lighter note space is a place for liberals and conservatives and nations all over the world come together

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.590
And we actually just made a video where we tried out the latest

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.670
Space food that astronauts are eating right now click here or the description to check it out

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.829
Also, if you want even more science, we have a weekly science podcast, so subscribe to it

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.739
The link is like down there I think and it's called side note
