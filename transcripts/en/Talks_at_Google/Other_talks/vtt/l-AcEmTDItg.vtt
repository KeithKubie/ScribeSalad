BILL DUANE: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.000
My name is Bill
Duane, and I look

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.570
after the well being
learning programs here,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.710
which includes the
gPause program.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.070
And today's talk is about
everyday well being and the way

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.850
that mindfulness can
be supportive of that.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.126
In particular, during good times
and during challenging times.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:28.211
It's one of my favorite topics
to hear Noah talk about.

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:30.210
One of the things that's
been really interesting

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.880
in my practice has been the more
I learn about my own experience

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.260
with well being, even
though the journey seems

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.850
very unique and personal
to me, the more I learn

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.070
about that really
deeply personal journey,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.490
the more I learn about how
this connects to other people's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.100
and their own journeys.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.660
And so an important part
of the gPause program

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.120
is connecting what
goes on here at Google

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.780
with what's going on in
the rest of the world.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.340
And in particular, this really
interesting and beautiful way

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.290
that we see the connection
between our practice and other

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.360
people's.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.934
And particularly during
a time of inequality,

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.350
it's really important
to make sure

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.850
that there's a connection
between the privileged

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.640
and the less
privileged, particularly

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.940
in terms of practice.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.080
So that's why, hopefully--
how many people here gPausers?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.090
Yay.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.510
So do you guys know that when
you practice and you record

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.310
your practice, it
goes to non-profits

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.400
that teach mindfulness to
less privileged groups.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.280
And I have the privilege of
talking about the Mind Body

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.330
Awareness Project, which is one
of the groups that we give to.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.710
We all know what's going on in
terms of incarceration rates,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.000
and particularly with kids.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520
And again, going
back to it, like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.697
what helps the kids
in this situation

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:50.030
is the same thing that helps us.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.530
Sort of self awareness,
self regulation,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.700
and compassion and empathy.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.527
So there's this connection
that's always going on.

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:00.360
So even though today
we're here to practice,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.250
to talk about our own well
being and everyday well being,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.430
it's in conjunction with the
people who are doing this work.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.250
And we have a
number of them here

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.500
joining us to let
them know that they're

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.420
supported, both directly and
indirectly, by this practice.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.690
And I'll be talking a
little bit at the end

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.970
about some opportunities for
volunteering and donations.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.530
But for now, let me introduce
my friend, my teacher,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.776
Noah Levine, author of
books with words in them--

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:35.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.880
--on punk rock, well being,
meditation, compassion.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
Are you coming out with
a young adult series?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.879
NOAH LEVINE: "Recovery."

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.320
BILL DUANE: "Recovery," right.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.194
That's a great thing.

00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:50.940
So as I mentioned,
one of the things

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.600
I appreciate most about him
as a teacher and as a person

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.150
is the ability to
skillfully blend

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.170
practice with appreciation,
but also sort of a low bullshit

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.412
orientation towards challenges.

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:06.370
And this idea of turning
towards challenges, as

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.010
opposed to turning away from it.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.490
So with that, I introduce
to you Mr. Noah Levine.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.002
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:20.960
NOAH LEVINE: Thank you.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.200
I'm happy to be here and
especially happy to be here

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.220
for this conversation
with you, but actually

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.230
in support of the Mind
Body Awareness Project.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.390
And I'm not at all used--
although I speak quite a bit,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.560
I'm not used to standing up.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.700
I'm used to sitting down and
sitting on a meditation cushion

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.480
most the time when I'm teaching.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.510
Or at least in a chair.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.010
So I'll stand here
awkwardly and not

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.970
really know what to do with
my hands, and figure it out.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.390
So a little background
of my experience

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.030
that brought me to
mindfulness practice

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.910
and that eventually
led to establishing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.150
the non-profit of Mind
Body Awareness Project

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.730
was that I probably
was introduced

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.290
to mindfulness as a child.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.779
My father was actually
a mindfulness meditation

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.930
practitioner and teacher.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.880
And so it was modeled,
like I saw my parents

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.380
meditating when I was a kid.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.200
And I was somewhat
aware of meditation.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.850
But through my own suffering
in childhood, and confusion,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.700
and pain that I
experienced, I completely

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.780
rejected, or just
wasn't interested

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.970
in-- it was modeled,
although I just

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.690
wasn't interested in
anything healthy for me.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:01.010
I was interested in
destruction and intoxication.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.260
I wanted to escape reality.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.350
I didn't want to sit
mindfully in reality.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.920
I want to avoid it.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920
And found lots of
different ways to avoid it,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.290
and lots of experiences,
which eventually for me

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.060
led to drug addiction and lots
of crime and incarceration.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.730
And at 17 years old, sitting
in Santa Cruz County Juvenile

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.920
Hall, where I grew up.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.680
And I'd been in and out of this
juvenile hall quite a bit from,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.750
I think I was about 11 years old
the first time I got arrested.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.140
And just kept getting in
trouble and this sort of cycle

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.441
of recidivism and in and out of
the court system and juvenile

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:43.940
hall.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.920
And this moment of desperation
in my life, where there

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.050
was a huge shift for me from
that first portion with all

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.720
of that trouble.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.430
And I just blamed everyone else.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.090
I didn't take any
responsibility.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.050
I felt maybe justified
in my actions,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.470
and somewhat like a victim.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.760
Like I was-- it was society's
fault. It was my parents.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.240
I love to put it on the hippies.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.810
It was the hippies' fault that
I was an angry, violent, drug

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.250
addicted punk rocker.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.795
I had to rebel
against my parents.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.770
But I found myself in sort of
a desperation and a realization

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.200
this last time that
I was incarcerated,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.639
where up until that time, I
had felt like, like I said,

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.930
it was everybody else's fault.
And I felt really stuck.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.690
My father had
probably encouraged

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.770
me to meditate a lot
of times, but I'd never

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.600
really considered it.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.680
I'd never seriously
considered it.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.840
But there was this moment
where I had a suicide attempt,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.190
and I was in a padded room,
and an observation cell.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.650
And I got a phone
call from my father.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.810
He didn't live locally.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.800
He was out of state And he
said, would you like some help?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.670
And I was like, yes.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.840
I need a lawyer, totally
get me some help.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.340
I'm in big trouble.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.150
Get me some help.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.640
And he said, are you ready
to learn mindfulness?

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.770
Are you ready to
practice meditation?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.300
And with a little bit
of disappointment,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.690
but with the desperation
of nothing else worked,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.440
nothing else that I've
sought happiness or well

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.680
being or contentment through--
drugs, violence, crime, sex,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.562
attention, all of the
adolescent ways that I thought

00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:46.645
would maybe make me happy.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.390
It all failed.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.810
I was in this sort
of like failure.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.310
So I was like, it's
gotten this bad.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.020
I'll even try meditation,
I'm this desperate.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.380
I will even try meditation.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.010
And right from the
beginning of mindfulness

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.730
practice, and I was given the
simple mindfulness instructions

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.050
that most people are given
in the beginning, which is

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.310
pay attention to your breath.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.540
I think something
like, breathing in,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.100
know that you're breathing
in, feel the breath entering

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.690
the nostrils.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.780
Breathing out, know that
you're breathing out,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.310
feel the sensations.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.900
And ignore your
mind for a moment

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.230
and pay attention to your
breath and your body.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.210
And that was a long time ago.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.480
A little over 27 years ago.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.030
I don't completely remember the
conversation or my experience,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.919
but some way or another, I
got willing, I got inspired,

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.630
and I went back to my cell,
my juvenile hall cell,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.880
and started trying to meditate
with this simple-- actually,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.880
I think the other instruction
that I was given was count.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.170
Breathing in one, breathing
out two, breathing in three,

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.470
breathing out four.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.790
And I would kind of
go one, two, and then

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.752
be gone, just
thinking about prison

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.210
and what that was
going to be like.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.820
Or this sort of shame
of the past and regret.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.300
Just all of the suffering
that my mind was creating.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.960
Like being locked in a
cell is unpleasant enough,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.210
but actually, my mind was worse.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.770
The past was way worse
than being in that cell.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:30.060
The future was way worse,
my fears way worse.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:38.690
So I immediately got some
relief, some level of relief.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.460
What a relief to not be
in my mind, even just

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.860
for half a breath, even
just for that in breath,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.110
even just for that out breath.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.340
Just that little
moment of avoiding

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.160
the suffering, the
psychological, mental,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.580
emotional suffering.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.660
And being with
the-- which was also

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.830
a pretty unpleasant
experience for me.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.590
At the time I was detoxing
from alcohol and drugs.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.090
It wasn't like all of a sudden
I'm meditating peacefully

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.940
in this jail cell.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.820
I'm really unhappy.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.470
But even my unhappiness
that the mindfulness,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.270
from the beginning,
I saw this is

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.130
better than what
my mind creates,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.761
the suffering that
my mind creates.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.560
My first couple of
years, I ended up,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.580
I was locked up for a few months
and then put into a group home.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.060
And I got very lucky.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.920
I could have-- it was
the '80s, and they

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.544
weren't sentencing adolescents
to adult prison yet.

00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:41.460
And the three strikes,
all of that stuff they,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.650
weren't doing that for kids.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.510
And it was actually
my third felony arrest

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.820
that I was in for that time.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.310
And I could have-- 20 years
later, I could still--

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.970
kids that get
arrested for the stuff

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.920
that I got arrested end
up for decades in prison.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.800
But the timing and
fortunate lucky karma, I

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.080
don't know, something.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.460
I ended up having a judge
that said let's just keep him

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.552
in a group home
until he turns 18,

00:11:11.552 --> 00:11:12.885
since I was still an adolescent.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.440
I meditated.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.530
I tried to meditate.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.250
I didn't really know
what I was doing,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.072
but I tried to pay
attention to my breath.

00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:26.010
And I tried to ignore my mind.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.220
But I was very
embarrassed about it.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.580
Meditation's not cool
where I come from.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.840
I wasn't going to tell
anybody that I was meditating.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.136
Luckily, I was mostly
in a single cell.

00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:38.760
And then I was put
into this group home

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.580
where there was
like four teenagers

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.857
in this room in bunks.

00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:45.940
And then I'd have to kind
of lay there and pretend

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.180
like I was sleeping as I was
doing breath awareness, or body

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.770
scan, or kind of-- I'm not being
weird, I'm just laying here.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.076
Kind of stealth, secret
mindfulness practice.

00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:03.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.690
And my meditation practice
was pretty half-assed

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.970
for the first couple of years.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.590
I didn't get serious
about meditation

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.300
until I was about 19.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:11.915
Late starter.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.120
First couple years I did
it, and I think I used

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:24.010
mindfulness the way that a lot
of people maybe use prayer.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.656
I've heard of the, I think they
call it the foxhole prayer,

00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:27.780
when things get really bad.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.680
Then you're bargaining with God,
like get me out of this one.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.920
I won't do it again.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.253
And I would use mindfulness
like that, when I got really

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.960
stressed out, really
afraid, really

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.869
shame spiral or something.

00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:40.160
And I'd come back to my breath.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.250
Like ignore that, come
back to my breath.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.739
And then at about 19 years old,
I think that a piece for me--

00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:52.280
I don't know how,
and I'll try to get

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.040
into the core of the
conversation here.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.100
But I still have this idea
that maybe the happiness

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.139
that I was seeking would come
somehow from outside of myself.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.180
I still had-- I was like
well, I'm a drug addict.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.910
If I'm sober, then
I'll be happy.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.720
If I have money, if I
have a relationship.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.650
I just kept thinking that
somewhere out there was

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.230
the happiness that I sought.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.380
And I found myself just
two years later-- I

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.940
got my GED, went
back to college,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.232
had the car that I thought
would make me happy.

00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:24.190
I wanted the low rider.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.540
I got it.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.590
I wanted a motorcycle.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.190
I got it.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.320
The beautiful girlfriend.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.190
I was like, I had all
of the material stuff

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.396
and sensual experiences that
I thought was going to work.

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:40.130
And I was so disappointed
that it didn't work.

00:13:47.107 --> 00:13:48.690
I was so disappointed
that I signed up

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.390
for a meditation retreat.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.370
Well, I also got busted by
the police for graffiti.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.370
Sober vandalism, out
there ego trip tagging.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.750
And I got in all
of this trouble.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.560
And it was meditation
that was like, oh, this

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.400
is the only thing that's
ever really worked.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.060
This is the only
place I've ever found

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.320
any true inner satisfaction
or feelings of well being.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.460
That the stuff, the
sensual, the material never

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.770
really satisfied me.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.310
And so I started going
to meditation retreats,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.400
and practicing
daily, and getting

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.860
more disciplined about it.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:35.340
And moving beyond the simple
breath awareness, kind

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.170
of ignoring my mind practice,
and was instructed in actually

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.470
expand to your whole body.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.820
And expand to the
emotions, and feel them,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.390
and start watching your mind
rather than always ignoring it.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.170
Being mindful of all of
the experience of being,

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.520
rather than just using the
breath as a stable object

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.050
that allows us to
avoid the thoughts.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.580
Although in the
beginning, that's

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.850
very important as all
of you meditators know.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.880
But the instructions expand.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.850
And not only the
mindfulness practice,

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.700
but also the heart practices,
the compassion practice.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:22.820
And forgiveness meditation was
a huge important foundation

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.320
for me.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.930
I had so much self-hatred
and so many resentments.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.770
And so training my
mind, and forgiveness

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.810
phrases, and compassion
phrases, and loving kindness,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.750
and equanimity.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.140
All of these
different meditation

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.120
techniques that I
was introduced to.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.880
Mindfulness being core for sure.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.280
But the emotional
intelligence as well.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.930
And not just the wisdom, not
just the mindfulness wisdom.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.700
So I go very serious
about meditation.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.200
And then it just made
sense to me a few years

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.790
into my own meditation
practice to start

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.110
going back in to
the juvenile hall

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.760
where I had been locked up.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.530
And really out of the gratitude
of, oh, this really worked.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.180
My life not only externally,
but really internally,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.440
my life changed so drastically.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.240
I felt so grateful.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.080
I finally came to a sense of
more sustainable, ongoing well

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.808
being.

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:29.870
Being comfortable
in my own skin.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.960
Being at ease, whether it
was pleasant or unpleasant.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.420
Mindfulness taught
me all of that.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.360
And it all went back to
that moment of willingness

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.150
in juvie that
started my practice.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.050
And so sometime
in the mid '90s, I

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.420
started going back into
the same juvenile hall.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.110
Actually, I'd imagine
that many of you

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.680
are familiar with the Wisdom
2.0 conferences, and Soren

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.780
Gordhamer who has
organized that.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.830
And Soren and I were friends.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:07.069
And we started the juvenile
hall meditation groups together.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.680
Started going into
Santa Cruz, and then we

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.760
are going into San Mateo
and teaching meditation

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.246
to the kids.

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:18.829
And I'd get in trouble
once in a while

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.690
because trying to relate to the
kids, I'd be like mindlessness.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.769
It's like you're
rolling a joint.

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:28.060
Like you're paying attention
and you're like taking out

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.660
the seeds and the stems.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.070
And I'd try to use these sort of
street analogies with the kids.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.096
And sometimes the guards would
be not so happy about that.

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:37.704 --> 00:17:38.870
But the kids totally got it.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.453
They're like, yeah,
I know what that's

00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:42.140
like when I'm really
paying attention

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.087
and I'm trying to get
the seeds and the stems.

00:17:44.087 --> 00:17:45.670
And I'm trying not
to break the paper.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.630
And that's the only time
I'm really paying attention.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.070
So yeah, do that to your breath.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.278
Pay attention to your breath.

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:56.440
It was a pretty wonderful
experience actually going back

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.080
into that same juvie, and
kind of full circle for me.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.930
And then a few
years later, when I

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.860
was going to grad
school in San Francisco,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.147
some of the guys that were
in graduate school with me

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:12.980
knew that I was doing
the meditation groups.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.960
And they said hey,
let's start a nonprofit

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.310
and let's do this more.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.660
Let's do more meditation groups.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.600
Let's expand it to San
Francisco and Marin and Oakland.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.550
And we got a grant
from Thich Nhat Hanh

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:30.320
that helped us start the
Oakland meditation groups

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.890
in the Oakland Alameda juvie.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.030
So as an, I know,
long introduction,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.180
but it's so wonderful for me.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.910
Because then I became
a psychotherapist

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.920
and I began being a full
time meditation teacher,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.060
and writing books about
it and all of that.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.880
And I turned MBA over to
the people that were still

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.830
going in, and I went on and
opened a meditation center

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.590
in New York and San
Francisco and Los Angeles.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:03.840
And went this other direction
then in doing the juvie work.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.950
But always was a little
bit of connection to it

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.430
and staying in
board of advisors.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.490
And then last year,
of really seeing

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.070
that the organization
was struggling, really

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.600
struggling financially,
of saying, how can I help?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.340
How can I help raise some money?

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.810
I want this work to continue.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.990
Make sure that kids in juvie
get introduced to mindfulness.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.200
So it's such a joy to
be here on their behalf.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.670
And now let me try to shift
a little bit into the topic

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.680
of everyday well being.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.740
I mean, I guess the simplest
way to talk about it,

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.470
and it's a big shift
for most of us ,

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.380
is to come through mindfulness,
through present time,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.119
nonjudgmental,
investigative awareness.

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.660
Which would be one
of the ways that I

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.930
would define mindfulness.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.230
Present time, no
judgment of what's

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.270
happening in the present.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.790
Some level of investigation.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.623
I think that there can
be a confusion often.

00:20:03.623 --> 00:20:06.580
We say mindfulness, and we say,
well, let's ignore our minds.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.862
And then we think, people think,
oh, I can't use my mind then

00:20:09.862 --> 00:20:11.820
to investigate what's
happening in the present,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.090
because that's thinking, right?

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.510
But actually, there's a
quality of mindfulness

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.860
that is reflecting on what's
happening here and now.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.440
Of investigating and looking
deeply, and even thinking

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.930
about what's going on,
what is this emotion,

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.130
what is this sensation,
what is this thought?

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.670
Of an inquiry and
an investigation.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.420
The appropriate use of
thought in meditation.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.020
Not just always ignoring
our minds forever,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.540
but using them, training them.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.800
Maybe even turning
the mind into an ally.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.267
The wisdom that gets
developed and uncovered

00:20:45.267 --> 00:20:46.100
through mindfulness.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.800
And I feel like
what I wanted to say

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.360
about that was that through
this experience, beginning

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.100
to understand directly and
deeply that our happiness,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.450
or unhappiness, our well
being, just like me sitting

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.260
in that juvenile hall
cell, it doesn't really

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.050
depend on what's going on.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.830
Now whether it's a really
difficult experience that's

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.390
happening.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.890
Or I've also had the experience
when my first book came out

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.570
and it was on the
best sellers list.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.340
And that was like so exciting.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.300
I wrote a book and it's
on the best sellers list.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.354
But I was in this relationship
that wasn't going very well.

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:35.770
And just seeing
this sort of like,

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.500
I'm supposed to be really happy.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.700
I'm kind of miserable.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.310
I'm kind of not-- I'm
not getting my way.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.000
Things aren't going
as well as I thought.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.770
Or just that disappointment.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.750
I thought I'd be happy.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.010
I thought that success and
sobriety would be the solution.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:02.052
And then always having to come
back to the inner well being.

00:22:02.052 --> 00:22:03.760
And that it's not
about what's happening,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.770
whether it's pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.530
But that it's how
am I, how are we

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.890
relating to what's happening?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:20.190
Whether it's really difficult,
or it's really wonderful,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.560
really good, really pleasant.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.710
Kind of a big example
of that-- and maybe, I'd

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.270
imagine some of you have
had that experience--

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.690
I was meeting with a music
producer a few months ago who

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.000
wanted to learn to mindfulness.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.490
And asked me to talk to him.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.140
And we were talking about
his first platinum record.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.820
And he said it was like
the worst day of my life.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.750
He was like, I thought it would
be the best day of my life,

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.615
but for some reason, it was
just crushing that it happened,

00:22:57.615 --> 00:22:59.790
and it happened
early in my career.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:05.420
And I just feel like there's
nowhere but down from here.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.870
The bar has been
raised, and just

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.765
what his mind did
about his success.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.890
He went on to ask me a question.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.431
He has about half
a billion dollars,

00:23:16.431 --> 00:23:18.930
or something like that, and we
went on to ask me a question.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.250
He said, some of my
friends are really rich.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.190
Some of my friends
are billionaires.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.060
And I only have half a billion,
so I'm not-- compared to them,

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.010
I'm not that rich.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.830
And he said, and none
of them are happy.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.000
He said, I have
all these friends

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.083
and they're billionaires,
and we go on the yachts,

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.410
and we go and do this stuff.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.930
And none of them are happy.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.130
And he was somebody who
had realized that earlier,

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.700
that the money wasn't going
to work for his happiness

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.964
and turned towards
meditation practice.

00:23:48.964 --> 00:23:51.380
And was saying, yes, I do that,
and I make all this money,

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.490
and I do music, and
it's my passion.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.630
And I know that I have to
take inner responsibility

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.780
for my well being, and
not the next success.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:05.040
And not the next platinum
or whatever record.

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:12.810
And that's the core, right?

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.380
That's the simple
and core teaching,

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.930
which is that our well
being isn't about what's

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.400
happening outside.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.870
It's about how are we inside?

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.180
Have we developed
the compassion,

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.120
the care for our own pain,
for our own difficulties,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.750
for the stresses that
we inevitably will face?

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:39.030
And have we developed the
non-attached appreciation?

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.820
Knowing mindfulness so quickly
shows us, oh, everything's

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.550
impermanent.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.230
Everything's
constantly changing.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.720
But I want the
good stuff to stay.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.120
The clinging, the attachment.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.300
I want everything that's
pleasant, like don't go,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.435
don't be impermanent.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:56.720
How dare you.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.380
If it's unpleasant, please,
yes, be impermanent.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.430
I'm happy to let
go of this pain.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.990
But the pleasure not so easy.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.380
The successes, the
heights, the good times,

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.067
not so easy to let go of.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:18.610
Now, I have a sense
that-- I'm a poker player.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:24.530
I like poker analogies, that
the deck is stacked against us

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.880
for happiness as human beings.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.430
That the survival instinct
that we're born with.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.230
Everyone, not just
really messed up

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.910
kids like me that become
drug addicts and criminals,

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:45.670
everyone, that we're born
into this body that clings all

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.260
by itself.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.320
That constantly
craves for pleasure.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.740
That we all have a mind
that's planning mind,

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.180
planning, planning,
comparing, judging, craving.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.620
That it's our survival instinct.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.900
That it's that reptilian part
of the brain from the millions

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.090
of years of evolution.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.510
Mindfulness is really
this radical tool

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.620
that not very many
people have, that

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.850
teaches us about
letting go and accepting

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.080
the impermanent nature, rather
than clinging and craving

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.590
and chasing the next fix.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.960
The next pleasure, the next
success, the next promotion,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.490
or whatever it is.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.400
Now, that having been
said, also mindfulness

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:40.770
gives us a way to say, oh, I
do want the promotion actually.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.350
I do want to be successful.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.770
I want to be healthy,
maybe wealthy.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.310
I do want all of that stuff.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.990
And how can I pursue my goals
without suffering about it

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.650
too much?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.890
How do I work for satisfying
the healthy desires

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:04.160
that I have without the
stress and fear and suffering.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.540
Mindfulness teaches
us that directly.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.880
I think in the writeup, Bill
and I were going back and forth.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.990
He's like, it's
a little vanilla.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.450
Let's make it a
little bit edgier.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.370
Whether the shit hits
the fan, or what was it?

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.170
Whether you're feeling
you're kicking ass in life,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.230
or life is kicking your ass.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.410
And that with mindfulness,
sometimes life

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.330
does kick our ass.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.390
And can we maintain some
level of well being,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.860
even in the difficult times.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.780
And my experience with decades
of mindfulness practice

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.010
is that I'm fairly
successful most of the time,

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.037
even when it's really
difficult. And I

00:27:55.037 --> 00:27:56.120
do have some difficulties.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.070
And then when life
is really good,

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.790
and the inflation, the ego
wants to take it all personal,

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.610
that mindfulness says, oh,
this isn't so personal.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.920
Just pleasant attention.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.030
Don't believe
those ego thoughts.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.760
Don't believe the stories
that the mind wants

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.260
to make up about
oh, it's just going

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.130
to keep getting
better from here.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.130
Kind of staying grounded
in all things will pass.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.160
All things will change.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.820
So maybe, let's see what
kind of questions, dialogue.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.770
I'm happy to talk with you
about anything you'd like.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.580
Any questions about mindfulness,
other meditation techniques.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.580
Anything that I've said.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.940
Any questions about MBA.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.370
We're going to talk about
that a little bit at the end.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.230
But for your meditative
practice, for your mindfulness,

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.820
or compassion, or forgiveness.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.160
Whatever it is that you're
working on or getting

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.885
inspired to work on
in your own efforts.

00:29:03.885 --> 00:29:06.620
What kind of thoughts,
questions, or comments

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.816
do you have?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.660
Please.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.440
AUDIENCE: My name is Genevieve.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.370
Nice to meet you.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.202
NOAH LEVINE: Nice to meet you.

00:29:19.202 --> 00:29:24.490
AUDIENCE: My question is around
transpersonal experiences,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.440
like really elevated
experiences of consciousness.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.420
Did that play in your
meditative journey?

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.440
And where do sort
of place those?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.065
NOAH LEVINE: Both on
drugs and not on drugs.

00:29:37.065 --> 00:29:37.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:40.569
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if you can repeat that.

00:29:40.569 --> 00:29:42.860
NOAH LEVINE: Do I need to
repeat the-- the question was

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.120
about-- she said
transpersonal, elevated,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.190
expanded senses
of consciousness,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.570
and did those play
in my journey?

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.040
And maybe how important are
those experiences maybe?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.569
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:03.110
NOAH LEVINE: And I don't know
if that's really your question,

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.400
but that's the part that
I'm interested in answering.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.350
[LAUGHS] And I'll try to
answer the first part, which

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:14.520
is it seems like in
the meditative process,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.590
there are many different
ways that it happens.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:23.280
There are some people who have
these very big, expanded kind

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.420
of awakenings and insights.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:32.250
And it's kind of life
changing experiences

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.240
that happen through meditation.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.610
Really seeing some stuff
you didn't see before.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.520
And understanding your
mind in a way that's

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.570
the ego, the self,
whatever you would call it.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:45.310
Like there are some big,
transpersonal experiences

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.090
that happen for some people.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.590
And there are other
people that will

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.690
meditate every day
for decades and never

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.470
have any of those big,
bright light, bells

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.000
and whistles
meditative phenomena.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.210
And so there's a conversation
in the meditation circles

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.250
and community about the
spontaneous insights

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.420
or the gradual awakening
process that happens.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.540
Of becoming more and more
clear, more and more present.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.420
But it happens slowly, and
it's no big experiences.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.080
It's just, oh, I actually pay
attention more consistently.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.205
And I am compassionate
more consistently.

00:31:23.205 --> 00:31:25.689
And I'm forgiving more easily.

00:31:25.689 --> 00:31:26.730
And I've become generous.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.680
And it just sort of
happens very gradually,

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.867
rather than a big, expansive
experience that led to it.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.510
I tend to see my own
meditation practice

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.600
developing pretty gradually.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.250
For instance, I
would do some of what

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.850
I call heart practices, loving
kindness, or compassion.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.690
And for the first
couple of years

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.760
that I would do those
kind of practices,

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.270
I didn't even mean it at all.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.760
Like I would say to myself,
may I be happy, may I be kind.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.210
And my inner voice
was so unkind.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.500
It was just like,
this is bullshit.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.850
But I kept doing it anyways.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.670
I persevered.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.450
I had found in
mindfulness enough relief

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.847
that I wanted to really follow
a meditative path in my life,

00:32:16.847 --> 00:32:18.555
even though some of
those other practices

00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:21.880
just felt like, this is just
making me more agitated.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.450
This isn't making
me calm at all.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.960
This is just showing me
how angry and afraid I am.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.610
But then after a couple
of years of looking back,

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.530
and say, oh, I
actually mean it now.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.020
And after five years of oh, I
actually mean it and feel it.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.780
How did this happen?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.650
I'm not judging my own inner
meditation voice so much

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.090
anymore.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.000
10 years of just really
gradually looking back

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.085
how it worked slowly.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.740
And then I also have done
some really long meditation

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.530
retreats, like three month
silent meditation retreats.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.740
And on those-- and one
month, and three months,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.500
and lots of 10 day
meditation retreats.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.880
On those sometimes I
got so concentrated

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.000
that I had some of those
really weird expansive,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.810
might be what we
call transpersonal,

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.920
disillusion of everything.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.190
And pretty weird
meditative phenomena

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:28.360
can happen when you're
practicing all day, every day

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.980
for weeks or months on end.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.370
But my teachers were always
very-- a little bit dismissive

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.561
of that phenomenon.

00:33:37.561 --> 00:33:39.560
They were a little bit
like, oh yeah, that's OK.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.960
Yeah, dissolved into
rainbows, whatever.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.300
OK.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.480
They would really just be like,
can you pay attention to that?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.320
Can you note that?

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.080
Is it pleasant or unpleasant?

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.610
Are you clinging to it?

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.220
Rather than putting
much emphasis

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.990
on those big
meditation phenomenon,

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.111
just like, just phenomena.

00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:02.860
Pay attention to it
like you pay attention

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.240
to the breath or the
motions or the mind.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.949
You don't have to push it away,
but don't get attached to it.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.840
Don't think that that's
like the real thing.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.429
Just part of what happens.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.630
And a lot of people have
suffered a lot about--

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.989
and maybe even some of you.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.204
I know I've done it some.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:21.870
About like, you start
meditating and you

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:26.034
have a pleasant
experience back in 1974.

00:34:26.034 --> 00:34:27.406
It was like, that was so good.

00:34:27.406 --> 00:34:29.989
And then you spend the rest of
your meditation practice trying

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.290
to get back there.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.389
I want that one again.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.850
I felt good once,
and I want to do it.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.050
And then you kind of
suffer about trying

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.080
to create an experience,
rather than what

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.300
the core of mindfulness is,
which is accepting what is,

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.980
as it is, pleasant or
unpleasant, expanded

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.610
or contracted.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.150
One of my meditation teachers
likes to, over and over,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.250
say right now, it's like this.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.380
And that's the mantra.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.190
That's the-- whatever.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.770
It's like this, and it's
fun, or it's painful.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.720
It's like this.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.570
It's joy, it's
sorrow, it's boredom.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.880
It's like this.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.550
That radical
acceptance perspective.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.555
Was that close enough
to what you were--

00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:24.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.340
NOAH LEVINE: Thank you.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.900
I liked your comment
about speaking

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.500
the language of the people
that you're teaching to,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.830
that you're talking to.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.450
And how important that is.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.350
You know, I like
teaching with Bill

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.730
in this kind of environment.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.540
And we've done some
things together.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.380
Because he knows the
language of Google, and how--

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.910
and I could try to do
some computer analogy

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.070
that I would just botch.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.780
Like I just, I don't--
But it's important,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.310
and I think that Google has
actually been great at doing

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:05.409
that, and empowering people
from within to do the gPause.

00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:07.700
So that you're speaking to
each other in your language,

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.590
rather than bringing all
outside facilitators.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.810
And for the latter part,
I feel like actually, I'd

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.100
like maybe Micah to
speak to that question,

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.270
because he's like one of
the core facilitators who's

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.660
doing it now.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.560
And I feel like, actually,
if I went into the juvie now,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.200
I'd be a little bit out
of touch with the youth.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.600
When I was doing
it 15 years ago,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.040
I felt like I was
much more connected.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.780
But now I'd feel
a little bit less.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.730
I would do it, and I'd try.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.764
And there's a
universal language.

00:36:42.764 --> 00:36:44.180
But I'd be curious,
what would you

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:50.230
say to that, of kind of
the entry point of what's

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.600
working best, and
what techniques

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.180
are you using that are-- yeah.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.580
Micah's one of the core
instructors, and does a lot

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.510
of the classes around the bay.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.460
MICAH ANDERSON:
So, yeah, welcome.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.980
My name's Micah Anderson.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.100
I'm the senior meditation
instructor at MBA.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.900
We have the 10 to
12 module curriculum

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.360
that we use with the youth.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.750
The first kind of
foundational one

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.390
is introduction to mindfulness.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:27.370
So for example, the way we would
introduce that to the youth

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.200
would be through a game called
Still Chillin', which is,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.460
essentially it's a competition
to kind of see who can sit

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.850
still the longest.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:41.230
And generally, a class
would be 8 to 10 kids,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.070
somewhere around there.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.590
And slowly, we'll play like
five or six rounds sometimes.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:53.080
And slowly we'll start to
introduce some instruction

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.640
in the actual game.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.030
And it's a great way for them
to start to find just focus.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.760
Usually it's a visual, right?

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.220
They'll find a piece and they'll
just kind of sit and just

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.670
focus on it, right?

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.010
And then slowly people
will start laughing

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.230
and get knocked out.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.890
And there's always like last
man standing kind of thing.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:19.280
And then as the curriculum moves
forward, and a lot of times

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.850
we have a cohort model,
which we'll move through.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.630
And each module builds
on the next one.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.970
So we'll talk about
basic goodness.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.320
And then the next module would
go into impulse regulation,

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.920
just kind of unpacking how
mindfulness can support

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.890
impulses and reactivity.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.970
And the difference between
a reaction and a response.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.740
And then it really
starts to go deeper.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.920
We do start to go into things
like emotional intelligence

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.260
and awareness, and how we can
use that self moment to moment

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.360
presence to look at emotions.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.350
And then eventually look at some
difficult emotions and trauma.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:09.994
And will impact what
empathy is, and compassion,

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:14.410
and try and unearth
beliefs that the youth may

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.070
have about themselves,
whether negative or positive.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.881
And then trying to
address those if possible.

00:39:20.881 --> 00:39:22.380
So those would be
some of the areas.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.050
And we use loving
kindness meditations.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.840
We use a variety
of different types

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.320
of body-based meditations.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.370
Mindfulness of breath.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.020
Of course, the counting
one is very good.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.250
Because the youth, they're
dealing with things

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.150
like they can't fall
asleep at night.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.860
And they're stressed about
their court case in the morning.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:49.350
And they're separated from loved
ones and their communities.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.480
The majority of the
youth that we're

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.940
serving in San Mateo
as well as Alameda,

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.110
they're carrying a reasonable
amount of trauma and PTSD

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:05.530
that really is affecting
their ability to do a lot,

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.000
to do anything in a certain way.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.400
So does that kind of
help answer the question?

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.113
MICAH ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.110
NOAH LEVINE: So the
question was that part

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.870
of what will happen for
people in meditation

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.350
is that there will be different
levels of pleasant experiences

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:31.730
that Meng is pointing
to of joy will start

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.860
to arise in the meditation.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.810
Uplifting joy, he
was talking about.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.910
Or this kind of calming
happiness and gladness

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.720
that will happen.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.780
And then what's the
connection between that

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.932
and emotional pain?

00:40:48.932 --> 00:40:50.755
And I don't know that
I know the answer.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.020
I don't know that I know
the answers to that.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.700
I have directly
experienced a lot of really

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.990
pleasant meditative states.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.360
And what we call
the rapture states.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.185
And especially on
those long retreats

00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:08.630
when you get really
concentrated,

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.910
and all of the stuff
starts to go away,

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.119
and this joy and
happiness comes.

00:41:14.119 --> 00:41:15.910
And of course, it's
all impermanent, right?

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.000
It comes and it goes.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.615
It passes.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.060
I don't know the
answer to how it's

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.940
connected to emotional
pain, because I also

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.710
have had so much emotional
pain in my experience.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:33.120
And I think-- I tend to
think that emotional pain is

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.535
unavoidable for all
of us human beings.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.230
That it's just part of having
a mind , having a heart,

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.870
having emotions.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:48.510
That we have unpleasant,
afflictive, emotional pain.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.710
And some people have the
deep traumatic experience

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:57.390
that Micah was talking about
with many of the students

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.320
that we're working
with in the juvies.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.280
Maybe some of us.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.640
I know myself, I've had a
lot of traumatic experience

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.740
in my life, and a lot
of emotional pain.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.670
But I don't know how or if it
equates to the development.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:16.210
I tend to think of
the phenomena of joy,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:22.330
rapture, that that is a
universal outcome of training

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.620
the mind.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.230
That in a deep
meditative discipline,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.340
you get concentrated enough,
it's just what happens.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.615
Joy will arise.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:42.090
Gratitude, gladness, these
pleasure states will happen.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.880
And I would imagine
that whether or not

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.960
you've had a lot, kind of an
extra dosage of emotional pain,

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.100
or actually you've had
a life that hasn't had--

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.500
you've had the normal
human suffering [LAUGHS]

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.730
that we all have.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.700
But it hasn't been
extreme in any way.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.247
I'd imagine that there--
I feel like-- I don't

00:43:05.247 --> 00:43:07.580
know if it's true or not, but
I feel like those are just

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.857
sort of universal
qualities that happen

00:43:10.857 --> 00:43:13.190
as part of the phenomenon of
deep meditative discipline.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.982
Yeah.

00:43:17.982 --> 00:43:19.260
AUDIENCE: Can I [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.343
NOAH LEVINE: Yeah, please.

00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:21.940
And I'd be curious
what you-- I think

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.440
you have a thought
about that that I

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.380
haven't thought about yet.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.830
AUDIENCE: In your journey,
which very touching

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:33.320
journey of managing pain, your
emotional pain, at what point

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.690
did your ability to-- I'm
guessing at some point

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.590
you developed the
ability to access joy.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.730
And at what point
did that become

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:46.140
helpful as part of the journey
towards overcoming pain?

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.735
And if so, how so?

00:43:48.735 --> 00:43:50.360
NOAH LEVINE: It's
hard for me to answer

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.270
because, like I was saying
in that first question,

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.330
it happened so gradually for me.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.300
I can't point to, like oh, and
then there was this moment.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.960
But I do, reflecting
back, and say, oh,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.470
those first couple of
years I was doing the-- I

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.380
wanted the kindness
or the compassion

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.610
or the joy, the
appreciative joy,

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.810
but it wasn't really happening.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.830
I wasn't even able to,
in my own inner voice,

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.860
be sincere about what these
well wishing practices.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.620
But at a couple years,
started to shift.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.480
At five years into my
practice, I could see it really

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.560
starting to shift.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.880
I can remember about 10 years
into my meditation practice

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.240
where I had the experience
for the first time

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.220
in my life of
forgiving everyone.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.940
Up to that point,
I had resentments

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:45.010
that I was trying to let go
of, but hadn't let go of.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.080
I had made some progress,
progress, progress,

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:52.550
but there was still those couple
that we're just no, not yet.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.490
And then coming to this moment
about 10 years into meditation

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:58.970
practice where I'd forgiven
everyone, including myself.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.240
And I could think of even the
worst people in the world,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.440
I could think of them
with some compassion,

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.030
with some forgiveness.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.330
And seeing them as
suffering, confused beings.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.950
And that was joyous.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.300
And I can remember that.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.830
But I can also-- it was an
interesting experience for me,

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.230
because there was also a
delusion of permanence.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.460
I thought, I'm done.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.314
Forgiveness, did it.

00:45:29.314 --> 00:45:31.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.350
Totally done.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:38.690
And then I was a little
bit surprised the next day

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.530
when I was pissed off again.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.560
I thought I was done
with these resentments?

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.280
I thought I'd forgiven.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.300
And then see, oh,
even that forgiveness,

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.500
even that joyous experience
of liberation from hatred

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.760
was temporary.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.670
It was real, but it
was really impermanent

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.390
like every other mind
state or emotion.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.870
So for me, pretty gradual.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.010
Sometimes it's hard to tell,
also, inside ourselves.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:14.080
Other people might
be able to-- Micah

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.020
might be able-- me and Micah
have been friends for 25 years.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.580
He might be able to say, yeah,
around seven years he was less

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.296
of a jerk.

00:46:24.296 --> 00:46:25.420
He was happier or whatever.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.590
Sometimes the people outside
of us can say, you're happier.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.340
And inside, we're
not always totally

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.635
clear about when that happened.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.190
How do we navigate the balance
between generosity and kindness

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.710
and compassion and forgiveness
and healthy boundaries?

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:52.260
And when it's too
much, overtaxing on us,

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.230
or I think you ended with
then we're resentful.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:57.849
Like we've been too
forgiving, and we're not

00:46:57.849 --> 00:46:58.890
taking care of ourselves.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:05.460
Or too generous and not
taking care of ourselves.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.200
It's a wonderful question.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.010
It's a very important question.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.720
And like a lot of these
really deep and important

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.240
personal questions for us.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.200
Like there's absolutely a
line of what's too much.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.880
When are we being complacent
rather than active?

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.640
When are we becoming
a doormat, because I'm

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.360
being compassionate
toward your suffering

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.480
so I'm going to let
you be unkind to me.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.130
And I'm going to be
compassionate and forgiving.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.430
There's absolutely
a line of when

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.700
we need to actually
speak up for ourselves,

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:43.500
and say no, and have
a good boundary.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.630
But I don't know where that
line is for anybody else.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.130
Because it's for each one of us.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:54.270
It's our personal, where's
the balance here for me.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.250
And so it's a lot of what the
mindfulness practice and all

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.960
of this conversation is about
is developing that intuitive

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.456
knowing of what's too much.

00:48:05.456 --> 00:48:09.260
And I think we get there
from trial and error.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:15.330
I think the only way that we
found our balance, our middle,

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:19.200
is through giving too
much, giving not enough,

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.330
forgiving, having compassion
in a way that's attached.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.240
You know, that kind
of-- I had compassion.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.630
I expected you to change.

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.470
Not having the good boundaries.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.320
I think, my own experience is
that just the trial and error

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.780
of, oh, that didn't
work so well.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.590
Let me try something different.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.450
It's always this ongoing
experiment of finding balance.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.220
Thank you so much.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.170
I'm really happy to have
been here to share with you

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.390
and to represent for MBA.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.610
And so a few minutes
here at the end,

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.484
Bill and I think Roger are going
to have a few things to say.

00:48:57.484 --> 00:48:58.900
BILL DUANE: So
Some exciting news.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.280
So first of all,
thank you, Noah.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.610
BILL DUANE: So I have
some exciting, happy news.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.100
So one is that, as
you know, gPause

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.900
has given in nice
chunk of change

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.560
to help MBA with its programs.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.520
In addition, there
is the Google match.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.780
And Meng and I are
also going to have

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.790
another match on top of that.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.460
So if anybody would
like to go MBA project,

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.887
you can do the Google match.

00:49:27.887 --> 00:49:30.220
And then send me an email,
and then Meng and I will also

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.740
match it up to $5,000 total.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.270
So it's really nice opportunity.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.657
And I think doing
is really important.

00:49:37.657 --> 00:49:39.490
That's why more and
more of the gPause stuff

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.420
is about volunteering and
being in the community.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.270
So there's also a
really fun project

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:50.120
that we've just posted on gGive
for a six month design project

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.410
to help them increase their
online and social network

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.400
presence.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.650
So super fun there.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.765
So I'll send out an email
with this information.

00:49:59.765 --> 00:50:01.390
But it's the opportunity
to really take

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.930
some of the practices
and connection

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.870
that we were talking about
and sort of make it happen.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.624
So that's an opportunity.

00:50:08.624 --> 00:50:10.040
ROGER MILLER: So
I'm Roger Miller.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.880
I'm the executive director
of the Mind Body Awareness

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.379
Project.

00:50:12.379 --> 00:50:15.630
And just really want to
extend a lot of appreciation

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:19.000
and gratitude to Noah and
also Bill for hosting us here.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.430
And certainly also you,
Meng, for your support.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.870
And also just the general
Google and gPause community.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.470
You all have been
fantastic, whether or not

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.580
you know it or not.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.370
And we would love to get
more involved with Google.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:38.110
This is such an amazing
giving and growing community.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.400
We would love to
be more engaged.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.170
And we're really
working a lot on trying

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.100
to improve some of
the digital products

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.830
that we're pushing into
the juvenile halls.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.880
Some recordings of guided
meditations in the language

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.640
that the young people
speak to help them sleep

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.100
better, et cetera, at night.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.930
And then also bringing that out
into the community to the youth

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.720
as they're trying to
transition back into the world,

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.480
and leaving the
safe or not so safe

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.262
cocoon of the juvenile hall and
returning to their communities.

00:51:08.262 --> 00:51:10.720
We want to be with them with
some portable digital products

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.250
and app, and so
that's what we're

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:13.630
working on trying to develop.

00:51:16.344 --> 00:51:18.135
NOAH LEVINE: I put some
flyers in the back.

00:51:18.135 --> 00:51:20.520
I opened this drug and
alcohol treatment center

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.510
in Los Angeles, a
residential, that's

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.430
using meditation as the core
treatment for addiction.

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.025
So if you or anybody you know
might be interested in that--

00:51:28.025 --> 00:51:28.900
BILL DUANE: A friend.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.233
NOAH LEVINE: --there are flyers.

00:51:30.233 --> 00:51:31.580
You or "a friend," yes.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.915
I put some flyers back there.

00:51:32.915 --> 00:51:35.290
If you have any questions
about it, happy to talk to you.

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:37.490
BILL DUANE: There's some
MBA schwag back there.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.370
Oh, and if you do
donate, there's

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.600
a thing on gGive where
you can say, please share

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.090
my information with the group.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.247
If you do that, they will send
you nice things, like prizes.

00:51:46.247 --> 00:51:47.830
ROGER MILLER: T-shirts,
water bottles.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.871
BILL DUANE: T-shirts,
schwag, We all love schwag,

00:51:49.871 --> 00:51:51.405
stuff like that.

00:51:51.405 --> 00:51:52.280
So reminder for that.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.400
And I suppose, also
be on the lookout

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.340
for Still Chillin'
gPause sessions.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.302
Sounds pretty good.

00:51:57.302 --> 00:51:59.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.940
Cool.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.050
Thank you all very much.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.800
[APPLAUSE]
