00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.160
Hey, a jad here. It's been an incredible, incredible, hmm.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.940
[inaudible] hey jad here. This has been,

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.500
it's been an amazing year here at radio lab. You guys, ah, guys,

4
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.980
what am I like the buddy. Okay. Hey Jad here.

5
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:19.210
It's been an incredible year at radio lab. You guys have made it a special year.

6
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:23.110
You've shared and supported the work of these. I'm just reading.

7
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.650
I don't even know what these words mean anymore. Hey, Jen.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.970
Jen. Yeah. Okay. Their button. You can, can you man, can you do this?

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.720
Okay. [inaudible] I mean, that's, can you, can you,

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.190
can you say something that makes the case? I'm just,

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.430
it's not happening right now for me.

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.350
<v 1>I thought you'd never ask.</v>

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.590
<v 0>Good. Can I squeeze and squeeze in here? But yeah. All right. Yeah. Good. Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.360
I'll just, I'll be here.

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.840
<v 1>Hey, I'm Dylan Keith. I'm the director of sound design for radio lab.</v>

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.470
Usually on the other side of the glass. Uh, I just want to take a minute and,

17
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.710
uh,

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.700
play a few clips that are examples of the incredible work that the producers and

19
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.160
reporters here at Radiolab have done over the last year or so.

20
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.460
Hopefully to remind you of why we think that this show is worth your support.

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.090
Uh, 2017 has been a hell of a year for,

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.670
for everyone that I know actually just nuts.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.740
And at radio lab we've expanded in all kinds of different ways and we've done

24
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:26.570
our best to go after stories that are deeper and newer and even out of our

25
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.404
comfort zone.

26
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.940
So the first clip I want to play for you is from a story about a man named

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.980
Oliver sipple who saved President Ford's life back in the 70s and then became

28
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:39.710
sort of a tragic footnote in American history.

29
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.210
And when you're trying to do a radio story about somebody who died a long time

30
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:48.530
ago, um, if you can't find that essential tape of that person,

31
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.030
sometimes it kills the story completely because we need that person to be

32
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:54.380
present in the narrative.

33
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.370
And you want to build the rest of the story around that specific tape.

34
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
And we found this incredible tape of Oliver that most people had never heard

35
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.230
before. Uh, there was just incredibly moving and we dug it.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.970
It took forever to dig this tape up. And um,

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400
and then we built the whole piece around it and it was just, uh,

38
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.220
it was just a beautiful experience. So here's part of that. Well,

39
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.200
I think you all know this is all ever simple.

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.890
We shaped the president's side as a prepared statement on a subject that's

41
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.970
appeared in the press today. In the past few days,

42
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.510
I have been asked many questions having to do with my sex show

43
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.310
<v 2>preference as to what I have been asked, whether or not I am gay or homosexual.</v>

44
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.220
This is, there is, this is my reply to the line in question.

45
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.380
The first reason

46
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.000
you are interested in my,

47
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
in me is the fact the woman who tried to shoot the president,

48
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.150
she, I'm sorry, I'm still nervous. Excuse me.

49
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.220
My orientation has nothing at all to do with saving the president's life.

50
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.850
I'm first and foremost a human being who enjoys and respects life.

51
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.730
I feel that a physician person toward worth is determined by how he or she

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.150
responds to the world in which they live,

53
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.430
not on how or what or with whom a private life is share.

54
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 1>So the next story I want to play is just, um, you know,</v>

55
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:33.550
one that because I'm a cold work head, um,

56
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.200
just gave me chills from the moment we started reporting it when I was thinking

57
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:39.420
about sound designing it and scoring it.

58
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.680
I put in the creepiest feelings that I had from my childhood. Uh,

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.030
and it's about the history of the chain of command, which still exist today, uh,

60
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.710
regarding who has the power to start a nuclear war. And actually for this one,

61
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.470
I'll play the sort of movie trailer version that, uh,

62
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:58.530
I love to make for these episodes on the next radio lab.

63
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.560
I assumed that there had to be some sort of check and balance so that one man

64
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.670
couldn't just order the launch, a nuclear weapon,

65
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.940
<v 3>the fate of humanity to not rest on one person.</v>

66
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.570
He could launch the kind of a devastating attack. The world's never seen.

67
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.960
He doesn't have to check with anybody. He doesn't have to call the congress,

68
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.340
he doesn't have to check with the court.

69
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.820
He has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in.

70
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.730
<v 1>That's in the next radio lab.</v>

71
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.790
So this last one I want to play for you really quickly involved earthquakes and

72
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.600
babies and plane rides. A truck load of translators,

73
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.810
a marketplace that connected Ukrainian eggs with Israeli sperm.

74
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.950
It was just bananas.

75
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:46.250
Here it is on the next radio lab we have nine nine babies.

76
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.210
We need the increasingly complicated business of making a family,

77
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:53.350
two guys and three women, four countries, planes,

78
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.370
planes to wait Japanese to have thousands of dollars and the women behind it,

79
00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:03.050
all the women up there in charge of deciding how they want their life to be and

80
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.480
we don't have to look at them with pity.

81
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.110
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

82
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.090
<v 1>If you have valued reporting from the radio lab crew in 2017 I'm asking you to</v>

83
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:20.091
make an end of year tax deductible donation now to support our work for the next

84
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:21.474
12 months.

85
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.840
Your year end donation of just $60 combined with the support of other listeners

86
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.670
will really help us plan for the year to come. Go to

What do you think, Jed? Is that all right? Yeah.

92
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.840
I'll tell you I feel I feel Boyd with energy. Suddenly. Look man,

102
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.210
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, I'm kind of getting used to the mic here. Wait a second. Cut.</v>

103
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.080
Happy New Year everyone and thanks for supporting radio lab.

104
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.470
We really couldn't do this without the listeners who give take care.

105
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.330
Oh wait, you're listening. Okay.

106
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.280
<v 5>No. [inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.770
<v 0>you are listening to radio lab radio from w n y.</v>

108
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.080
S. E. Yup. Okay. Ready?

109
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:00.110
Three two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abu Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.

110
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.880
This is radio lab and this is part two of our attempt to answer some listener

111
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:09.230
questions that have piled up over the years gathering digital dust in our inbox

112
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.830
and a few of them in this round come from kind of close to home. Yeah.

113
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.760
In any case,

114
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.650
starting us off this round is a question asker who has developed quite a

115
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:22.910
reputation here at radio lab. The other moveable Scott Little,

116
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.590
<v 6>I'm just a normal dude, man.</v>

117
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.540
<v 0>Scott spoke to our producer, lots of Nasr.</v>

118
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.410
<v 7>Now, Scott, he actually sent us a lot of questions that caught our attention.</v>

119
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.170
Yeah, they don't, they don't stop. I can't slow this brain down.

120
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.500
Questions like [inaudible]

121
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.430
<v 6>truly do not even remember like writing.</v>

122
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.310
<v 7>Why is the moon devoid of all colors?</v>

123
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.660
<v 6>But when I read them I was like, oh yeah, that sounds like me.</v>

124
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.190
<v 7>Have we seriously not translated any animal languages yet?</v>

125
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.820
<v 6>Is there a reason coconuts look a lot like shoe pansy heads or is that just a</v>

126
00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:51.654
coincidence?

127
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.970
<v 7>But then we zeroed in on one of Scott's questions that at first seem kind of</v>

128
00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:59.640
simple but it got really big.

129
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.990
<v 6>Okay. When a spacial goes into space,</v>

130
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.660
how do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellite?

131
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.520
Is it just radar or is there some kind of complicated system that tracks all of

132
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:13.840
them? And since we talked, just kind of looking up about this, you know,

133
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.860
about like how many satellites are actually up there and what are we even

134
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:22.600
calling space junk and, and has this affected anything yet?

135
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.340
Um, you know, it's just like,

136
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.370
it goes from like kind of informational to like almost like this sort of doom

137
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:32.680
and gloom real fast. Like there's so much junk up there,

138
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.330
like it's going to be impossible to leave the earth's atmosphere pretty soon.

139
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.630
And I don't know, I just, it just kind of me curious.

140
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.400
I'd be curious to see what, what's um, who's, who's in charge of all this?

141
00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:47.100
That's what I want to know. Who's in charge here? Who's in charge of space.

142
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.470
<v 7>Okay. Is everybody there? Yeah, I'm here.</v>

143
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.980
I've got Colonel Walsh and she's willing to talk to you about space

144
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.250
surveillance. Okay, great. Ma'Am. You still hear us? Yes,

145
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.990
<v 6>I'm here</v>

146
00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.280
<v 7>so I couldn't actually find anyone who is literally in charge of space,</v>

147
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.220
but I did find what I think is pretty much the next best thing.

148
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.560
<v 6>Oh, Lieutenant Colonel Mia Walsh and I'm the commander of the 18th Space Control</v>

149
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:08.140
Squadron.

150
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.830
<v 7>I think your title has gotta be the coolest title of anyone I've ever</v>

151
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:12.440
interviewed.

152
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.430
<v 6>My title is the coolest title. The commander of the 18th Space Control Squadron.</v>

153
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.290
<v 7>Yeah, that's like the, you should, you should have like an action figure.</v>

154
00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:23.610
I think that would be amazing. Really very tiny actions.

155
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.050
Okay, so, so let's start from the top. When a space shawl goes into space,

156
00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:31.000
how do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellites?

157
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.080
<v 6>Well, we keep track of what's called the space catalog,</v>

158
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.250
<v 7>which is like a giant log book of all the manmade stuff surrounding us in outer</v>

159
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:38.810
space.

160
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.760
<v 6>A little over 23,000 objects.</v>

161
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.610
<v 7>Oh Wow.</v>

162
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.270
<v 6>So when whenever there's a launch, anything manned or unmanned,</v>

163
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.200
we'll track it against the existing things in the catalog and we'll make sure

164
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.090
that it doesn't hit anything on the way up

165
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.520
<v 7>or make sure it doesn't hit anything while it's up there.</v>

166
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:57.840
And then if there is a chance of an actual collision, they send out an alert.

167
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.350
<v 6>The notifications we create are called conjunction data messages [inaudible].</v>

168
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.690
So we send several thousand of those every day.

169
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.433
<v 7>Why?</v>

170
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.680
<v 6>Well thousand. We have a, a more refined,</v>

171
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.710
what we call emergency criteria and we issue between six and 10 of those per

172
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:15.260
day.

173
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.500
<v 7>What? That's like a, that's a lot.</v>

174
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.340
<v 6>It seems high. But when you consider we're tracking 23,000 objects,</v>

175
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.680
if it's not too bad,

176
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.480
<v 7>but on top of those 23,000 objects, it turns out there's,</v>

177
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.520
there's even more stuff out there.

178
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.550
But she says it's basically just too small to be able to track.

179
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.950
<v 6>We think that they're probably more like a half a million close to a half a</v>

180
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.730
million on [inaudible].

181
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.360
<v 7>Why, what, what? So you have like almost none of them,</v>

182
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.160
<v 6>it sounds like that,</v>

183
00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:49.120
but just remember that some of those [inaudible] hundred thousand objects are

184
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.920
very, very tiny pieces of debris.

185
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.140
<v 7>So like give me a sense like how big, how small, what are we? Yeah,</v>

186
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:55.090
what are we talking about?

187
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.960
<v 6>There is small as, as sizes of um, flecks of paint.</v>

188
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.873
<v 7>Oh Man.</v>

189
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.720
So there's no way you can track like a half a million flecks of pain that feels

190
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:05.310
like, that feels like impossible.

191
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.740
<v 6>No. And actually if you Google space shuttle and Fleck of paint,</v>

192
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:12.760
you can see a pretty famous picture of this shuttle window that was hit by a

193
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.010
fleck of pain and the kind of damage that it can do. [inaudible]

194
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.260
<v 7>tell me what kind of damage you can do moving at that speed. What, what yeah,</v>

195
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.120
what, what would I see if I saw that picture?

196
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.680
<v 6>So it went through several layers of the shuttle window and they determined that</v>

197
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:28.980
it was from a flick of paint from just, you know, a tiny fleck.

198
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.880
<v 7>So you've got almost half a million pieces of this itty bitty space junk.</v>

199
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.350
And when it comes to that stuff,

200
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.200
<v 6>it's really just a matter of keeping our fingers crossed and monitoring the</v>

201
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:42.500
situation so that we can react to it if something happens.

202
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.920
<v 7>Okay. Well, so, so, so when I, when I called, um, this listener,</v>

203
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.240
he's like, he's a little bit um, paranoid. Uh,

204
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.190
and then the one interesting

205
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 6>thing I, I came from, this is this thing, I think it's called the,</v>

206
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.650
the Kessler Syndrome. I would, it is thing the castle Lelo effect.

207
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.890
That's what it is. So there's this,

208
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.440
NASA scientists got this thing named after him where he's like,

209
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.620
we might get to a point where we have so much stuff in space that like something

210
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.913
will collide with,

211
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.520
with like two satellites will collide and that collision will cause so much

212
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:22.690
debris that it will basically be like this giant thing where just like things

213
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:26.190
are just exploding around the earth for like years and years and years,

214
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.970
like some sort of willow guest plague of space, job

215
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.320
<v 7>swarmed with a locust plague of space junk and that it'll be impossible to leave</v>

216
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:40.210
the earth's atmosphere anytime soon. What would you say to Scott

217
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.500
<v 8>[inaudible] just a second. Yes, this is Steve. You know, we, we have,</v>

218
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.240
we have a job to, to track those objects,

219
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.970
but a question like that is,

220
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.090
is this kind of out of our realm of responsibility?

221
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.920
<v 7>Okay. Okay, no problem. Um, uh, well let, see, can I,</v>

222
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.500
and just let me ask you another question then. Tell me if you can't answer it,

223
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:08.420
that's fine too. Um, which is,

224
00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:11.960
he also brought up something called the Caslow effect. Do you know about that?

225
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.160
Or have you heard of that before?

226
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.400
<v 4>W</v>

227
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.050
<v 7>which is,</v>

228
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.310
which is the idea that there's a possibility that two satellites will collide

229
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:25.510
and then they'll create debris and then that'll make a domino effect and cause

230
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.420
all kinds of other collisions and then it'll be a,

231
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.760
a whole giant debris field.

232
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.540
<v 8>I'm sure we've heard of it. The Kepler effect.</v>

233
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.560
<v 7>Oh, Kessler, sorry about that. Yeah, we're very familiar with the concept. Yeah.</v>

234
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.080
And is that something you worry about or no?

235
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.390
<v 4>Hello? Hello?</v>

236
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:54.224
Hello.

237
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.310
<v 8>I guess it is a concern. Sure. But, um,</v>

238
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.080
I think the members of the squadron do such a great job tracking everything

239
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:07.300
that's up there that we would hope that that wouldn't happen.

240
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.870
<v 4>All right.</v>

241
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.630
<v 7>Not that not the answer I was hoping for. Yeah. We, me neither. I gotta admit I,</v>

242
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:20.940
I started this whole thing thinking that Scott's fear was like kind of crazy.

243
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:23.730
But then after that conversation I started, you know,

244
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.530
researching it for real and I online, I found this video of Kessler himself,

245
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.530
<v 9>the beginning of the space program, there was a general attitude.</v>

246
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.090
The space was a big sky,

247
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.660
but you could put anything in it that you wanted and not fill it up to the

248
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:37.920
problem that you quickly run it.

249
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.040
<v 7>He basically says exactly what, Scott,</v>

250
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.470
<v 9>you don't change the way we operate in space.</v>

251
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.060
All this results in an exponentially increasing amount of degree until all

252
00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:50.330
objects are reduced to a cloud of orbiting fragments that are capable of

253
00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:51.770
destroying any spacecraft

254
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.140
<v 10>tends to operate. You are within that cloud, which would mean no satellites,</v>

255
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.230
no weather satellites, no gps, no any other kinds of satellites.

256
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:03.950
And then in the future, if things go really badly,

257
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.713
<v 11>uh,</v>

258
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.330
<v 10>you know,</v>

259
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:11.330
we'd just be stuck here forever and ever on earth.

260
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.540
<v 12>Yeah. Our next question comes from this guy in Brooklyn and he is five, five,</v>

261
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:23.140
five, five, five, five, five, five, five. That would be five, five years old.

262
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.050
And I interviewed him. [inaudible] are you going to go in my kitchen?

263
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.460
Who are you TG? I name is cage and I'm your son. Okay.

264
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:34.360
Tell me your question.

265
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.820
My question is why is the earth called earth?

266
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.110
Why is the earth called earth? I don't know. Why do you have any guesses?

267
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.850
A of kiss came up with the name.

268
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.530
The earth came up with its own name, I think. Okay.

269
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.830
Should I found out and then tell you yes.

270
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.330
<v 13>My first stop was a guy named Peter. Yeah. This is Peter. Peter Barry.</v>

271
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.890
<v 6>I'm a isotope geochemist. I work at the University of Oxford.</v>

272
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.970
I'm a researcher here.

273
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.390
<v 13>Am I right that you have some kind of a loose affiliation with NASA or is that,</v>

274
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:11.980
is that not right?

275
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.760
<v 6>Very loose in the sense that, I mean, I do a little bit of planetary work.</v>

276
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:18.240
I've worked on some lunar samples in the past.

277
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.080
<v 13>But you've worked on lunar samples. Yeah.</v>

278
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.080
<v 6>So I've actually done some, some isotope work on lunar samples.</v>

279
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.530
<v 13>He's actually one of the few people on the planet who's held the moon in his</v>

280
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.460
hand. So here's my question. I think it's pretty simple,

281
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:31.930
but maybe there's a story there. I don't know.

282
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.960
The question comes from Taiji vme his dad.

283
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.330
Why is the earth called the earth?

284
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.060
<v 6>That's a really interesting question. The earth is actually, so this is, uh,</v>

285
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.080
and it's an old Saxon word derive from English.

286
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:50.190
Dramatic roots in German earth has said, ah,

287
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.810
Erda I believe if I say earth and in German, and of course all these,

288
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.960
all these words are originally derived from like a, a mother language,

289
00:16:57.961 --> 00:16:59.970
like an Indo European mother language.

290
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.260
But what it means in German and what it means in all those old languages is it

291
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.400
actually just means soil or ground.

292
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.130
<v 13>Oh Huh.</v>

293
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.190
<v 6>All the other planets, all the other visible planets have these really,</v>

294
00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:14.790
you know, awesome names and they're all named after Roman gods.

295
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.470
<v 13>I mean, you have mercury's,</v>

296
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.340
it moved really quickly around the sun.

297
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.480
So we got it name from the Roman Messenger. God. Then you have

298
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.430
Venus chose this bright, beautiful orb glowing in the sky.

299
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.720
So we named it after the goddess of love and of course, Mars,

300
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.670
which was fiery and red. And so we named it after the God of war.

301
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.100
<v 6>An earth is the only planet, which is it named after a Roman God.</v>

302
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.400
Clearly this much different,

303
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.560
<v 8>uh, uh, etymology.</v>

304
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.830
<v 0>Peter Ultimately referred me to another guy at Oxford.</v>

305
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.343
<v 8>I love it.</v>

306
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.340
<v 0>Assist. Hi, can I speak to Gabe please?</v>

307
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.290
<v 8>Hi, speaking. Yeah. Hi Dad,</v>

308
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.460
<v 0>this is Gabriel Berry.</v>

309
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.630
<v 8>I can tell you a bit about, um, who the protests in day Europeans probably were.</v>

310
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.130
Sure. Um,

311
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.580
<v 0>Kroto pro toe Indo Europeans. Yes. So, so,</v>

312
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.980
so basically what Gabriel Barry told me is that you could find,

313
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.900
you could trace all this whole thing,

314
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.650
the word or back to this group of people who lived

315
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.780
<v 8>maybe 6,000 days ago.</v>

316
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.330
<v 0>This is like way before JC, way before the Greeks or the Romans. Yep.</v>

317
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.650
<v 8>Criteo and a European lived in basically what's now eastern Europe.</v>

318
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.980
So these were really people from the steps of Russia.

319
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.740
<v 0>Don't know a lot about them. We know they moved around a lot. Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.020
<v 8>Well and nomadic people couldn't, for whatever reason, settle down.</v>

321
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.050
<v 0>But he says at some point, maybe about 5,000 years ago,</v>

322
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.570
<v 8>moved from the steps of eastern Europe and Russia and</v>

323
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.740
<v 14>swept into Europe.</v>

324
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.330
It seems they trove chariot and they came on horseback,

325
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.520
make huge wave, uh,

326
00:18:57.521 --> 00:19:01.900
unsettled ood away from Britain down to northern India.

327
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.640
<v 0>So imagine this, uh,</v>

328
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.830
this wave of people on horseback spreading all over Europe and into India and

329
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.000
speaking this language,

330
00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:14.390
they would ultimately branch out into English and German and French and Hindi

331
00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:17.450
and Portuguese and like 400 some odd languages

332
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.600
<v 8>they spread across Europe and across, down into India and Iran.</v>

333
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.560
<v 0>The thought is they started to slow down, settle down,</v>

334
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.570
<v 8>and that's when they became farmers.</v>

335
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.750
<v 0>And that's when they started spending a lot of time looking down at the dirt.</v>

336
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.450
<v 8>We have lots of words for farming,</v>

337
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:37.170
from protein to European words like plow farrow or, or, uh,

338
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.790
<v 0>or as in the word that would become earth.</v>

339
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.310
But at that early point it just meant dirt.

340
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.490
And presumably it just meant like this dirt,

341
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.000
this specific little piece of dirt right here.

342
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.430
And I'm plowing it somewhere along the way.

343
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.130
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

344
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.630
<v 0>that word or Herta</v>

345
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.060
<v 13>became the word for all dirt.</v>

346
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.490
<v 6>The whole ball of dirt. Basically,</v>

347
00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:15.491
the word that starts being used to ass becomes the same word is used for fam,

348
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.610
you know, Michelob and also, uh, quite often some sort of,

349
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.553
got it.

350
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.060
<v 13>We have no idea when that switch happened. Exactly.</v>

351
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.750
I mean, we know within a few thousand years,

352
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.750
but whenever it was, strikes me as a pretty important moment for us.

353
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:39.660
People can ask you some questions. Taiji.

354
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.530
When did you discover that Earth was a planet on it?

355
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.490
No. No, really. When did you discover, do you remember when you,

356
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.490
when you learned that the earth was a ball? When my last too.

357
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.810
You don't remember? Do you know?

358
00:20:55.811 --> 00:21:00.811
You don't say do they don't last at little nest according to change.

359
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.640
I mean, I don't know. This is what I could get out of him.

360
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.110
That moment for him happened at daycare at this place called Little Nest

361
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.210
Brooklyn.

362
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.520
<v 12>Yeah. Vanessa did it.</v>

363
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.300
<v 13>It was a day when his teacher, Vanessa had them do this little [inaudible]</v>

364
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.300
<v 12>the project. She said we were going to make up our own,</v>

365
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.230
are pushing our own. What?

366
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.390
Our own person or what does that mean?

367
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.570
That means learning about the earth and nature.

368
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.570
Earth with two eyes and some legs and some Martins.

369
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.160
<v 13>Oh, I see. I see.</v>

370
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.000
They were basically making these earth puppets and he says, after they did that,

371
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.090
I was sending on the rock. You were sitting on the rug.

372
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.890
Is that where you have your best ideas?

373
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.820
You were sitting on this a little rainbow colored rug that they have holding

374
00:21:47.821 --> 00:21:50.250
this earth puppet. I was thinking

375
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.700
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

376
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.540
<v 12>I was thinking of earth last round,</v>

377
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.770
smooth round. And it's a plan.

378
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.970
<v 13>By the time we get from the Prodo Indo Europeans to the ancient Greeks and</v>

379
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.800
Romans, which is a couple thousand years,

380
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.800
you begin to see the concept of earth arising up.

381
00:22:13.801 --> 00:22:16.950
It goes from a simple word that means dirt for soil,

382
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.043
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

383
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.560
<v 13>to mother earth, the goddess.</v>

384
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.590
So it went in the opposite direction of the other planets.

385
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.700
It started as this lowly dirty thing beneath our B

386
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.060
and then became divine

387
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.190
<v 11>[inaudible].</v>

388
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.740
<v 13>When I told th this answer, uh, he was disappointed.</v>

389
00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:45.370
He was actually hoping that the earth was named by an Alien Daddy.

390
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:48.010
Nothing. I asked to go to another question. Yeah, you got another one.

391
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.543
<v 11>Go ahead.</v>

392
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.560
<v 13>How has the son made you mean like how, how did the sun become the Sun</v>

393
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.920
<v 11>man? That's another good question.</v>

394
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.823
Yeah,

395
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.750
<v 13>I know. I was just repeating it so I can understand it.</v>

396
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.040
Are you asking me how it was on board?

397
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.793
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

398
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.620
<v 13>do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head?</v>

399
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.230
You do? What? What? What? What? How does he know that? I mean, yeah, of course.

400
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.340
Why is he special? Hey, sorry. I'm going to get licensed.

401
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.190
My Brain Ram BFF is best friends forever. What is BFO? That's the friends often.

402
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.030
Okay. Yup. Are you ready? Yup. Are you ready? I am all already.

403
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.670
You see what I'm doing? But are you doing just Dunkin donuts? Has It? Maybe? No,

404
00:23:43.671 --> 00:23:45.980
no, no. Like, like here in, they have people

405
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.060
<v 5>come in that I think somebody comes with a truck. What do you do with it? Wait,</v>

406
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.190
you have done it before? How did they do that?

407
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.510
I don't even understand that question.

408
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.130
<v 16>Yeah, she should tell Simon the, we're in here. Hey everybody,</v>

409
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:04.060
I'm gonna help you next up. Yes. Just to seeing your coffee. Black please. Hi.

410
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.470
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The Adler family

411
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.110
as in producer, Simon Adler and his dad, Tim. Yep. Uh,

412
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.180
so a couple of weeks back,

413
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.430
<v 5>I'm just heading out of town now. I asked my old man,</v>

414
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:22.910
my dad to record himself going on a drive.

415
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:28.210
All good road trips deserved a cup of coffee and being the frugal individually,

416
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.801
but I am.

417
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:35.801
I decided that I drive through it of McDonald's would be the appropriate place

418
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:37.730
to fuel up.

419
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.130
He and my mom lived in Northwestern Wisconsin in a small little city town called

420
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:48.110
Auclair. I'm going to drive country roads in specifically.

421
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:53.060
What I'd asked him to do was to go drive on the county highways just outside of

422
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:56.420
town, farm field areas.

423
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.840
There are very few cars on the road that I'm on.

424
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.000
And the reason I asked him to do this with,

425
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:06.530
because for as long as I can remember, he's had this nagging

426
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.060
<v 16>question, a question that he bombards me with every time</v>

427
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:11.993
<v 17>home</v>

428
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.420
<v 16>off times when we're talking on the phone, he'll bring it up. Can you hear me?</v>

429
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.540
Yeah. Over the dinner table. Over email. I mean,

430
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.620
I've heard about this at least 600 times. What does mom think about all this?

431
00:25:24.621 --> 00:25:25.454
I've never asked him.

432
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.150
<v 6>Oh, hi. Oh no, she just rolls her eyes.</v>

433
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.430
<v 16>Okay. Yeah.</v>

434
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.290
Yeah.

435
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.123
<v 6>So what's happening?</v>

436
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.450
<v 16>Yeah. So do you want me to tell you why, uh, why I'm recording?</v>

437
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.550
Or do you want me to just,

438
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.690
<v 6>I knew we would get to it so you can tell me now.</v>

439
00:25:42.691 --> 00:25:45.900
I thought maybe it was going to be like a puzzle that I had to figure out.

440
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.740
<v 16>Okay. Well let me, let me just prompt you with this and see it.</v>

441
00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:51.390
See how well you take the bait here.

442
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.520
Do you know the question I'm talking about and could you just tell me what that

443
00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:57.354
question is?

444
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.720
<v 6>The question is, well let me back up.</v>

445
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.460
And example is this,

446
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.080
a person will be riding a road bike down a lonely country road.

447
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.280
Two other people will be walking their dog on the side of the road and a semi

448
00:26:19.841 --> 00:26:24.760
trailer truck will then be coming down that road.

449
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.311
<v 16>Okay.</v>

450
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:29.120
So we've got three different actors here and nobody else from miles and miles

451
00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:29.940
and miles.

452
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.110
<v 6>And there is not, you haven't, the biker hasn't seen another car,</v>

453
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.740
truck or pedestrian four miles on this road.

454
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.650
But what will happen is all three of those actors will come together at the

455
00:26:46.661 --> 00:26:49.870
exact same point and the exact same time

456
00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.430
creating a dangerous situation first of all,

457
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.140
but then it's just this spark and then it diffuses and you could sit on that

458
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:05.340
stretch of road for six more years and not find that happen.

459
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.660
<v 18>And the key thing here, my dad says is he it Tim Adler, uh, witnesses,</v>

460
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.660
this sort of thing.

461
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.850
<v 6>Oh, it happens to me a lot all the time.</v>

462
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.990
I would say it happens once every two weeks

463
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.150
<v 5>upcoming. We have the possibility of an event</v>

464
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.810
<v 18>on the day I sent him to record himself. Uh, after 10 or 15 minutes,</v>

465
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.650
have not seen a single other car on the road, came around this bend,

466
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.670
<v 5>there's a manure wagon being driven by a tractor right down the road.</v>

467
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.230
And yes,

468
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:42.030
we hear here at all appens the manure wagon is going down the road.

469
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.540
A tractor has just been pulled out on the road and now I'm passing by and all

470
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:52.320
three happened at the exact same place.

471
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.800
It just happens.

472
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:59.480
<v 18>What is your question then? Is it? Why does that happen or is it,</v>

473
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.320
<v 6>the question is why does this happen to me and does it seem to happen to others</v>

474
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:10.483
as well?

475
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.210
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

476
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.190
<v 18>okay. I think it's quite complicated.</v>

477
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.830
I don't know if it does your father get the thing to get to the bottom of this?

478
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:24.650
We call it the man who we thought might just have the answer. I'm a professor.

479
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.970
I'm actually professors, Sir David Spiegelhalter.

480
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.450
Where did you say your professor, Sir? Does that mean you've been knighted?

481
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a knight. You're the,

482
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:37.400
you're the first night I've ever spoken to. I'm on it.

483
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.640
I nothing but Cambridge is stuffed full of, there's hundreds. There's three.

484
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:44.510
A penny round here. The probability of me talking to a, yeah,

485
00:28:44.511 --> 00:28:47.040
you got to get exactly right. Very hard at date. Yeah.

486
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.250
Professor Sir David is a statistician. We're pretty dull with him.

487
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.640
When I ran my old man's question by him, his response,

488
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.320
I get quite a lot of stories like this.

489
00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:58.280
People contact me and they get very anxious, in fact, because they feel it.

490
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.800
Something's going on in their lives that making things happen all the time.

491
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:04.880
They're getting signs from the environment around them. Okay. I mean,

492
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.860
the term is, it's noticed synchronicity,

493
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.890
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

494
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:09.723
<v 18>synchronicity,</v>

495
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.140
<v 19>you know, that all of these big Buddha faculties of the psyche,</v>

496
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.720
<v 18>that was the term that Carl Young invented for this.</v>

497
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.240
<v 19>The division's entirely confined to, to space and time.</v>

498
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.520
<v 18>Carl Gustaf Union, you know, the fame to psychoanalyst of the 20th century.</v>

499
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.210
<v 19>You can have dreams or visions of the future. Yeah.</v>

500
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.640
<v 18>The idea that there was actually some force behind nature that we didn't</v>

501
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.910
currently recognize that did drive these things to happen.

502
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.500
Something beyond the normal rules of physics, quotes,

503
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.850
rationality. Hmm. So he really believes that there was this external force.

504
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.380
I think he just wasn't a very good statistician because Sir David says,

505
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.660
when you start to look at the events in our lives,

506
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:54.520
in terms of their probability,

507
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.090
every single event that happened to us is unbelievably unlikely and

508
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:02.230
unpredictable. So the crucial thing that measures it sort of surprising,

509
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:07.231
this is the unlikeliness of it occurring at some point over a reasonable period

510
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.420
in just a, I don't know, I'm trying to make this as concrete as possible.

511
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:14.860
So good luck. So if you're driving down a street that has, I don't know,

512
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.100
three cars per 10 miles and two bikers per 10 miles,

513
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.680
like how likely is it that over the course of those 10 miles you're going to

514
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:25.310
intersect the way that he does,

515
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.220
the likelihood of that happening in any particular 10 miles or any particular

516
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.420
hour is very low. It's a surprising event. But if your father drives a lot,

517
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.630
the likelihood of it happening over, I don't know,

518
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:42.000
maybe a week or two weeks and your month is very high. So David says, uh,

519
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.913
think of it this way.

520
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.070
<v 20>So let's say my dad would consider one of these intersections to be a meaningful</v>

521
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:50.650
coincidence, a synchronous event.

522
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.440
If a semi truck in a biker pass him

523
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.700
within five seconds of each other. Now

524
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.390
<v 18>if in one hour of driving my dad sees 15 cars and five bikers,</v>

525
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.690
the map tells you that the likelihood of one of each,

526
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.060
<v 20>uh, both a car and a bike passing him in the same a five second window,</v>

527
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.940
it's about one in 7,000.

528
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.660
But think of how many of those five second windows there are in any given week

529
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.050
or month. Uh, in fact,

530
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:29.190
I think of each of these five second windows as like one spin of a roulette

531
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:30.674
wheel,

532
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:36.570
a giant roulette wheel with 7,000 different numbers that you could bet the ball

533
00:31:37.221 --> 00:31:40.510
would land on your badge. Now Ladies and gentlemen,

534
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.310
and this is key when my dad's driving,

535
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:48.370
it's not like he only gets one spin of the wheel or one chance to see one of

536
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:52.060
these synchronous events instead lays your bench, ladies and gentlemen,

537
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:55.010
it's like every five seconds he gets to try again.

538
00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.040
<v 18>And given that he drives like three hours a week, when you do the math,</v>

539
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:06.550
what you end up with is a 31% chance of him experiencing this in any given week.

540
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.280
Meaning, if he's looking for it,

541
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.510
he should definitely expect to see one of these at least once a month.

542
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.450
So you have to not look at just the event,

543
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.910
not just the particular thing your father observed.

544
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.360
You have to think of all the chances for those things to occur that didn't

545
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:26.960
occur. You know, you've got to think of all the stuff you're not seeing.

546
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.130
<v 16>Yeah, a pretty good.</v>

547
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:32.850
See that fish quite the fish is like his third cast and

548
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.670
I called my dad back to break the news to him. All right. You want the answer?

549
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.243
Yes.

550
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.460
<v 18>So a weaker explained it to him from the history of viewing to the fact that</v>

551
00:32:44.461 --> 00:32:47.940
he's really just got to pay attention to all the times these coincidences aren't

552
00:32:47.941 --> 00:32:50.790
happening. Right. And when you look at it from that angle,

553
00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.860
it's statistically to be expected

554
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.550
<v 16>there. I understand,</v>

555
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.700
I understand. It's a little hard to swallow.

556
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.180
I'm a little more human than most

557
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:06.390
<v 18>it is.</v>

558
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:10.310
<v 16>Does make sense from a statistical analysis.</v>

559
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.070
But why does it keep happening to me?

560
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.350
<v 18>So these things do happen to some people.</v>

561
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.510
And I've got a lot of admiration of these people because they, your fans,

562
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.900
obviously great man. You know, it does tend to happen to people who,

563
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.980
who are very sensitive and aware and they notice their environment.

564
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.530
They're actually very mindful people that happens to,

565
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.970
and I suppose what I'm saying is this is a really admirable, you know,

566
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.030
characteristic trait.

567
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.180
<v 16>Well,</v>

568
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.160
there is no question this makes my day when I've heard that I've been praised

569
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:37.994
by, I'm nice.

570
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.833
<v 18>Yeah.</v>

571
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.050
<v 16>Kelly, his highness that someday we should go out for a cup of tea.</v>

572
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.960
<v 18>Not to bring it down though. He heaped all this praise on you.</v>

573
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.890
I'd love to meet him and I'm sure he's wonderful, but then concluded by saying,

574
00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.820
but I would, I think I would say that he's not very special.

575
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:10.820
<v 16>I'll, I, you didn't really have to tell me that. Yeah, sorry.</v>

576
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.450
No, that's okay. That I'm going to just listen to the first part.

577
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.000
<v 4>Okay.</v>

578
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.990
<v 20>All right. Okay. Enjoy the rest of the day of the week. Thanks.</v>

579
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.700
I love you and I'll talk to [inaudible]. Tell Mama, give her a call. And, uh,

580
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.530
hopefully tomorrow morning. [inaudible] fine. Love you too. Okay, bye bye.

581
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.340
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

582
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.130

89.3 WPT in Green Bay.

584
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.853
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

585
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:10.110
[inaudible] I want to ask you one question. Alright,

586
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.320
excellent question. [inaudible] just relax. Can you w you are,

587
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.450
we're not in Kansas anymore.

588
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.860
[inaudible] where do I go?

589
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.380
You know, where you, how did you get any

590
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.230
[inaudible] [inaudible] stop.

591
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.840
<v 0>Okay. So mixed up.</v>

592
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.170
<v 6>Yeah. My name is Eben Becker.</v>

593
00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.250
<v 0>We're going to go to Boston with Evan Becker. And here's his question.</v>

594
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.830
<v 6>So I grew up in the Boston area. I still live in Boston today.</v>

595
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.780
Kind of relevant to this question is

596
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.440
<v 0>Evan, it turns out is something of a snowboarder. Yep.</v>

597
00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.970
<v 6>You know, I've been snowboarding for 20 plus years or so and friends and I, uh,</v>

598
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.960
traditionally go up to, uh, New Hampshire, Vermont, you know,

599
00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:21.250
New England area to go skiing

600
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.170
<v 0>and you know, a many years back on one of these group trips they took,</v>

601
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.050
<v 6>uh, we, we were feeding and um,</v>

602
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.200
they had recently opened a no tubing course

603
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.290
<v 0>[inaudible] and by the way, that tiny [inaudible],</v>

604
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.510
that's our producer Tracy Hunt [inaudible]

605
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.420
<v 6>and, uh,</v>

606
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.760
everybody's looking at the snow tube chorus and some would just pose the

607
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:41.850
question of like, how fast do you think that's been goes? Um,

608
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.100
and then another friend jumped in and said like,

609
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.490
I bet you I could get that up to like a hundred miles an hour easily from the

610
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:48.630
top of the mountain. And like,

611
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.720
no way that you couldn't even do that in perfect conditions.

612
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.640
<v 0>And from this small little disagreement,</v>

613
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.060
<v 6>the great debate began from there. And like, that was in 2004.</v>

614
00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.373
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

615
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.480
<v 6>Been going on for more than a decade.</v>

616
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.110
<v 0>And over these 10 years going back and forth and back and forth on this</v>

617
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:06.944
question.

618
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.630
Evan and his friends gradually focused in on the rules of this argument and

619
00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:14.900
eventually they came on this very specific wording.

620
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.020
<v 6>So the question is, um,</v>

621
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:22.110
in perfect conditions within the earth's atmosphere and not within a vacuum and

622
00:37:23.051 --> 00:37:28.051
you reach 100 miles per hour going down a mountain on an everyday snow too,

623
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.633
<v 0>like an inner tube,</v>

624
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.900
<v 6>the same thing that you get if you went to the local hardware store or something</v>

625
00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:36.740
like that. Nothing fancy, nothing overly engineered, things like that.

626
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.090
<v 0>And still to this day, some of Evan's friends are like, yeah,</v>

627
00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.000
we can break a hundred miles an hour. We can, but Evan,

628
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:44.650
<v 6>I just don't see that it can happen.</v>

629
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.530
<v 0>He says, no,</v>

630
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.780
<v 6>you can not do this,</v>

631
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.160
<v 0>but I think it can happen. I think it can happen.</v>

632
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.560
That is Destin Sandlin host

633
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.890
of an extremely popular youtube channel called, Hey, it's me, Destin,

634
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:01.080
welcome back to smarter every day. And this is important,

635
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.020
smarter every day cause he is very smart on his channel.

636
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:06.600
But Destin does is he proposes.

637
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:10.590
So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet.

638
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:14.430
Questions. Today's question is why questions a lot like Evans,

639
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:18.630
which he then proceeds to answer. I mean are do, she does GG the stunt cat.

640
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.370
I think that's in your also an actual rocket scientist. A little bit.

641
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.840
I've only, I've only said that one time. My mom corrected me very quickly.

642
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.030
She was like, no, I, I'm a, I'm what's called a flight test engineer.

643
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:37.000
So we, we test missiles and helicopters and stuff like that.

644
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.280
What can I say one thing before we start? Uh, sure.

645
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.080
I feel like before we jumped to the answering part of this conversation,

646
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:47.590
I want to appreciate the question. So I'm just,

647
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.840
I'm wondering is there some like physical,

648
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.320
are there some physical reasons why a hundred would be really hard to do in an

649
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:56.220
inner tube down a hill? Yes. So this is what I,

650
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.240
I thought about when I first heard the question.

651
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.790
So if you think about going down a hill,

652
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.070
there's two things that are slowing you down.

653
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.470
The first one is the friction with the snow.

654
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.780
And the second one is the air resistance,

655
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.170
which for Destin all boils down to something that he calls drag.

656
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.180
It's a one half times the density of the aims, the Coefficient of drag,

657
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.014
the cross sectional.

658
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.940
So this started as a really simple question in my mind and as I started gaming

659
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:25.420
out how to, how to do this without killing a person,

660
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.290
the more I thought about it, the more I realized it can get very,

661
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:33.670
very complicated. Yeah. I mean I can, I can show you all those equations,

662
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.310
but I can't work them out on the back of an envelope.

663
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.540
Mostly because math is hard still.

664
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:41.830
He did tell us that he could,

665
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:46.720
he was pretty confident that he could get this tube to go down more than a

666
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.330
hundred miles an hour down the hill. Yes. I'm saying that it can happen.

667
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.250
And Are we sure that somebody hasn't done this and posted like their GoPro video

668
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:55.084
on youtube,

669
00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.940
this world record or gravity powered snow slut. Whoa. What is that?

670
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.510
Whoa. What's the, what's the world record? She's passing me the phone. Um,

671
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.520
okay. So at this moment, Destin's wife, terra Sandlin,

672
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.090
she's in the studio cause she's with him on vacation in New York and she's been

673
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:17.140
looking at her iPhone at the Guinness World Records website,

674
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.030
gravity powered snow sled,

675
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.790
134 kilometers per hour. Wait, that's over a hundred.

676
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.530
That's 83 points. That's under 80 power.

677
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.980
He said, I'm over here questioning everything about what I believe.

678
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:35.440
I mean this is the moment for me.

679
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:40.000
A sled is meant for velocity a to be faster.

680
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.230
Oh Man. Miles an hour. We're too slow here. So,

681
00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:48.160
so here's the deal. I'm different than most people.

682
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.040
I'm not going to die in this foxhole if it's clear that I'm wrong.

683
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.950
If it's clear that I'm wrong, I'm going to retract. Okay?

684
00:40:56.951 --> 00:40:59.290
So here's where I would go with this. This is what I would do.

685
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.420
The real big thing that the tube causes a problem in my mind is all the friction

686
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.880
on the, on the mountain, right?

687
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.090
So I mean within the bounds of the question, because he,

688
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.700
he went to all these great links to define what we could do and what we

689
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.960
couldn't. He did not tell us what slope the mountain had to be on.

690
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.900
And so what we're going to do is we're going to go to the worst possible

691
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:24.730
mountain imaginable, which is straight down a cliff basically. Okay.

692
00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:28.720
Are we all on the party line? And so with the help of producer Tracy Hunt,

693
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.040
Evan and Destin Cajon, I heard Evan, can you hear me? Yeah,

694
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.290
we wanted Evan the question or do you hear or how Destiny's gonna work this

695
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.210
thing out. Good. We're all together

696
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.040
<v 8>right here what the answers are.</v>

697
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.910
<v 0>Yeah. So this is ultimately a question about terminal velocity, right?</v>

698
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.770
So in theory,

699
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.990
if we were to go straight down like out of an airplane,

700
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.580
we would go as fast as we could ever go because the only thing contributing to

701
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:59.870
the terminal velocity at that point would be drag no friction at all.

702
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.210
And so would you accept the answer?

703
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:05.630
If I'm able to go a hundred miles per hour straight down out of an airplane,

704
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:10.520
for example, would you say that it is possible? Maybe even if our,

705
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.840
you know, even our far hill is only one degree off of, you know,

706
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:17.390
straight down towards the earth, it still counts as the hill, right?

707
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.160
<v 21>Yeah, I guess so. You know?</v>

708
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:24.190
<v 8>Yeah. As long as it's going downhill in your fat miss fear. Yeah.</v>

709
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.200
<v 0>So I I want to call, uh, I've got a buddy named Paul here in Alabama.</v>

710
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.240
He owns a place called skydive, Alabama.

711
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.140
I go to church with him and see him all the time and uh, I think you'd be game.

712
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.560
<v 21>So is that, could you, could you Destin like uh, I don't know, like two way.</v>

713
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:40.670
Call him from your phone or something. Is that what you,

714
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.190
what you think you're going to try to do? Yeah.

715
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:47.340
<v 0>So Paul [inaudible]. So here we go. What's up man?</v>

716
00:42:47.341 --> 00:42:51.120
Are you ready for me to merge you all right, Paul, are you there?

717
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.010
<v 8>Yes sir.</v>

718
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.010
<v 0>Oh, oh. Hi Paul. Okay.</v>

719
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.080
<v 8>How's it going?</v>

720
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.400
<v 21>And we have Evan who had this, who had this crazy question about snow tubing.</v>

721
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.820
<v 0>So Paul, let me, let me kind of set the stage here. Okay.</v>

722
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.360
So Destin explains the whole inner tube thing and he tells his friend Paul like

723
00:43:08.361 --> 00:43:11.240
we want to know is if you can jump out of a plane, go streak down,

724
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.630
could you break the a hundred miles per hour barrier? Is that safe?

725
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.040
Can you do a test like that?

726
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.070
<v 8>Well, yeah, it's totally possible. I've done it.</v>

727
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.203
<v 0>Wait,</v>

728
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.213
<v 8>um,</v>

729
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.780
<v 0>you've done it with an inner tube.</v>

730
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.380
<v 8>Absolutely. And a rat. It's all full size, Huh?</v>

731
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:32.150
<v 0>What? Yeah. Plus is that on two different occasions,</v>

732
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.350
he and a bunch of friends jumped out of an airplane carrying an inflatable

733
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:40.340
flotation device, uh, in one hand. And they can, I had a watch,

734
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:44.180
a little computer that track their speed on the other. How fast did you go?

735
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.350
<v 8>Um, in both cases it was over 120.</v>

736
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.120
<v 21>Really? [inaudible] but yes,</v>

737
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.230
<v 8>it's 100% possible.</v>

738
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.430
<v 0>So that it doesn't count. It does, it does that it's the same.</v>

739
00:43:56.431 --> 00:44:00.960
It's as if it's as if he had a virtual mountain that he jumped off of the

740
00:44:00.961 --> 00:44:03.840
question specifically said on the mountain. Like,

741
00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:06.570
these guys have been arguing about this for a decade. Right.

742
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.130
And we're going to come back to them and be like, no, no,

743
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:10.760
just drop it out of an airplane. No, this cheating. No,

744
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.643
it doesn't resolve anything.

745
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.220
You can beat down a mountain and not touching them out. Sure. False.

746
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.060
That's where you go to law school. You went to stuff like that. Well,

747
00:44:18.061 --> 00:44:19.320
did you read the question?

748
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.940
I am now here by recusing myself from this whole affair. Do we have, we have,

749
00:44:23.941 --> 00:44:28.500
we have ceased to truly in good faith. Answer the question. What do you mean?

750
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.520
And furthermore,

751
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.820
we get the guy on the phone and we hood wink him into accepting a renegotiated,

752
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.200
uh, a contract here of the collections. No, that's, no, he got bullied. I am,

753
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.540
I would not be a party to this, but I, I know

754
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:12.893
<v 11>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

755
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.183
[inaudible]

756
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:33.420
how much you care.

757
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.400
<v 0>Tell us where we're going next. So the next one, uh,</v>

758
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:48.360
is from our producer and in QA. Oh, hello. Any, hello God.

759
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.440
What are we going to be talking about today? What is,

760
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.320
what question do you bring up?

761
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:55.151
<v 23>Oh, okay.</v>

762
00:45:55.151 --> 00:45:59.530
So this one is a little bit different because it didn't come in the form of a

763
00:45:59.531 --> 00:45:59.951
question.

764
00:45:59.951 --> 00:46:04.951
It came in the form of a very tantalizing email from a fellow named Ern Hendrix.

765
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.210
Henry. Yes, from Amsterdam. Good morning. Hi, is this Erin? Yes, it's me.

766
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.280
I need to basically said, hey, am urn.

767
00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:15.790
I'm an artist and I just want you all at Radiolab to know that me and my friend,

768
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:16.720
we are building an island.

769
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:21.970
Offsets are building an island of fat and I live in a fat. Yeah,

770
00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:26.350
I know like I was like of all the things to build an island note of why fat,

771
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.070
<v 8>I'm just fascinated by it. I just like thinking about it. Yeah.</v>

772
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.010
<v 23>Well what was like,</v>

773
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.920
what's the thing that made you start looking at fat in a curious way?

774
00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:34.813
What was the moment?

775
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.550
<v 8>Well, the real moment,</v>

776
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.080
the real moment was I sitting together with a friend of mine and Mike Thompson

777
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.900
and we are in a train and going to Amsterdam.

778
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.830
When we started talking about fat and that it was such a strange thing first and

779
00:46:47.831 --> 00:46:48.990
why was there so much of it?

780
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.630
<v 23>Were you eating fat or were you feeling fat or what? What? I mean,</v>

781
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.390
we're weird guys, right? We talk about things like this,

782
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:01.080
<v 8>probably eating fat like chips or fries or something.</v>

783
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:05.070
And then we started talking about how in the English newspapers they had been

784
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.280
this new stories about Ed Burks,

785
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.290
<v 23>these fat birds that are under the ground in the sewers of London,</v>

786
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:14.060
just like wreaking havoc. And there was one guy that what? Timeout

787
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.590
that Berg.

788
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.550
It's actually in the Oxford dictionary since 2015 it's like an actual word now.

789
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.940
Fatberg in iceberg. Yeah, in the sewers. The sewers. Wow.

790
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.630
What do those look like? Well, I mean like a sort of,

791
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.010
imagine an iceberg I guess,

792
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.670
but this one's floating on the water in the tunnels underground in London and is

793
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:36.070
made entirely of of fat. Yeah.

794
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:40.300
And a little while ago urn and his friend Mike actually got to go down into the

795
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:41.960
sewers to check out these fabrics. [inaudible]

796
00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.220
<v 8>it was an amazing experience.</v>

797
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.980
<v 23>They're sort of like waiting through it with these weight or hip waders on,</v>

798
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.440
pushing bits and pieces of fat aside.

799
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.560
<v 8>It's just this strange sort of trembling of gooey stuff inside of the sewer.</v>

800
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.130
<v 23>Wait, yeah, let me look it up. Wait, it's, you have, is that a picture of it?</v>

801
00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.140
Of a Fatberg? Yeah. Oh my God. Wow. Yeah, so,

802
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:07.070
so it's like this like clumpy lumpy mass of garbagey fat stuff.

803
00:48:07.071 --> 00:48:10.790
It's gray and Brown and it's sort of like filled with all this sewer stuff,

804
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.100
living it. Whoa.

805
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:14.470
<v 8>Fungus grows on it</v>

806
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.550
<v 23>and it just like completely blocks the old brick tunnels underground.</v>

807
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:21.220
So this is like, this is like based on the things people have eaten.

808
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:24.820
There's so much fat in people's Diet and the sewers. Yeah. It's just like,

809
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:27.610
it's like people throwing fat away, like taking bacon grease,

810
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.940
throwing it down the sink, cooking fat down the sink. What?

811
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.110
And in September of this year in London,

812
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:36.040
they found a Fatberg in the sewers that weighed as much as 11 double decker

813
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:40.510
buses. That's how much fat shut up. I know. It's crazy. In one place.

814
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.810
Yeah. And of course

815
00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:42.643
<v 4>course</v>

816
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.360
engineers at the Thames Water company in Britain say they've launched a sewer

817
00:48:47.361 --> 00:48:50.570
war against a giant fat Blob, clogging London's sewers.

818
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.010
The way it's described in the news.

819
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.180
That's always a monster fatty monsters ever be something positive.

820
00:48:56.181 --> 00:48:57.890
It needs to be monitored. It needs to be settled.

821
00:48:57.891 --> 00:49:00.920
Please call credit now familiar enemies. It has a bad rep,

822
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.820
<v 23>but I mean are and felt like maybe fat isn't a monster.</v>

823
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.630
Maybe it's just like this, this giant thing in the world that's,

824
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.580
that's trying to express itself.

825
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.140
<v 8>He be like wants to be seen. If he wants to be on the stage on some appreciation</v>

826
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.040
<v 23>fat, trying to have a voice and say like, listen to me, I'm here.</v>

827
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.530
Don't think I'm important. I am make up 20% of your body that Duh Dah, Dah,

828
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:27.270
Dah and celebrate fat does he is he was,

829
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.740
he is celebrating fat and so he said that, you know,

830
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.200
if as an artist you're trying to explore water,

831
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.820
you don't just drink it out of a glass.

832
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:38.640
<v 8>We swim in the ocean. You left you a ride your bicycle through a rain storm.</v>

833
00:49:38.641 --> 00:49:41.790
This is where you start to appreciate watering is in a different

834
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.111
<v 23>wait.</v>

835
00:49:42.111 --> 00:49:45.480
So he's trying to do the same kind of thing with that experience it and I'll be

836
00:49:45.481 --> 00:49:46.280
different ways

837
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.220
<v 8>to walk on it. We wanted to sort of make angels,</v>

838
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:53.400
<v 23>no angels. We're going to make tech angels. Um,</v>

839
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.270
<v 8>we just want to have this different relationship I guess.</v>

840
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.940
<v 23>And is that where he came up with the majestical idea of building a fat island?</v>

841
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.250
That's right. Did he make, did he actually make one? Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.390
He's making one right now.

843
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.470
He's got like this like spot off the wharf in Amsterdam and right there in the

844
00:50:09.471 --> 00:50:13.700
ocean water, he's building this little floating blob of fat

845
00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.080
<v 8>with matching federally and vendoring sets from a waste materials from the</v>

846
00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.650
butcher.

847
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:22.070
Sometimes you're just buying it and we're melting it and then pouring it onto

848
00:50:22.071 --> 00:50:23.510
the islands making a bigger and bigger.

849
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.450
<v 23>And right now it's like 15 feet across and it's just,</v>

850
00:50:26.451 --> 00:50:27.910
just like they're hanging out,

851
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.410
<v 8>bobbing up and down and side to side. And it sort of, you know, it's alive.</v>

852
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:35.620
It moves. It's, you know, it's always changing. So, um,

853
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:40.050
<v 24>we give ourselves a maybe another half year or a year and then it should be</v>

854
00:50:40.051 --> 00:50:40.480
finished.

855
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.200
<v 23>And could you, how actually, how big do you hope to get it?</v>

856
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:49.230
Can you think of like as big as a truck or a blue whale or you're going a blue

857
00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:51.544
whale?

858
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.660
<v 24>No, no. Oh my God. That would be amazing.</v>

859
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.980
<v 23>Of course,</v>

860
00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.950
<v 24>dreams are like that. My dream is that I wouldn't be able to see the end of it.</v>

861
00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.230
<v 23>Oh Wow. Really realistic I suppose.</v>

862
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.213
<v 24>I mean, um,</v>

863
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.450
the size of two or three trucks who'd be amazing already and then you have a

864
00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:11.440
real thing. I mean, probably be able to stand on it. That's the thing.

865
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:14.250
I would like to be able to stand on it. That will be pretty good then.

866
00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.810
Not then you can really safely call it an island somehow.

867
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.290
<v 23>Definitely. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

868
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.080
<v 24>Great. I know it's strange, but, um,</v>

869
00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:26.010
<v 8>what I noted, I love it. Yeah. I noted them when I'm there.</v>

870
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.240
I really love the little sort of thing that is there in the water.

871
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.900
<v 23>Do you have, if we were to use this as, as part of the show,</v>

872
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:38.750
I need you to give me some kind of, um,

873
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.910
question that I can try and answer about fat. And it sounds like you are,

874
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.790
are doing a lot of questioning.

875
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:48.270
<v 24>Well, I would really like to know when we're, like, I'm very, very,</v>

876
00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:51.560
very curious about the relationship between life and fence.

877
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.430
Was there first life or first set?

878
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:54.560
<v 23>Okay.</v>

879
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.150
<v 24>Or, or even when did set starts because we know when certain species of animals</v>

880
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:04.130
started and when the, we know more or less when the universe was created, right?

881
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:08.060
Yeah. When did that start? When was the first set? Okay.

882
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.980
This is something that I would love to know

883
00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:14.380
<v 23>when was the first five first. That's interesting. Yeah.</v>

884
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.690
And actually it turns out that the very,

885
00:52:16.691 --> 00:52:21.691
very first version of fat has been around for a pretty long time.

886
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.120
<v 8>As long as our soldiers and around before.</v>

887
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.620
<v 23>Wow. So is this like big bang we're talking or,</v>

888
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:34.070
<v 8>well, no, it would have been after that. After star formed and exploded,</v>

889
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.230
then you could start forming these.

890
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.470
<v 23>Okay. So this is aqueous geochemist Tom McCall,</v>

891
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.400
<v 8>I admit, I am in my pajamas.</v>

892
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:45.390
<v 23>Oh, that's so great. You got a hold of him during the Thanksgiving week. Um,</v>

893
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.570
so Tom told me that the earliest, earliest version of fat was

894
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.420
<v 8>a carbon hydrogen oxygen compound</v>

895
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:54.180
<v 23>called</v>

896
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.520
<v 8>Oh yes,</v>

897
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.480
<v 23>fatty acid. Yep. Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen.</v>

898
00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:01.650
So first you need hydrogen and hydrogen comes along with the big bang.

899
00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:05.010
So we get that really early. Um, then we have to wait for,

900
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.450
start a form, start to get old a started, die and explode.

901
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:14.430
And then you get carbon and oxygen and that carbon and oxygen along with the

902
00:53:14.431 --> 00:53:18.540
hydrogen is now like sort of swirling around in this interstellar space,

903
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.830
dust stuff. And when those three things come together,

904
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:26.010
they start to make these, these shapes.

905
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:31.460
<v 8>So we have like a chain of carbons linked together and each one of those carbon</v>

906
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.190
has a couple of hydrogen bonded to it.

907
00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.940
<v 23>So you've got a carbon hydrogen chain. And then</v>

908
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.960
<v 8>at one end is a, what's called the carboxyl group.</v>

909
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.270
<v 23>And that's like a little group at the top. This carbon,</v>

910
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:45.050
hydrogen and oxygen in it. Yeah.

911
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.520
So I like to think of it kind of like a flower.

912
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:51.510
Like the stem of the flower is hydrogen carbon or the petals of the flower

913
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.180
contain oxygen as well as carbon and hydrogen.

914
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.330
And there's fat in this little flower like shape long

915
00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.740
<v 25>before the earth existed, floating around in space.</v>

916
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.010
<v 23>So then the sun and the moon and the earth and the planets form and you've got</v>

917
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:15.450
our solar system and on the surface of the earth after it's cooled,

918
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.860
you've got fatty acid. Now we don't know exactly how they got there,

919
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:22.770
whether they formed on the earth itself or came from,

920
00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:24.440
<v 8>I don't have an immediate right</v>

921
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.060
<v 23>smacking into earth. Um,</v>

922
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:29.910
but the important thing is that fatty acids are there and there's also a lot of

923
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:30.744
water there.

924
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:35.490
And the water is important because the thing about these little fatty acids is

925
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:35.840
that

926
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.790
<v 8>has have the hydrophobic end to the molecule.</v>

927
00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.010
<v 23>So hide your phone phobic means like scared of water. So is it,</v>

928
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.230
it is a first like water. Okay. So our fatty acid flowers,

929
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.930
the oxygen end, the um, the flower end,

930
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.250
<v 8>that's the end that kind of likes water</v>

931
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.313
<v 23>in the stem end,</v>

932
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.600
<v 8>like your water.</v>

933
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.560
<v 23>And so if there's water, the stems are like cow, we need to get away from it.</v>

934
00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:02.190
And so all these flowers form this, you can imagine it like a,

935
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.250
a bouquet that is so full that it is a sphere.

936
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:08.970
So all the flowers are on the outside cause they love water and all the stems

937
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:11.040
are on the inside. They're hiding from the water. That's interesting.

938
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.170
So all the fat, the,

939
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:17.180
all the fat flowers join together because it allows the water hating parts to

940
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.940
hide. Yeah. And the watering loving parts to be on the surface. Yeah.

941
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.970
But this was all like long pre-life this is life is no idea what it is yet life

942
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:29.010
hasn't even thought about coming on the scene. Interesting.

943
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.300
But there is a theory, it's one of many theories out there,

944
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:37.500
but there's an idea that when these little fat flower bubbles form in this sort

945
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:39.860
of primordial sea, they're kind of taking

946
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.740
<v 8>the little sample, the fluid it around them. Then</v>

947
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:43.750
<v 23>inside with them,</v>

948
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:47.470
<v 8>so whatever your fluid, right, it's going to get trapped inside the,</v>

949
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.510
<v 23>so on the inside they've got some things,</v>

950
00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.280
some visitors from visitors and the theory goes that maybe one of the things

951
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:58.010
around in the sea that ended up getting pulled inside,

952
00:55:58.011 --> 00:56:03.011
one of those fat bubbles was a little floaty bit of genetic material like like a

953
00:56:03.021 --> 00:56:08.021
little bit of RNA and then for the first time ever instead of random bits of RNA

954
00:56:09.441 --> 00:56:13.580
floating around in a soupy sea you have a cell

955
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:16.900
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

956
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.950
<v 23>for the first time you have an inside, you have a,</v>

957
00:56:20.951 --> 00:56:23.760
you separate from the super round you,

958
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:28.190
<v 0>so the fat ball, these fatty little threesomes.</v>

959
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:32.660
If that floated in from outer space and Levy landed here and maybe look cool.

960
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:36.740
Where's the first container that made life possible? Right.

961
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:37.980
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

962
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.980
<v 18>I don't think there is any way really have anything like we call a living being</v>

963
00:56:43.651 --> 00:56:47.270
without having a membrane or something separated from this. Rounding

964
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.630
<v 23>fat is really important. Profoundly important.</v>

965
00:56:50.631 --> 00:56:54.130
That is is without fat there would be no us there. We'd be healthy.

966
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.780
<v 0>We we are, we are. We are built in houses a fet.</v>

967
00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:58.950
So that means when you get [inaudible]

968
00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:02.940
<v 23>your soap bar out in the shower, you should give it some respect is so fat.</v>

969
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.900
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It is bad, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. No traditional soap.

970
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.230
It's just fat. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Shit, I didn't know that.

971
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:14.190
And that's okay. You don't know everything can, I mean,

972
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.190
but I think I'm actually really excited for [inaudible] to hear this because I

973
00:57:17.191 --> 00:57:22.191
feel like I'm going what can convey the way that the beginning of life told him

974
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:27.320
that? No, I haven't. Can you hear me? Ooh, I wonder what he'll say. Alright.

975
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.550
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I called on and again,

976
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.590
and this time she was at a conference,

977
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.920
<v 8>well, my coats are covered in fat. Now I had to go to this conference.</v>

978
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:40.050
I didn't know what was coach Fetty. Okay. I found an old coat.

979
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.420
But you know, everything is covered in set.

980
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.350
We get how this is taking over my life and I just have to deal with it.

981
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:48.500
<v 23>Anyway. Um,</v>

982
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:54.050
so I wanted to tell you what my scientist told me about the earliest form of

983
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.660
fat. Can I tell you? Yes, please. Okay.

984
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.570
So I'm trying to think of a way to put this succinctly. Okay.

985
00:57:59.571 --> 00:58:01.430
So I told them everything I learned,

986
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:05.540
it makes a barrier barrier between us and the rest of the world.

987
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:08.510
It makes it makes us really, yeah. Yeah.

988
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.000
And it could be that these like these like early,

989
00:58:11.001 --> 00:58:15.860
early fatty acids are the thing that make life as we know it,

990
00:58:15.861 --> 00:58:16.694
possible

991
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.860
<v 8>suspected it. I suspect it is. Yes.</v>

992
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:26.530
Intuition. I guess it's beautiful how it's supposed to be.

993
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:31.531
This is what I've always dreamt of the Burke starts to generate as soon as I'm

994
00:58:32.111 --> 00:58:35.800
in love and sort of so nice that we're not telling me things that I don't know.

995
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.090
This is what, this is why I lived every moment.

996
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:41.993
<v 18>Okay.</v>

997
00:58:59.130 --> 00:58:59.963
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

998
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:01.270
<v 23>thanks guys. Okay. Yeah. Nice.</v>

999
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.380
<v 0>A lot of people do think, uh, for this, uh, these two episodes,</v>

1000
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:22.600
this was actually a real group effort, but particular props to producers,

1001
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.350
Tracy hunt in that Keel. Tiefer Yep.

1002
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.430
You're heading the whole thing into Bethel and to Bethel hop tay for a huge

1003
00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:30.320
production assist it should.

1004
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:35.000
You have a question that's burning in your brain. We know exactly.

1005
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.400
Send it to us at radio lab at [inaudible] dot org and also a cro, which a w NYC.

1006
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:42.560
Dot. She likes to get them particularly,

1007
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.330
not particularly send that directly and a this box.

1008
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:49.610
He does particularly like it when you stand on the sidewalk or just outside his

1009
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:52.460
window. Say, I'm furious with curiosity.

1010
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:57.050
I told because I'm on the fifth floor and you'd have to be very tall or in a

1011
00:59:57.051 --> 01:00:01.310
tree. Okay. We say, or we just take it by. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

1012
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.950
Thank you for listening and for questing with us.
