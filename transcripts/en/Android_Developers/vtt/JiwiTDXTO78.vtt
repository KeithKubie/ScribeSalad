GREG NEISWANDER:
My name is Greg.

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.050
I'm a researcher at Google,
and I work for the Android Auto

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.682
project.

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.140
GERMAN BAUER: And
I'm German Bauer.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.502
I'm a designer on the
Android Auto team.

00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:09.460
How are you guys doing?

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:14.800
GREG NEISWANDER: And
we're going to talk

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.960
about designing for driving.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.612
So German will explain
what that actually means.

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:21.070
GERMAN BAUER: So
what we want to do

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.040
is we want to give you a
little bit of an insight of how

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.510
Android Auto came about,
the considerations that

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.670
went into making it, and how
we're supporting developers

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.980
who might not know even about
automotive design in bringing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.574
their Android up to
this new platform.

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:36.990
And then, time
permitting, we want

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.141
to talk a little bit
about the future as well.

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.100
GREG NEISWANDER:
So Android Auto--

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.150
does everybody know what it is?

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.520
Anybody not know what it is?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
I think everybody knows.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.180
But for those that don't know,
it's an extension of Android,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600
bringing Android into
the car so that you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.380
get the apps, the functionality,
the features that you want

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.640
from your phone, but you have
it presented in a new manner

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.354
that's fit for the
context of driving.

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:07.230
GERMAN BAUER: Why are we in
an automotive area as well?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.850
If you heard
[? Sunda ?] this morning

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.140
talk about the whole
larger platform of Android,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170
we're really a big part of that.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.670
Android is all about
having many touch points

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.360
into people's lives across
devices-- not just phones, not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
just tablets, but also
watches, cars, and TV.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.020
And this is all for
over a billion users

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.910
and a whole ecosystem
on top of it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.800
that new developers
help us build as well.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.560
And together, we make
it a really big thing.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.160
And as of today,
at I/O 2016, we're

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.090
talking about Android Auto
itself becoming a platform that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.990
has two new form
factors in addition

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.400
to what was already on the
market for about a year,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.510
spanning a wider range
of automotive types

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.960
and actually really
becoming a system on itself.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.330
And the first one,
the first form factor

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.830
I want to talk about is
the one that we already

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.199
saw in the photo,
which is by plugging

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.630
a phone into a
compatible car, and then

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.330
your phone becomes projected
directly onto the car's display

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.540
and you use the car's control
to interact with your content.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.980
And so the phone is powering
the entire experience

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.770
in this form factor.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.590
And as of I/O 2016, as
of today, Android Auto

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.080
is also previewing a
brand new form factor

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.910
for those cars that are not
yet compatible with the plugged

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.820
in version of Android.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.610
So we're extending
into these older cars.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.026
For example, if
you have a classic

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.860
and you want to
put Bluetooth in,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.470
this is a great Android
audio experience directly

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.560
on the phone screen.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.667
So you don't need
anything else there.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.250
And the third thing
we want to preview

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.400
is really a concept of Android
as an embedded platform built

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.130
directly into the car.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.670
You can see this outside
in the red Maserati.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.660
There's a preview of
that concept there.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.760
And it's that car
manufacturers can actually

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.630
build their native
system on top of Android.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.000
And so you can get a great
experience directly built

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.090
into the car.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.670
And what we're super-thrilled
to see, having built the system,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.100
is finally realizing this
bigger vision of Android Auto

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.180
running across all these
different platforms

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.140
and translating the UI,
depending on the screen form

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.070
factor, depending on the
input devices that you have.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.100
And I think this is
something that we are super

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.210
excited about.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.270
And Greg is now
shedding more light

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.969
on why driving is really
so different than using

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.510
a regular phone in
a regular context.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.500
GREG NEISWANDER: Right.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.860
So when we move into
new spaces, it's

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.830
really important to take the
context of the environment

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.970
into account.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.560
When we look at
driving today, we

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.740
see that we're spending a
lot of time inside the car.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.780
So from a fairly
recent study, they

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.980
found that the average
person in the US

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.966
spends around 45 minutes
inside the car per day.

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:10.590
For those of us living
in the Bay Area,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.240
it's actually probably higher,
given the traffic volumes

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.530
that we have out here.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.970
But either way, that's
somewhere on the magnitude

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.750
of around 280 hours per
year inside the car.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.940
It's a lot of time.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.020
And it's a piece of our life.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.460
And what we find is
that during that time,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.480
people don't want to necessarily
stop their digital life.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.260
So they want to still be
able to be entertained.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.850
They want to communicate.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.440
They want to be productive.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.610
And if we can't figure
out the right way

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.510
to convey the information,
then it leads to problems.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.170
So as an example,
texting-- we all

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.710
know that texting isn't good.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.610
A study found that, or they
noted at highway speeds,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.570
when you text and drive,
it's approximately

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.370
equivalent to driving the
length of a football field

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.290
while not looking
at the roadway.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.680
So it's not good.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.960
And we know that
we shouldn't do it,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.730
yet we also know that
people are still doing it.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.260
So the question is why?

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.450
Well, one reason is that we
tend to overestimate our driving

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.130
abilities.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.900
So as drivers, we're
generally overconfident.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.570
And we tend to try and we don't
understand the true dangers.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.480
So basically,
we're overconfident

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.640
with our abilities.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.180
And we also underestimate
the true dangers of driving.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.100
This leads to a pretty
bad mix, because when

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.930
we want to engage
with-- when we want

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.610
to be productive or
communicate or be entertained,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.830
it means that we start
to engage with our phone

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.880
or do things that we
shouldn't necessarily do.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.070
And the problem is,
when we're driving,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.130
if we screw up, if you
do something stupid,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.630
you don't just put
yourself at risk,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.800
but you put all the others
in the car with you at risk.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.680
And you put those around
you at risk as well.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.600
So it's really
critical that we figure

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.560
out how can we
re-examine the technology

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.670
to better suit the environment.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.740
GERMAN BAUER: Didn't you
in fact have a statistic

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.920
where you said that
the majority of drivers

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.200
think they're better
than average drivers?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.350
Which is actually
mathematically impossible.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.350
GREG NEISWANDER: Yeah,
it was somewhere around--

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.910
I think it was 93%
of those sampled

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.710
thought they were
above average drivers.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.630
GERMAN BAUER: And
the rest was probably

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.960
a statistics expert that
realized that wasn't possible.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.560
So from this point, it's
really, really clear

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.290
that designing for the
phone is not the same thing

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.450
as designing for driving.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.010
Really two different things.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.020
I think Greg has made abundantly
clear with the three points

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.920
that he just made that it's
a very different situation.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.130
And this different
environment needs

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.370
to be thought of as
such when we start

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.442
about designing absent
services for this environment.

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:02.560
GREG NEISWANDER: Right.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.730
And one thing to note is it's
not mostly the phone's fault.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.500
If you go into a
car dealership today

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.240
and you look at the technology
that's going inside the car,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.820
a lot of them resemble
tablets and phones right now.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.550
So it's not just
for the technology,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.450
but again it's the way
that the information

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.950
is constructed and
ultimately conveyed

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.456
that's the critical elements.

00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:27.401
GERMAN BAUER: And so for
Android Auto-- and this

00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:30.460
is what this talk is
about-- the experience

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.632
needs to be designed
specifically for driving.

00:07:32.632 --> 00:07:34.340
And what this means,
we're going to start

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.960
with the next few slides.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.750
So for one thing, one easy
way that we can think of this

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.370
is that really, driving and
keeping your eyes on the road

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.930
is task number one.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.730
And dealing with the phone
should be task number two.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.850
And this is very different than
phones, where we design apps

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.350
specifically for
whole engagement,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.710
for full engagement.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.780
And here, we actually
want to do it differently,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.800
because we don't want you
to spend this much time

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.232
with your eyes off the road.

00:08:07.232 --> 00:08:08.190
GREG NEISWANDER: Right.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.648
And another way to
think about this

00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:13.050
is if you substitute
primary task for driving

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.200
and your secondary
task is a distraction.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.420
So all other activities
inside the car

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.881
that don't pertain to driving
are, in fact, distracting.

00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.730
And we find that people engage
in distracting activities

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.350
quite a lot.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.350
So there's a recent study that
looked at naturalistic driving

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.830
data and found that
over 50% of the time,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.880
people engaged in
distracting activities.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.620
This can be anything
from texting,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.370
as we talked about
before, but it can also

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.840
be eating or conversing
with a passenger

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.820
or even dancing
in your car seat.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.830
So all of this, if it
doesn't pertain to driving,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.140
it has some element of
distraction for the driving

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.220
task.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.050
When we look at
distraction itself,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.546
we can break it down from
the human perspective.

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.430
And we see that
ultimately, it can

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.030
be thought of in three
main fundamental ways.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.060
So we have visual distraction.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.580
This is, of course, when
your eyes are off the road,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.860
looking at other things.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.720
We can have manual
distraction, and this

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.060
is when your hands are
off the steering wheel

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.470
or off steering controls,
fidgeting with other things,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.790
like the climate control.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.630
Then we can have
cognitive distraction.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.750
This one's a little
bit harder to assess,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.877
but it's basically when
your mind is not actively

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:31.460
thinking about the
driving task and is

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.840
attending to other things.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.540
In the real world,
we rarely see a task

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.690
that takes just one
form of distraction.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.330
Most often, tasks
have some element

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.950
of all of these
types of distraction.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.240
So if we use an
example, something

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.000
as simple as rolling
up the window.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.390
In order to determine if you
need to roll up the window,

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.370
you might have to
glance at the window.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.660
So there's some visual.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.870
You have to reach over
to the button, of course.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.910
So there's some
manual distraction.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.630
And then you have to
think about maybe,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.520
do I need to push or do
I need to pull on it?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.580
So this is a really
simplified example.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.270
And of course, the
levels of distraction

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.630
here aren't really critical.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.300
But it's a good
representation, and it

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.510
helps us to understand when
we're designing experiences,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.890
we need to figure out how
can we focus the experience,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.670
and how do the
experiences affect

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.620
each of the different
channels of distraction.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.290
Ultimately, how can we minimize
the overall distraction?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.210
And what we know is that we
can't fully eliminate it.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.980
Distraction is
always going to exist

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.170
in some form inside the car.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.690
But what we can do
is we can mitigate it

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.320
through responsible design.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.630
GERMAN BAUER: So then,
how do we fundamentally

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.950
rethink how we design
the UI for driving away

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.120
from the interaction model
that we know from the handheld?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.870
And what I want to
do is actually share

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.340
a few principles
with you that have

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.940
come about as we did
a lot of research

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.880
and a lot of design iterations,
and let's talk about those.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.020
So one simple
principle that is one

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.850
of the foundations
for Android Auto

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.297
is that we're really trying
to bias things towards action.

00:11:16.297 --> 00:11:17.130
What does this mean?

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.850
So when you're on your phone
and you're trying to play music,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.210
for example, you have a
selection of multiple apps.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.210
You select your app.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.910
Then you have maybe a grid of
different suggested things.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.750
The song you have
might not be in there.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.370
You are scrolling down a list,
maybe possibly another list.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.600
And that's a lot of
noodling before you actually

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.730
get to play a song.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.950
Compare this with the
old style auto radio,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.160
if you still remember
those from way back when,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.737
where you just press any of the
buttons and out comes music.

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:50.820
It's really simple, or you
put in a CD or cassette

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.860
and it just works.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.260
And this is sort of the
gold standard in some ways,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.625
because there's very
little load on you.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.440
You just start it and it
is immediately actionable,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.510
immediately set up
for consumption.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.890
And then you can still change
from there, the channel

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.810
or whatever, but it just gives
you some instant gratification.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.820
GREG NEISWANDER: Right.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.430
And then we also want to try
and reduce visual and cognitive

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.320
load by overall
simplifying the interface,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.830
making layouts and
content predictable,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.440
so making things consistent, and
then flattening the hierarchies

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.870
as much as we can to, , again,
surface actions as quickly

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.060
as possible.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.630
So this really overall just
means a reduction in complexity

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.230
and really focusing on core
activities that makes sense

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.790
to do while driving.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.540
And keep in mind for
other activities,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.920
those can always be deferred
to pre- or post-drive states,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.880
such as playing with settings.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.610
All of this is done to keep
interactions efficient so

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.880
that you can get the
content you want,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.030
but then get to drive back to
driving as quickly as possible.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.220
And for those other
tasks, where you're

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.540
looking for very
specific content,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.460
voice can be a
great shortcut that

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.050
can be this great deep dive.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.390
So if you're looking
for that one song

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.000
that you really
want to play, you

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.780
can simply make a voice command.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.130
And this allows
you to reroute away

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.380
from the complexity of going
through an interface visually

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.740
and just make a simple
voice command and get it.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.890
So we really want to enable
voice in all of our apps

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.050
so that users can take
advantage of these shortcuts.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.190
And the great thing
is about voice

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.450
is it really doesn't
require any visual elements

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.840
or manual elements
for distraction.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.320
We're also talking today, if you
go over to the booth later on,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.750
you'll see that we're
working on hot wording

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.579
so that OK Google
will work in the car

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:46.620
so that you don't actually
have to press a button

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.960
as well to start
your voice session.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.320
Now, the other side of this
is, though we can alleviate

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.980
visual and manual
distraction, we

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.560
do have to be aware that
voice comes at a cost

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.360
through cognitive distraction.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.980
Because every time you think
about what you're going to say,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.630
every time you start to speak,
and every time you listen,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.680
it takes some element
of cognitive processing.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.890
So we want to carefully
design the voice interfaces

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.720
and the voice flows to try and
mitigate cognitive processing

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.290
and overall cognitive load.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.200
GERMAN BAUER: So
people ask us often,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.640
why don't you just
use your phone?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.845
People are using it today, and
the phone in the last 10 years

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:30.220
has really evolved
to almost like

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.340
a competing platform
with smartphones,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.470
and it really hasn't had a
long time to optimize its UI.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.700
But think about it--
when you're driving,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.080
your attention is
primarily on the road.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.570
And your phone will be an
arm's length away from you,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.895
not close to you.

00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:45.520
And then finally, if
you've ever driven

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.562
on the American
highways around here,

00:14:47.562 --> 00:14:49.020
you know there's
a ton of potholes.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.040
And you know what that does
to your touch accuracy.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.660
Have you ever tried
those on a screen?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.300
It's very, very tricky.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.080
And then you throw in
non-ideal lighting conditions

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.706
like today, when the car turns,
the light comes from this side,

00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:01.538
then from this side.

00:15:01.538 --> 00:15:03.120
Sometimes the phone
is full of glare

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.560
and you can't
really see anything

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.700
and you can't change
any of these things.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.200
And so it becomes clear that
we don't have a regular handset

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.310
situation here.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.960
So first of all,
the typography needs

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.350
to be significantly larger
to see at a distance.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.390
The touch targets need to be
much more forgiving and bigger.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.900
And then finally,
the contrast needs

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.200
to be maximized to work in
all the lighting conditions,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.450
including night driving.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.320
The good news is, with
every building block

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.130
that we're making for
the OS, we're also

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.734
keeping the developers in
mind as we're building this,

00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:34.150
so you don't have to necessarily
spread all these details.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.130
You don't have to be
car and driving experts

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.130
as you're building an
app for Android Auto.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.280
So a few examples
are on the left side,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.730
we have font styles that
have been extensively tested

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.370
and optimized for
driving use case

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.310
that developers can call upon.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.610
We have layouts
in component sizes

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.340
built for automotive
touch target sizes.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.290
So all of our
layouts are actually

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.160
built on this metric that allows
for these large enough touch

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.761
targets.

00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.010
And then finally, we have
this icon contrast switch-on

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.830
mechanism built into
the system where

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:08.714
you can provide an icon as an
app developer that's one color.

00:16:08.714 --> 00:16:10.380
And then we switch
the color accordingly

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.880
to what happens
with the background.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.710
And this happens automatically.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.985
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:18.980
GREG NEISWANDER: Yes,
so the whole field

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.480
of legibility in
glanceable environments

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.600
is actually a super,
super interesting area.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.760
And what you find is
that little tweaks

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.680
and things like font weight
or font size or contrast

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.390
can actually have quite
significant impact

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.380
on the overall
readability and time

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.940
it takes to understand
or read text.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.857
And so when we're
talking about driving,

00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:43.690
we're not talking about
a matter of seconds.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.970
We're really talking a
matter of milliseconds here,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.730
and every little bit counts.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.570
So we're really interested
in this type of research.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.590
MIT Age Lab and
Monotype have both

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.380
been conducting research in this
area for quite some time now.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.320
And so we're
collaborating with them

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.319
to conduct collaborative
research to, again, investigate

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:09.520
these areas of font legibility,
dynamic lighting environments,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.270
font colors, contrast, font
size, all of these things

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.280
to better understand
basically, how

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.339
does this really affect
legibility in a driving

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.410
context, and how can we
further optimize our system

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.750
to, again, even if it's
shaving milliseconds off,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.871
let's make those improvements
and make driving better.

00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:33.370
GERMAN BAUER: One of the big
learnings that we had over time

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.230
was that we understood
that we needed

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.100
to make our system throughout
knowable and familiar

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.970
throughout all its applications.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.470
What does this mean?

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.960
Well, remember how
Greg previously

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.200
talked about cognitive load.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.890
And one of the biggest
loads is actually

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.230
what we refer to as mental
loading and unloading

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.360
of an application model.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.030
So that basically
refers to the user

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.650
as they're switching
from one app to another.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.760
They need to learn and
relearn a new model.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.960
Sometimes they
remember it, of course,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.126
when they use it frequently.

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:07.220
But there's still learning
and unlearning going on.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.050
And if you're driving, then
your mental capacity is already

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.010
sort of shrunk because
your attention,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.550
again, is on the road.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.180
And so it means that
for us, it meant

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.010
that we wanted the system UI
to organize it in such a way

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.070
that the apps are
all self-similar.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.570
There is recognizable
elements in all of the apps

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.410
that even if you
switch to another app,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.720
it sort of works
in the same way.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.610
And this is very
different from phones,

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.270
obviously, where every app
tries to distinguish itself.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.040
And Spotify has a
completely different UI

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.820
than, say, Google Play Music.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.060
But for Android Auto, we want
to keep this at a minimum

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.620
so that people don't
have to relearn

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.510
in the situation of driving.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.100
So let's look at some
wire frames here.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.710
This is a navigation
application on Android Auto.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.110
And the bioframe is
in the bottom right.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.590
This is the phone application.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.080
You can see the same system
takes place where there

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.980
is these recognizable
elements, and we're

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.710
going to go through in a second.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.690
And this is an audio
music application, again,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.680
with very, very simple elements.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.732
And in the next
slide, we're going

00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:12.940
to talk a little bit about
these common elements that

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.230
are used throughout the system.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.630
So we basically designed
the elements in such a way

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.190
that they have common
functionality no matter which

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.130
app you're in.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.750
And these anchor
points are the menu

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.490
on the left top
corner, where you

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.180
get access to
alternative content

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.090
compared to what you're
currently playing.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.980
The microphone on
the right side,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.510
which accesses what we call
the demand space, which

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.220
is basically you can query
the system like a Google Voice

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.460
to either do actions or find
a specific piece of content.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.010
Then the application
has its own actions,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.920
and this is the white area.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.590
And the whole system
has an activity strip

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.470
at the bottom where
you can switch

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.710
between the core activities of
driving, which we identified

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.000
as navigation, communication,
audio and music

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.910
and entertainment, and then
car-specific activities.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:11.080
Now let's look at that case
of music application here.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.370
So the first one we saw
was Google Play Music,

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.990
and you can see a very
familiar structure

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.580
with a play/pause button,
the forward and rewind.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.370
And you have an additional
menu on the right side.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.460
And this here,
this other screen,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.530
is a different application.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.570
This is an audio
app that happens

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.957
to have a 30-second rewind
and a 30-second forward.

00:20:31.957 --> 00:20:33.790
And even though they
have slightly different

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.810
functionality and they
express their brand

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.530
in a different color,
it's still fundamentally

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.880
the same structure that the
driver can benefit from.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.410
Even if they have never
seen this app before,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.030
they can reuse that.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.540
And when you're at
night, driving at night

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.640
has its own specific challenges.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.260
And we do a lot of automatic
switching of some of the panels

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.590
and things like that for them
to reduce the overall lighting

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.620
intensity.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.270
But you can still recognize
the exact same structure.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.540
And we're actually giving
the application developers

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.850
a way to notify them that
when they're in a low light

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.267
situation so they can switch
to a different color palette.

00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:12.849
This is one of those
things that we're

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:14.990
doing to make it easier
for application developers

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.130
so they don't have to redo
everything themselves.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:23.370
And so today, we're introducing
this new form factor directly

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.230
on the phone screen and unifying
the story for the developers

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:28.420
and the overall experience.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.200
Because what you can
see here is exactly

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.975
the same structure from
a user experience model,

00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:35.850
even though the form
factor is very different

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.770
and you may not see as many
buttons in the white area,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.640
because frankly, the
screen is smaller

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.440
and is usually in a mount.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.920
But it's exactly the
same structure otherwise.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.430
And this is what this new form
factor looks like, for example,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.792
for Google Play
Music during daytime.

00:21:54.792 --> 00:21:57.000
In the next screen, we're
seeing the same application

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.660
that we looked at before--
the audio app, which

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.170
is right on the next screen.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.880
And again, you recognize the
same structure over and over

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.730
again.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.520
And finally at night,
you can see this here.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.600
Again, very similar
building principles.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.210
And even in different
applications like the phone

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.730
application, making
a phone call,

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.140
this looks immediately
familiar because the actions

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.860
are grouped such that the most
important actions are directly

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.060
front and center.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.820
And you're immediately
in the experience,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.390
rather than having to navigate
through a bunch of menus

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.360
to actually get to the
consumption experience.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.810
And then finally, the
navigation screen,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.600
which is also part
and parcel of this

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.960
experience here on the
smaller form factor.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.794
And this functions in
exactly the same way.

00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.210
GREG NEISWANDER:
Then we also want

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.340
to try and be naturally
integrated into the car.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.530
So what does that mean, exactly?

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.910
It means that we
want to use existing

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.280
buttons for common
functions when we can.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.450
So that's things like
controlling the volume,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.770
skipping track, muting or
pressing the voice button.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.020
So when we can use
these buttons, that

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.020
helps to provide a more
seamless experience to the user,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.490
helps to reduce learning
costs, and reduce confusion

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.190
so that when the driver
steps into the car,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.940
he or she doesn't have
to guess or relearn.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.960
They can just start using
it and it just works.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.850
And more than
integrate it, we also

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.860
have to adapt to the different
technologies inside the car.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.240
So if you go to
the dealer today,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.310
you'll find that
technology widely

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.190
varies across manufacturers,
makes, and models.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.590
And we need to be able to
provide a solution for those.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.520
So in the screen
that you see, we

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.360
need to have a solution
not only for touchscreen,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.130
but we need a solution for--
let's see if it switches,

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.200
there we go-- for when
it's not a touchscreen,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.520
so when it's a
rotary knob or maybe

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.830
it's a touchpad or some
other interaction method that

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.370
hasn't yet been released.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.100
So this gets to be
supremely challenging.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.000
And ultimately, what we see
is that this field is only

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.990
getting more complex.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.070
You have different screen sizes.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.800
And those screens
are now-- you're

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.870
seeing different form factors.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.390
So some are doing long portrait.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.200
Some are stretching
wide in the landscape.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.820
You have different
control types, of course.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.200
And the layouts for
where technology

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.950
is going inside the
car is also changing.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.340
So you're seeing shifts of where
information conventionally used

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.300
to be just in the
instrument cluster or just

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.220
in the head unit.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.800
You're now seeing migration
of where information is moving

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.300
across the inside of the car.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.530
And basically, this is
a lot of complexity.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.010
It's a huge amount
of complexity,

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.968
but it's really important
that we pay attention

00:24:44.968 --> 00:24:48.360
to this complexity so that you
as developers and designers

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.824
and makers don't have
to worry about it.

00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:52.990
GERMAN BAUER: Yeah, I want
to iterate on that point.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.440
I think that what
Greg just showed

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.929
is that you can go outside
to look at some of the cars

00:24:58.929 --> 00:25:00.970
and the differences in
screen sizes and all that,

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.480
but you don't have
to worry about this.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.271
Because one of the
things that we're doing,

00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:06.920
we're translating the UI
across these different input

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.540
and output devices.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.160
And of course as designers,
we could say, whoa, these guys

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:11.670
are crazy.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.670
Why are they doing this?

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.910
We want a uniform UI and this
should all be the same, right?

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.660
But when you look at cars,
they're very expensive.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.390
They're very
emotional purchases.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.480
People pay a lot of
money for their stuff.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.670
And brand differentiation is
really their competitive edge.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.464
And they're doing
this because they

00:25:28.464 --> 00:25:29.630
want to leapfrog each other.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.170
They want to say,
we are this brand

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.030
and this is our characteristics.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.240
And our system
basically owes them

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.470
to adapt and integrate
well with that system

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.490
and be a natural part, as
Greg was showing before.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.650
It needs to feel like
it's part of that system.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.717
And so the good news is
that Android Auto really

00:25:46.717 --> 00:25:48.800
takes care of that as far
as apps and services are

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.210
concerned, so you didn't have
to be an automotive expert.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.220
And one of the other
interesting challenges

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.790
is that as an ecosystem, of
course, we're in many countries

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.100
and Android Auto rolls
out to many countries.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.000
And there are many different
locales, regulations, but also

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.650
driving habits-- left side,
right side driving and things

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.130
like that that all have
to be taken into account.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.100
So when you look at
this overall complexity,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.420
it's actually a pretty
multi-dimensional problem,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.240
where on one side you have
an ecosystem of all apps

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.690
and services that all want
to get on Android Auto.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.170
On the other side, you have
many different cars and form

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.677
factors.

00:26:22.677 --> 00:26:25.010
And in the middle, you have
many different locales where

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.700
these products will be used.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.890
That's hard, right?

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.940
But the good news is,
again, is that Android Auto

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.130
put many, many people hours
into engineering components

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.490
that can be reused across
these different form factors.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.509
So hopefully, as a maker
of apps and services,

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:40.425
you are shielded from
that kind of complexity.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.910
And so this speaks to the
point that I was just making.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.180
Basically, the common
platform is important

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.141
because we can't
ask you to create

00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:52.765
an application or
different application

00:26:52.765 --> 00:26:55.260
or design for every
different car type out there.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.440
That would be nearly impossible.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.980
And so we're trying to help
with the standardization

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.120
across these things.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.180
And so finally as
designers of the system,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.570
we have a lot of responsibility.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.980
So first, to you guys,
the developers and makers

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.730
of things, the apps continue
to work on the system

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.630
no matter what future car UI
configuration the manufacturers

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.582
will come up with.

00:27:18.582 --> 00:27:20.290
And then finally to
the driver, that they

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.200
get to use their stuff,
their content on all

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.060
these different cars and doing
so in a responsible manner.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.710
And then finally, to
the car manufacturer,

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.150
that they get an
ecosystem of apps

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.510
that they can use to augment
their car experience.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.560
GREG NEISWANDER: As
German just mentioned,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.650
we have this responsibility
to the driver.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.780
And part of that
responsibility is understanding

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.260
that humans simply aren't as
capable inside the car when

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.200
they're driving.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.690
We're just not as good at
interacting with technology,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.700
because we have this competing
safety critical activity

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.680
that we have to
pay attention to.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.430
So we have to be very
careful and weigh things

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.270
very carefully,
every design decision

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.260
against the implications of
the effects and the effects

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.970
that it might have
on human performance.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.660
And there's this
critical balance here.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.080
Essentially, one of the
cruxes of really developing

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.570
experiences inside the
car is, how can you

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.590
deliver a positive
user experience

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.450
while at the same
time making sure

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.930
that we're not
overtaxing the driver?

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.280
And that leads us to
this very typical process

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.800
of research and design.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.070
So this is a pretty
common iterative cycle

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.747
that you see in most
development cycles.

00:28:34.747 --> 00:28:36.330
But I point it out
because it's really

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.180
absolutely critical for our team
to have this close hand in hand

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.730
process.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.540
And we really overly
invest in research,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.270
in our research
because distraction

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.520
is such a critical issue.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.850
So we need this tightly coupled
process between the two,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.290
because it really helps
to facilitate rapid design

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.170
and helps us to head in the
right direction early on,

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.560
rather than having to
course correct later

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.900
on when it's more costly.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.760
And that leads us more or less
to trying to test everything.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.490
So a lot of the principles
and the patterns

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.040
that you see from
Android Auto aren't

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.160
a random set of
ideas and theories

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.610
that we've just arrived on.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.720
They're the result of a
highly intuitive process

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.050
that's predominantly led by
vast amounts of user testing.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.960
So we rigorously test again
and again, as much as we can.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.840
And we have a lot
of tools and methods

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.890
that we use, both on
the qualitative side

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.470
and the quantitative side.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.680
But rather than dwell on this
slide, I'll go to the next one.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.700
So we have this quick
video which is Nat and Lo.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.500
Is anybody familiar
with Nat and Lo?

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.340
A few people.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.310
So Nat and Lo is
this YouTube channel.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.240
It's a couple Googlers
that go around Google

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.020
and they film behind the scenes
action of different projects

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.050
and things happening at Google.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.370
And then they post it on
their YouTube channel.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.520
So they recently
stopped by Android Auto

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.660
to check out our research lab.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.830
I'm not going to
play the whole clip,

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.360
but I recommend everybody
go and check that out.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.860
But instead, I have some quick
clips that I'll talk over.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.660
So we can go ahead
and play the video.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.014
And this is just to show some
of the different research

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:20.930
activities that we do.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.920
So there's their start up.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.430
And then there's Nat and Lo.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.518
It's really Lo and
Nat, in that order.

00:30:28.518 --> 00:30:30.380
So we have driving simulators.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.420
So this is one of our
driving simulators.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.990
And basically what you see
is it's a representation

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.670
of a car inside of our lab.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.310
And it allows us to put
participants inside a fake car,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.530
but give them this really
immersive environment

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.500
as they drive.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.330
And as they do this, we'll
give them tasks in Android Auto

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.850
to perform.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.360
And so as they try and drive
and complete tasks, we then

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.770
look at their
driving performance

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.850
and evaluate, how much
does their driving

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.910
performance degrade?

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.310
And that's an indicator
of if we need to redesign

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.670
or not if something's
overly distracting.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:15.560
Beyond the simulator, we
look at eye tracking as well.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.500
So as I mentioned before, visual
distraction is really critical.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.870
So here's one of
our eye trackers.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.940
It of course tracks the eye.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.020
And it gives us a quantitative
assessment of natural glance

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.730
behavior inside the car.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.900
So we use this, again,
paired with the simulator

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.270
to have them engage with
tasks in Android Auto

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.560
as they have to also drive.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.080
And that helps us to determine
how people make glances.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.420
And if we find that people have
to make too long of glances,

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.950
that's an indicator that
it's overly distracting

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.340
and we need to go
back and redesign.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.207
And we also look at
cognitive measurement.

00:31:53.207 --> 00:31:54.790
This is a little bit
harder to assess.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.040
But this is detection
response task, DRT.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.820
And basically, she's putting
a microswitch on her finger.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.450
That's a little button
that she can click.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.130
Then she also has a
tactor that gets taped.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.710
We tape it around the neck area.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.020
And that vibrates on
a random interval.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.420
And when she feels
the vibration,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.780
she has to acknowledge
it with the button.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.850
And basically, this is
a really rudimentary way

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.980
to black box the brain
and look at the phase

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.760
delay of cognitive processing.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.650
We can start to evaluate,
relative to other tasks, how

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.350
distracting something is
from the cognitive aspect.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.420
Then we have occlusion goggles.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.520
These are these really
goofy-looking goggles.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.590
And they cycle between fully
opaque and fully transparent.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.190
And it's just a really
quick, easier way

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.040
to simulate a dual task
environment for evaluating

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.140
whether a task can be completed
within a reasonable time

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.885
and whether or not
a task is chunkable.

00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:48.010
GERMAN BAUER: Thanks, Greg.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.880
That was really great.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.280
We have a little time left
to talk about implications

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.060
for the future in the
areas we're interested in,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.450
in terms of future.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.350
And also you can't
have a presentation

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.540
about cars without talking
about the future, I guess.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.250
We're really at the beginning
of this journey, where we're

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.150
starting to understand
that bringing two

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.040
industries together
from the internet

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.450
and develop a community and
maker of apps and Google,

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.410
and on the other side the
automotive industry, which

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.600
has much longer development
cycles between car cycles,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.420
sometimes seven years and more.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.390
But really understanding
the thoroughness

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.870
that they put into the
process is actually essential,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.210
because they're
building huge machinery.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.310
It's actually a very
non-trivial problem.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.500
And at the same time,
they're learning from us

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.780
as we're going through more
rapid iterations of things.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.950
And both of these
things coming together

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.620
is starting to be a
really interesting mix

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.820
and a new potential
for developing things

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.490
that weren't here yet before.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.232
And we are starting to see also
that the automotive [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:51.232 --> 00:33:52.690
that we're building,
we're starting

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.840
to apply those to other
areas within Android,

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.040
because we are having some
very interesting learnings.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.760
One area that we want to
look at in the near future

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.210
is that we're very interested in
new types of applications that

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.020
haven't yet been
covered, where there's

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.960
innovative areas like car
health, driving monitoring,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:15.370
new forms of car ownership, or
even professional drivers that

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.920
require new types of apps.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.579
So in this case, for
example, an EV manufacturer

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.120
might be really
interested in talking

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.190
about how their batteries are
doing and things like that.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.889
So we're starting to think
about apps in the car

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:31.190
also as something that
goes over to Android

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.690
as morphable apps,
morphable systems that

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.810
can take different shapes.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.268
And that's something
we're learning

00:34:36.268 --> 00:34:38.960
as we're building Android Auto
that might apply to future

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.060
in other form factors,
different shapes

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.820
depending on what the
context is and what

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.139
your cognitive ability is.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.820
And so this is something
that is completely new.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.610
Another thing that I love
about designing for cars

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.889
is that it's really sort
of a greenhouse, a very

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.940
defined environment.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.400
Everything has its place.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.370
It's very heavily constrained.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.590
And so we can start
experimenting and learning

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.410
from things as people are
sitting in this position.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.480
There's clearly a
driver, a passenger,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.150
maybe passengers in the back.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.720
They all have their roles.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.480
And so we're
starting to learn how

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.540
we organize the system optimized
for these specific roles.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.570
And we can do this
in a car much better

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.910
than we can do this in
freeform environment

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.590
like the phone or the TV.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.530
Another area that we're
very interested in

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.150
is thinking beyond just
the in-cabin experience.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.070
Because when you think about it,
as Greg was mentioning before,

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.890
there's really a
pre-drive experience

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.640
and there's a post-drive
experience that's

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.120
very important to
us, that really

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.910
makes this the whole
holistic experience.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.880
But also think of
it as a scale thing.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.380
You have your phone.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.110
But your phone is inside a
car, which has multiple phones.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.860
And then the car drives inside
an interconnected system

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.690
of cities and highways.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.960
And each presents a new
connected opportunity

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.980
to innovate in.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.430
One example is that
for example in Maps,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.370
you see the green,
red, yellow of traffic.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.350
And this is something where
small units of information

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:07.010
get put together to form
useful information for all

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.490
the drivers.

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.210
And we believe that every
major change in transportation

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.210
has fundamentally changed
the infrastructure.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:19.600
Trading notions of scale, the
way we build and the way we

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600
organize our cities.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.900
And we believe that this next
thing, the connected entities

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.040
that cars are, will change
that yet once again.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.150
And cars-- it's
interesting, because when

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:35.810
we look at 10 years ago, cars
were really super optimized.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.220
They had the engine optimized
and all this other stuff.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.780
But as people are using
phones in different ways

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.350
and people are using
connectivity in different ways,

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.580
they have, as Greg
pointed out, expectations

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.880
of how they can also
use this in the car

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.060
as they're spending more
and more time in the car.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.400
And so this is very clear that
this is a brand-new platform.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.230
And we think about computing
in a very different way.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:02.610
And so as we think about this,
it's become very clear to us

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.630
that cars, connected cars, do
become a thing unto themselves.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.830
In the past, when mobile
phones first came out,

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.240
people tried to shoehorn the
PC interfaces into mobile

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.580
by just shrinking it.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.660
It was a bad idea.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.510
So the phone has come a long way
to develop its own interface.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.850
And real change will
happen to the car UIs.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.530
They're not just
smartphone interfaces

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.240
that are a little bit
blown up, but they

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.640
will happen as cars become
their own connected thing

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.350
in themselves.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.990
And so we're almost at
the end of this talk.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.810
And if you remember only
two things from this talk,

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.610
we want you to take away this.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:45.640
First thing is, we really
learn that we needed

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.350
a completely different
model for the UI

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:52.080
to get design for
driving optimized.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.140
And the second thing
is that Android

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.700
as an operating system, and
specifically Android Auto,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.730
helps you with building
some of this expertise

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.620
directly into the
building blocks you get

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.180
to use for making applications.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.660
And this is a long process.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.120
Because of all the safety and
driver destruction implication,

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.390
we have to very thoroughly
test all this stuff.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.520
But the future is very exciting.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.770
We as an operating
system are also

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.590
starting to learn to
almost morph and adapt

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.740
the UI to new constraints and
to future form factors that we

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.974
haven't even thought about.

00:38:25.974 --> 00:38:27.640
And believe me, there's
some crazy stuff

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.098
out there that we
see at auto shows

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.690
where the screen's
like hugely wide.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.340
And normal computing
environment,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.550
normal adaptive responsive
design doesn't even follow this

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.590
and wouldn't have
a response to that.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.240
So we're only at the
beginning of this evolution.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.380
And we see this as
the starting point.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.590
And we can wait to see what
together, you and us, will

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.739
build from this going forward.

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:52.030
Thank you very much for coming.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.610
GREG NEISWANDER: Thank you.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.560
