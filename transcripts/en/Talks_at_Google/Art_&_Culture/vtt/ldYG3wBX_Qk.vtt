ALAN SEALES: "In Transit" is a
funny and poignant new Broadway

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.250
musical which follows the
intertwined lives of 11 New

Perfect" and "Frozen."

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.970
"In Transit" takes you on a
journey with people hoping

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.340
to catch the express
train to their dreams,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.530
including the stops
they make along the way.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.540
Modern yet timeless,
"In Transit"

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.460
is a story about all
of us, set to music

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.280

long after the ride is over.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:14.120
So there are a couple
Broadway debuts.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120
Raise your hand.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.620
Yeah.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.454
All right!

00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:16.954

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:19.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:22.890
But I want to get in
the history of the show.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.790
We'll kick it off early.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.640
So Janet, you've been with the
show since, I guess, inception.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.740
It started where, in 2004
was the original inception

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.240
of the show?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.750
JANET ROSEN: It started
right after September 11.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.100
The four writers were
friends and in their 20s,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.170
and they wanted
to write something

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.630
that was a little bit cheery.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.530
And they were performing it in
small clubs, the four of them,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.470
who are not here today.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.180
But I got involved
about in 2010,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.650
when it went to Primary Stages,
Off-Broadway for a six--

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:08.350
seven, counting Chesney--
person performance of it.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.980
It's like a six-week run.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.540
And I came in and somehow
[LAUGHS] got sucked in.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.340
And I have been leading
it forward for the last

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.070
over six years until we
got a Broadway theater.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.950
It's gone from six plus
Chesney to 10 plus Chesney now,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.390
performers.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.240
And it's the first
a capella musical

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.750
that's ever been on
Broadway, so we were

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.150
groundbreaking in that respect.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.420
And audiences are loving it.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.030
We got a standing
ovation every night.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.110
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.340
The fact that it is the
first a capella musical--

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.680
were there any roadblocks for
you to get it to Broadway?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.120
Or did it help the process?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.620
Like "This is new,
let's put it on."

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.320
JANET ROSEN: I don't know that
a capella was particularly

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.100
a roadblock.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.260
It's just that there are
so few theaters compared

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.640
to how many shows want
theaters, that no matter

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.200
what your show is, it's going
to be very time-consuming,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.830
and you've got to really
stick to it to get a theater.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.560
Because not only are there
not that many theaters,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.360
but there are a lot
of theaters that

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.680
have long-run
shows in them, that

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.850
are there, like "Chicago" for
20 years or something like that.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.530
So those are taken off
the market immediately.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.040
So it's a challenge, and you
don't give up if you care.

00:12:40.524 --> 00:12:42.690
ALAN SEALES: How many of
the cast here was involved?

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.040
Is this the first
time you were all

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.956
involved in this production,
or did any of you

00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:47.970
get involved with
Off-Broadway and beforehand?

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.050
CHESNEY SNOW: I was involved
in the Off-Broadway show when

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.000
Janet, our fearless producer--

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.300
I can't tell you guys enough
how incredible this woman is

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.190
for getting it here.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.450
Most first-time lead producers
never, ever get that done.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.430
So it's really incredible.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.181
But yeah, I was part of the
Off-Broadway production.

00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:09.930
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.660
And then--

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.940
MOYA ANGELA: As soon as
it was off Off-Broadway,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.650
I came in five years
ago, six years ago?

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.400
ADAM BASHIAN: It was
six years, and so did

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.590
I. We joined when they
started reworking the show,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.480
and they added some roles to it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.124
And Moya and I joined then.

00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:27.540
ALAN SEALES: So
what's been added?

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.860
What's changed?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.610
MOYA ANGELA: Well, before, there
were only six or seven people

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.970
who did everything that
all of these people do.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.150
It was tough.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.405
I mean, it's still tough.

00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:41.790
But it was unbelievably tough.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.620
It was like on another level.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.700
And I think everybody played
a lot of different characters.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.330
Now they kind of spread out who
everyone plays, except for me.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.790
I've done the same
three characters

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.780
since I started this
journey six years ago.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.300
CHESNEY SNOW: Some
songs changed.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.865
ALAN SEALES: Oh, really?

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:05.430
CHESNEY SNOW: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.560
There was a song
called "Reunion"

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.770
that got cut in the rehearsals
of Off-Broadway, which

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.850
was really interesting.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.950
It was about Jane
actually going to her--

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.820
she actually goes
to her reunion.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.550
And--

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.758
MARGO SEIBERT: There was a
song of mine that was cut?

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.600
I'm just kidding.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.130
CHESNEY SNOW: And it
was pretty funny, too,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.460
because I realized
the night that it

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.850
was cut because I had to go back
into the theater during tech

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.080
to grab a bag.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.400
And I just happened to stumble
into this intense meeting

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.680
with the producers, and the
theater, and the writers.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.570
And you could just see the
look on the writers' faces.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.510
But yeah, it's a
challenging process,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.840
because you have
something for so long,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.450
and then it changes over time.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.102
And things become sentimental.

00:14:57.102 --> 00:14:58.560
There was a song
called "No Dental"

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.180
which was a reggae joint, you
know, [INAUDIBLE], you know.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.589
And then "Wing Man"
has developed a lot.

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:08.880
Yeah, the songs have developed.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.100
MARGO SEIBERT: There's also the
fact that now, for 11 parts,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.834
we brought on Deke Sharon
as the orchestrator.

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:19.500
Is that correct?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.970
He was brought on
after the Off-Broadway?

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.970
RICK HIP-FLORES: Yeah,
so the six-person version

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.900
was the Off-Broadway version.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.983
And then five years ago,
we brought on Deke Sharon

00:15:26.983 --> 00:15:28.770
to add four more voices.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.560
And so now we have 10
voices plus a beatboxer,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.606
so 11 people on stage.

00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:33.731
MARGO SEIBERT: That's nuts.

00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:35.200
ALAN SEALES: So Rick, were you--

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.680
you were doing "Fun
Home" in the same theater

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.510
while this was
Off-Broadway, right?

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.540
Or is the time--

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.625
RICK HIP-FLORES: No,
the Off-Broadway thing

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.530
was-- we're talking
quite a long time ago.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.310
This was about 2010, was it?

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.870
So there's been a lot.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.510
Lots has happened
between [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.565
MARGO SEIBERT: It takes a while
for a new musical, typically.

00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:56.940
ALAN SEALES: And were you
involved with the Off-Broadway,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.939
or did you come-- did you
come with the theater,

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:00.725
or did you come with the show?

00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:02.850
RICK HIP-FLORES: Well,
there's sort of three stages

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.420
of this process.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.470
There was the
Off-Broadway thing,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.400
which was quite a while
ago, several years ago.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.233
And then there was a
whole gestation period,

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.982
where we were doing workshops
and developing the show

00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:11.940
in the past five years.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.314
So that's where I kind of
brought in around the same time

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:15.500
Moya was, around--

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.910
was that 2010 or 2012?

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.620
2011, 2012.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.130
Yeah, so just between then and
now, that's a whole six years.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.590
And I think we did workshops and
readings just about every six

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.340
months, right?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.710
Six months, we did shows at
54 Below, we did performances,

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.340
and what they call labs
to specifically work

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.999
on the material where the
writers can make changes to it.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:41.040
And so that's the process
that I was involved in,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.770
never the performance of
the Off-Broadway show.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.360
ALAN SEALES: So
for those of you,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.681
I guess recently, who were added
to it, or even those of you

00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:51.180
who were in it originally, what
was your first reaction when

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.320
you heard, oh, it's going
to be an a capella musical?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.550
MARGO SEIBERT: Uh-oh.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.580
I don't have any
experience with a capella,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.740
except my little sister's
in an a capella group.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.781
And that's what I told
them in the audition room.

00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:05.880
I was like, "My little
sister sings a capella.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.230
I've gone to a lot of concerts."

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.173
And that got me the
job, which was nice.

00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:13.730
No.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.380
I mean, I love
complicated singing.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.560
I love the challenge of this.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.825
But I had never had a
capella experience before.

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:25.200
TELLY LEUNG: When I first
heard was an a capella musical,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.680
I thought to myself, "Well, is
it ever going to sound full?"

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.450
I'm so used to
doing rock musicals,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.000
and musicals with big
or orchestra pits.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.147
So I was like, "How are we going
to make that a full sound?"

00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:38.730
And actually, one of the things
that a lot of audience members

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.077
leave telling us is that they
say, "Actually, we forget--

00:17:43.077 --> 00:17:44.910
partway through the
show, two or three songs

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.980
in, we forget that
there's no orchestra."

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.240
And that it does sound full.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.160
And that really is a
testament to our writers

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.320
and also to Deke
Sharon, who arranged it

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.700
in a way that is using the
entire range of the human voice

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.640
so that it feels--

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.931
we are the orchestra, you know.

00:17:58.931 --> 00:18:00.730
So it's pretty incredible.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.259
So that fear was allayed
pretty quickly for me.

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:07.050
ADAM BASHIAN: We also
have some of the best

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.133
sound people on Broadway--

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:09.600
TELLY LEUNG: Yes, oh my gosh.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.620
ADAM BASHIAN: --who
help mix us, and do

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.630
an incredible job of making
sure everybody's balanced,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.310
and you hear what you need
to hear at certain times.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.518
TELLY LU Ken Travis, our
sound designer-- incredible.

00:18:16.518 --> 00:18:19.050
MARGO SEIBERT: Because unlike
what we're doing right now,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.230
we have our normal
microphones that we wear,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.590
and then we also
are wearing in-ears

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.120
like you see it
at a rock concert.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.810
NICHOLAS WARD:
Like Beyonce wears.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.640
MARGO SEIBERT: Like Beyonce.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.350
TELLY LEUNG: Like
Mariah Carey wore!

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.668
NICHOLAS WARD: Or Mariah
Carey didn't wear!

00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:33.922
MARGO SEIBERT: Oh!

00:18:33.922 --> 00:18:34.591
Edit that out!

00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:36.090
NICHOLAS WARD:
[INAUDIBLE] too soon.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.560
MOYA ANGELA: Cut!

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.572
Just kidding!

00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:40.280
NICHOLAS WARD: My name
is Justin Guarini.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.661
TELLY LEUNG: But you know what?

00:18:43.661 --> 00:18:45.960
I was watching that New
Year's Eve with the in-ears,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.094
and my heart actually
leapt out for her.

00:18:48.094 --> 00:18:50.010
Because I said, [GASPING]
"She hears nothing."

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.712
Now that I know what it's like--

00:18:51.712 --> 00:18:52.920
MARGO SEIBERT: We can't see--

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.850
we don't see Rick.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.790
Rick is in another room, and
we don't have any monitors.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:02.280
So in our in-ears is a click
track so we can keep on tempo.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.690
He gives us our pitches,
and he also counts us in.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.190
And we can have up to the
10 voices plus Chesney

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.610
panned in our ears.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.230
So I can have my bass over
here, I can have soprano 1 here.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.180
There was a learning curve.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.400
We may have broken
down a few times.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.120
But now, that's how
the show operates.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.130
It's kind of a technical feat.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.400
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I was
going to ask about that.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.760
Rick, are you in a
tiny little room that--

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.370
MOYA ANGELA: He is the Wiz.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.236
NICHOLAS WARD: The
Diary of Anne Frank.

00:19:33.236 --> 00:19:35.194
MOYA ANGELA: He literally
is the Wiz, in a room

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:37.230
somewhere, with the door closed.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.540
We had to make him
a special room.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.040
Serious.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.414
RICK HIP-FLORES: So we developed
this entirely new method

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:45.190
of conducting a show which has
never really been done before,

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:50.180
and not certain whether it
should ever be done again.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.380
So every show that you see
on Broadway pretty much

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.181
has a visual reference,
a visual monitor.

00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:55.680
You look behind you
in the audience,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.927
and you see that there's
a conductor monitor,

00:19:57.927 --> 00:19:59.010
and you see the videotape.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.940
We don't have
that, because we're

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.890
pretty much in the round,
or actually 3/4 for us,

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.306
but it's pretty
much in the round.

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:05.774
So anywhere where they would
have put a video monitor would

00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:07.940
have been a little bit
distracting, so we said, "Why

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.630
don't we just try this
without any video monitor?

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.680
Just all in their ears."

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.260
So at the start of every
song, give a chord--

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.890
[SINGING NOTE]

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.530
And then "1, 2, 3, 4,"
and then they're in.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.420
NICHOLAS WARD: Or "4."

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.600
Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.935
TELLY LEUNG: Now,
the crazy thing

00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:25.920
for actors-- when you're
performing in a scene,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.461
you could be in a very intimate
scene with your fellow actor,

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.840
but in your ear, you
will hear Rick say,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.370
"2, 3, 4," because he's
counting in everybody else.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.806
So that actually
was the part that

00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:37.305
took a little getting used to,
to feel a little bit like you

00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:39.150
have many voices in
your head talking

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.149
to you at the same time.

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:42.900
MOYA ANGELA: And getting
dressed while [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.800
ALAN SEALES: Because you
have so many costume changes.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.330
And there is no orchestra, so
you are your own transition

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.530
music.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.140
So how do you do that
with the costume changes?

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.765
NICHOLAS WARD: The
funny thing about it

00:20:53.765 --> 00:20:55.380
is, you would think
by now-- we've

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.960
been doing this show since
December 11 previews,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.970
maybe November 10 or whatever.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.790
You would think by now,
you're in a groove,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.620
and you've got your show down.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.577
Every doggone show, I'm
tired, I can't breathe.

00:21:07.577 --> 00:21:09.660
There's one song "Four
Days Home," where I'm like,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.600
[HUMMING] the whole song.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.970
Everybody else cuts out,
and I start the vamp again,

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.020
and I don't stop.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.540
And Kathleen Marshall,
who is amazing,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.660
has us running around
pushing chairs,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.090
changing clothes three times.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.020
And I'm not 21 anymore,
so, you know, it's hard.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.060
And I think that's
the one thing that--

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.077
we all, at the end of the
show, every single night, we

00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:38.160
finish "Deep Beneath the
City," and then we all go

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.410
[SIGHING DEEPLY].

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.730
Every single night.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.350
Because it's still
hard, it's still work.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.410
And I think we're
proud of it, but it's--

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.900
you don't come in, and
like a lot of shows,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.790
the orchestra takes
you through the show,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.170
and you ride the ride.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.270
This one, you're on
a roller coaster,

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.325
and it's always like
[MIMICS ROLLER COASTER].

00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:58.200
MARGO SEIBERT: I think
it is that last moment

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.210
that we remember that
we are the orchestra.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.810
I feel like it's the final
note, we're like, "Oh, yeah.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.647
We made every single sound
that happened tonight."

00:22:06.647 --> 00:22:08.480
TELLY LEUNG: But you
know-- and for us, it's

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.140
such a feeling of
accomplishment, too.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.140
But I also feel like because
our house is so intimate,

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.520
that audience knows.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.300
They know how hard
it was to hear

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.150
11 people on that stage making
every sound for 90 minutes.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.212
They recognize that, too.

00:22:23.212 --> 00:22:25.170
And I think that is why
they jump to their feet

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.190
at the end of the show.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.580
They know.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.413
They go, "I can't believe
we just saw that."

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:31.050
JANET ROSEN: I come to the
show two or three times

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.410
a week, just to check up.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.000
And because it's
in a semi-circle,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.380
I see across to the
audience on the other side.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.910
And there are people that start
to smile in the first minute

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.430
or two of the show, and
they keep that expression

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.870
on their face the whole
hour and 40 minutes.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.190
They never stop smiling
through the entire thing.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.440
That's how much they enjoy it.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.814
ALAN SEALES: I
like that you guys

00:22:55.814 --> 00:22:58.500
keep going back to every single
sound, every single sound.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.540
And there's one of
my favorite scenes--

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.760
Kathy, you should get a close-up
on Nick's face right now.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.320
There is a point
where, set in New York,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.765
they do the cacophonous
sound of New York City

00:23:12.765 --> 00:23:17.219
that I would love for you
guys to give to us now.

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:19.052
NICHOLAS WARD: I just
need a sip real quick.

00:23:19.052 --> 00:23:21.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.723
ALAN SEALES: This is all
coming from their mouths.

00:23:23.723 --> 00:23:25.848
NICHOLAS WARD: I'm not
going to use the microphone.

00:23:25.848 --> 00:23:26.385
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:26.385 --> 00:23:28.222
You You don't want him
to use the microphone!

00:23:28.222 --> 00:23:29.805
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
do the whole thing.

00:23:29.805 --> 00:23:30.632
Do the whole thing.

00:23:30.632 --> 00:23:31.590
Yeah, yeah, all of you.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.790
NICHOLAS WARD: Everybody?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.540
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.590
[SNAPPING]

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.076
[LOUD SOUNDS OF NEW YORK]

00:23:49.153 --> 00:23:51.028
AURELIA WILLIAMS:
(YELLING) Shut the hell up!

00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:53.518
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:53.962 --> 00:23:54.670
TELLY LEUNG: NYC!

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:59.382 --> 00:24:00.340
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.800
NICHOLAS WARD:
Eight shows a week.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.810
ALAN SEALES: Being in the round,
and the audience is right up--

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.740
I mean, not on
you, but they're--

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.510
NICHOLAS WARD:
Eating cheesecake.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.545
There was a woman--

00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:13.270
[LAUGHS] we were
doing Saturday night.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.853
And obviously, you
get a lot of people

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:17.170
that this is their first
time seeing a Broadway show,

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.804
and they go to the TKTS line.

00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:19.720
And they're like, "Oh!

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.890
'In Transit,' let's go.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.390
It's about a train.
so let's do it."

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.480
And so there was a
young woman sitting

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.290
on the corner of stage
right with her boyfriend.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.520
And we were doing
[HUMMING] And she pulls out

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.500
a piece of cheesecake.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.075
And I'm like, no no.

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:40.470
And she opens it up, and takes
out a fork, and is eating it.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.630
GERIANNE PEREZ: She had Juniors.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.880
NICHOLAS WARD: It was Juniors!

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.370
[LAUGHS] I was like, all right.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.827
We're now dinner theater,
which is super cool.

00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:47.410
AURELIA WILLIAMS:
New York cheesecake!

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.490
I mean, it's a part
of the experience.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.990
NICHOLAS WARD: And
she didn't even

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.365
think anything
was wrong with it.

00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:52.944
That's what's great to me.

00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:55.110
ALAN SEALES: Have there
been any other weird things,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.710
like the audience
getting up on stage?

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.352
There's no intermission, so
an hour and 45 minutes in,

00:24:59.352 --> 00:25:00.310
people have got to pee.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.820
MARGO SEIBERT: Well, they're
warned at the top of show

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.000
in a very clever way
done by our writers,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.680
that if you haven't
peed now, it's too late.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.900
You have to stay.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.660
And for the most part, I
think that the thing is

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.050
is that if you're in the front
row, you are in the show.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.270
You are so close, you're closer
than for the front row is here.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.430
Which is amazing,
because it's really

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.380
fun when people are
having a really good time,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.167
it's really really fun.

00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:30.250
But people will just forget,
and put their feet up

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.802
on the stage, and
that kind of stuff.

00:25:32.802 --> 00:25:33.760
NICHOLAS WARD: Or tape.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.955
They will pull out their
phone, and I think they forget.

00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:38.760
MOYA ANGELA: We'll remind them.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.094
"Excuse me, lady."

00:25:40.094 --> 00:25:41.885
ALAN SEALES: Do you
ever do that, actually?

00:25:41.885 --> 00:25:42.617
You tell them?

00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:43.704
MOYA ANGELA: Yes, we do.

00:25:43.704 --> 00:25:45.870
GERIANNE PEREZ: James one
time got in someone's face

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.600
and was like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.190
ALAN SEALES: So
the show itself--

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.340
I mean, it's a big oval.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.532
It's basically recreating
a subway platform

00:25:55.532 --> 00:25:56.740
for the majority of the show.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.600
And in the middle of
it, there's this--

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.827
what do you call it?

00:25:59.827 --> 00:26:00.785
MOYA ANGELA: Treadmill.

00:26:00.785 --> 00:26:02.920
ALAN SEALES: A giant, a
100-foot-long treadmill

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.760
or something.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.960
Does that thing ever break?

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.140
Do you have a contingency plan?

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.750
NICHOLAS WARD: Well, I
was doing the coffee cart.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.800
And normally, it's
like [HUMMING].

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.420
And I ride out probably
midway where the stairs end.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.380
And for some reason,
I wasn't stopping.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.290
It was like, [HUMMING].

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.580
And I'm like, [HUMMING]
(YELLING) where are we going?

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.170
And I thought-- in
my mind, I'm like--

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.510
I think as actors, we
all automatically start

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.620
to go through this contingency
plan of, what am I going to do?

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.559
If I'm jumping out now,
I have to do the rap,

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:39.100
and then am I going
to point to the--

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.100
I went through all of
this, and then it stopped.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.790
And then it backed up--

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.086 --> 00:26:45.820
--and then went forward--

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.064
MOYA ANGELA: And I was on
it walking in glitter heels.

00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:52.480
And a dress-- I won't tell
you, because you've got to come

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.860
see the show.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.250
But I was walking--

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.504
I was like, I'll
never make it home.

00:26:59.504 --> 00:27:01.920
ADAM BASHIAN: What was great
about that happening, though,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.896
is in shows, when
you're calling cues

00:27:03.896 --> 00:27:05.270
like the treadmill
or the lights,

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.120
everything's on this
number system, right?

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.850
So if something gets off, that
means almost everything else

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.580
either has to catch
up or wait for it.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.120
So all the lights started
to do the wrong cues.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.150
So the next scene after that
is this scene in an office

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.040
building that's fairly tame.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.490
But for this performance, it
was like working at Google!

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.370
Because there were
disco lights going,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.910
and all sorts of crazy things
in this very intimate scene.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.060
So that was pretty funny.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.920
NICHOLAS WARD: They
had to shut down.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.640
They had to basically
reboot the system.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.500
ADAM BASHIAN: Yeah.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500
GERIANNE PEREZ: We hear
this very intimate scene

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.120
between Mario and
Moya [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.970
And then all of a sudden, we
hear [POWERING DOWN SOUND].

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.252
And Mariand and I
are facing upstage.

00:27:45.252 --> 00:27:46.960
And we just grabbed
hands, and were like,

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.043
it's the end of the world.

00:27:48.043 --> 00:27:50.780
We really thought we were
about to meet our match.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.570
NICHOLAS WARD: I
thought this was--

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.020
I always think the world's
coming to and end, though.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.340
CHESNEY SNOW: But that's the
beauty of live theater, right?

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.040
It's something always--

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.720
AURELIA WILLIAMS:
It's the beauty?

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.249
[LAUGHS]

00:27:57.249 --> 00:27:58.040
CHESNEY SNOW: Yeah!

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.680
Well, because I feel
like the audience

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.430
then feels like that's
the magic of live theater.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.280
AURELIA WILLIAMS: Yes,
they're part of it.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.330
CHESNEY SNOW: That's
not going to happen--

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.371
MARGO SEIBERT: Well, you
always remember the show

00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:09.580
where something went wrong.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.796
Patti LuPone hit the light
bulb, and it exploded,

00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:14.170
and glass went
into the audience.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.660
That happened during "Gypsy,"
and everyone was like, "What!"

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.243
NICHOLAS WARD: What
about the guy that

00:28:18.243 --> 00:28:20.680
plugged his phone into the set?

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.990
"Hand to God?"

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.550
He thought the set
looked like a normal set,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.250
so we plugged his phone
in during the show.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.751
Yes.

00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.041
And they were like, "You idiot!

00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.810
This isn't real!"

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.742
AURELIA WILLIAMS: It's a set!

00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:33.700
ALAN SEALES: Climbed up
on stage and plugged it

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.690
into a prop outlet.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.297
Did the first production
have this, the treadmill too?

00:28:40.297 --> 00:28:41.880
Or is that recent--
only for Broadway?

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.480
JANET ROSEN: It's
a very small stage.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.270
It was probably half the size of
this platform, the whole stage.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.270
ALAN SEALES: No kidding.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.605
JANET ROSEN: Yeah, it was an
Off-Broadway theater, very

00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:52.730
small Off-Broadway theater.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.240
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, you guys
make use of the whole stage.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.270
And to put it on half of this--

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.930
yeah, that's hard.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.780
That's really good.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.690
Chesney, I want to go to
you for a second here.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.430
You've had a very
interesting history.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.850
You-- if it's okay
to talk about this--

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.520
actually were homeless
in a previous life

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.600
we'll call it, right?

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.090
CHESNEY SNOW: Yeah, that's
why I moved to New York.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.380
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, now
starring on Broadway.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.040
You want to touch on your
journey here, how you got here?

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.070
CHESNEY SNOW: Yeah, I
mean the interesting thing

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.700
about this show for me is
that my life has always

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.740
been in transit.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.550
We were always moving
from one place to the next

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.590
through childhood.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:37.120
And yeah, we had some
difficult times as a child.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:44.790
But I was in Arizona, and I
had found myself homeless.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:50.710
And I was in a homeless
shelter, and they had this--

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.530
it was like a barracks, you
know, so it was all men.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.390
And it was a really interesting
glimpse into America,

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:03.660
to see the various
people that were there.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.250
I remember there was a father
with his 10-year-old son,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.590
and the son was on
the bottom bunk,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.600
and the dad was on the top bunk.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.290
And I was just looking,
and observing at how

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.390
everyone was interacting.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:27.210
And I remember there was a
guy in a wheelchair with--

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.980
both of his legs were gone,
and half of his arm was gone.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:37.170
And he held his POW flag
high with the American flag

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.190
on the wheelchair.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:48.270
And I just remember
having that experience was

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.100
this giant leap for me
in recognizing what I

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.960
wanted do in terms of my life.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.135
And just really being humbled.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.200
And yeah, I was sitting there.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.210
And I had just finished doing
"All's Well That Ends Well,"

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.070
so I had a little bit
of money in my pocket.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.390
So I was trying to find out what
was I going to do with that.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.510
And it wasn't a lot of
money, summer stock.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.150
You guys--

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.960
So yeah, so I decided, I'm
going to get on a Greyhound bus.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.720
And if I'm going
to be homeless, I'd

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.430
rather go be
homeless in New York,

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.290
because that's
where my dreams are.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.490
And so I got on a Greyhound bus.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:37.150
And a friend of mine who
was also doing summer stock,

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.270
he had went to
ACT San Francisco,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.510
which is the American
Conservatory Theater there.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.517
And I had met him
during "Julius Caesar,"

00:31:44.517 --> 00:31:45.850
and I had got in touch with him.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.700
And he was like,
"Well, you can stay

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.020
at my place for a month or two
until you can find a place."

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.300
This was 2002.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.490
And yeah, so I got
on a Greyhound bus

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.030
and made my way across
the country to New York.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.560
And that's how I started.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.670
I started by actually spitting
poetry on the streets,

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.590
and selling jewelry
on the streets.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.030
That was how I ate
when I first got here,

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.720
and I just worked my way up.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.940
So by the time that I read the
script of "In Transit," which

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.270
I had been in New York for
almost 10 years at that point.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.200
And they say that it's
a 10-year journey.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.349
I've heard this rumor.

00:32:28.349 --> 00:32:30.390
And I read the script,
and I was like, "Wow, this

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.560
is kind of like my life."

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:37.590
I was like, it's finally
a role that I'm right for.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.351
Yeah.

00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.100
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.070
I want to come back
to this for a second,

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.270
but if anybody
has questions, you

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.645
should start lining
up over here,

00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:45.750
and we can take your
question in a second.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.949
There was-- for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:47.949 --> 00:32:49.490
CHESNEY SNOW: Oh,
look at that light!

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.470
The light.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.337
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:51.337 --> 00:32:53.170
ALAN SEALES: That guy
has to ask a question.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.412 --> 00:32:56.870
So for the last 10
years or so, you

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.820
were saying that you've been
doing some education as well,

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.490
right?

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.940
CHESNEY SNOW: Yeah.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.610
Me, and I think there are a
few other teaching artists--

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.430
I know Moya also, we
share this passion.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.790
Because, well,
when I was a kid--

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.340
when I was about 13,
14, my family and I,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.190
we were homeless, my
sister and my mom.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.210
And so I got to this place
called Platteville, Wisconsin.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:26.390
And it was an
English teacher that

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.970
really turned my life around
by giving us a Shakespeare

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.500
assignment.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.540
And it was in that
Shakespeare assignment

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.800
that I was first introduced
to the magic of theater.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.090
And because I was
in a place where

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.120
I didn't have much
self-esteem, and being

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.620
the only black kid in the
school, I was kind of isolated.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.110
And so theater was a way for me
to feel confident and escape.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.880
And so I really feel
in a lot of ways

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.360
that it saved my
life in many ways.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.890
Really, it did.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.600
Because it gave me
an understanding

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.259
of my own brilliance.

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:09.800
There's so many things in this
world that can tell you you're

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.310
not brilliant,
you're not brilliant,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.030
you're not brilliant.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.739
But there are so many different
types of intelligence,

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.260
as I'm sure you all
at Google are aware.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.489
But yeah, so I always
wanted to give back.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.850
So I've been working
and teaching beat--

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.000
I teach beatbox at the
Lavelle School for the Blind

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.350
with my man Taylor McFarrin,
another great a capella artist.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.650
And we use beatboxing
as a way to help

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.900
students who are blind that
have multiple disabilities

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.399
communicate.

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:45.409
So we started that
program there,

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.810
and that's still going strong.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.090
And then I've been working
in the New York City

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.770
public schools as a teaching
artist for about ten years.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.630
ALAN SEALES: That's incredible.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.340
There was something you
said in an interview

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.423
I was watching last night.

00:34:56.423 --> 00:34:58.250
You said, "You may
not like everybody.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.450
You may not know everybody.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.670
But everybody is
singing backup to you."

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.010
CHESNEY SNOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.360
ALAN SEALES: Just wanted
to leave that right there.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.730
It's important for
the corporate dynamic.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.672
Yeah.

00:35:08.672 --> 00:35:11.047
Take a question?

00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:11.880
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.820
Thanks for being here.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.445
First of all, you
all sound incredible.

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.202
I'm really excited
to come see the show.

00:35:16.202 --> 00:35:17.702
A few of you mentioned
that you have

00:35:17.702 --> 00:35:19.610
no previous a
capella experience.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.944
Have you found that you had
to change the way you sing?

00:35:21.944 --> 00:35:24.110
I mean, especially if you
have Broadway backgrounds,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.500
you're used to belting, or
doing the star in the middle

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.250
of the show thing.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.520
MARGO SEIBERT: Oh, god.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.415
AUDIENCE: Have
you found that you

00:35:31.415 --> 00:35:33.560
had to change the way
your voice sounds, to fit

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.916
in with this kind of a sound?

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:36.790
MARGO SEIBERT: That's
a great question, and--

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.498
TELLY LEUNG: Yes.

00:35:37.498 --> 00:35:40.250
MARGO SEIBERT: I do
do this in the show.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.290
Absolutely.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.330
So with these kind of
intense orchestrations

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:50.180
that Deke created with
our 10 voices together,

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.390
we are serving you
musical instruments.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.390
So there's a lot of time when
vibrato isn't necessarily

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.920
appropriate when
you're streamlining

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.000
sound to make a very
specific instrumental, yes.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.680
And also then to
blend with everyone,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.030
because if everyone's vibrato's
going at the same time,

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.690
you know, it might be
really fun and less--

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.740
and less good.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.230
So yeah, there's a--

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.170
Telly and I both
share the [HUMMING],

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.200
like when we're making a--

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:24.905
what is that?

00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:25.530
Is that a bass?

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.363
TELLY LEUNG: Guitar.

00:36:26.363 --> 00:36:28.640
MARGO SEIBERT:
It's a bass guitar.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.954
So yes to your question.

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.370
TELLY LEUNG: It
is hard, because I

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.890
feel like in a
traditional Broadway

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.769
show, as a soloist,
you want to ride up--

00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:38.810
I feel like I'm trying to
ride above an orchestra

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.770
at all times.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.190
But in this, oftentimes, the
blend is what's important.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.890
Everybody singing the same
vowel is what's important.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.756
And the discipline
that it takes-- that

00:36:48.756 --> 00:36:49.880
took the longest, actually.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.410
This is actually much harder
than actually belting a tune

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.740
to the back row of the theater.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.729
This is much harder.

00:36:55.729 --> 00:36:57.770
NICHOLAS WARD: I think in
a normal Broadway show,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.980
you start rehearsal day
one with music rehearsal.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.530
This one, we started
music rehearsal

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.450
before we started
rehearsal, where

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.409
we sat in a room for eight hours
a day for almost two weeks--

00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:10.700
MOYA ANGELA: "In Transit" jail.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.033
NICHOLAS WARD: And it was like--

00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:15.470
and I think for a lot of us, we
were kind of like, "Oh, my god.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.110
How am I going to sing
for eight hours everyday?"

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.180
And thank god Rick was
so cool, because he

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.430
knew when we started
looking a little crazy,

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.290
we need to take a break.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.250
He did.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.650
But at the same time,
he slowly started

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.650
creating the foundation
of the show, which was us

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.510
not being soloists.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.250
And really making
sure that if you

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:38.360
can't hear the person sitting
next to you, then you're wrong.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.540
And he would say it with a
smile in a nice, nasty way.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.790
On Thursdays, it was
a little extra shady.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:44.370
MARGO SEIBERT: Shady Thursday.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.244
NICHOLAS WARD: So we
have now Shady Thursday.

00:37:46.244 --> 00:37:47.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:47.712 --> 00:37:50.210
But that's how the
foundation of the show was.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.430
And I think it took us
all probably a good week

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.840
before we retrained our
voices and our minds

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.460
to think of singing a show.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.180
Because normally you stand in
front, and you sing the song.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.240
Now it's really,
we're all one body

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.931
supporting the people telling
the story in front of us.

00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:08.680
RICK HIP-FLORES: As a
point of comparison,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.010
no show that I've ever done
has ever had more than two

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.620
or three full days of
rehearsal at the top.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.410
So we started with
10, and I remember

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.420
writing to Kathleen
Marshall at the beginning.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.461
I said, "Is this correct?

00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:21.405
10 days of rehearsal?

00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:23.530
10 days, eight hours a day
of just singing, sitting

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.440
in chairs with music stands?"

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.690
And she was like, "Yeah, yeah.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.449
You can do that."

00:38:27.449 --> 00:38:29.490
And I was like, "Oh, this
is going to be murder."

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:35.200
But by the end of it,
I was so optimistic

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.907
going forward, because they
put up with it so well.

00:38:37.907 --> 00:38:39.490
I mean, that takes
a tremendous amount

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.370
of focus and concentration
to learn a score like that,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.570
and with these 10-part
harmonies for basically 80

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.250
hours of rehearsal straight.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.750
And the fact that
they could do that

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.772
made me know that they
could do anything.

00:38:51.772 --> 00:38:53.980
NICHOLAS WARD: We would all
go home and cry at night.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.850
I'm not kidding.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:59.080
I remember-- normally, you get
a score, and the score is--

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.250
what is it called?

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.450
8 1/2 by 11.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.840
Our score-- because
it's rectangular.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.430
TELLY LEUNG: A4 paper, and
it's printed horizontally.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.215
NICHOLAS WARD:
Horizontally, thank you.

00:39:09.215 --> 00:39:11.200
TELLY LEUNG: 11-part
harmony the entire time!

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.800
So you're constantly
just flipping pages.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.676
It's a little insane.

00:39:14.676 --> 00:39:16.883
ALAN SEALES: Is the beatboxing
written on there, too,

00:39:16.883 --> 00:39:18.749
or did you get to make
up your own thing?

00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:19.330
CHESNEY SNOW: I'm sorry?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.454
ALAN SEALES: Did you get
to make up your own thing?

00:39:21.454 --> 00:39:23.590
Everything you do
every night, is it set?

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.400
It's locked in?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.358
CHESNEY SNOW: The beatbox
and the score is set.

00:39:26.358 --> 00:39:31.430
I mean, it's
developed over years.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:36.530
So at first, there really
wasn't percussion just laid out.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.820
We were exploring and
building it over the years,

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.740
mostly Russ Kaplan
really laid it down.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.247
And so yeah, it is
written now, there.

00:39:49.247 --> 00:39:50.330
ALAN SEALES: That's crazy.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.560
CHESNEY SNOW: It had to
start from somewhere.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.000
ALAN SEALES: So there
is-- oh, go ahead.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.041
GERIANNE PEREZ: You guys
developed a lot of that,

00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:57.700
though, in that
first 10 days, right?

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.690
CHESNEY SNOW: No,
I think it was just

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.150
over the Off-Broadway
for a lot of the songs,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.200
and then through the
developments that we did,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.426
the readings and stuff.

00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:11.300
ALAN SEALES: So the a
capella genre, I guess,

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.570
subculture, within mostly
college-age people,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.080
I would suspect, has a very
specific set of groupies,

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.940
and followers, and whatnot.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.430
Have you found that has
transitioned to this show?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.884
Do you have a capella groupies?

00:40:23.884 --> 00:40:26.050
GERIANNE PEREZ: We've got
some pretty great Fansits.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.240
We like to call them In Fansits.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.600
NICHOLAS WARD: I
didn't know that!

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.480
GERIANNE PEREZ: Yeah!

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.980
There are a couple
of people that we

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.880
see at the stage door that
have come quite a few times.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.560
And they're just so happy that
they get the chance to see it

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.430
over and over again.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.580
Because what they say is
that there's so much going on

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.310
on the stage, because it's
such an ensemble-based show,

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.020
they can follow
different things.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.609
Every time they come and see
it, whether it's five, 10 times,

00:40:47.609 --> 00:40:50.150
they'll see something different
and hear something different.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.534
And that's kind
of really lovely.

00:40:51.534 --> 00:40:53.450
ADAM BASHIAN: One of
them gave me a note once,

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.756
which I thought was adorable.

00:40:54.756 --> 00:40:56.440
GERIANNE PEREZ: Yes,
I got a note, too!

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.940
ADAM BASHIAN: Because
I was on for--

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.815
I don't think I was--

00:40:58.815 --> 00:40:59.990
I think I was on for David.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.370
And she says, "Oh!

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.990
When the redheaded
guy does that,

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.939
he usually goes this way."

00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:06.480
NICHOLAS WARD: Oh,
that kind of note.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.956
ADAM BASHIAN: OK!

00:41:07.956 --> 00:41:09.410
GERIANNE PEREZ: Noted!

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.390
Duly noted.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.306
ADAM BASHIAN: It's like,
"well, I go this way.

00:41:12.306 --> 00:41:13.320
Thank you."

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.790
No, it was very sweet.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.280
But yes, they come quite a bit.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.780
NICHOLAS WARD: You know she's
going to be back in that stage

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.969
door with another note.

00:41:19.969 --> 00:41:21.760
AURELIA WILLIAMS: It's
interesting to go in

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.150
as a cover.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.410
So me, Bradley, and Adam--

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.020
we all cover more than one role.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:35.330
And so it's kind of interesting
when you go in for something

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.550
that you're not
the normal person.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.160
And so coming out,
there's this guy.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.919
He's a young guy,
kind of a big guy.

00:41:42.919 --> 00:41:43.460
I don't know!

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.290
He came, he was like, "This
is my fifth time coming.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.550
I saw you last time you were
on as the woman in the leopard

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.070
print, and now you're--"

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.500
And I was just like, "Wow!"

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.790
He's made it to--

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.470
and when I would come
out, while I was on,

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.521
I must have seen him at
least four or five times.

00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:02.520
And I was like, "How'd
he have money to do that?

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.280
That's amazing!"

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.990
CHESNEY SNOW: I
also think that it's

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.360
another reason that
it catches on, too, is

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.750
because unlike a lot
of Broadway shows,

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.300
this is really New York's show.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.850
I mean, if you're a New
Yorker, if you've lived here

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:23.060
for six months, you're going
to find elements of your life

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.790
in this show, because
New York itself is

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.490
a character in the show.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:33.830
And so I think that people
love to come and see

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.590
those hustles, and that
struggle, and that joy,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.454
and the quirks of what
it is to live here.

00:42:39.454 --> 00:42:41.870
NICHOLAS WARD: To that point,
too, I think a lot of people

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.200
come thinking a
capella is the show.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.134
I think people think that--

00:42:47.134 --> 00:42:48.800
early on, we did a
talk back, and people

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.510
thought they were coming
to an a capella concert.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.310
And I think actually, a capella,
even though it's amazing,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.470
and it's a really cool
feature of the show,

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.720
I think the truth is
really the heart of all

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.870
the different stories,
and it's so relatable.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.150
And it's so tangible
for every person.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.720
Every person at the stage
door-- old, young, black, white,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.400
Asian, we get them all--

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.610
they all really attach onto
different parts of the story.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.980
And that's what's,
I think, to this day

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.590
that's still resonating so
much with our audiences.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.980
And why people come
back, because they

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.112
might be somebody that's
now going to school

00:43:24.112 --> 00:43:25.070
on their second career.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.780
And they're like, "I was Jane.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.250
I was trying to do it.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.236
And I didn't get my break."

00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:32.360
And so therefore, they come
back, and they're like,

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.180
"I want to see it again,
because she's living my story."

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.220
Or the gay couple.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.389
I'm from the South, so I
know a lot of that stuff.

00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:41.180
And there's a lot of
people that feel that.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.659
And so it's really, I think,
the cool thing about our show.

00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:46.950
ALAN SEALES: One more question.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.575
AUDIENCE: This isn't
really a question,

00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:50.460
but my mom and I have
a tradition where

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.410
every few months, she
comes to visit me here,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.610
and we see a Broadway show.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.300
And the last show that we saw
was actually "In Transit."

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.275
And when I told her
that "In Transit" was

00:43:59.275 --> 00:44:00.900
doing a talk at my
work today, she just

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.370
told me to forward
her compliments

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.600
and thank you guys
for what you do,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.058
because we really
enjoyed the show.

00:44:05.058 --> 00:44:06.510
MARGO SEIBERT: Thanks, Mom.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.140
NICHOLAS WARD: What's
your mom's name?

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.800
AUDIENCE: Aria.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.799
NICHOLAS WARD: Hi, Aria!

00:44:09.799 --> 00:44:11.018
Thank you!

00:44:11.018 --> 00:44:12.946
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.940
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for coming.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.702
I wanted to come
back to this idea

00:44:17.702 --> 00:44:19.410
that New York is a
character in the show,

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.970
because this is
one of the things

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.110
that I really enjoyed about it.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.980
But we walked out of
it saying, is this

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.920
going to limit sort of
the reach of the show?

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.410
Is someone who comes
from rural Kansas

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.830
really going to enjoy it as
much as someone who lives here?

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.454
And have you seen any of that?

00:44:36.454 --> 00:44:38.370
MOYA ANGELA: We get that
all the time, though.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:41.246
We get big groups from--

00:44:41.246 --> 00:44:42.120
CHESNEY SNOW: Brazil.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.730
MOYA ANGELA: And
the thing about it

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.360
is, yes, it's a New York show.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.880
But the stories that we
tell, and the situations

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.020
that are happening on stage
are super relatable to anybody.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.220
And so it's just something
everyone can connect to.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.110
CHESNEY SNOW: And
just to add to that,

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.090
there is this thing
that I always--

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.020
because I hear that, too.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.460
But one of the things that
it's important to remember

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.210
is the iconic
nature of this city.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:13.860
It's like, I remember
being in Bhutan

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.995
and seeing people with
the New York hats on.

00:45:16.995 --> 00:45:21.180
I mean, literally, in the
mountains of Nepal and seeing

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.750
people, seeing young kids
who-- that country pretty much

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.730
just got opened up to
YouTube not too long ago.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.730
But there's this--
unlike most cities,

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:38.700
New York has this
larger than life brand.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.130
And so I think that
when you come here,

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.560
it's easy to relate to it.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.300
My family came from
Oklahoma City--

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.680
completely related to the
show, because of the nature

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.760
of what New York is.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.176
MARGO SEIBERT:
It's also stories--

00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:57.690
sorry-- the stories that
they've heard about the subway.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.773
It's like, then you don't
have to ride the subway.

00:45:59.773 --> 00:46:01.520
You can just come
see "In Transit."

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.425
And I've had people be like,
"I've heard of that happening!"

00:46:04.425 --> 00:46:07.290
And they feel like
they're part of it, which

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.550
is great for out-of-towners.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.341
TELLY LEUNG: I mean,
at the end of the day,

00:46:10.341 --> 00:46:11.720
these are very human stories.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.980
And the thing about New
York that makes it unique

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.430
is that it's the
humanity all on steroids,

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.680
because we're all, the
millions of people, all crowded

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.220
together.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.740
And the common denominator
happens to be the train.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.580
AURELIA WILLIAMS:
The subway, yeah!

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.050
TELLY LEUNG: No matter
how much money you make,

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.633
and who you are, sometimes the
fastest way to get from point A

00:46:27.633 --> 00:46:28.710
to point B is the train.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.670
AURELIA WILLIAMS: It's
the most efficient.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:30.060
TELLY LEUNG: Right!

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.060
It's the most efficient.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.660
So I feel like it's very
human stories, just told

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.460
in a setting where it's
humanity on steroids,

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.400
is what I think of it.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.885
AURELIA WILLIAMS: I mean,
I'm from New Jersey--

00:46:39.885 --> 00:46:40.990
[AUDIENCE WHOOPING]

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.975
--which-- oh, hey!

00:46:42.975 --> 00:46:45.450
Jersey in the house!

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.458
I live in Connecticut
now, though-- ooh, sorry.

00:46:47.458 --> 00:46:49.728
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.080
But what's funny is even in
New Jersey, it's not that far.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.660
I grew up 20 miles from Midtown.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.580
And we came out, but
we didn't come out

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.900
that much, and just because of
the apprehension of New York

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.574
being this big,
scary place where

00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:06.740
somebody's going to rob you.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.030
And, you know, the subway
is a big, scary place.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.094
I think that the New York
story part that you see,

00:47:17.094 --> 00:47:19.260
it's something that you get
whether you've been here

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.480
for 10 years or 10 minutes.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.280
When you come in,
there's a certain thing

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.250
that you are
slammed by, and it's

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.840
part of why you travel here.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.270
And I think that people get it.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.770
You know?

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:29.910
They get it.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.040
NICHOLAS WARD: It's why
"Friends" was so famous.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.380
GERIANNE PEREZ: And
"Sex in the City."

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.290
NICHOLAS WARD: And
"Sex and the City."

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.960
Not everybody that watched
"Friends" or "Sex and the City"

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.870
lived in New York, but
yet the comedy of it

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.376
is they're caricatures
of life experience.

00:47:43.376 --> 00:47:45.750
And that's why people are like
"Oh my gosh, that's crazy,

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:46.750
and it's funny.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.250
Oh my god."

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:49.180
Because it's true.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.690
ALAN SEALES: Well,
we are at time here,

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.460
so I want to wrap this up.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.300
Go see them at Circle in the
Square at 235 West 50th Street.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.150
But before you get up--

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:05.674
I would love it-- could you
guys do one more song for us?

00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:07.036
AURELIA WILLIAMS:
Sure, we can do that.

00:48:07.036 --> 00:48:08.077
I think we could do that.
