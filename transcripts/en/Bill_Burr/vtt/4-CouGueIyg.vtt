00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.320
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:09.100
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.090
just checking in on you mother fuckers.

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.160
Um,
Jesus Christ.
It is three 48 in the morning.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.230
I'm a little jet lagged here,
knocking out the podcast.

6
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.030
I just did a two shows on a,

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.680
what would be at Tuesday and Wednesday here in Liverpool.

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.990
And um,
at the Liverpool Phil Harmonic,

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.360
they had a little drum kit back there.
I didn't have any earplugs.

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.070
I ended up realize that they were going to give me one,

11
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.240
so messed around on it a little bit,
but the fucking crowds were amazing.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.970
All of my jokes seem to be working on this side of the pond.

13
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.110
There were a couple of things that I had to make minor adjustments to.

14
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.750
<v 0>What are the lines people don't get,</v>

16
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:02.020
but I'm leaving it in the fucking special anyways.
I don't give a shit,

17
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:06.460
but this thing's ready to go.
I am very excited,

18
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:10.310
very relaxed.
I'm in a great place and um,

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.140
I want to thank everybody who came out on a school night,

20
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.000
Tuesday and Wednesday.
I could not have had a better time.
And thank you to,

21
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.260
uh,
create scans who opened up for me.
Um,

22
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.040
I had a great time working with him.
He fucking killed both shows.
Um,

23
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
which I always like.
I hate doing a show where,
you know,

24
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.910
I like it wire to wire,
everybody does a good job.

25
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.990
So there's none of that bathroom break bullshit.
Um,

26
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.270
while people are on stage,
you know,
so underrated Liverpool,

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.280
beautiful Goddamn city also helped that the weather was perfect.

28
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.940
Um,
I guess,
you know,
she usually gloomy and rainy around these parts,
but uh,

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.950
we got to sunny days and tonight Liverpool had a game and people still came out

30
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.590
to my show,
which was very flattering.
And uh,

31
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:10.591
I kinda got all back into the whole premier league shit as a Liverpool one.

32
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.420
So I guess you get three points for winning.
And last I checked,

33
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.530
they were like one point ahead of man's city.
All right.

34
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.060
Now this is what's interesting.

35
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:23.350
Liverpool is backed by American dollars.

36
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.280
All right?

37
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280
Man City is backed by Saudi and Saudi Arabian money.

38
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.030
<v 0>Now we buy oil from Saudi Arabia.
So in a lot of a bunch of it.</v>

40
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.060
So in a lot of ways they're also in around about way back

41
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.410
by American dollars.
But for what I heard,

42
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:52.820
rumor has it is we got more oil in our country at this point than they do.

43
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.070
So I don't know how to do this fucking math.

44
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.900
All I know is the owner of the Red Sox owns uh,
Liverpool.

45
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.680
And you didn't realize how fucking insane it would be if the owner of the red

46
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.681
sox owned him right through the curse of the babe ended that curse.

47
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.560
And from what I heard,
Liverpool is never won that Premiere Championship.

48
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.650
There's 10 fucking games left.

49
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.470
So all they gotta do is keep winning.
There's no playoffs,

50
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.430
which play offs,

51
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:29.431
which blows my mind because they're leaving so much money on the table.

52
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.840
Like who am I as an employer?
My thing,
who am I as an American?

53
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.590
This is what Americans do.
It's what fucking English people do.

54
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.340
You barge in and you fucking put your own ideas as somebody else's foreign land.

55
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.860
So why not?
You guys got to have a play off.

56
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.370
This is like college football all over again.

57
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.650
Everybody would pitch at the end of the fucking year.

58
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.430
It's a little bit different.
That's actually,
it's a lot different.

59
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:59.050
It actually kind of makes sense,
but I don't know.
Call me a stupid American,

60
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.460
but they had a fucking play off.

61
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.230
Like what if you know you,

62
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.420
if you play all fucking year and and you lose by one point so you don't get the

63
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.520
championship,
you're one point less.

64
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.521
Let's say it ended today in Liverpool Beats Man City by one point.

65
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:21.850
What if they just fucking had one more game?

66
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
The top two teams or what if they had a special thing that if the top two teams,

67
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.820
if you're within five fucking points,

68
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.200
if you're in second place by five points of or less,

69
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.380
you've earned a playoff game and they play a one game winner takes fucking all.

70
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.480
All right.

71
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.320
You're going to tell me like how many fucking people are going to tune in for

72
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.490
that,
you know?

73
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:52.960
Instead of having all these fucking games going on at the same time.
Hey Bill,

74
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.280
you know,
I don't know if you've noticed,

75
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.320
but the league's pretty functionally successful.

76
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:59.110
We really don't need your fucking ideas.
I Dunno.
Sorry,

77
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.690
I just grew up with playoffs.
Playoffs.
Um,

78
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.940
so anyways,
uh,

79
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.040
that's fucking was pretty exciting and the next time I really got into it,

80
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.251
you know,

81
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:15.010
everybody was walking around today with this scarves on and saw this guy with a

82
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:19.630
suit on.
He was going to work,
but he's still at a white shirt on with a red tie.

83
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.400
Clearly s like supporting his team.
Like people were fucking into it.

84
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.250
It killed me.
It killed me to not go to that game.

85
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.280
Obviously I did had a great time doing the show,
but like,

86
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:31.480
just to know that that was right there.

87
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.950
Most Sal is playing in these fucking like the Wayne Gretzky of soccer right now

88
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.690
and I'd have a chance to see another great athlete live.

89
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.670
Uh,
next time I come back I'm going to be drinking.

90
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.410
I figure I'll do a one off show here the day before the day after.

91
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.850
Probably the day after.
It'd be better if there was a game right now.
Wait,

92
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.800
do the show first and then,
then I do the game,

93
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.260
then I get all banged up and I go to the fucking game and I'll put a bunch of

94
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.980
money on Liverpool.
That way I'll give a fuck.
Um,

95
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.010
I still don't understand why the defense is allowed to stop fucking running.

96
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.510
And then you're off sides.
If that's the case,

97
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:17.740
why don't you just put four fat lady's back on defense that can't fucking run.

98
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.240
Yeah.
And then they'd never get near your net.
Right.

99
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.700
Just have them sitting down in the grass playing with the fucking daisies.

100
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.140
I don't get it.
Whatever.
Somebody will explain it to me.
Um,

101
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.250
so,
uh,
I got to tell you about a,

102
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.430
a little medical episode that I had.

103
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.380
So I flew over here from New York City.
Uh,
I don't remember if I,

104
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.000
I was so fucked up.
I don't remember if I even told you this.
Did I?

105
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.960
I did I already tell the story about almost faint.
Well,

106
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:52.140
I figured out why I almost fainted in the elevator.
Right.

107
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.390
I already told you this stuff's right.
I told it on Monday.

108
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.500
Recap real quickly is I,

109
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.400
the day after I flew from New York to La,
I mean to,
uh,

110
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.130
to Manchester took the train over to Liverpool.
Um,
they had a fucking steam.

111
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.310
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.330
<v 0>And they had a sauna and I went to the sauna and I was in there and I wasn't</v>

113
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:15.550
sweating.
I'm just like,
it didn't feel hot.
I'm like,
what the eff,

114
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:19.000
this fucking thing sucks.
And then I went to the steam and I was like,
all right,

115
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.880
this is better.
And then when I left,
I had to walk up a flight of stairs.

116
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:23.110
When I got to the elevator,
like,
dude,

117
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.220
I almost went down like the closest I've come to fainting

118
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.430
ever,
other than from alcohol,
just doing the fucking face plant.
So

119
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.890
I was blaming their sauna,

120
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.370
thinking it was that shit that heats you up from the inside.

121
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:42.830
And I didn't realize how fucking hot I was,
but,
uh,

122
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:47.660
when I told a few people what happened,
um,
it was,

123
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.770
I was dehydrated from the f I don't think I drank enough water when I was in New

124
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.090
York.
So I was already a little dehydrated.

125
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.060
Then I got on a seven hour fuck six and a half,
seven hour flight,

126
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.910
and then didn't drink water and then took a sauna and a fucking steam.
So,

127
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.770
and then all my symptoms,
like I fucking,
when I went into the locker room,

128
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:07.910
I was by myself and all of a sudden I was like,
oh my God,

129
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:11.930
I got to fucking sit down.
And then I was like dry heaving.

130
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.000
And I was like,
oh my God,
what the fuck I'm going to Puke.

131
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:21.560
And then I didn't puke and there was nobody in the locker room.
And then

132
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.930
<v 3>after that,
then all of a sudden it wanted to come out the other end,</v>

133
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:29.380
not to get fucking gross,
but,
uh,
it did.

134
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:33.220
And I think that toilet is retired and somebody told me,
said,

135
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.400
all of these are signs of you are dehydrated,
your dehydrated.

136
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:41.430
I saw I was dehydrated before I took a fucking sauna and a steam and my dumb ass

137
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:45.640
almost fucking passed out.
Did I tell you this story?
I can't remember.

138
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.480
<v 0>No wait,
I didn't.
I didn't.</v>

139
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:54.620
That's right because I had to show that night and when I did the show there was

140
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.860
a couple of,
when I,
I ramped up the energy and I was like touching my toes,

141
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.780
doing something.
I came back up fast.
I was like,

142
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.620
Oh fuck am I going to pass out right here on stage?
Um,
dude,

143
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:06.210
I got on the fucking elevator

144
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.790
and this other guy going on with me and I was just leaning

145
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.700
on the fucking like armrest there that the rail and I was just staring at the

146
00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:17.420
ground.

147
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.940
And you know that deal when you think you're going to faint and you just trying

148
00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:23.330
to keep yourself cool and every time you think you hit the top like,
okay,

149
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:26.060
I could deal with this.
I can maintain my consciousness.

150
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.540
It goes a little higher and you let go fuck off.
Fuck,
hang in there.

151
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.510
And I can't remember if the dude was talking to me or not.

152
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.260
I think he said something to people.
And I got off,
I got off at the wrong floor,

153
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:39.500
so I had to walk down a flight of stairs and I got to the first set of first

154
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:43.760
step and just sat down.
And then the guy looked at me,
he goes,

155
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.850
are you okay?
All right.

156
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.470
Now if I was a woman,
I would be like,
no,
I need help.

157
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.260
I have a family and a child that's depending on me to not die.
Right?

158
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.200
But I'm a man.
So of course I said,
yeah,
I'm fine.

159
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.440
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

160
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.980
<v 0>dude,
I was,
I was not fine.
Yeah.
And He,
you know,</v>

161
00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:11.450
he's a guy.
So he's like,
alright,

162
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.180
well this is emotionally weird to deal with this with another guy.

163
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:15.200
And he just fucking left.

164
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.870
So I sat on the fucking stairs for like,
I dunno,

165
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.470
like another like minute.

166
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.970
And I slowly walked down the stairs and I just,
uh,

167
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.060
I,
I've made it into the,
the hotel room.
And at that point I,

168
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.380
uh,
I asked club soda.
Kenny,
I just texted him,
said,

169
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:38.660
bring me a Gatorade and some fucking waters and shit.

170
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:40.520
So I just pounded that and I was all right,

171
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:45.080
but Jesus Christ or freckles almost went down all freckle.
Okay,

172
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.620
here's one for you.
If you're a fucking dumb ass like me,

173
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:52.910
and you get on a plane and fly for six hours more or more and you're already

174
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.720
dehydrated yet,
don't go take a fucking sauna.
And then two,

175
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.530
I took two steams cause I was like that Saunas not doing shit.

176
00:11:00.531 --> 00:11:02.570
And then when I went into the steam room,
I thought I was sweating.

177
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:07.430
It was just the fucking steam.
And then I went back in again,
fucking idiot.

178
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.990
Um,
but other than that,
I had a great time here.

179
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.290
Uh,
you know,
checked out the Beatles statue.

180
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:17.000
I did a couple of like touristy things,

181
00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:19.610
but other than that I just tried to walk around and look at a lot of beautiful

182
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.710
buildings and everything.
Really,
really great city.

183
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.820
And the people were cool as shit.
And uh,

184
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:26.720
I kept striking out with the food though.

185
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.770
Jesus Christ's eight at this fucking Italian place.
Who the fuck?

186
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:33.410
I know fucking asshole gets a Tahlia in Liverpool,
England.

187
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.710
I went,
I ordered these fucking,
I got some oysters cause you know,

188
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:43.150
I'm trying to keep my figure for my special.
So what are some oysters?
Okay.

189
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.330
And I'm thinking,
you know,
there's water right here,
these oysters gotta be fresh.

190
00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:50.080
Did that taste fresh at all?
And then I got one of those,
those uh,

191
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.860
you know those rice balls tines make is like,
it's fucking rice.

192
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.320
It's almost like a result.
It's got like cheese in it and then they deep fried.

193
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.600
It's fucking,
that was my little,
that was my cheat meal.
Right.

194
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.090
So I order those things that shows up with like truffles on it.

195
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.560
It was the blandest.
Yeah.

196
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.400
I never sent back food and I just don't have the fucking

197
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.280
courage to do it because you guys send me in stories about sending back food in

198
00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:15.330
like what happens?

199
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.230
Cause I'm always of the belief they're going to get mad at you and then they're

200
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.550
going to spit on your food.
But like these fucking things was so bad.

201
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:29.450
There was like,
there was no fixing it.
You know what I mean?
It's not like,

202
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.330
Oh hey,
this is medium rare.
Could you make it medium?
It's just like,

203
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.990
this tastes like the person who cooked it doesn't know how to cook.

204
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.280
Is this bringing your fucking six year old to workday and they fucking made my

205
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.420
rice balls here.

206
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.620
<v 0>And I just was like,
you know what?
I'm not fucking eat.
This is,</v>

208
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:47.490
this is how rebellion,

209
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.150
this is the most rebellious I've ever been in a restaurant because I worked in

210
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:55.650
one and I never want,
I always tip well even if they fucking suck.
So I,

211
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.760
I ate one of them and I was just like,

212
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.820
I am not going to out of politeness and how my parents raised me to not waste

213
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:08.890
food,
eat these other five fucking things,

214
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:11.860
and then have to get on an elliptical and work off something that I didn't even

215
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:15.790
enjoy.
So I just set it to the fucking side and eight,

216
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:20.791
my fishy oysters and the waitress came back around and she goes,

217
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.420
okay.
She's like,
how was everything?
And I said,
what?
I always say great.

218
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.130
It was all great.
It was awesome.

219
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.490
And she's looking clearly seeing that I barely touched it.
She goes,

220
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:33.670
everything was fine.
And I was like,
yeah it was great.
Can I just get the check?

221
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.260
And that was it.
So the upside is with,

222
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.090
with being dehydrated

223
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.080
and almost puking and shitting and fucking eaten this shit food over here.
I,
I,

224
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.520
I've actually drop some pounds cause laid off the booze doesn't hurt either.

225
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.653
Um,

226
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.720
so anyways isn't a thing I learned by the way.

227
00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:59.970
I'm just gonna keep saying anyways cause I can't stop saying it.

228
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.020
I like to think it's part of my charm.
Um,

229
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.400
I've always wanted to go to that tt race since I found out about it about six,

230
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:09.234
seven years ago

231
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.600
and I keep trying to book myself on the Isle of man and they just don't have

232
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:17.860
shows there.
I don't know what the deal is.

233
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.650
Well they don't know who I am and they don't give a fuck.

234
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.580
I don't know what it is.

235
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.040
And I just realized today looking at the map that Liverpool is like 45 fucking

236
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.690
minutes flight away.

237
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.470
So I'm thinking of maybe at some point doing a one off show here in flying over

238
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.470
and seeing that race before.
You know,

239
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:43.360
people who don't race motorcycles and don't watch motorcycle racing are so

240
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:45.460
outraged by it that they shut it down.

241
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.263
<v 1>MMM.</v>

242
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.131
<v 0>You know,</v>

243
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:53.570
those are the same fucking people try to get fighting out of hockey and they

244
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:53.841
just,

245
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:58.841
they just try to ruin any sort of gladiator thing that is left in society.

246
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.580
You know what I mean?
Um,
oh,

247
00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:06.820
the latest dead person that people have been going after.

248
00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:10.090
They went after John Wayne now they just,
they went after,
I think Bill Hicks.

249
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.250
It's the stupidest shit ever.

250
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.720
All these white people trying to show how fucking progressive they are by

251
00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:20.500
keeping the limelight off of them and all the mistakes they've made socially in

252
00:15:20.501 --> 00:15:22.570
their lives by now there,

253
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.440
I think they've attacked all the white people they can get that are alive now.

254
00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:29.320
They're going after dead people,
dead white people.

255
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.340
Apparently Davy Crockett was a piece of shit.

256
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.440
I just don't,
how is that helping anything,
you know,

257
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.710
not to mention it's an astoundingly white thing to do.

258
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.060
To think that you have to go back in history to find people like that.

259
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.310
And then it's up to you to redefine how we are perceiving these five.

260
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.360
Why don't you deal with what the fuck's going on now?

261
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.080
That's another really cringe worthy thing.
You know,
when people,

262
00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:02.350
I can't believe in 2019 well that's because you're white.

263
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.130
I'm sorry.
It's just,
I don't,

264
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.330
I'm just so sick of these fucking left the whities patting themselves on the

265
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:14.250
fucking back,
you know,
with all of this shit,

266
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.180
you know,
acting like they're fucking doing something.
It's like,
listen,

267
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:19.290
if you want to get involved,

268
00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:22.200
there's plenty of groups that you can join that go and just,

269
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.920
you can physically take time out of your fucking life to go do something.

270
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.970
Stop Fucking,
I dunno.
I'm just,
you know,

271
00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:33.510
remember that guy used to do the fucking humble brags.
The guy passed away.

272
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.340
He was still around it.

273
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:38.640
Maybe he would do another one that had to do with humble bragging,
but like,

274
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.330
it's in like a social way.
Woke bragging or some shit.
I don't know what it is.

275
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.320
Um,
so anyways,
um,

276
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.320
I actually miss,
I misunderstood when the,
when the,
um,

277
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.010
the thing for Brody was going to be,
uh,
Brody Stevens is going to be,

278
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.430
um,
I don't want him announcing this thing here because it's just for family and

279
00:17:02.431 --> 00:17:04.950
comedians.
They're going to shut down the comedy store,

280
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.510
the shutting the whole fucking thing down,
not making any money that night.

281
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:13.230
This is what this guy meant to the comedy store and everybody that knew and

282
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:17.550
loved them,
this shutting down the entire fucking comedy club March 11th,

283
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.470
and we're going to have a big night remembering him telling stories and all
that.

284
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.970
It's going to be fucking unbelievable.

285
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:28.971
And I feel so thankful that I'm actually going to be in town when this goes down

286
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:33.940
and I can't wait to,
uh,
to go down there and be a part of that.

287
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.830
And um,
what else did I want to say about that?

288
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.660
I can't fucking remember him.
It's not going to have half asleep here.
Oh yeah.

289
00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:48.990
I was also able to call in Brody,
you know,
obviously did a podcast,

290
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.580
the all things comedy network.

291
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.420
And I was talking to one of the people over there and they said today that over

292
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.910
100,
say that again.

293
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.930
100 people showed up,
um,

294
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.700
to be on his final podcast.
All went over,
drove themselves over there,

295
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:12.450
called in ice,
skyped in.
And um,

296
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.810
it just really goes to show you,
uh,
like I,
you know,

297
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.430
I don't think I've ever seen that.
You know,

298
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.570
unfortunately I've seen a lot of people pass away,
but like,
um,

299
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.140
this guy really touched a lot of people,
so you know,

300
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:31.740
if you can take a positive out of something,
so fucking sad,
that is,
uh,

301
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.790
that would definitely be it.
So I imagine at this point,

302
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:39.480
if I actually had the advertising,
I would read some.
So I'm just going to say,

303
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:41.400
Hey,
I'm going to the,
uh,

304
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:45.030
the advertising now and this is where we will edit it in.

305
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.490
All right.
And now we're back.
We're back to the podcast here.
Um,

306
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.600
what else is there to talk about?
I'm going to Glasgow now.

307
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:02.520
What I love about Glasgow aside from the fact that I love,
I love Scotland,

308
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.133
um,

309
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
is I'm a huge ACDC fan and old ACD DC fans like myself all know that the live

310
00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:20.630
album,
if you want blood,
you got it was recorded in Glasgow

311
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.870
and I are for years would listen to that song,
the Jack

312
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.700
and um,
when Bond Scott Sang,
she told me she was a virgin.

313
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.530
He would say something.
I couldn't,
I any virgins,
whatever.

314
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:41.840
I could never understood.
Stand what he was saying.

315
00:19:41.841 --> 00:19:45.200
He was actually saying any virgins in Glasgow,
Glasgow,

316
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.480
I believe that's what he's saying.
And I never,
when I finally went,

317
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.460
I thought it was Glasgow,

318
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.460
so I wasn't saying it right then it went there and I heard how they said at

319
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:59.540
Glasgow,
all of a sudden it just clicked in my head going,
wait a minute,

320
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.090
is this where they fucking recorded that?

321
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.980
So of course I had to figure out where the theater was that they recorded it and

322
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:08.870
I'm like,
I got to fucking play there.

323
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.650
I've got to tell my shit jokes where the greatest rock band,

324
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:13.880
as far as I'm concerned,

325
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.140
rock and roll band ever performed one of the greatest rock alive rock albums

326
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:20.964
ever.

327
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:26.010
And unfortunately I looked it up and it was,
uh,

328
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.360
it no longer exists.
Um,
speaking of which,

329
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:34.260
when you come in and to Liverpool,
they have,
uh,

330
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.920
the club where the Beatles played like 200 shows,

331
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:39.720
like some of their first 200 shows.

332
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.940
And now that I am an experienced tourists,
I said to the driver,
I said,

333
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:48.400
now is this the original place?
Is this the exact place?

334
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.020
Because I remember when I was in London,
everybody,

335
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.800
this is a stupid Abbey road thing where you're walking across the street.

336
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:55.090
I want to be John.
I want to be Paul.

337
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.390
That's not the same crosswalk crosswalk has been moved.

338
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.780
So you're not standing where they stood.
Okay.

339
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.780
So I asked and I'm like,
okay,
now the,
that fucking crosswalk bullshit,

340
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.480
I did that.
And it turned out that they fucking,
you know,

341
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.580
that wasn't where they were.

342
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.030
Now was this club really the place where John Paul Ringo and George all played

343
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:24.910
their first 200 shows,
the cavern club or something like that?

344
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.840
And the guy goes,
he's like,
yeah,
no,
no,
it isn't a

345
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.800
place where they originally played.
It's like a fucking hotel now,

346
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.770
but this is close.
It's on the street.

347
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:39.610
So the best thing you can do is you can walk down the street where they walked

348
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.220
to go to a club that no longer exists.

349
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:45.280
But when you go into the club that they say is the club,

350
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.960
it's not the fucking club.
Oh,
did I take a picture?
I gotta I gotta um,

351
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.950
I don't want to fucking hurt anybody's business here,
but I was with,
uh,

352
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.660
uh,
Andrew thumbless.

353
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:01.810
He sees like shooting stuff for my patrion page on this tour.

354
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:06.070
And we getting ready for my special.
And,
uh,
we went to go,

355
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.140
you know,
he's a huge Beatles fan.

356
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:11.500
So we went down there and we would checking out,
uh,

357
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.750
all of these,
uh,
uh,
come on.
Did I take a picture of it?
Fuck,

358
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:21.610
I didn't take a picture.
God dammit.
We went to this,

359
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.510
this Beatles Museum.
Okay.

360
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.500
Now if you're trying to attract people,
you'd,

361
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.700
it's if you have artifacts from the Beatles,

362
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:35.190
which you want to do is have like a couple of yet yet,

363
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.130
not yet.
Your best ones.
You want to keep your best ones in there also,

364
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.450
it's a let down,
but you got to put something from your top five out front.

365
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.880
So we go to walk into this fucking museum.
He goes,
I want to go in,

366
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.760
and I was like,
all right,
all right.
And he goes,
you don't want to go?

367
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.980
And I go listen to it.
You're fucking huge Beatle fans.

368
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:55.430
I want to ruin this for you.
Let's fucking go in.

369
00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.780
So we go to walk up the steps to go in and I swear to God they have this

370
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.950
mannequin that they dressed like John Lennon and it was just a mannequin and it

371
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:13.510
had the all white suit that he had and it wasn't the white suit,

372
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:18.310
it was just a white suit and they glued or taped a beard to a mannequin's face

373
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:20.080
and put this awful fucking wig on it.

374
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.490
It looked like me when I dress up to do the comedy jam and I just started

375
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:28.420
laughing and I was just like,
Andrew,
I go look at this fucking thing.

376
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.540
If this is what they have to get you in there,

377
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:32.980
what the fuck do they have in there?

378
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:35.380
And he just started laughing and we were just like,
all right,
fuck it,

379
00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:39.190
let's get out of here.
So I think,
I think we made the right move on that one.
Um,

380
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.920
but they did have a lot of cool stuff and we went to another place that,

381
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:45.130
a bunch of cool t shirts and shit.
I tried to find something for my daughter.

382
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.370
I actually couldn't find anything but uh,
I got to get her something.

383
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.263
<v 6>But,
um,</v>

384
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.240
<v 0>I am excited in a couple of days cause I'm,
I'm flying out,
you know,</v>

385
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.910
my family over here and I can't wait.

386
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.520
<v 6>MMM.</v>

387
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.700
<v 0>To see my Kiddo,
I signed up for Skype and that's been a good thing.</v>

388
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:03.620
So I talked to her like three times a day

389
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.960
<v 6>and uh,</v>

390
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.930
<v 0>yeah,
she's Hilarious,
but it's just killing me.
This stuff I'm missing.</v>

391
00:24:09.931 --> 00:24:10.770
Like this morning,

392
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:16.650
my wife was putting socks on her and they had a little teddy bear on it and she

393
00:24:16.651 --> 00:24:18.300
pointed at and she goes,
teddy bear.

394
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.100
And my wife was surprised cause she didn't know she could say that.
And she goes,

395
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.870
my wife goes,
that's right,
teddy bear.

396
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.520
And then my daughter just put her right hand up and she goes,
hi,
five

397
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.600
like fucking bore rat.
And my wife said she fucking like,
oh,

398
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.170
like just keeled over laughing and what's awesome is my daughter.

399
00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:44.720
Like she understands that Shit's funny now.
So now it's the cutest thing ever.

400
00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.630
She laughs and after she left she goes funny.
It's just,

401
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:51.090
it's the greatest thing ever and it's killing me that I'm out here.

402
00:24:51.091 --> 00:24:55.080
So thank you to whoever invented Skype and facetime and all that.
So that's,

403
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.200
that's been helping me out.
Yeah.

404
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.930
<v 6>But um,</v>

405
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.490
<v 0>I'm coming down to the end of it here.
I got a,
uh,</v>

406
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.550
I've got to kill a new hour then I'm very proud of and I can't wait to fucking

407
00:25:06.551 --> 00:25:10.330
unleash this and let it go.
And then just see,
you know,

408
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.110
you know where the next hour leads me.
Uh,

409
00:25:14.111 --> 00:25:17.590
and with that I got to give a shout out here to an amazing musician I saw

410
00:25:17.591 --> 00:25:21.760
tonight,
uh,
Victoria Sharp.
I was in this cigar bar.

411
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.410
I wasn't going to smoke a cigar before my,
uh,
special,
but I had,

412
00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:30.070
I kind of gave in,
I just had to go have one.
You know,
they have this great place,

413
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.660
a puffin rooms here in Liverpool and this woman,

414
00:25:34.661 --> 00:25:37.720
Victoria Sharp,
s h.
A r.

415
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.400
P.
E.
Mmm.
Her Instagram is at Victoria Sharp,

416
00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:48.250
E music and

417
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.863
<v 6>mmm.</v>

418
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.720
<v 0>She was on the piano and like she was so fucking good.</v>

419
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:56.180
It sounded like she was in the other room cause they didn't want to have her

420
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.190
enough playing piano while everybody was smoking.

421
00:25:58.191 --> 00:26:02.150
So she was in the smoke resection and she's playing it,
you know,

422
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.600
she came around and she had this whole list of songs,
anything,

423
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.070
any songs like fucking like 200 fucking songs,
that scene.

424
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.200
But she just went in and I didn't really,

425
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:12.740
she started playing and after they just sound like the same artists over and

426
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:14.870
over again.
I finally that the guys I was with,
I was like,

427
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.300
is that that woman who was just talking to it was so good.
It sounded like a,

428
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.870
like a recording.
Um,

429
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.850
she actually at one point sang happy birthday to this do Jamie who came out to

430
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:26.684
the show

431
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.573
<v 6>and</v>

432
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.990
<v 0>she sang.
It's so good.
I actually,
this is the first time I ever been like,
yeah,</v>

433
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.090
happy birthdays are really good song.
Like she made happy birthday,

434
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:37.530
sounded like a fucking hit song.

435
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.650
So if you ever get a chance to see or checkout on music,

436
00:26:40.651 --> 00:26:45.651
she's on a Instagram at Victoria Sharp with an e at Victoria Sharp music.

437
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.590
Um,
check her out and uh,
I mean she seems like she'd be perfect to,

438
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.760
if you have a private party and you just want to kill a musician that just plays

439
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:59.400
piano and can just crush it doing that,
it's not intrusive,

440
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:02.490
but it adds to the atmosphere.
Can't say enough good things about her.

441
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:05.460
And she was cool as shit when I met her.
All right.
So anyways,

442
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:09.090
thank you to everybody who came out here and Liverpool,
uh,

443
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.080
could not have had a great,

444
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.290
better time and it was a fucking honor to be here and looking forward to going

445
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:17.910
back to Scotland,
been to Glasgow a couple of times,
haven't been in awhile.
So,
uh,

446
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.730
those fucking lunatics,
Scottish people are fucking lunatics.
I love him.
So,
um,

447
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.640
then after that we go to Manchester,
then I think Birmingham,

448
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.960
and then it's off to London and all freckles does a special and getting really

449
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:34.570
fucking excited for this.
So,
ah,
that's it.
Enjoy the music.
And then we have

450
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:35.900
<v 7>a half hour of ways.</v>

451
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.870
There's the afternoon just before finding Monday morning podcast,

452
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.290
Thursday by last year,
five years ago.

453
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.080
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

454
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.250
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

455
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:45.150
February 28th,
2011.

456
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.330
And uh,
that's it for this month.
Pay Your fucking rent still tomorrow.

457
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.570
All right.
Oh,
you pot heads out there sitting on the couch,

458
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:58.500
man.
Woe.
Is it like February?

459
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.080
I like making fun of potheads say they,

460
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.650
they're really fucking defensive individuals.
Um,

461
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.310
every once in a while I make fun of potheads on here and I get a plethora of

462
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:11.430
emails.
Speaking of emails,
uh,

463
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.400
if you'd like to send an email to the podcast,
send it to

464
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.540
bill@thempodcast.com.
That's the new email bill B I l B as in bill,

465
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:26.250
I l l@themmpodcast.com.
All right.

466
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.630
And uh,
yeah,
I make fun of the fucking potheads.
I make fun of him.

467
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:33.090
I was actually having,
I mean I don't give a shit if you do it or not.

468
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.870
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck if that's your ritual.

469
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.480
That's what you have to do.
Do what she does.

470
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.630
Is she having a beer and smoking a joint at the end of the day?
Huh?

471
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.510
Why don't you answer that one there?
Freckle face.

472
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.740
I'll tell you what the difference is.
What I'm doing is legal.

473
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.200
What your doing is doubt.

474
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:56.800
You throw your pot smoking fucking hands in the air.

475
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.800
Let me finish my point.
All right.

476
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.160
You hemp shirt wearing motherfucker.

477
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.600
Um,
yeah,
that's the difference.
That's the only difference.

478
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.940
Cause I don't even think like as far as health goes,

479
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:16.270
I was going to say health wise,
but that,
that word doesn't exist.

480
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.010
I remember from my vocab improvement class way back in high school,
um,

481
00:30:21.011 --> 00:30:25.240
this guy used to talk about the wiseguys health wise,
sports wise,

482
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.050
weather wise,
the wise guys that,
that,
those words do not exist.

483
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.120
Although lately ladies,
um,
lately,
uh,

484
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.670
the dictionaries just said fuck it.
You know,

485
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:41.671
we can't keep up with the overwhelming level of stupid people using words that

486
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:47.230
we say don't exist.
And then they just give in,
you know,
like they'll make lol,

487
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.820
oh,
like a legitimate word then abbreviation me,

488
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.990
they left a love initially sleet will the little red and 2003 they'll do shit

489
00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:59.080
like that.
You know,
that's a bad example.
But then again,

490
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.040
I'm not exactly a great host.
All right.
You want something better?

491
00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:07.930
Go to another fucking podcast.
I don't need you.
Your attitudes.

492
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.120
The hell was I talking about?
Oh,
I was talking about weed.
Um,

493
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:17.290
the difference that difference.
I was talking to a buddy of mine last night,

494
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:22.060
we were out in a sports bra.
Um,
we're actually watched the,
uh,

495
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.840
the Celtics clippers great game.
And uh,

496
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.840
it's awesome to see the clippers are good.
And I'm also really,
really,

497
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:33.100
really nervous about getting rid of a Kendrick Perkins.
I don't get that.

498
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.330
I just felt a big sigh of relief from everybody on the,
uh,

499
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.780
on the Lakers bench.
Oh,
thank God.

500
00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:45.730
We don't have to deal with that guy fucking making us be men,
you know,

501
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.800
bitch slapping us in a fucking paint like we deserve.
That's why Pau Gasol,

502
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.100
his face is so fucking thin.
He took a slap from Perkins on both side of is hey,

503
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.540
give him a double,
remember killer Khan,
he gave him one of those,
uh,

504
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.720
during the first time we met him in the finals.
Then he had that deer in the,

505
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:05.800
I look for the rest of the fucking series.
That's what happened.
Um,
and we,
yeah,

506
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:10.090
we traded them away,
but don't get too excited Laker fans.

507
00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:13.210
Cause I got a feeling those fucking the thunder are going to take you out.

508
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.800
You know,
I think you guys a ride.
Thank you.
You've,
if you had your moment,

509
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.940
you had your moment,
the fucking Sun.
But don't worry.
Don't worry.

510
00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:26.470
I heard through the fucking grapevine that a dad,
what's his face there?

511
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.670
That Goddamn,
he looks like one of those transformers.

512
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.820
Who's the guy apply.
I'm so bad when I want to talk about who,

513
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.560
what the fuck is the Twite Howard I heard through the grapevine wants to be a

514
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:42.830
fucking or can you believe that shit?
Can you believe that shit?
You know.

515
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.080
Can Coby have any more championships?
Just laid at his fucking feet.

516
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.680
Overrated.
Koby Bryant.

517
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:54.320
Three out of his five fucking rigs.

518
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.990
Fucking ugh.
No stupid Laker fans.
The MVP,

519
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.580
MVP,
anytime he does anything just drives me up the fucking wall.

520
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.510
The guy got shack in his prime with Phil Jackson,

521
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:14.400
you know,
and all these morons Laker fans and be like,
well Jordan had them.

522
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.260
Jordan had him when he was a fucking nobody with no experience.

523
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.420
Okay.
Other than as a player.
Okay.

524
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:27.440
He became Phil Jackson with,
with,
with the bowls,

525
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.890
you know what I mean?
You fucking morons.
He knew how to win.

526
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.190
He knew how to take big stars in Moulton together.
That's what the fuck he got.

527
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.720
And that's what he got with shack.

528
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.680
And then he still pulled the fucking team apart.
Still pulled them apart.

529
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.330
I don't know if he gets fucking Dwight Howard.

530
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.920
Fuck him and his in the last two championships I respected.
All right,

531
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:48.890
but those first three,
give me a fucking break.
Okay.

532
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.550
You Take Colby out of that lineup and you put me in there and that little

533
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.940
fucking frilly,
golden purple uniform with my ghost white legs.

534
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.680
We're still going to win 50 games.

535
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.350
I'm just going to be feed and check and he's going to turn around with this

536
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.810
tongue sticking out the side of his mouth.

537
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:10.130
Like some special needs kid trying to put blocks in around circle.
Right.

538
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.420
Ah,
really?
Did you have to attack those people bill?
Sorry,

539
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.720
I'm going off the dome.
Um,
anyways,
let's get back to fucking pot here.
All right.

540
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.990
This is,
this is,
this is the conversation I had.
Oh,
I know.
So,
um,

541
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.390
I went to this,
this Boston sports bar last night,

542
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.690
and for the first time since I can fucking remember,

543
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.380
I had a good experience as a fan because,
uh,

544
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:38.330
and I mean almost you guys who listen to this,
you know,

545
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:43.070
even the over there and jolly old England,
you're cozy,
smug cuts,

546
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.210
right?
If you're a fan of Liverpool,
you pretty much live in Liverpool,
right?

547
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:48.770
Isn't that our police when you're young,

548
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.690
but then you move away and not only do you feel weird rooting on your team,

549
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.340
your people are telling you that they suck at it.
It's unreal.
Since 1995,

550
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:02.360
I moved to New York City and then it went from everybody loving the red sox to

551
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:04.130
absolutely hating their existence.

552
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.280
And then I moved out to la and everybody hates the Celtics.
And,
um,

553
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.600
not to mention the awful vibe of sports fans out here in,

554
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.500
uh,
on the west coast.
They are fucking horrific.

555
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:23.360
I Dunno why ESPN spends the lion's share of their time when they talk about

556
00:35:23.361 --> 00:35:27.200
awful fans just talking about Philly,
you know,

557
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:33.010
just recycling those same two fucking stories about Santa Claus and a,

558
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.800
I don't know what else they did.
They fucking,
what did they do?

559
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.010
And they raped like Kathie Lee Gifford sent.
What happened?

560
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:45.240
I can't fucking rubber anyways.
Um,
yeah,
just out here.
The vibe.

561
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.960
It's just not fun out here.
Um,
I dunno,
I,

562
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.210
I can't explain it.

563
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:56.211
It's like back east obnoxious shit-talking morons.

564
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.460
Right.
And I include myself as one of those,

565
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:04.230
but eventually it dies down and you'll start talking about the game.

566
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.150
You'll start talking about games you went to,
you start talking sports.

567
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.650
It goes beyond a fuck you,
you fucking chattery and fig.

568
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.150
It goes beyond that.
Out here.
It never does.
And when it does,

569
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.870
it goes on to a,
I'll stab you in the parking lot.

570
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.640
It's not fun out here.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

571
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:31.151
There's that.

572
00:36:31.151 --> 00:36:34.990
I will stab you in the fucking people get stabbed at Games out here.

573
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.160
It's hilarious.
Like that movie,
the warriors,
it's fucking ridiculous.

574
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.020
You Ucla and USC played at the Rose Bowl.
Okay.

575
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.850
And people got stabbed.

576
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:48.860
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

577
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.580
<v 8>And they're talking about Philly cause they through batteries at Santa Claus.</v>

578
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.990
What would you rather have?
Would you rather be dressed like a holiday icon?

579
00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.990
Taken a fucking Duracell do the head or do you,

580
00:36:59.991 --> 00:37:03.830
would you rather take a steak knife to the gut through your game?

581
00:37:03.831 --> 00:37:08.831
Worn Jersey out in the parking lot to bleed out on the fucking 17th hole outside

582
00:37:08.901 --> 00:37:13.680
of the Rose Bowl?
I don't fucking know.
So anyways,
can I,
can I,

583
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.030
so I,
I,
what am I,
I don't want to say anything.
You know,
you're stuttering.
Prick.

584
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.460
Um,
um,
so I went to this,
I went to this sports bar,

585
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.900
there was just a Boston sports bar and it was fucking great.

586
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.950
Like the Celtics did something good and I was almost self conscious to chair.

587
00:37:30.951 --> 00:37:34.910
I'm so beaten down by living out here and everybody was going nuts and it was

588
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:38.690
just such a fucking relief.
It was awesome.
And I have decided,

589
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.130
fuck staples center.
I'm not going to the games down there.

590
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.510
Um,
even Dodgers games are surprisingly not fun.

591
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.960
I had a buddy of mine showed up to a Dodgers game.

592
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.380
You're playing some of the National League team and he's from Cleveland.

593
00:37:54.381 --> 00:37:55.940
He had a Cleveland Indians hat on.

594
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.600
He's out in the bleachers and this guy started like legitimately saying,

595
00:37:59.601 --> 00:38:02.360
I'm going to kick the shit out of you if you don't take that Cleveland Indians

596
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:06.200
hat off fucking Indians.
They haven't won since 1948.
Who gives a fuck?

597
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:11.660
So anyways,
I have,
fuck,
I'm never going to get back to the weed here.

598
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.900
I'm going to have to stick with this fucking story.
So last week as you,
you know,

599
00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:18.830
I cut the podcast short cause I,
someone hooked me up and I went to the,
uh,

600
00:38:18.831 --> 00:38:21.830
to the all star game to go down there and watch some of the greatest athletes on

601
00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:26.680
the planet and of course check out the WHO is.
Um,

602
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.860
and I was not disappointed.

603
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.230
I'm fucking amazing basketball.
Um,

604
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.150
and the level of whore,
uh,
just every fucking tear.

605
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.900
Okay.
The desperate horror,
the horror live down the fucking street,

606
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.230
all the way up to the whore who flew in for the fucking game,

607
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.520
who's been doing p nine dx for the last fucking eight months,
you know,

608
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.840
did some sort of cleanse and was just in unbelievable shape.

609
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.840
Just fucking trying to figure out how to get in to an after party to get into

610
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:01.390
the hotel and there was fucking awesome.
So anyways,
I get,

611
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:05.950
I get this insane hookup,
right?
I'm not trying to big league you guys here.

612
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.750
All right.
But I got it.
I got a great,

613
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.020
I got a great fucking hookup and I was in one of those,
uh,

614
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.490
one of the luxury boxes,

615
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.730
one of the 90 million luxury boxes that they have at staples center.

616
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.330
They have like three,
three levels of them.
Um,

617
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.080
and I'm sitting there and I'm like,
oh,
finally I'm in staples center.

618
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.230
It's not a Lakers game.
It's not a clippers game.
Then I play in the Celtics.

619
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:30.310
I don't have to listen to Boston sucks the entire time I'm here.
Right.

620
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.680
And all of a sudden,

621
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.660
<v 9>hang on a second.
Does that my phone.
Can you hear that?</v>

622
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.150
Where the fuck is my phone?

623
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.170
<v 8>He,
that gay little ring.
That's my phone.</v>

624
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.423
<v 9>Where is it?</v>

625
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.810
<v 8>Bomb bubba bone bum Ba ba bum.
Anybody else had the fucking droid?</v>

626
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.410
Yeah,
that
Dun Duh Dun Duh.
The reason why I picked that is because I,

627
00:39:55.411 --> 00:40:00.411
there's like 10 options for a ringtone on the droid and the first nine sound

628
00:40:00.661 --> 00:40:05.070
like an air raid.
You now bap bap,
bap or they take this,

629
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:07.590
this ringing that just,
it just puts me on edge.

630
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.310
So the only thing that one's called waterfall,
I think it is.

631
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.180
So I have it set on that and every time I do need it goes,
what are you afraid?

632
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.530
But I say like,
I liked that one.
So anyways,

633
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.960
so I got box seats for the fucking all star game.
It's ridiculous,
right?
Um,

634
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.430
and I'm sitting there and I got a holy,
now I bought like an all star tee shirt,

635
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:34.080
you know,
total fucking nerd fan.
And I go to the game,
I'm thinking this is great.

636
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:36.210
So finally have to deal with shit.
Talk at people,
right?

637
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.890
I'm sitting there watching the game and all of a sudden this little kid voice,

638
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.020
seven,
eight year old,

639
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.290
when when doc rivers put out the big three from the Celtics,

640
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:50.190
I just start hearing this kid going anytime a Celtic shoot the ball,
he go

641
00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:02.020
yelling this shit right the entire fucking time I go,
you gotta be shitting me.

642
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.750
You gotta be shitting me.
Really?

643
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.140
You're going to heckle at a fucking all star game,
you idiot.
Right?

644
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.930
And then they go to sit the big three from uh,
the Celtics,
right?

645
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.550
And then I hear this guys voice go,

646
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.510
go [inaudible] I'm like,

647
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:22.780
what kind of a fucking moron yells at,
at an all star game.

648
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.130
And I look over,
I'm not going to say who it was,

649
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.190
but uh,
it was a rapper,

650
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.120
very famous rapper who is being just a rapper,

651
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.210
you know,
has traveled the fucking world.
And I'm literally sitting there going,

652
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.430
cause I was looking at the kid going,

653
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:48.431
this kid sounds like a 35 year old asshole,

654
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.300
you know,
who calls in like a sports talk radio kind of thing.

655
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:58.160
Why is he behaving that way?
And then I look,
oh cause his dad is an asshole.

656
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.090
It would would've just sent out,
just come in and ended up,
you know,

657
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.810
the experience end up stuff.
But I will give this to them.
At least they weren't.

658
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.140
They were making some noise.
I don't if you guys watch the all star game.

659
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:10.820
It was the worst crowd I've ever seen in my life.

660
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.270
The problem was because the entire lower level was either former players,

661
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.160
whores or some form of celebrity or somebody managing a celebrity.
And uh,

662
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.880
everybody just sat there.
I mean,

663
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.760
I could have yelled from where I was sitting and someone on the court could have

664
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:29.480
fucking heard me.
But,
um,
I dunno.

665
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.650
I still like that rappers albums,
at least the stuff from the late eighties,

666
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:38.650
early nineties.
You're eventually going to figure this out.
But uh,
uh,

667
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.471
Jesus Christ,

668
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:43.550
do you ever have the urge to throw in eight year old off a fucking mezzanine

669
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:46.880
level?
I didn't want to do that,
but you know,
it's just like,

670
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.560
will you shut the fuck up?
Just shut up.
All of Ya.

671
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.340
Ali is shut up and he can make a fucking lay up to shut up already.

672
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:58.760
It's a fucking all star game.
So anyways,
let's get back to the weed.

673
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.160
Let's get back to the weed.
So,

674
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.820
so I go to the sports bar and I'm hanging out and we started talking about,

675
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.270
you know,
I'm still not boozing,
right?
135 fucking days here.
People,

676
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.540
this is getting serious.
You know,
this is like,
I,

677
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.500
I sort of hung out with somebody in a cult and you're like,
yeah,

678
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.880
it bills too smart for this shit,
you know?

679
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:19.640
And then one day I show up with the shaved head and that glassed over,

680
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:22.220
look at my eye,
talking about waiting for the spaceship.

681
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:26.720
I'm 135 fucking days in people.
I don't know if I'm coming back.
Oh,

682
00:43:26.721 --> 00:43:30.920
you fucking booze hounds out there.
I think you might have lost me.

683
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.630
Ah,
the urge is still there.
Her Gun,
I'd love to tear down a fucking fierce did.

684
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.730
Um,
so anyways,
so we were talking about the difference between,
you know,

685
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:46.460
booze versus weed and um,
and I,
I basically told them,

686
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:48.200
I said,
yeah,
and I don't think there's anything,

687
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:52.040
especially now with like a vaporizer,
um,
I don't,
you know,

688
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:57.120
that has to be way more healthier than drinking like three beers and that,

689
00:43:57.121 --> 00:44:00.590
seriously,
that's another thing too.
Like when,
when potheads go like,
you know,

690
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:04.820
you come home after work,
you have a beer,
I smoke a joint.
It's like,
no dude,

691
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:08.210
that there's different,
I drink a beer,
I'm not drunk.

692
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.340
You know,
you smoke a joint that's like drinking.
Like what three,
four beers,

693
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.990
I think it is.
Anyways,
whatever.
So this,
this is what I think the difference is.

694
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.580
I think the fact,
because weed is not legal,

695
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.620
that's why it leads to other drugs.
You basically,

696
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:29.030
you left the legal world and now you've dipped your toe into illegal.

697
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:33.090
And I think it's really easy to go from weed to be like,
Eh,
shrooms,

698
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.070
you know,
it's his cousin.
It's no biggie.

699
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.790
I have you,
you know,

700
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.100
and then there's this and then cocaine is kind of further in the back of that

701
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:44.934
room.

702
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:50.160
And then right behind cocaine is a big steel fucking door.

703
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.860
Like that maniac used to come out of in the,

704
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:55.830
in the Texas chainsaw massacre.

705
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.840
You slide that fucker opening in there.
That's where it,
heroin,

706
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:05.730
meth,
oxy and all that shit is in there.
All right.

707
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.280
Which I don't think just because you smoke weed that you go to that,

708
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:13.010
but they're there.
That's what I will say that Lena,

709
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.960
when when people who smoke weed go,
dude,

710
00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:19.220
it doesn't lead the harder drugs and yeah,
it does.
I think it does.

711
00:45:19.221 --> 00:45:20.240
It doesn't always,

712
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.400
you know this people who smoked crack and they don't become addicted,
they try.

713
00:45:24.401 --> 00:45:25.700
I tried it once,
I was like whatever.

714
00:45:25.701 --> 00:45:27.110
And then other people lose their entire lives.

715
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.160
There is exceptions to it being up,
but being honest with me potheads all right.

716
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.260
Like I,
this one,
I want to know how many people out there have just tried just,

717
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.570
you know,
Ben drunk,
you know,
tried alcohol I guess is what I'm trying to say.

718
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:43.700
Never tried weed,

719
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.420
but did try mushrooms like I've done two drugs,

720
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.290
alcohol and mushrooms,
you know,

721
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.670
alcohol and coke.

722
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.950
I bet you would be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't have weed in there.

723
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:04.730
It goes bear,
we'd shrooms or beer,
weed,
coke,

724
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.920
depending on what you want to feel.
Right.

725
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.740
If you want to hallucinate or if you want to feel like Charlie Sheen.

726
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.853
<v 6>Huh.</v>

727
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.370
<v 8>How fucking amazing was that whole thing?
I loved all,
I'm on Twitter by the way.</v>

728
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:21.390
I finally gave in,
Joe Rogan signed me up to drop a fucking name there.
Uh,

729
00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:25.710
I was doing his,
uh,
awesome podcast,
which you guys should all check out.
Um,

730
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.670
I was doing his podcast and he was beside himself that I wasn't signed up to

731
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:31.710
Twitter and I've been shitting all over Twitter,

732
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.950
tweeting and all that type of thing saying I don't want to fucking do it.

733
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.940
And I'm gradually becoming addicted to it.
And of course I don't have,

734
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.810
we'll have it up on the [inaudible] podcast.com where I'm,
where I'm located.

735
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:44.910
I've been,
uh,
you know,

736
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.440
I learned how to attach pictures and uh,
you know,

737
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.750
I feel like a little schoolgirl right now.
I'm all excited.

738
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.790
I'm cutting and pasting.
I'm typing,
socializing.
Um,

739
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.750
ah fuck.
What the hell was I talking about that I feel okay.
Weed coke,

740
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:05.640
a Texas chain,
so that massacres,
oh you can't bill.

741
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.850
What is wrong with your brain?
My brain goes in,
it goes in a straight line.

742
00:47:08.851 --> 00:47:13.320
If I tried to go back,
I'm fucked.
The fuck was I talking about?

743
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:18.180
Oh,
Charlie Sheen.
There we go.
Thank God Charlie Sheen.
Alright,

744
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.120
I'm gonna have to start doing this thing live so I can start taking college just

745
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.150
for that specific thing that when I lose my train of thought,

746
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:26.910
they could just tell me what the fuck I was talking about or I could get an

747
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:30.430
assistant,
you know,
you could do something like that.
Charlie shame.

748
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.330
I was amazed at the amount of people that took what he was saying at face value.

749
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.110
Kathie Lee Grifford to bring her up again.
She was like,

750
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:42.190
I thought his statements were selfish.
They were self centered.
It was like,

751
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.660
you don't think he was high?

752
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.950
I can't say it was high because that would be slandered.
But what the fuck?

753
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.220
Why is my voice cracking?
I know because I was yelling and that Sports Bra,

754
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:55.270
what the fuck?
When it's time to change?
Um,

755
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.853
that guy,

756
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.570
he sounded like he sounded okay for the legal department,

757
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:06.430
not Slagle Love Cook.
He sounded like somebody high on cocaine,
you know?
Right.

758
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:09.670
When you're hitting that peak before the paranoia comes in from what I've heard,

759
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.120
not so you guys think that I'm out there doing coke.
I can't do it.

760
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.080
I'm too fucking paranoid as it is.
You know,
that I'm,

761
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:19.660
the shit right up the mountain would be,

762
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:22.510
would be very short for me and then it would just go right down to,

763
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.400
I think everybody's watching me.
Uh,
I'm gonna go,

764
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:29.350
go hide in a fucking broom closet.
Um,
yeah,

765
00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:33.910
he just sounded like he was fucking high out of his mind and I was actually kind

766
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:38.680
of annoyed by the guy who was interviewing him because I just felt like he was

767
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:41.560
sort of enabling them,
you know,

768
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.220
and like you kind of saw in that at least I'm totally judging this because who

769
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:49.970
knows?
I don't know either one of those fucking guys,
but it was like he is,

770
00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:54.730
see how celebrities Odi because people are just so psyched to be fucking around

771
00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:58.570
them that they look the other way.
The guy at one point goes like,
uh,
you know,

772
00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:01.090
I saw you the other day.
You seem fine.
You know,

773
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.760
we were at your house in your media room watching apocalypse now.
He,

774
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:06.940
you seem fine.

775
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:14.590
It's like you fucking star Fucker gimme a god that you're,

776
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.460
you're with Charlie Shane watching apocalypse now in his media.

777
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:20.080
Roman is fucking mansion.

778
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.400
There's no way you're going to criticize them in that moment.

779
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.570
That would be like me hanging out with Jimmy page watching the song remains the

780
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.900
same.
He's falling down drunk and he looks at me like,
Hey mate,

781
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:35.440
you think I've got a drinking problem?
Ah,
Jimmy,
you're fine.
Hey,

782
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:39.040
can I play one of these?
Gets I can have the guitar,
dude,
you're awesome.

783
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.043
<v 4>Okay.</v>

784
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.610
<v 8>Who the fuck?
I mean,
there's no way you're going to criticize anybody.
You know,</v>

785
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:51.270
if I could go a fucking watch the godfather over Al Pachino his house.

786
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:53.820
Well,
I guess that's,

787
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.790
that's not the same because Charlie Sheen's not in apocalypse now.
Whatever.

788
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:02.980
Al Pachino have any kids.
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?
I don't know.

789
00:50:02.981 --> 00:50:06.190
So whatever.
I felt bad for the guy.
I hope he,
uh,

790
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.400
you don't hope he turns his life around.
But I also felt that he,

791
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:11.640
I thought he made some decent points.
There was a lot of points in there.

792
00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:15.430
I was just like,
hey,
you know,
skis,
he sort of hands on

793
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.980
Imam lined.
He actually,
I only listened to half that shit.
I'm all right.

794
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:23.650
Before we get into the podcast here,
can I tell you about the content?

795
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:27.890
The bank that I ran into this week?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?

796
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.570
What the fuck is my fucking phone?

797
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:38.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

798
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.340
<v 3>What the hell is it?
All right.
Do you guys really want to listen to,</v>

799
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:45.320
to hunt for my fucking phone?
The hunt for Red October.
Um,
all right.

800
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:49.850
So I'm sitting outside my bank,
you know,
cause I worked hard all weekend.

801
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.970
Why would I want the money when I can just go and give it to these Steve and

802
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.790
motherfuckers?
Oh sure I can have it at home.

803
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.030
Right then I got to worry that people will figure out that I'm,

804
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.000
I'm cashing my checks and I'm bringing them home.
And next thing you know,

805
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.960
the outside of my apartment looks like the end scene at the end of fucking scar

806
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.180
face,
right?
Bunch of sweaty,
long haired Psychos,
you know,

807
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:17.140
climbing over my nonexistent walls and behind all of them.

808
00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:21.730
Some guy who's watched walking is slow as Jason and Friday the 13th knowing that

809
00:51:21.731 --> 00:51:23.230
he's going to get the fucking kill shot.

810
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.550
<v 8>Um,
so anyways,
I'm sitting outside the bank and I'm on a conference call,</v>

811
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.270
you know,
talking about some bullshit,
you know,
pitching some fucking idea,

812
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:33.610
you know,
hey,
you know,
we'll take 10 whores,

813
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.760
we'll stick them in a house and we'll call it the fucking whore challenge.

814
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:42.190
And if fucking we'll get fucking Bob Saget the host or whatever the fuck I was

815
00:51:42.191 --> 00:51:43.024
saying.
Right.

816
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.300
So as I'm sitting there outside the back in the parking lot in my car,

817
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:51.380
uh,

818
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.380
this home in this lady pulls up and this Mercedes right and I'm on the phone.

819
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.090
She opens the door right into my fucking car.
Boom.

820
00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.860
Does it look at my car,
closes her car door and just walks into the fucking bank.

821
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:09.380
And I was sitting there like beside myself going,

822
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:13.070
did she just open the car door into my fucking car?

823
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.190
Cause she sought a mind fuck me.
Cause I heard it,
but she didn't do a,

824
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:21.530
or Oh my God,
I'm sorry she didn't look.
She just act like it didn't even happen.

825
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:25.280
I was like,
you know,
you know the hybrid,

826
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:28.640
because it goes from like the gas engine to the electric tangents sometimes when

827
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:32.450
it,
when it turns over,
it causes the car to shake a little bit.

828
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:35.150
And sometimes like when I'm on of my podcasts at time where I thought that guy

829
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:38.720
rear ended me,
that's what happened.
So I was like,

830
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.640
this is that some sort of hybrid shit or whatever.

831
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:42.890
So I go back to the phone conversation here.

832
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:44.950
She comes out again and now you know,
I'm looking at her,
you know,

833
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:46.880
she's got little midriff showing,
you know,

834
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:49.940
a little blondie and I'm like already starting to judge her and she comes

835
00:52:49.941 --> 00:52:53.030
walking again,
opens the car door right into my car.

836
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.840
So I'm on this conference call with like fucking industry people.
I'd go,
Hey,

837
00:52:56.841 --> 00:53:01.130
can you guys hang on a second,
I should have hit mute.
And I didn't.
All right,

838
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:06.110
so I put,
I beeped the horn and I go,
I go,
hey,
hey.
I put the window down.

839
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.880
She's like,
what?
I go,
you just opened your door into my car.
I did.

840
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.290
Yes,
you did it on the way into the bag or on the way out.
She was like,

841
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:19.460
well I didn't chip the paint.
That's what she said.

842
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.300
And I was like,
what do you may need a chip to pay you or you didn't even look,

843
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.320
how would you know?

844
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.900
Why don't you be a little more considerate next time and look what the hell

845
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.070
you're doing.
Boom.
And I slammed the door shut.
Right.

846
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.160
So I go back to the car,
I go,
sorry about that.
Guys are like,

847
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.850
Oh lets everything go right over that bill.
No,
it isn't.
All right.

848
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:42.750
You heard what happened?
You fucking jerk.
You don't have any,
you know,

849
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.540
you don't have

850
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.760
<v 10>the uh,
you know confrontations,
right.</v>

851
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.770
So she goes,
uh,

852
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.490
then I just hear her with my window up.
I can just hear her going,

853
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:57.220
<v 8>have a nice day,
smile.</v>

854
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.780
She starts doing that shit.

855
00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.820
Like I'm this asshole like me getting upset that you opened your fucking car

856
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:07.360
doors.
We twice without a care in the world.

857
00:54:07.361 --> 00:54:11.950
Like my natural reaction is not supposed to get upset.
You know what I mean?

858
00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:17.890
I Dunno.
You know,
I don't believe in that whole heaven and Hell Shit,

859
00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:21.370
but I think that that episode right there is,
you know,

860
00:54:21.371 --> 00:54:23.740
if there is this whole judgement that was one in favor of me,

861
00:54:23.741 --> 00:54:27.580
the fact that I didn't call her a cunt,
you know right there.

862
00:54:27.581 --> 00:54:32.560
You know what I mean?
She's given me the finger like somehow she's been wrong.

863
00:54:32.561 --> 00:54:33.394
I swear to God,
dude,

864
00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:37.630
I just wanted to take my fucking passenger side door,

865
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.200
open it up and fucking like three fucking times,

866
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.010
right into a goddamn car and then just go,
hey,
did shift the pate.

867
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:51.160
This is why I didn't.
Two reasons.
One,
because it was a broad,

868
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.500
all right,
it was a guy,

869
00:54:53.501 --> 00:54:56.760
I wouldn't do it because what if he comes over and beats the shit out of me who

870
00:54:56.950 --> 00:55:01.060
say cous kitten home.
Okay.
You know,
if you want to have like a,
a street fight,

871
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:05.890
like a brother on brother fight,
where we both end giving each other in,
you know,

872
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.570
in simultaneous headlocks going,
you give,
you give,
I'll have a fight like that.

873
00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:12.850
But I,
you know,
average random dude,

874
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:15.520
I'm not fighting the guy in 42 fucking years old.
Okay,

875
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:20.140
I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
But now there was a woman,
I can't do it because

876
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.180
<v 10>she could get out of her fucking car and just starts smashing up my car.</v>

877
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:30.190
And there's really nothing I can do to try and physically stop her because she's

878
00:55:30.191 --> 00:55:34.090
a lady.
Right?
And that's the first reason.

879
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:39.091
And then the second reason is I've watched enough sports to realize that,

880
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.660
uh,
the reps always see the retaliation.
They never see the initial thing.

881
00:55:44.661 --> 00:55:47.830
So it's like,
she fucking hits me twice.
Nobody sees it.

882
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:50.680
And then I fucking slam Mike and then I,
you know,

883
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.601
<v 8>I would be like,
hey,</v>

884
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:56.130
she did it to me first and I would fucking loose.

885
00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.240
So I didn't do anything at a,
Oh,

886
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:04.740
the fucking thoughts I had afterward of wishing I followed her.

887
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.350
You know,
in my quiet hybrid to wherever the hell she lived.

888
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.450
And I wanted to carve into her driver's side door either cunt.

889
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:20.790
And I was like,
ah,
that's on.
That's on original.
I love,
I wanted to carve in.

890
00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:25.240
I didn't ship the paint and to the,
or maybe I did chip the paint,

891
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.200
lol laughing my ass off OMG.
Or is there some dumb shit?

892
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.940
You know what if I,
you know,
you know what kills me is she's out there.

893
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.840
You know,
she probably told the story later on that day where I would just,

894
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:41.930
I would love to hear her version of that fucking story,
uh,

895
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:46.510
how she was the victim.
You know,
it's just,

896
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:48.930
I can tell who's,

897
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.970
because she was hot and she's not used to somebody actually calling her on her

898
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:55.120
shit.
Or if she's a product of the combination,

899
00:56:55.121 --> 00:57:00.121
the timeout generation and that generation for the last fucking 35,

900
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.500
I don't know,
35 years for the last,
I don't have 25 fucking years.
The parenting,

901
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.590
at least in this country,
I don't know what happened.

902
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:13.650
It's like it went from when I was a kid where whatever your neighbor said you

903
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:18.610
did,
your parents believed,
whatever your teacher said you did,

904
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:19.743
your parents,
whatever,

905
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:23.290
and adults said that you were doing and you are out of a low in your outer line.

906
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.030
Parents just said,
oh,
is that what he's doing?
I'm going to have a talk with them.

907
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.120
Mr. Robinson down the street says,

908
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:32.860
<v 4>yeah,</v>

909
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.650
<v 8>you jumped over his fats.
You will,
you want,</v>

910
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.040
you were jumping in his pool and then you tried to ladder up.

911
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:44.120
Give me that shit.
Get upstairs.

912
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:48.230
You go on your fucking rub you.
But whatever.
They don't do that anymore.

913
00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.040
The last like 25 years.
It's like if,
uh,
if uh,

914
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:54.710
somebody says something to somebody,
hey,

915
00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.710
basically your kids being a fuck head right now,

916
00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:02.900
they just automatically defend their kid straight through the whole thing.

917
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.560
They defend their kid.
You can't go to somebody's house.

918
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.970
You can have a fucking play date.

919
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:11.060
You don't get the shit kicked out of you that you don't get hit or anything.

920
00:58:11.061 --> 00:58:13.550
You get a time out,
you know,

921
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.340
and then I think,
you know,
25 fucking years later,

922
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:21.250
you're in a bank fucking opening you goddamn door into somebody's car.

923
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:23.600
You're a surprise that they're mad and beat.

924
00:58:23.601 --> 00:58:25.390
Don't think you did anything fucking wrong.

925
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:32.460
Timeout.
Look at hockey.
You go in to beat the shit out of somebody.

926
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:36.300
They just make the guys sit down for five minutes,
you know,

927
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.590
does he learn anything?
They keep comes out,
he fucking pizza him up again.

928
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:47.130
Hey,
by the way,
I bought those Bruins.
Huh?
Beaten a very,
very,
very,

929
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.300
very strong Vancouver conduct team.
I was a big fucking victory for us,

930
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.480
but I think before and Oh,
and the fucking road trip.
Jayode all right,

931
00:58:54.481 --> 00:58:59.280
let's get to the topics for this week.
Um,
topic number one for the classic,

932
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:03.440
is it racist,
racist,
racist,
racist.
Um,

933
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:05.000
Oh,
before I get it to get into

934
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.040
<v 3>that,
before we get to that,
um,</v>

935
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.280
here's something you might want to read up on last week when I was talking about

936
00:59:10.281 --> 00:59:15.200
the,
uh,
the,
the whores that go to the all star game and that type of shit.

937
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.720
Um,
there's somebody sent me an article that we will have linked on the,
uh,

938
00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:21.950
the [inaudible] podcast.
Dot.
Uh,

939
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.980
<v 10>was an article that came out in 2006 in Gq magazine where one of the writers</v>

940
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:31.790
hung out with some Groupie,
some NBA groupies and that type of thing.
And,
um,

941
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:32.871
what is really,

942
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:36.170
it's a really interesting article and what is also really interesting is she

943
00:59:36.171 --> 00:59:41.171
never really gets to talk to any of the horrors that are really doing the dirt.

944
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:46.070
You know what I mean?
She talks to three girls who,
well,
we might if it happened,

945
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:50.360
but who knows.
We're just here to have fun.
Uh,
that's how tight that circle is.

946
00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:51.510
It's really interesting article.

947
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:56.540
I'll have the link up on the MM podcast.com the official Pan Fan page of the

948
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:00.440
Monday morning podcast.
And now let's get to the topic.
Is it right there?

949
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:02.750
Um,
all right,
bill,

950
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:05.840
while flipping the channels the other night I happened to catch the end of

951
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:10.710
America's funniest home videos.
Um,
America's funniest home videos.

952
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:11.151
The family.

953
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:15.170
That one on this particular night was a white family with what I assumed was an

954
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:19.520
adopted black daughter,
uh,
who was maybe six or seven years old.
Anyways,

955
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.290
after they announced the winners,

956
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:24.560
the host shook each of the family member's hands,

957
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:29.240
but when he got to the little girl,
he put his hand up and ask for a high five,

958
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.830
which immediately made me live it.

959
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:37.280
I'm not saying it was necessarily racist,

960
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:42.230
but I hate it when white people call me brother or want to give me complicated

961
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:44.090
handshakes when they barely know me.

962
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.980
Can you please tell your listeners to knock that shit off?
Lol.
Um,

963
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.720
you know,
it's fucking funny about that is,
yeah,
I agree with you.
It isn't racist,

964
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.240
but it is a,
uh,

965
01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.780
in knowing sort of a pandering or ingratiating yourself to black culture.

966
01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:06.920
Yeah,
I can see.
I,
I know what you're saying.

967
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.210
I just don't know how to verbalize it.

968
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:12.080
The only way I can really describe it as you guys,

969
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:15.170
anybody out there by that P90x I recommended it's great.

970
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.020
I just go on the road so I can't do the Diet.
So it didn't work for me,

971
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.380
but nick has been doing it lately and she brought up something,

972
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:25.590
I forgot what's really funny on those tapes.
I don't,

973
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.880
I can't remember the names of the people there,
but there's like,
you know,

974
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:33.230
a white guy like two white chicks and then a black dude.

975
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:37.430
So he goes around the room saying hello to everybody.
This is Pam.

976
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.160
They call their blam.
Right.
And he just,
you know,
go to,

977
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:43.940
this is Jerry's a taekwondo guy,
watch out for this guy.
You know,

978
01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:45.650
this is so and so blah,
blah blah,
blah.

979
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.740
And then he walks up to the black guy and let's just say his name is like,

980
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:52.460
you know,
whatever James.
And he goes and he'd be like,
what's up James?
My brother,

981
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.370
every fucking disc.

982
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:03.790
He calls him my brother and then he goes like high pitch my bread and it's,

983
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:07.640
it's so,
uh,
on a Deuce chills from the opiate Anthony,
I think,

984
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.680
believe opie and Anthony came up with that expression,

985
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:14.420
or that's at least where I heard it first dose chills every time I hear that.
Um,

986
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.900
I totally agree with you.
I don't think it's racist,
it's just some sort of,

987
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.780
it's like if you met somebody Asian,
would you bow,
you know,

988
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:27.030
ads?
Yeah,
I get that.
I get that.
That's fucking funny.
Um,

989
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.960
I,
and I've been guilty of doing a semi,
you know,
that the,
the,

990
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.650
the handshake,
the,
uh,
I,
I don't know the mainstream one

991
01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.570
was,
it grabbed the thumb slide of the hand,
the snap thing.

992
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:45.450
That thing was there for awhile and I don't even fucking know,

993
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.590
but I will not do a fist bump with anybody,
even if,
uh,

994
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.080
even if there's a black guy there,
I still won't do it.

995
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.320
I'll just assume that he's still hanging out with too many white people and

996
01:02:55.321 --> 01:03:00.000
that's why he's still doing,
uh,
a pound.
Um,
all right,
next one.

997
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.770
Um,
hey bill [inaudible].

998
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.700
I just finished up a conversation on Facebook with some female friends of mine.

999
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.110
Um,
long story short,
I asked if they were on Twitter.
They replied,

1000
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.330
we don't Twitter.
And I replied,
all right,

1001
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:16.200
well whenever you ladies realize that you're missing out on the greatest social

1002
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:19.080
network since the underground railroad,

1003
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.220
just follow me at any wrote his Twitter name.
He say,
what was my comment?

1004
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:27.180
Racist in your opinion?
Um,
no.
First of all,
you guys,

1005
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:29.220
you've got to let me know what race you are too.

1006
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.670
So I'm assuming that you're white now that isn't racist.

1007
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:37.260
That's what overly sensitive people would think that it's racist because you

1008
01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:41.700
made a reference to something that involved,

1009
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.060
uh,
the they do.

1010
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.920
This happens to me a lot in stand up where people don't look at the context in

1011
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:51.990
which you're saying something.

1012
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.450
You're basically saying the underground railroad is the greatest social network,

1013
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:00.510
or Twitter's the greatest one since the underground railroad.

1014
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:03.840
So doesn't that mean that you think that the underground railroad was a great

1015
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:06.570
thing?
The underground railroad was,

1016
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:11.340
was Africans escaping slavery?
So,
no,

1017
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.460
I think it's actually,
it's a good reference.

1018
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.920
I think you're guilty of making a good reference,

1019
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:20.070
but if you're around a bunch of overly sensitive people,

1020
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.520
they would immediately think because you brought up something that had to do

1021
01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:28.140
with slavery on some level that you somehow advocate advocated slavery.

1022
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:29.400
Um,

1023
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.570
that happens a lot in stand up where people don't listen to what you're saying.

1024
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.760
Or if you make a reference to slavery,
they then think that,
well,

1025
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:43.560
because you made a reference to it,
then you obviously advocate it.
Um,
um,

1026
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:48.420
so no,
I don't think that that is a,
uh,
I don't think that that's racist.

1027
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:52.380
All right,
let's plow ahead.
Next one is a right age man.
Hey,
uh,
bill,

1028
01:04:52.381 --> 01:04:53.880
here's one for you.
I'm 35,

1029
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:58.500
but when I was about 23 for some reason I went to a bunch of stores looking for

1030
01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:02.550
a specific CD CDs back when they had those things.
Um,

1031
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:06.030
so I come from a middle class family and went to high school,
high school.

1032
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:09.060
That was like nine.
Oh two one.
Oh,
it was almost entirely white.

1033
01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:13.980
So I find myself in this store looking for what I thought was a CD by Snoop Dogg

1034
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.813
.

1035
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:19.970
I felt like an idiot and I'm standing in there and Khakis and a polo while a the

1036
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:25.381
other white kid behind the counter reads a list of available CD titles by Snoop

1037
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.950
Dogg.
Um,
as I try to remember the name that I'm looking for,
all right.

1038
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.890
It didn't really set that up.
So he goes into the story,

1039
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:33.640
he finds another white kid to works there.

1040
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.750
He's dressed in Khakis and polos and says that he's looking for a snoop Dogg CD.

1041
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:42.460
So now the white kid behind the counter is reading off titles of Snoop Dogg

1042
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.290
albums.
He goes,
try to imagine him,

1043
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.970
the white kid looking down at the computer screen and him reading the title.

1044
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.190
He goes,
snoop upside and then looking at me straight in the eyes,

1045
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:58.630
finishing sarcastically with your head,
snoop upside your head,

1046
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:01.390
I guess it was the name of the album.
And he goes,
I never felt so white,

1047
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.020
lol discourage.

1048
01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:07.240
I leave for another store across the street in the mall.

1049
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.101
As I walk in,

1050
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:12.460
I immediately spot one of the token black kids that graduated with me.

1051
01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.290
Uh,
now right there,
that's an offensive,
that's offensive to a lot of people.

1052
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.470
Token black kids,
you know,
that's when you go to the all white school.

1053
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.520
And then there was like one black kid.
The kid's always called the token.

1054
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.380
So that's offensive all the way to racist depending on how I would think.

1055
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.820
Um,
but whenever,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
so anyways,
he sees,
you know,

1056
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:36.700
the one black kid,
he basically went to high school with how he said,
I was like,

1057
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:41.440
thank God lol.
I stop him and say,
Antwan,
listen man,

1058
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.300
listen man,
he throws in a man.

1059
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.630
I have a question for you.
What is the name of that snoop Dogg CD with the Blah,

1060
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.960
blah,
blah song on it.
Of course there was the awkward,
what are you asking me?

1061
01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:55.780
You asked me because I'm black,
right?

1062
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.350
Is the question he asked and as I'm standing there stumped for a response,

1063
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.990
he said,
it's not snoop,
it's not snoop Dogg,

1064
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:06.970
it's Dr Dre and the CD is the chronic.
Uh,
he said,

1065
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:11.050
now feeling like a true idiot.
I try to make some ridiculous small talk.

1066
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.660
That's fucking hilarious.
Uh,

1067
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:17.800
I knew I went to the right source as he confirmed,
but what are your thoughts?

1068
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:21.700
Is that racist now?
Now it's not racist.

1069
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:23.290
The token black guy thing.

1070
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.470
I thought of everything you said was the thing that I would,

1071
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.050
would raise the red flag where I would,
if I was in a conversation with you.

1072
01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:30.221
You know,

1073
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:33.130
that shit where at one white guys talking to another white guy who doesn't know.

1074
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:37.240
Then out of nowhere or something sort of in the gray area comes into the

1075
01:07:37.241 --> 01:07:40.300
conversation and from,
you know,
then there's always that tense moment of like,

1076
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:44.590
is this going to take a fucking right turn down to an unpaved road

1077
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.690
down to a shack?
Um,
no,
it isn't.

1078
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:54.240
It's not racist at all.
And it was proven because he knew the fucking answer yet.

1079
01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.440
Maybe you're,
maybe you're guilty of racially profiling.

1080
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:58.450
I think you went really efficient.

1081
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:02.860
It's not like you didn't try to ask another white kid.
He had no idea.

1082
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:07.680
And he was a cunt.
He almost seemed like he was judging you because you are a,

1083
01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:12.760
you,
you,
you were buying the music or in generally just didn't like rap music,

1084
01:08:12.761 --> 01:08:16.130
but you saw the black dudes you went to school with.
That's fucking,

1085
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:18.650
what are you asked me because I'm black.
You should've said yes.

1086
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.560
What am I supposed to ask some redneck?
Well,

1087
01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:24.320
what would happen if I walked up to you when ask,
Hey,
what,
what's,

1088
01:08:24.321 --> 01:08:28.280
what's the name of that new Travis tread album?
He probably like,

1089
01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:31.760
what the fuck are you asking a black guy that question for,
you know,

1090
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:35.300
if somebody came up to me and said,
hey bill,
what's the name of that beer?

1091
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:38.560
That Dev that's famous that Ireland bakes,
I wouldn't get offense.

1092
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.550
I wouldn't get offended by that.
You know?

1093
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:45.080
Or if they assumed that I drank because I'm Irish,
even though mostly German.

1094
01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.450
All right.
But I bought it because I have,

1095
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:50.650
I don't get offended when people assume that I'm mostly Irish mean.

1096
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.230
It's not like I don't look like a fucking Leprechaun.
Um,

1097
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.460
I think that that falls into,
uh,
being overly sensitive,

1098
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.900
but I feel that guys entitled to considered considering he seemed like he was

1099
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:07.220
the only black guy.
His school and other white kids referred to him as the token.

1100
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.160
And despite all that,
he was still nice enough to tell you what CD to buy.

1101
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:17.660
See that?
That had a nice warm,
fuzzy ending.
All right,
another one,

1102
01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:20.210
dear bill.
Hey,
by the way,
my breathing's getting a lot better.

1103
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:23.630
I got to pat myself on the back,
the pip,
pip,
pat myself on the back.

1104
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:27.830
My speaking still sucks.
Oh geesh.
Dear Bill,

1105
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:31.520
I recently moved to downtown Denver from Fort Collins.
Oh,
Jesus.

1106
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:36.110
Is that up near Greeley,
Colorado where they have the bad smell day?

1107
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:38.240
I know I've talked about this before in the podcast,

1108
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:42.110
but just in case there's new listeners out there in Greeley,
Colorado,

1109
01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:46.400
they have a slaughter house up there where a,
you know,

1110
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.310
if you've ever wondered where your fucking hamburgers and steaks and all that

1111
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:54.020
shit came from Greeley,
Colorado is a good guests.
And,

1112
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:58.670
uh,
some days when it's really windy up there and they've murdered a bunch of

1113
01:09:58.671 --> 01:10:03.620
fucking steer a,
they have what's known as bad smell days.

1114
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:09.050
And what you do is you call up the slaughterhouse and you say,
Hey,

1115
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.830
can you,
can you fucking cool it a little bit up there?

1116
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:18.200
We can smell it all the way down here.
We can smell the murder this way.

1117
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.350
And then they actually sort of a,
I don't know what they do,

1118
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:26.270
take a 15 minute break from killing the stairs or whatever.
I don't fucking know.

1119
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.100
Uh,
steered by the way is a bull without balls.
I had no idea what that was.

1120
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.280
I knew what a cow was.
I knew what a ball was.
I didn't know where to steer.

1121
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:38.330
Was steers a bull without balls and a,

1122
01:10:38.331 --> 01:10:41.480
those are the things that they,
uh,
they use for all your steak and hamburger,

1123
01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:44.810
I believe.
I don't think they used the cows.
He was accounts for the milk.

1124
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:49.580
They use the bulls to fuck the cows,
to make more cows and to make a more bowls.

1125
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.940
And then they cut their balls off and they make them steers.
Is that our works?

1126
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:57.830
Right.
Then I learned that in my travels out there on the road,

1127
01:10:57.831 --> 01:11:01.430
correct me if I'm wrong.
They're southerners.
What are you asking me?

1128
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.930
Because I'm from the south.
Yes.
You pick fucking jackass.
Answer the question.

1129
01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:10.220
All right,
here we go.
Dear Bill,
I recently moved to downtown Denver from a,

1130
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:15.090
from a from Fort Collins,
a small college town north of Denver.

1131
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:18.750
The only black people I had a had been used to seeing.

1132
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:22.740
We're either exchange students from Africa or Colorado State football,

1133
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:23.700
basketball players.

1134
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:27.420
My new home in Denver is a neighborhood that is known for having a high black

1135
01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:28.254
population.

1136
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:32.310
To cut to the point I've noticed while driving around my place that black
people,

1137
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:36.360
generally younger black guys,
do not respect jaywalking laws at all.

1138
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:37.950
I noticed that this,

1139
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:42.390
I noticed this after the fifth time in one day that a black dude had walked

1140
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:46.770
right out into traffic expecting that the drivers would hit their brakes and

1141
01:11:46.771 --> 01:11:50.640
wait for him to cross the street.
Now I see now I see this happen every day.

1142
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.593
When I got home,

1143
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:54.780
I brought it to the attention of my roommates and girlfriend and they thought I

1144
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:58.200
was crazy.
But soon enough,
they all began to notice this phenomenon.

1145
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:02.160
And now it's a big inside joke amongst us.
Uh,
also,

1146
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.470
I don't know if you've seen that.

1147
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:08.010
There are quite a few popular youtube videos that show exactly what I'm talking

1148
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:08.281
about.

1149
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:11.760
One video that I think you may have talked about showed a black guy dances way

1150
01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.280
into traffic until an ice cream truck put a stop to that.

1151
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.980
Is it racist that I noticed this also?

1152
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:20.350
Is this just a Denver thing or does it happen elsewhere?
Uh,

1153
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.290
jaywalking happens,
uh,

1154
01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:26.880
I think all over the world in every race does it as far as I know.
Um,

1155
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.540
this one is a little complex because there's a lot of levels to this cause you

1156
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.490
don't seem like you have hatred in your heart.

1157
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.493
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1158
01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.580
<v 10>And also I haven't been to enable it.
If that's what people do,</v>

1159
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.943
<v 1>you know,</v>

1160
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:45.330
<v 10>then that's what they do there.
I lived in New York City and we all do it all,</v>

1161
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:49.410
everybody 80 year old fucking,
uh,

1162
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:54.390
women from the aster family,
Jay walk when then you know,

1163
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:59.130
over to their fucking town car to go visit their bars of gold.
Um,

1164
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.690
everybody jaywalks so I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,
yeah,

1165
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:07.290
obviously it's black people aren't the only ones who jaywalk but a in your

1166
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.560
neighborhood if that's what everybody does.
Uh,

1167
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.990
I mean that's not racist to notice that,
uh,
I think to,

1168
01:13:12.991 --> 01:13:17.480
to just say that it's just black people.
Um,
I don't,
I have,

1169
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:19.160
you know what this is,
these,
these are getting,

1170
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.430
these are getting difficult cause I got to hear what you're doing with that

1171
01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.500
information.
You know,

1172
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:27.260
you did have your little clan moment where you convinced the people that you're

1173
01:13:27.261 --> 01:13:29.240
living with.
I'm telling you,
go out there,

1174
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:33.170
go out there and look at them and then they came back.
Oh wait,
shit,

1175
01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:35.910
your rack now how offensive it is.

1176
01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.940
It that just because you know you're from Denver.

1177
01:13:37.941 --> 01:13:41.510
Why am I giving you a southern accent?
See we're all full of shit here.

1178
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.590
Um,
ah fuck.
I just had a point there,
what the hell was I going to try to make?

1179
01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.800
Yeah.
I mean,
I'd have to know if you would just say in like,
you know,

1180
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:56.500
if you take it to the level I guess,
uh,
well you're,

1181
01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:59.150
you're going let you know,
I,
I,
you know,

1182
01:13:59.151 --> 01:14:02.440
the obvious level to take this where it would obviously be racist if you would

1183
01:14:02.441 --> 01:14:06.260
just like,
we gotta get,
we gotta get all the black people out of this country.

1184
01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:09.200
There are all these Jay walking such a bitches,

1185
01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.470
they're Rowan in this country or ah,
you know,

1186
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:14.260
I don't want my daughter dating a black guy.
Why?

1187
01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:16.960
Cause they're Jay walking sons of bitches of what do I mean?

1188
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.680
I don't fucking know if you just sort of noticing this and you,

1189
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:24.830
and you think it's funny that they do this shit kind of like when I do that

1190
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:28.660
older agent thing,
I don't have anything and get agents or a old people,

1191
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.780
it'd be fucking around like,
no,
I mean,
it's probably offensive,

1192
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:34.040
like my older Asian thing,
which I guess at that am I,

1193
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:37.630
that game is offensive to some people.
Um,

1194
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.890
yeah.
Is it racist
that you noticed?
I mean,

1195
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:50.140
it did happen.
I guess it's when you start thinking that,
that,
uh,

1196
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:52.360
all black people in general,

1197
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.960
like Bill Cosby is walking out of his mansion and Jay walks across the street to

1198
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:02.290
a,
I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno where to go with that one.
Yeah.
Now,

1199
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.720
but I'll tell you this too.

1200
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:09.280
Everybody jaywalks and I am one of the major offenders of it.

1201
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.010
I do it all the fucking time.
All right.

1202
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:15.280
I don't get fucking time to walk down to the Goddamn corner.

1203
01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:18.550
I don't understand what the fucking point is.
I get it.

1204
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:23.950
Look both ways and if there's nothing coming,
then go.
But if something's coming,

1205
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.300
don't go.
I get that.
All right,
Jay walking.
Uh,

1206
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.440
I think those laws are basically invented that basically.

1207
01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:36.700
So they a can keep traffic moving and be,
um,

1208
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.820
don't have to clean up a lot of dead people in the street because there's a lot

1209
01:15:39.821 --> 01:15:42.820
of bad drivers.
And there's also a lot of people who can't see that well,

1210
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.410
or across the street correctly.
Maybe that's why I don't fucking know.

1211
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:49.960
All right,
now we're into advice.

1212
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:53.510
This is one of these ones where I'm just reading too much rather than riffing is

1213
01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.270
that's what is that,
what the fuck's going on here?
You know what?

1214
01:15:55.271 --> 01:15:56.410
I'm going to talk about youtube videos.

1215
01:15:56.411 --> 01:15:59.530
Maybe they'll fucking stir up some sort of,
some sort of comedy here.

1216
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:04.330
I feel like I'm on fucking meet the press.
Um,
youtube videos.
Um,
check this one.

1217
01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:06.550
I remember a few weeks ago when I showed that to Johnny Mack,

1218
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:11.530
the QB doing all those trick shots,
uh,
somebody made an answer video,

1219
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:15.730
somebody else through his fucking football helmet into the ring.
Some guy,
Alex,

1220
01:16:15.731 --> 01:16:19.210
I don't know if it was say this right.
Tanny,
Alex tanties video.

1221
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.970
This is what I got to say about all these,
these trick shot QB things.

1222
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:26.920
The ones that are most impressive is when they do more than one trick without an

1223
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:30.220
edit.
Those are the ones that I like,
but uh,
you know,

1224
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:36.490
other than that,
these are pretty impressive.
So check that one out.
Um,
his,

1225
01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:40.630
his is a classic Youtube Video woman beats up boyfriend keeps yelling,

1226
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:44.530
fight back.
All these videos will be up on the MM podcasts and I,

1227
01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:48.370
this is some inside information then I'll give you,
I never named names,

1228
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.050
all right?

1229
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:54.610
But there's a friend of mine who wrote a very successful movie after watching

1230
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:57.190
this video.
All right?

1231
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:02.610
And in this video there is a woman beating the shit out of a guy.

1232
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:08.110
A big woman.
Okay.
So think of some comedies that came out

1233
01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.980
and the last,
oh shit,
what was it?
I think it was like five years ago it came out

1234
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.400
and,
uh,
why don't I just tell you the movies,
Norbert,

1235
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:24.090
the guy I know who wrote the movie,
wrote the movie after seeing this video,

1236
01:17:24.091 --> 01:17:26.880
he thought this video was fucking hilarious and said that's a movie.

1237
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.940
And then he wrote it and then again made.
And I remember standing there going,

1238
01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:33.810
wow,
it's that fucking easy.
You just have to sit down and do the Goddamn work,

1239
01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:38.830
you know?
Um,
all right,
next one,
magnetic kid.

1240
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.110
What the fuck is that?
Did I even watched that one?

1241
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.510
Seven year old kid claims he's magnetic.
I somehow missed that one.

1242
01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.130
I'm drunk guy on the news.
You have to see this is the best one of the week,

1243
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.840
I think as far as fucking hilarity.

1244
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:57.300
This guy is out of his mind and speaking of racist weight is by,

1245
01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.700
this guy gets really,

1246
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.460
he's really drunk and he starts talking about his neighbors.
He goes,

1247
01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:05.000
now and Sally,
you one,
are you right now?

1248
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:09.870
I never liked those people.
Uh,
I'm,
I'm,

1249
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.540
I'm gonna stay.
I'm going to say something racist.
Right?

1250
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.390
And he's so drunk.
He never gets around to it.
But the,

1251
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.830
one of the funniest things in this video,

1252
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:25.610
aside from the unbelievably long pauses this guy takes between talking,

1253
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:30.800
is how the,
the reporter keeps trying to give the guy the out.
He's like,

1254
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.910
did you start drinking?
Because she was so distraught from the fire?

1255
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.280
And the guy's like,
no,
you know,
like,
I've been drinking off.

1256
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.140
I was drinking before the fire,
during it and after it,
you know,

1257
01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.460
that's his basically his whole vibe.
Then here's a video.
People keep sending me.

1258
01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:48.590
I don't know why people find this thing funny.

1259
01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:51.680
I find the voice over to be unbelievably annoying.

1260
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.860
It says crazy nasty as honeybadger.

1261
01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:58.230
And I guess it's making fun of all the videos showing how bad ass the honey

1262
01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.270
badger is.

1263
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:03.920
But this guy sounds like he's doing a really bad impression of a sitcom

1264
01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:06.620
character that's gay.
And uh,
he just,

1265
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:10.430
he's annoying after a while a conspiracy theorists out there,

1266
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:14.480
new world order documentary we have.
And um,

1267
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:19.340
I actually got this one Chevy 1991 s 10 commercial.

1268
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:22.310
Uh,
one of the people I follow on Youtube,

1269
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:27.700
he does a bunch of a really good Zeplin covers and he throws up random videos

1270
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:30.200
every once in a while.
So I saw it on his channel.
Uh,

1271
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.340
it was both for Shard,

1272
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:38.110
I believe his name is B e a u just type in that and then look up Zeplin if

1273
01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.210
you're a drummer.
Um,

1274
01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.980
he fucking kills a bunch of different Zeplin tracks and,
all right,

1275
01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:49.210
those are the youtube videos for this week.
And uh,

1276
01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.290
do I have anything else to talk about?

1277
01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:52.720
I think I was just going to fucking advice and then we'll wrap this goddamn

1278
01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:57.070
thing up.
We will wrap it up.
Oh this week,
by the way,
I'm going to be in Miami.

1279
01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:02.210
All right.
I'm going to be in Miami
at the,
uh,

1280
01:20:02.211 --> 01:20:07.040
the fucking fuck fest theater.
Where the hell am I going to be?
Hang on a second.

1281
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.560
Me.
Let me get the information for you,
right.
Do you just sit tight?
You sit tight.

1282
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.350
You're Goddamn cubicle.
All right.

1283
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.760
Start fucking scratching your Chin as you're looking at those spreadsheets.
Like,

1284
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.140
that's odd.
All right.

1285
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.900
I'm at the new world symphony 517th Street,
Miami Beach,
Florida.

1286
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:28.080
Also for those of you in Utah,
I added,

1287
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:33.120
I added a date in March,
March 18th and March 19th.

1288
01:20:33.121 --> 01:20:37.310
I'm going to get wise guys in West Valley City,
Utah.
Uh,

1289
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.140
probably going to hang around for another day to go fucking skin.
Oh,

1290
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.620
I know what I want to tell you guys.
I finally committed to the sport of hockey.

1291
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.650
Told you I've been playing ice hockey out here and all I had,

1292
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:49.700
I had the helmet with the full cage in the front because who's kidding?

1293
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:54.950
Who my dream of making it to the NHL died sometime I believe,

1294
01:20:55.850 --> 01:21:00.600
uh,
about 1984.
Um,
I was never good.
I always sucked.

1295
01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:04.020
So I would go,
I've been playing,
I helmet,

1296
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:08.280
I have the full face mask and I had the gloves,
sticks,
skates.

1297
01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:09.780
Obviously that's all I had.

1298
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:13.950
And I gotta tell you as a 42 year old man falling down on the fucking ice,

1299
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.190
that is not a good feeling.
So I finally just said to hell with it.

1300
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.310
And I went out and I bought all the gear,
head to toe.

1301
01:21:20.311 --> 01:21:23.960
I have all the fucking pads and it made a,

1302
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:28.950
made all the difference in the world.
Dude,
you go down,
you don't feel anything,

1303
01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.840
you don't feel anything.
It's fucking tremendous.
It's like falling,
uhh,

1304
01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:38.640
falling on it.
Not Pillows,
but it's,
it's the shit.
So,
uh,

1305
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.180
so anyway,
so what I've been doing is,
you know,
I hate going to the fucking gym,

1306
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:46.470
so I,
they take my dog for a hike or recently for cardio's that they have,

1307
01:21:46.471 --> 01:21:47.830
you know,
they have the public skating thing.

1308
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:52.630
So I'll go down there like a fucking pedophile,
you know,

1309
01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:57.030
42 year old single white male,
never married,
no kids.

1310
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.350
I swear to God,
I won't even look at a child when I am in there.
I won't,

1311
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:05.130
I fucking,
I just skate around and I fuckin mind my own business.
So anyway,

1312
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:07.380
I go down there and a,

1313
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:11.070
I basically work on shit that I suck at that you can work on it during a public

1314
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:14.640
skating thing,
which is basically I suck at stop and on my right side.

1315
01:22:14.641 --> 01:22:18.840
So I just started working on that.
And A,
I can turn around to skate backwards,

1316
01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:22.890
but I'm not good.
I'm more lefthanded than I am right handed,
so I'm not good yet.

1317
01:22:22.891 --> 01:22:24.090
I shoot the puck right handed,

1318
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:27.780
I'm fucked so I can't turn around to the right side.
Good.

1319
01:22:27.781 --> 01:22:30.690
So the only way you improve in life is if you attack your weaknesses.

1320
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:33.490
So I start learning it right,
and I'm crossing over and over.

1321
01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:38.530
<v 3>It's going great.
And then what happens?
I get a little cocky.
Oh,
he's right.</v>

1322
01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.870
And I'm fucking my version of flying and probably going three quarters of the

1323
01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:46.030
speed that,
uh,

1324
01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.000
that I can skate and I fucking turnaround and dude,

1325
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:52.120
I don't know what the fuck happened cause I,
you know,
I'll fall,

1326
01:22:52.121 --> 01:22:55.090
but I can fall gracefully at this point that this was like,

1327
01:22:55.330 --> 01:23:00.330
I had a beginner fall and I was going backwards at about 17 miles an hour and I

1328
01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:05.680
didn't fall in my side.
I didn't,
I didn't get my hands down,
nothing.
I fell,

1329
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:10.330
I fell like a fucking tree and I landed right on my ass.

1330
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.030
And then I got my right elbow down at the last second.

1331
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:16.450
So my head didn't hit the ice,
but my brain's still smacked.

1332
01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:20.500
And like I was dizzy when I got up.
And Dude,
I swear to God,

1333
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:25.030
I don't know how I didn't break my tailbone.
I fucking like,

1334
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:29.740
my ass was killing me.
I had to s I s I skated off the ice.
That was it.

1335
01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:34.390
I was done.
I went off the ice and I sat down and I collected myself,

1336
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:37.780
you know,
and I had snow all over my backside.

1337
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:41.091
<v 8>Oh,</v>

1338
01:23:41.091 --> 01:23:46.091
I missed the best part of when I fell down and I fucking went to try,

1339
01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:48.440
kind of stayed there for half a second.

1340
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:51.900
Like did I just break my fucking tail bone?
Did I really just do that?
And I,

1341
01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:56.000
and I didn't feel any sort of,
you know,
pain beyond,
I just busted

1342
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.853
<v 3>my ass on the ice.</v>

1343
01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:02.010
So as I roll over some like 11 year old kid skates by and does this Simpson

1344
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:06.640
<v 8>ha ha and then keeps going.
I got to Mit,
I didn't get even get mad at him.</v>

1345
01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.640
I was just like I said,
I know it,
I know and I know it.

1346
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.590
And then I got up and it wasn't till I was driving home that that kid actually

1347
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:17.860
annoyed me and I dreamed of cross him into the glass,
you know,
which is,

1348
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.230
which is childish.
But uh,
yeah.

1349
01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:25.060
So I'm playing again this week and I'm definitely having a good time.

1350
01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:28.150
It's so much better than going to the gym and I'm,

1351
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:32.500
I having fallen on the ice there by myself.

1352
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:35.320
I have a whole new respect for like contact sports,

1353
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:37.030
like people who play him at like,
you know,

1354
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:41.020
professional fucking levels or even just pick up games like,
uh,

1355
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:45.940
you know,
I was seriously like,
there was like,
I had to collect myself.

1356
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:50.230
Like I said,
like I can't imagine doing that shit for a fucking living.

1357
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.480
Mean skating is hard enough.

1358
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:55.630
Forget about some guy trying to knock you over when you're not looking.

1359
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.980
It's just,
it's unbelievable.
It's unfucking believable,
so it's unbelievable.

1360
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:03.730
I couldn't believe it.
I'm bored with it already.
Um,
all right,
let's,

1361
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:07.360
let's read some advice and then I'm getting the getting the fuck outta here.

1362
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.020
By the way,
recently I've actually thought,

1363
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:14.950
I've considered about having some advertising here on the podcast and I know you

1364
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:19.900
guys are thinking,
Oh gee,
he is here.
He goes,
he's going to sell out,
man.

1365
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.550
I'm,
you're absolutely right.
I am going to sell out.
You know,

1366
01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:27.970
what are they going?
I want to keep it real and stay broke.

1367
01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.550
I'm not broke.
I'm doing all right,
but give me a fucking break.
Okay.

1368
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:37.000
Eventually people,
I'm not going to want to jump on a goddamn airplane.
Okay.

1369
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:42.160
And I don't want to charge you cons,
anything,
you know,
so,
uh,

1370
01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:43.440
I've been thinking about it so,
but I,

1371
01:25:43.441 --> 01:25:46.450
I think I can still do it in a creative cool way where I'll just have

1372
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:51.370
advertisers on here of Shit that I like.
Drum companies,
booze,

1373
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:56.230
uh,
you know,
Shit like that.
As long as I can read it and make fun of the copy,

1374
01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:57.790
I will do it.
Um,

1375
01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.220
and I'll charge everybody a dollar 75 per episode.
Um,
I dunno,

1376
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.190
I'm going to try to figure something

1377
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.510
<v 10>out.
Um,
all right,
let's go to advice,
spill advice.
Um,</v>

1378
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.050
so for the last five years I've been teaching guitar lessons fulltime at a very

1379
01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:14.930
large music school in Chicago.
Um,

1380
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.550
there are over a hundred music teachers at the school with about 5,000 students.

1381
01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:23.060
Every session,
half of those students are under 18.

1382
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:27.170
The school has been around for over 50 years and is globally recognized.

1383
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:30.350
Let me see if I can figure that out.
Mm.
Oh,
Chicago.
I don't know that one.

1384
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.250
I was going guess Berkeley.

1385
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:34.940
Now I get an email from the new director of the school is saying all of the

1386
01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:39.941
staff are required to get their thumbs scanned by some company called bio

1387
01:26:39.971 --> 01:26:40.804
metric.

1388
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:47.230
What biometric scans your thumbs into their watch system.

1389
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:54.070
We all already had a background checks done when we were hired,

1390
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:56.810
but now they argue that we need to have this done.

1391
01:26:57.050 --> 01:27:00.800
Apparently all of the public school teachers in their entire city are being

1392
01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:02.360
forced to do this as well.

1393
01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:07.430
Basically anyone who is around any younger who was around any younger,

1394
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:11.390
please,
please people please proofread your shit.
You make me sound dumb.

1395
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:12.530
I'm already dumb enough.

1396
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.920
Basically anyone who was around any younger people over for a profession is now

1397
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:23.210
mandated by their employee to get in this creepy biometric system.

1398
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:28.400
You see this shit?
Have you guys noticed this?

1399
01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:29.930
All this fucking screaming and yelling.

1400
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:34.340
We do during every single election that comes around to pick the Democrat or the

1401
01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.413
Republican.

1402
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.190
It doesn't make a difference because when the real shit goes down like
approving,

1403
01:27:40.191 --> 01:27:44.690
giving biometrics the right to do this,
we don't get to vote on this.

1404
01:27:44.691 --> 01:27:47.930
They don't even tell us about us.
They just go,
it's a law.
It's mandatory.

1405
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:52.370
You have to do this.
Anyways,
he says,
I don't have anything to hide,

1406
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:53.900
but the mental picture of all of us,

1407
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:57.080
harmless musicians lining up like fucking cattle,

1408
01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:01.240
having some storm trooper assholes scanning my thumbprint into some super

1409
01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:04.730
computer where it will stay forever is really depressing.

1410
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:09.020
Obviously this is all done in the name of air quote,
protecting the children,

1411
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.690
but at what cost?
Here's my question for you.

1412
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.510
I feel like this is my moment to take a stand.

1413
01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:18.440
Should I make a deal big deal about this and try to rally all the other teachers

1414
01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:23.000
to fight this or will I just look like I have something to hide?
Uh,
it is really,

1415
01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:26.660
really hard to get a job at this school,
so I'm scared to make waves.

1416
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:30.170
Do you feel like this protects kids from creeps?

1417
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:33.200
I should mention that in the schools 50 year,
his history,

1418
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:37.790
no incident of a teacher,
a student misconduct has been recorded.

1419
01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:41.960
Everyone knows that pedophiles can't play an instrument.
Lol.
Uh,

1420
01:28:41.961 --> 01:28:46.040
and do you think,
um,
they are making priests get thumb scans?

1421
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.080
I fucking bet.
Not all joking aside,
I'm really bothered by this situation.

1422
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:52.870
What should I do,
Bill?
I don't know.
I,

1423
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.050
the first thing I would do is I would talk to other teachers and see how they

1424
01:28:57.051 --> 01:28:59.790
feel about it.
I think that's complete horseshit though.

1425
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:06.000
They have been basically working their way towards this since they first came up

1426
01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:10.350
with photo ids and social security numbers and all of that shit.

1427
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:15.030
It's all done under the whole guise of organization in your own fucking safety.

1428
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.180
And it's complete horseshit.

1429
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:24.410
It has to do with them eventually trying to have a very few people be able to

1430
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:31.500
make the decisions for all of us.
That's basically what's going on.

1431
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.290
Okay.
And the more information they have about you,

1432
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.890
the easier it is to be able to find you.
I mean,
think about that shit.

1433
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:39.000
They're going to have your thumbprint,

1434
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:42.270
they know what you're fucking fingerprint looks like.
All right.

1435
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.770
They're going to have an a visibility to freeze your fucking bank account and

1436
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:51.300
your cell phone as a goddamn microchip in it.
Okay.
So the second day,

1437
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:56.301
I mean this is like end of day shit and they got these fucking robots that

1438
01:29:57.871 --> 01:30:01.080
they've been working on that can outperform human beings.
I'm telling you,

1439
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:03.450
our days are fucking number.
They are on jeopardy.

1440
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:07.560
The other day they had two human beings playing against the fucking computer.

1441
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:15.340
Those two people,
they're helping human beings get phased out.

1442
01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:16.630
You should see I'm not competing,

1443
01:30:16.631 --> 01:30:20.320
gets a fucking computer so you can figure out how it does against me and you can

1444
01:30:20.321 --> 01:30:23.890
figure the computer's weaknesses and strong points so it can come back with even

1445
01:30:23.891 --> 01:30:27.220
more game and you can pump it back with more fucking information.

1446
01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:31.600
So eventually I become fucking useless unless of course I know how to build a

1447
01:30:31.601 --> 01:30:36.460
robot or know how to grease it's fucking joints.
Yeah Dude.
I think,
yeah,

1448
01:30:36.461 --> 01:30:41.230
I think it would be a very noble thing if you complained about that.

1449
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:44.170
I think people need to complain more.
I'm guilty of it.

1450
01:30:44.171 --> 01:30:47.440
I fucking rant here on this podcast,
but I've never been to a protest.

1451
01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:50.690
But I don't think that it's right that they,
that they pass a law,

1452
01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:52.090
like whether you agree with that or not,

1453
01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.660
that's not something that they should be able to pass without the voice of the

1454
01:30:55.661 --> 01:30:58.000
people.
We should be able to vote on something like that.

1455
01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.230
That's fucking ridiculous.

1456
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:02.320
I just found out from my account the other day after years of saying,

1457
01:31:02.321 --> 01:31:06.130
I'm not doing my shit online cause I don't want to put all that information

1458
01:31:06.131 --> 01:31:09.880
online.
I now have no option.
I have to do it online.

1459
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.420
You know,
I,
I don't want to put all my fucking information online,

1460
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:20.820
my tax ID numbers,
my social security numbers.
You're out of your fucking mind.

1461
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:25.140
You're letting people in to your entire financial history.

1462
01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:28.770
You'll [inaudible] GG your whole fucking God knows what they can do with that

1463
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:33.000
and they can ruin you.
All right.
All I'm doing is bitch in here,
but oh,

1464
01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:35.670
that's shit.
Really.
That's fucking creepy as hell.
Um,

1465
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.820
I would talk to other people,
be like,
and a,
you know,
well,

1466
01:31:37.821 --> 01:31:41.010
what do you think about this?
You know,
sort of get it going.
You know,

1467
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.860
just like how they started the revolution in this country.
Hey,

1468
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.390
are you already thinking about those red coats?

1469
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.160
They kind of a yet Dick's right to kind of dicks.
Yeah.
I don't like him either.

1470
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.410
All right.
Uh,
question number two.
Hey bill,

1471
01:31:52.411 --> 01:31:55.500
this has been bothering me for a while now and I'm not sure what to do.

1472
01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:00.280
I'm 19 years old.
I go to Umass Amherst.
Oh Geez.
Um,

1473
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:03.880
do that place is insane.
Do you guys still party the timeout generation?

1474
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:06.220
Do you still party the way they used to where they would actually have

1475
01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:09.970
fatalities at that school?
People used to ride the elevators.

1476
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:13.450
There was that classic urban myth about those kids bring in the cow up to the

1477
01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:15.520
roof of the building and they didn't know how to get it off.

1478
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:20.440
So they just pushed it off to the side and it exploded into a hamburger heaven.

1479
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:24.670
Um,
anyways,
I had a girlfriend my first semester of college,
uh,

1480
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:27.160
that was still in high school.
We both knew that I was going,

1481
01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.370
that we both knew that I was going far away and we,

1482
01:32:30.371 --> 01:32:32.650
but we agreed that we would stay together.
However,

1483
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.040
I guess her feelings changed and she wanted to be single.

1484
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:40.000
I was devastated when she broke up with me and I've been really down because she

1485
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:44.380
was the first girlfriend I had that I really liked.
And,
uh,

1486
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.020
I wasn't just trying to get laid,
actually liked this girl.

1487
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:50.650
So after a few weeks I found out she was hooking up with this kid that I

1488
01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:53.980
considered to be a friend,
a boy,

1489
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:57.400
because we had been hanging out over the summer and partying together.

1490
01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:01.660
What's fucked up about the whole situation is that this isn't the first time

1491
01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:05.270
this guy has done this to me.
All right.

1492
01:33:05.271 --> 01:33:09.680
You know what I just thought of when I read that sentence was,
uh,
what was the,

1493
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:13.370
what was the name of that movie?
Uh,
dead presidents.
You know,

1494
01:33:13.371 --> 01:33:17.090
when the dude comes back into the pool hall with the stick and he beats the shit

1495
01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:20.810
out of Terrence Howard.
I,
that's,
I'm not saying to do that,

1496
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:25.070
but that's the first movie scene that came to my head.
Anyways,

1497
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:26.450
at the end of my senior year,

1498
01:33:26.451 --> 01:33:28.940
I broke up with a different girl and this kid was hooking up with her.

1499
01:33:28.941 --> 01:33:32.900
About a month later,
I let that one slide.
That's your fault then if,

1500
01:33:32.901 --> 01:33:34.460
because he said,
because again,

1501
01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:38.270
I didn't really give a fuck about any other girlfriends I had before this

1502
01:33:38.271 --> 01:33:40.640
previous one.
Um,

1503
01:33:40.641 --> 01:33:44.300
I don't want to be a crazy ex boyfriend that gets defensive over girls that no

1504
01:33:44.301 --> 01:33:45.134
longer like him,

1505
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:48.860
but should I or should I not tell this kid to back off and stop going after my

1506
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:52.400
ex-girlfriends?
Uh,
you definitely need to have a talk with that dude.

1507
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:57.580
You need to clear the air with them
and um,

1508
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.710
and then you need to stop fucking with them.
That's what I would do.

1509
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.130
And I would go somewhere along the lines of describing him as like a,

1510
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.820
you ever see those little fish that swim under the big fish,
you know,

1511
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:12.560
and I plankton,
I don't know what they fuck they are,

1512
01:34:12.561 --> 01:34:16.100
they swim on under the whales.
You know,
just ask them.
It's like,
dude,

1513
01:34:16.101 --> 01:34:19.910
do you have an ability to get pussy without drafting behind me?

1514
01:34:19.911 --> 01:34:22.310
Like somebody in the Tour de France,
you know,

1515
01:34:22.311 --> 01:34:26.510
if there was like pussy at the finish line,
the fuck is wrong with you.
You know,

1516
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.273
I don't know.

1517
01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.730
Don't listen to me on how to say this stuff because I say fuck a lot and I'm an

1518
01:34:31.731 --> 01:34:34.160
angry dude.
You'll end up getting into a fist fight.
But uh,
yeah,

1519
01:34:34.161 --> 01:34:37.740
I would definitely say something to the kid.
Oh,
you know,

1520
01:34:37.741 --> 01:34:40.260
it'd be funny if you call them up,
like,
I don't know where you're from.
You know,

1521
01:34:40.261 --> 01:34:41.730
just say you're from,
um,

1522
01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.730
just say you're from La.
Just call them up and say,
hey,
listen,

1523
01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:47.660
just to let you know,

1524
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:51.520
I've been recently hooking up with this chick from San Diego.
Uh,
you know,

1525
01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.150
just want to let you know,
you know,

1526
01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.700
send you a picture just to show you the next person that you're going to be

1527
01:34:55.701 --> 01:34:59.180
fucking cause evidently you loved sloppy seconds.
You know,

1528
01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:01.730
you fucking pervert you gave from me or something.

1529
01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:06.020
Do you just want to be where my Dick has been?
You know the love of God.

1530
01:35:06.021 --> 01:35:09.110
Go get yourself a boyfriend.
There you go.
Hit Him with the homophobia.

1531
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.650
That's a good one.
Not that I advocate homophobia,
but when you use it,

1532
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.310
it can be your friend.
Ah,
that really makes sense.
All right bill.
Hey Bill,

1533
01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:20.240
I'm 24 and have four kids.
Jeez,
what is it?

1534
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:24.680
The fucking 18 hundreds.
What do you do?
You Go,
what do you got?
Some fucking,

1535
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:29.840
they need some farm hand,
sir.
Somebody to go clean out the silo or fill it up.

1536
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.510
Ah,
good Lord.
You guys make your own clothes.

1537
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:40.910
I'm 24 and I have four kids.
I'm married.
I feel bad for this guy.

1538
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:41.720
Should make fun of them.

1539
01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.720
I work for public utilities doing very hard manual labor and I work hard for my

1540
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:49.610
money,
which goes straight to my wife and four kids.

1541
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:54.820
Basically when politicians run for office and they try to stand on the shoulders

1542
01:35:55.551 --> 01:35:58.010
of hardworking Americans.
This is the guy right here.

1543
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:02.600
This is the guy that like Sam Elliott talks about.
Speaking of that,

1544
01:36:02.601 --> 01:36:05.060
I recently saw one of those cores commercials.
Have you seen that?

1545
01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:11.180
<v 9>The rocky mountains good down this country like a backbone and we make a beer</v>

1546
01:36:12.181 --> 01:36:13.620
the way the fuck we want to,

1547
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:17.430
and that was having a backbone is all about you're gonna have the backbone to

1548
01:36:17.431 --> 01:36:22.431
make a let beer that looks and tastes like piss a watered down.

1549
01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.960
Shitty beer comes from the backbone rugged mountains.
Okay.

1550
01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.500
<v 10>You know something?
I think whenever you have a pussy product,</v>

1551
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.520
you know one of the red flags as he gets Sam Elliot to do the voiceover,

1552
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:36.410
you know,
cause you're like,
oh my God,

1553
01:36:36.411 --> 01:36:40.670
people are gonna see right through the fact that,
I mean come on people cores,

1554
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:46.130
it's one of those beers when like you're hung over that you actually drink.

1555
01:36:46.131 --> 01:36:48.050
That's like vitamin water for an alcoholic.

1556
01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:56.820
They're trying to tie it into the fucking rocky mountains.
I mean,
I know,
I know.

1557
01:36:56.821 --> 01:37:01.020
They,
they get their fucking water from the rocky mountain.

1558
01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.330
<v 9>Let's go down this country like a backbone.</v>

1559
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:09.580
The tough gash she had.
Give me some of that school band.

1560
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:11.423
Core line.

1561
01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:15.640
<v 10>Yeah.
Jesus.
I'm anyways,
where the fuck am I?</v>

1562
01:37:15.641 --> 01:37:17.110
How the fuck that even start talking about that.

1563
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:21.100
The other day I got a call from work,
uh,
the other day I got a call from her.

1564
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:23.980
Okay,
let,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's reset this up again.
The case,

1565
01:37:23.981 --> 01:37:27.250
24 years old,
he has 17 kids now.
He has four kids.
He's married,

1566
01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:29.890
works with public utilities,
does very hard manual labor.

1567
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:33.190
He works his fucking ass off and all his money goes straight to his fucking wife

1568
01:37:33.191 --> 01:37:34.540
and his kids.
All right.

1569
01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:37.540
The other day I got a call from her at work and she told me to meet her at the

1570
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.110
doctor's office because she doesn't like taking the kids to the doctor alone.

1571
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:46.420
When I get there,
she starts yelling at me as usual red flag and they,

1572
01:37:46.421 --> 01:37:50.560
and then said,
then she said,
all you know how to do his work,

1573
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:55.950
so why don't you just go back to work and saying all I do is

1574
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.980
<v 8>pick up after you and the kids and basically calling me a loser for working and</v>

1575
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:06.150
making money.
I'm doing my best to provide for my kids.
She takes my money.

1576
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:09.330
She spends my money on stupid shit.

1577
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:14.130
We've been married for a year and four months now,
but you get four kids.

1578
01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:17.220
Did you have quadruplets,
sir?
What happened?
I don't know bill.

1579
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:20.790
I just like to hear your take on the situation and give me some advice.

1580
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:26.610
All right.
Oh,
okay.
Oh,
gauges.
Here we go.
All right.

1581
01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.310
All right.
First things first.
I don't know what you said before.

1582
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:35.820
She said all you know how to do his work,
so why don't you go back to work?

1583
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:41.540
That could have been anything from her actually being a jerk to her saying,

1584
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:46.050
yeah,
Philip has a cold and you said,
yeah,
which one's Philip?

1585
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.570
We've got so many fucking kids.
Which one?

1586
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:52.680
Which one is easy is either the little a rusty heroin,
then she up

1587
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.300
<v 11>hello.
You know how to do his work.
Where did you go back to work?</v>

1588
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:58.930
<v 8>You know,
if she said it like that,
then what can you do?
Um,</v>

1589
01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.560
but it doesn't seem,
I don't know.

1590
01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.310
The fact that she's saying all I do is pick up after you and the kids,

1591
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:12.160
uh,
this,
this is what you need to do.
The worst thing that you can do,

1592
01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:18.370
um,
when you want somebody to hear your point is to be a fucking asshole.

1593
01:39:18.371 --> 01:39:22.930
Like me.
It's like when I,
when I approached that lady at the bank,

1594
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.950
you know,
I,

1595
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:31.530
she didn't hear what I was saying because h she's,
you know,
she's a cunt.

1596
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:36.000
All right?
Who's kidding who?
But beyond that was I was a dick to her.

1597
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:38.040
So no one's gonna listen to you if you're a dick.
So if you really,

1598
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:40.350
if you want to stay with this woman,
right?

1599
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.290
You're going through a rough period in your relationship.

1600
01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:47.610
What you have to do is you got to walk away from that situation,

1601
01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:50.640
you know,
go scream into a pillow.

1602
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.790
All the shit that you want to say to her or go yell at your windshield is you

1603
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:57.270
drive around the block 15 fucking times for a couple of drinks.

1604
01:39:57.271 --> 01:39:59.130
Whatever you gotta do,
unwind.

1605
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:05.660
And this is how I do it cause I have a brutal temper and just write down on a

1606
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:10.770
piece of paper what you want to fucking convey.
All right?

1607
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:12.420
And then practice it.

1608
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.960
I know this sounds crazy to people who don't have this problem,

1609
01:40:15.961 --> 01:40:20.130
but that's what I have to do because I,
I'll sit there and like that bank thing,

1610
01:40:20.131 --> 01:40:24.000
I,
I,
I,
I tried to practice it.
My first attempt at practicing,

1611
01:40:24.001 --> 01:40:28.110
I would start off slow and eventually get pissed all over again.

1612
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:31.860
I'd be like,
hey listen,
I noticed that when you went in,
you know,

1613
01:40:31.861 --> 01:40:35.100
you open your car door into my car and then he came out and then you did it

1614
01:40:35.101 --> 01:40:38.160
again.
And it's like,
what the fuck?
You know?
Okay wait,
I can't do that.
All right.

1615
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:41.280
Start off a bill.
And each time I would get further and further to the end,

1616
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:44.880
so that's what you have to do with this person.

1617
01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.900
You have to sit down hour and 12 minutes.
How fucking long is this podcast?

1618
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.750
You have to sit down with her and just be like,
look,

1619
01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:54.040
<v 12>I</v>

1620
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.760
<v 10>mean,
I don't know what you're just say,
listen,
we have four kids.</v>

1621
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:00.310
That's a situation you don't have.

1622
01:41:00.311 --> 01:41:04.030
The place is going to be a mess and I am working.
Okay.

1623
01:41:04.031 --> 01:41:07.870
Obviously I'm not giving you what you need.
What?
What more do you need from me?

1624
01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:12.100
Okay,
let her see.
That's it.
Probably a good way.

1625
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.950
All right,
we need to talk.
You seem really upset with me.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1626
01:41:16.951 --> 01:41:20.890
blah.
What more do you need from me then what I'm doing?
All right.

1627
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:22.690
Since she sees that you're relaxed,

1628
01:41:22.691 --> 01:41:24.280
you're going to hear what the hell she wants to say.

1629
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:29.260
Then when she says what she has to say,
you know,
fair enough.
All right,

1630
01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:33.940
here's,
here's what I need from you.
All right?
And then in a nice way,

1631
01:41:33.941 --> 01:41:37.180
you got to tell her to stop spending all your money on stupid shit,

1632
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:40.840
all right?
That's what you gotta do.

1633
01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:46.030
And I'm telling you the key when you're fucking trying to make some headway in

1634
01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:48.550
your relationship is with the woman,

1635
01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:53.350
is you can't lose your fucking cool,
all right?
And they will,

1636
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:57.100
if,
if you pack them into a corner sometimes when they're doing something wrong,

1637
01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.410
cause they humans,
they're going to do something wrong.
When you back,

1638
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.410
I'm in the corner and they did something wrong.
Watch out.

1639
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:06.400
If they start attacking you all right with shit that has nothing to do what

1640
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:09.670
you're arguing about,
like you're arguing about,
you know,
you know,
whatever,

1641
01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.740
yet you,
you fucking,
um,

1642
01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:15.180
she keeps leaving the TV on and going to bed and it's on all night.

1643
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:19.210
She's fucking whatever,
whatever the fuck that debt causes the,

1644
01:42:19.211 --> 01:42:23.170
the electric bill to go up.
If all of a sudden she starts going,
well,
you know,

1645
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:24.820
you just mad cause you,
you know,

1646
01:42:24.821 --> 01:42:29.080
you're just short or she attacks you for that or some other bullshit or just

1647
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.660
you're just a fucking ass hole right there.

1648
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:34.510
She just abandoned her argument and what she's doing now,

1649
01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.140
she's just trying to make you mad so that she can steer the argument into some

1650
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:42.850
other bullshit or just hopefully get you to say something so fucked up that it,

1651
01:42:43.230 --> 01:42:46.180
uh,
it just totally camouflage is,
you know,

1652
01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:49.120
the bullshit that she did to start the fucking argument basically.

1653
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:52.570
So just keep your cool.
You got to sit down,
you've got to eat,
dude,

1654
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:55.180
you got four girls,
you got four kids with this,
with this girl,

1655
01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.910
you're attached at the hip with this woman.
Okay?

1656
01:42:57.911 --> 01:43:00.610
So what you want to do is try to have a good time.
You're good guy.

1657
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.090
You work in your fucking ass off.
Okay.

1658
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:09.190
She needs to appreciate that.
And uh,
she has to appreciate that,
you know,
uh,

1659
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.001
you know,
what do you want to do?

1660
01:43:10.001 --> 01:43:11.830
You want to fucking whatever the fuck you're doing.

1661
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.920
He didn't want to walk around picking up a spongebob squarepants stuffed animals

1662
01:43:16.991 --> 01:43:21.940
all day.
You know,
you gotta be like,
sweetheart,

1663
01:43:21.941 --> 01:43:24.210
you had four fucking kids.
See,
this is why I'm not good at it,

1664
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.140
so we don't yet for fucking kids.

1665
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:31.530
The fuck do you think was going to happen?
You know,
get your tubes tied.

1666
01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:34.870
Quit bitching at me.
See,
that's the first pass.
That's the first way I would say,

1667
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:39.970
and by you get to the end,
he to say,
listen,
you know I love you.
You love me.

1668
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:42.580
We have four beautiful kids.
We have to work together.

1669
01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:45.730
It's definitely a trying time at being this show with all these kids,
but blah,

1670
01:43:45.731 --> 01:43:48.730
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I'm telling you,
your,
your,
your life will be like,

1671
01:43:48.731 --> 01:43:50.590
it'll be better.
It'll be better if you work it out.

1672
01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:54.440
But the worst thing you want to do was come and her after you've had a few pops

1673
01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:57.540
and said,
listen,
let me tell you something.
You'd dump con all right,

1674
01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.380
I'm the backbone of this fucking country.
You don't want to come at her that way.

1675
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:03.020
All right,
you stupid bitch.
I'm fucking working my balls off.

1676
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:07.610
Why don't you go out there and that God dip fucking oil rig all day.
You know,

1677
01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.700
once you get out of the pharmacy,
get on the fucking pill.

1678
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:13.520
Maybe you wouldn't have to be picking up so much shit.
All right,

1679
01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:17.000
well let me know to pull out.
You'd say dumb shit like that,
you know,

1680
01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:19.220
and then you're gonna have a year and a half fucking horrific relationship.

1681
01:44:19.221 --> 01:44:20.054
You don't want to do that.

1682
01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.460
<v 3>So that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.
And as I mentioned,</v>

1683
01:44:23.461 --> 01:44:27.480
I am up on Twitter now and actually enjoying it.
I have made peace with the,

1684
01:44:27.481 --> 01:44:31.050
with the tweeting.
You don't,
I feel like right now I feel like a,
uh,

1685
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.040
I feel like Johnny Damon when he went to the Yankees after trashing twittering,

1686
01:44:35.041 --> 01:44:39.990
but the,
now I'm fucking,
you know,
shaved my beard.
You got a haircut.
Oh,
you know,

1687
01:44:39.991 --> 01:44:44.660
I'm just going to credit,
come in and contribute on Twitter wherever I can.
Uh,

1688
01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:49.590
no,
it's not that bad.
It's not the best.
Just typical me.
I am,
uh,

1689
01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:54.950
I'm an old soul.
I'm a crabby 80 year old as a 42 year old.
I am.
I Look Ah,

1690
01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:59.700
shot.
No,
I don't like it.
I didn't like Facebook.
I still don't really like it.
But,

1691
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:03.900
<v 10>um,
I'm at the mercy of you guys.
You guys all go to Twitter.</v>

1692
01:45:03.901 --> 01:45:06.480
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You know,

1693
01:45:07.530 --> 01:45:10.800
I stayed on my space as long as I could.
I felt like I was in a ghost town,

1694
01:45:10.801 --> 01:45:14.880
like some old Motortown that dried up and I was just sitting there listening to

1695
01:45:14.881 --> 01:45:19.190
the rusty hinges,
you know,
is the doors swing swung back and forth.
Oh,
Jesus belt.

1696
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:21.240
We get it.
Stop being so fucking dramatic.

1697
01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:27.210
You're at Twitter in fair.
You're a Twitter.
Um,
yeah,

1698
01:45:27.211 --> 01:45:30.050
That's the podcast for this week.
You guys all have a,

<v 5>fuck yourself.
All right.

1701
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:49.000
Everybody needs to

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:21.820
[inaudible]
illuminate main street cinema,
Rio.

1703
01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.090
We don't care about no government.

1704
01:46:34.410 --> 01:46:35.730
45.
Wow.
