[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:09.650
HAEMIN SUNIM: When
I was a teenager,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.430
I often wonder, why am I here.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.150
I felt as though I was
just thrown into this world

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.990
without giving me any kind
of answer or guidance.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.360
And some philosophers
describe this feeling

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.420
like waking up in
a movie theater

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.940
and then the movie has been
playing for the last 10

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.060
minutes.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.009
So you are just
waking up and then try

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.520
to figure out what
this drama that we

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.530
are experiencing right now.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.300
You are just thrown
into this movie theater.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.520
So I was watching the drama
of my life as a teenager

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.215
and tried to figure it out.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:49.880
What is that which is
watching this drama.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.720
So I became very interested
in spiritual practices

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.540
and became very
interested in religion,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.080
so I ended up studying
religion in college.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.519
And then I was following
many different teachings,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.900
but ultimately I wanted to
just experience, quote unquote,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380
enlightenment like
the way Buddha did.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.990
So I said maybe I
should become a monastic

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.120
and get the proper
training, and maybe I'll

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.940
be able to have that experience.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.190
So I became a monk after
my graduate school.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.620
And then I went
through the training.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.310
And while living in
Buddhist monastery,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.120
I realized that while we are
meditating and all that--

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.650
however, every Sunday, we do
offer services for lay people--

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.150
however, after the
late in the services,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.230
they will want to come and
have a conversation over tea

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.670
with Buddhist monks.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.220
So what ended up happening
was I was sitting there

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.170
in my 20-something--

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.830
I was like mid-20 and then
having a deep conversation

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.260
with people over 40s, 50s, 60s.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.980
They're telling me
about stress at work.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.410
They have problem
with their children.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.020
There are illness they
are going through.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.650
Of course, I didn't have enough
life experience at that time.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.260
All I could do was
just listen very

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.470
attentively and compassionately.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.730
And the good thing was that that
really helped them apparently.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.810
So what they really want
is somebody there rather

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.780
than giving them the
answer, they wanted somebody

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.060
to really listen.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.140
And so I was getting
good at that actually,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.140
and I realized
that that could be

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.790
part of my spiritual practice.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.180
In Buddhism, you need two
things to become awaken.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.270
First one is wisdom, and
another one is compassion.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.120
And both side-- it is
absolutely necessary.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.330
And I realized that maybe
I can cultivate compassion

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.420
by engaging with
everyday problems

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.330
that people are having and
offering whatever the wisdom

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.500
that I have.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.550
So that led me to do a
little bit of social media.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.940
In my opinion, I think the
social media is a tool just

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.420
like any other tool.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.140
It can be used in
a positive way,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.330
or it can be used
in a negative way.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.680
So I start writing something
much more meditative

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.840
and helpful remarks that
came from my meditations

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.030
or helping other peoples.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.390
And then that became really
popular in Korea first.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.290
And then I was invited
to write a book.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.710
At first, I didn't think
that my book will become

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.690
very popular to be honest.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.740
But it became really popular.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.450
It's called "The Things You Can
See Only When You Slow Down."

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.110
I think it was published here a
couple of years ago in London--

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.830
in the UK as well.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.540
And then what
happened was I decided

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.450
to use whatever the
attention that I was

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.560
receiving for the public good.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.510
So I began what is called
School of Broken Hearts.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.960
So I set up four
years ago in Seoul

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.300
where people who are
going through a difficulty

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.810
in their lives, they can
come and they can share.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.810
For example, if you are just
recently diagnosed with cancer

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.100
or if you just lost
your family member

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.300
or if you just went through
a very difficult divorce

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.320
or people who just got laid off,
all this difficult experience,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.490
oftentimes we feel that we are
all alone, completely isolated,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.560
and scared.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.990
However, if you are--
if we come together,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.960
then you will realize
that I'm not the only one,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.380
and we can all do this together.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.770
And especially if you
get to share your feeling

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.150
and through--

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.080
you can share through
language or through dance,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.323
through writing, through
paintings, in different ways,

00:04:57.323 --> 00:05:02.000
in a very supportive and caring
way and that can help you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.790
tremendously I realized.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.090
So the school has
grown quite a bit now,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.650
and we have like 50 or 60
teacher working together.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.740
And we have two
different center.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.400
And they're from
that experience.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.090
And as I was speaking
with more people

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.000
in the center and the
while giving a talk,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.370
I was able to write
a second book, which

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.405
is "The Love for Imperfect
Things," and here I am.

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:28.696
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: Well, welcome.

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:31.730
We're very glad that you
wrote the second book.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.200
So I actually want to touch
a little bit on your school

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.550
because when I read about that,
I thought about the skills

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.660
that we're taught at school.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.700
We're taught everything
from ceramics

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.940
to woodwork to circuitry,
but this education system

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.000
doesn't really equip us
with everyday skills,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.550
whether it's compassion
or self care.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.300
What are your views on
life, and what can we do--

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.480
maybe there are people
here with children--

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.410
and how do we educate
ourselves on this journey.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.660
HAEMIN SUNIM: Right.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.170
I notice that unfortunately
the traditional school system,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.880
they do not teach us how
to become more self aware--

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.400
become aware of who we are
and under what circumstances

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.650
I thrive and under
what circumstance

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.460
I don't do very well and what
kind of personality do I have

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.620
and what kind of path
do I want to walk along.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.570
These are the very important
questions, and if we fail,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.330
how can I pick myself up?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.070
How can I get out of this?

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.910
When I feel so much anger,
how do we overcome it?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.040
Or if I need to forgive somebody
or let it go, how do I do that?

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.420
All those important skill
that's directly related

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.470
to our life, everyday life, we
didn't learn it unfortunately.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.530
So that's why I started the
School of Broken Hearts.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.460
I think we as a human being,
we go through a difficulty

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.770
whether we like it or not
because we have a human body.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.170
So we will get sick.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.020
We get disappointed.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.860
So in my school, I
invite many therapists

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.680
or wonderful teacher.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.290
We do it together
to figure out things

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.600
that we didn't learn in
college or in high school.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.520
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: So one
of the tenets of Buddhism

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.880
is life is suffering.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.820
But when you look at the
world that we live in today,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.970
I think it's fair to say that
everybody feels that life

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.210
is good or life is great.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.735
How did we end up here,
and what do we do?

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:54.070
HAEMIN SUNIM: Whoa, very
philosophical question.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.730
Very good.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.671
Well, in Buddhism, life by
nature is not suffering.

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:05.080
When we are grasping, when
we are attaching ourselves

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.580
to a certain thing, whether
it's your idea, whether it's

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.460
your health, whether
it's your relationship,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.400
and holding onto it in hoping
that this will not change,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.210
then it creates suffering.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.070
So what they are
saying is everything

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.660
that has form or shape is
inevitably will change.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.220
It is impermanent.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.610
So if you can truly see
that it is impermanent,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.320
then you enjoy--

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.620
you can rejoice what you
have knowing that what

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.884
you are having is temporary.

00:08:40.884 --> 00:08:47.680
So even if you are having
a wonderful life right now,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.380
you may at some point get sick.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.950
When you experience
that, then that

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.270
becomes a opportunity for
us to deepen compassion.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.820
I am sick, and then
at that time you

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.300
get to realize that there
are a lot of people going

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.270
through many terrible
difficult illness,

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.270
for example, that
invite ourselves

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.250
to become more compassionate
and have open heart.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.900
So I think difficulty in
our lives are great lessons.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.100
It makes our spirit
to become more mature.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.590
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: And how does
the compassion arise from that?

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.720
So how do we exercise
the compassion then?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.980
HAEMIN SUNIM: So
let's say we are

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.730
in a very difficult situations.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:40.840
And if we are completely lost
in that thoughts, feeling

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.370
of victim, I just
didn't want it.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.740
It just happened to me.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.870
I feel like a victim.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.330
It's terrible.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.910
And if we just keep on thinking
about ourselves only and not

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.930
really connecting to
the bodily emotions,

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.120
things that is
happening to you--

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.760
in other words, if you
just dwell on what happened

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.890
in the past and continually
regurgitate that thought over

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.530
and over again, then you
feel like you are a victim,

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.160
and you cannot get out of it.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.060
However, if you begin
to turn that attention

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.510
to other people who are
in similar situations,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.720
then you begin to see
that through the pain,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.940
we actually connect.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.530
We can actually
understand each other.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.980
This is the part of the life.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.010
And that makes us stronger
and allow us to break out

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.035
of our egotistic shell.

00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.240
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: Talking
about imperfection

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.670
and perhaps there are times
when, especially in January,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.400
it's very timely.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.970
Everyone wants to be
skinnier, has a list of New

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.650
Year resolutions.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.960
And in the book you talk about
your existence is enough.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.860
But that's quite hard to embrace
when the world is telling us

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.390
that we could be better.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:04.050
And how do we navigate this
because on the one hand,

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.310
we should be happy with our
existence, but on the other,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.460
it can get confusing when
we all want to improve.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.090
Like it's OK to have goals
and want to be better,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.290
but where do you find the
balance between the two.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.250
HAEMIN SUNIM: Hmmm, this is
another excellent question.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.910
I think we are all
imperfect, right.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.990
Would you agree?

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.510
Yeah.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.840
Like and I think
it's good that we

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.880
recognize some of
our imperfection

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.260
and try to become better
at it, whatever that is.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.052
There is nothing wrong with it.

00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:46.890
However, just remind
ourselves-- can you

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:52.740
remember the last time when you
felt really peaceful and happy.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.730
Can you remember that.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.650
You could be when you are
in a vacation, somewhere

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.990
warm or a beautiful
mountain or in the company

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.950
of your good friends,
whenever that is.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:15.630
In that time, what was the
overall quality of your mind?

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.590
Your mind at that
time was you were

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:23.310
appreciating that
particular present moment

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.990
that you are experiencing.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.190
And there was no
resistance to what is.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.560
Are accepting as it is.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.920
You feel grateful for what is.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.910
Am I right?

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.410
Yeah.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.909
Yeah.

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:40.580
So likewise the happiness
that we are seeking

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:46.040
is actually accepting as it is.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.720
If we can-- our heart become
serene and become peaceful

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.970
and there's more space for
us to embrace and become OK

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.110
with what is.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.160
And, of course, if we find some
other problems in our life,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.550
then what happened
is we are not content

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:09.710
with the present moment, so our
mind is automatically escape.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.070
We think about the
future, and we regret

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.580
what happened in the past.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.170
So while doing that, we are
missing out the present moment.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.700
So let me just also talk
about one interesting thing.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.540
When I first became a monk,
I had this idealized image

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.700
of a perfect monk.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.050
So I was assigned to
master, my mentor,

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.410
and so I was hoping
that my mentor would

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.350
be this idealized perfect monk.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.050
But when I first met
him, he wasn't anything

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.270
like what I had in mind.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.380
My idealized monk is
very dedicated, serious,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.530
meditate really hard,
and then imparts

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.570
very wisdom and all that.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.750
But my mentor monk,
[? the ?] master, he was--

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.020
he loves to make jokes.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.080
He also has some temper.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.450
He gets angry.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.710
So he wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.740
And then at that time
what happened was I

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.480
had a close monk
friend, and we were

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.300
ordained around the same time.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.880
So he invited me to his temple.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.370
So I went to his
temple, and I had dinner

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.560
with him and his old master.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.630
So when I first
met his master, he

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.050
was exactly what I had in mind.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.660
He was here-- his mind was
serene and serious and meditate

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.110
a lot and imparts
in all the wisdom.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.280
So I was thinking, oh,
gosh I wish I can switch.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.270
I wish I can change my mentor.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.960
So I was a little
envious of him.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.130
And then 10 years passed, and
then I met my friend again out

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.860
on the street accidentally.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.990
And then I was very
happy, of course.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.510
I said, oh, it's
so nice to see you.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.980
Long time no see.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.935
How have you been, and how
is your perfect master?

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.720
And he said that, oh, well,
I am no longer in touch

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.460
with my master.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.550
I was very shocked.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.690
He's not having any kind
of contact with his master.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:21.590
I say, why?

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.240
Your master is perfect.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.190
And he said that
because he was perfect,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.500
he demanded that all of his
disciples to be perfect, too.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.850
So he reprimand people
if they are committing

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.080
something that is not correct.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.250
So they were feeling really bad
about themselves all the time.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.510
So he felt hurt, and so he left.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.210
At that time I realized that
my master wasn't bad at all.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.030
The fact that he
has a humor, it's

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.270
like a great quality I realize.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.850
He doesn't take
himself very seriously,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.430
and he knows that
he's imperfect.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.010
Because he's imperfect--
he knows he's imperfect,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.570
he's willing to forgive other
people who is imperfect.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.660
So a lot of monks
who have some trouble

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.120
or have some scandal
outside, they

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.730
will all ended up
coming to my temple,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:22.010
and we are all living happily
together because my master is

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.750
so forgiving anyway.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.830
And whenever he gets angry, and
he I usually feel bad about it

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.310
next day, and he gives
me a pocket money.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.670
So there are so many
wonderful qualities.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.300
So I still get along
with my master very well,

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.800
and I really respect my master.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.930
So I think once we
accept our imperfections,

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.110
I think we become much
more genuine person.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.240
And we are willing to
show our vulnerability.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.570
When we show our
vulnerable side,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.950
then I think we can
meet on other people

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.720
in a much deeper and true way.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.380
And that there you can create
much meaningful and deep

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.706
relationship.

00:17:07.706 --> 00:17:10.280
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: You
speak about acceptance

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.720
and accepting our imperfections,
other people's imperfections,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.260
and you speak about how
that starts with self care,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.670
self-love.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:25.670
So can you tell us what
you define self care to be

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.720
and how it fits into acceptance?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.630
HAEMIN SUNIM: Yeah
I talk about this

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.550
in my first chapter of this book
because while I was growing up,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.240
I was taught to be a good boy.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.260
I just wanted to make my
parents very happy and proud,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.590
and I wanted to be
a good student, too.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.210
So I wanted to make my
teacher to be happy and proud,

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.300
and then I want to
be a good friends.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.210
I wanted to make my friends
to be happy around me,

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.000
so I wanted to
please other people.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.970
However, while I was doing
it, I neglected myself.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.010
I neglected the
well-being of myself.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.500
For example, when I
went to graduate school,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.900
I remember because I would say
yes, yes, yes to everything.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.250
And in the group
work, I ended up

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.350
getting all the difficult
work all the time.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.550
So I was just assumed that
if I do one difficult work,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.090
maybe the other will do
difficult work later,

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.960
but it didn't happen like
that, especially in the US.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.900
So I said, oh, I don't know
what to do with this problem.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.230
So I was talking to
my friend, and then he

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.120
told me that you
have an obligation

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.090
to be good to yourself first.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.775
So when we are being--

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:49.240
taking time to care
about self, care about

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.810
are physical or emotional
well-being, then what happen

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.590
is when we are happier,
when we are healthier,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.740
then we can be nice
to other people.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.910
And the opposite is also true.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.110
If we just say yes, yes, yes
to everything and if you've

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:09.910
become overwhelmed and you
become completely exhausted,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.750
then your relationship
will suffer.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.950
So I think we have to learn
to say no to some time

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.530
to certain thing but do it
in a very compassionate way

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.540
and so that you are not
creating abrupt difficulty

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.392
in a relationship.

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:31.600
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: I'd like
to shift gears a little bit

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.030
and talk about depression.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.180
Approximately 1 in
4 people in the UK

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.630
will experience a mental
health problem each year,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.320
and 1 in 6 report experiencing
a common mental health

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.630
problem in any given week.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.960
There is a chapter on
depression in the book,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.840
so seems like a big challenge.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.810
How should we handle
it, and how should we

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.890
react to it when perhaps
we're feeling depressed?

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.870
HAEMIN SUNIM: Yeah,
it's a big top topic.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.860
And sometimes we know the
cause of our own depression,

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.340
but sometimes we simply do
not know why we feel that way.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.190
Maybe because our body
is getting old, and then

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.530
to a certain change in our body,
we feel emotionally depressed.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.050
But sometimes we do know
why we feel depressed.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.000
For example, if you
have a very high hope,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.870
you have a high expectation
high goal to achieve,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.650
but if you look at your own
reality you are way down here.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.160
And so the distance
between where you are

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.130
and where you want
to go it's huge.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.870
And you've been
trying to go there

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.930
very for many, many
years, and yet you

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.540
realize that I may not
be able to get there.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.840
And then you, of course,
feel very depressed.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.010
If that is the case, then rather
than setting really high bar,

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.650
I would recommend that why
don't you break it down

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.300
and then to look for something
easier goal to achieve.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.980
And so rather than feeling
that I am a huge failure, I--

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.130
you can turn it around
and say I do make--

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.690
my life is full of success.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.932
It can be very little
thing, but it can be--

00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:15.400
you can do it little by little.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.810
And you can also--

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.050
if you're seriously
depressed, then I

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.170
think it is important
that you look and seek

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.590
out professional
help from a doctor.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.470
But if you are feeling a little
bit blue once in a while,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.805
then I think it is important
that we move our body.

00:21:33.805 --> 00:21:37.750
We often think that we
can if by just thinking

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.260
about positive thing, maybe
we can change our mind,

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.320
but our mind and body is so
close really interconnected.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.440
So if you're feeling
a little bit depressed

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.540
or a little bit
blue, then I suggest

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.280
that why don't you
go out and take

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.720
a walk in a beautiful nature.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.860
And so if you look at a bird
or flowers or green lawn

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.850
or whatever then a
sky, you can get out

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.100
of this perpetual
negative thinking loop.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.240
You know what I mean?

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.230
So by paying attention to what
is happening in front of you,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.806
you can become
less self obsessed.

00:22:17.806 --> 00:22:19.180
SHIFALI MUDUMBA:
I'd like to know

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:25.050
how many people in the
room meditate, say, daily?

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.070
Sometimes.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.430
OK.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.100
At least once a month?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.000
OK.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.180
So we have some
enthusiasts in the room.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.310
I'd like to, if I
may, read a passage

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.680
from the book about meditation.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.470
"The true nature of our
mind is like the sky.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:46.000
Our thoughts are like clouds,
our emotions like lightning,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.400
and the sky accepts
them all equally,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.070
watching as they shift
and move across it.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.440
The weather of
thoughts and emotions

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.250
rises and passes away, but
the sky remains the same--

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.300
clear, luminous, open."

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.140
It's a really wonderful
passage, but it's

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.250
hard to get into that
state where it really

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.860
feels like the clouds
and the lightning are

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.410
moving in and out.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.040
And what-- how do we get there?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.540
I guess it's-- obviously there's
an element of regular practice.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.420
But what advice do you have
for us meditation enthusiasts?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.420
HAEMIN SUNIM: Very good.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.920
Very good.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.530
I was deeply touched
and very happy

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.650
that you guys are
into meditation.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.140
That is really wonderful.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.000
But I was-- I'm also hoping that
you guys can take a step more

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.630
and do a little bit
deeper meditation.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.730
That is we can meditate just
to feel good about ourselves,

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:55.040
to understand about our thinking
mind and things like that.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.670
But you can also
go a step further.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:03.160
That is what is
that which knows.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.900
We know everything.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.230
Do you-- are you
aware that I am here.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:13.470
So then what is that which is
aware of Haemin Sunim is here?

00:24:16.127 --> 00:24:16.960
You see what I mean?

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.070
Yeah.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.150
We only pay attention
to the object,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.550
the object of awareness, but can
we pay attention to awareness

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.270
itself?

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.170
Can you become aware
of your own awareness.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.250
From that awareness-- field
of awareness I would say--

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.170
everything rises and disappears.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.060
It can be your good feeling
or negative thoughts,

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.080
whatever that is.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.390
It arises and disappears.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:52.340
However, this awareness
field, it never moves.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.260
It never disappears.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.950
Can you stop being aware?

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.950
Can you try-- let's say
for the next 3 minute--

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.010
can you say for the next
three minutes, I will--

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.590
I have decided not to be aware?

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.250
Can you do that?

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.480
Even if you close your
eyes and close your ears,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.090
you will become aware that,
oh, I don't see anything.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.350
You've become aware that,
oh, there is nothing.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.600
Awareness is still happening--

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.510
you see what I mean--
whether you like it or not.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.900
But the-- whatever the
object you become aware of,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.970
it comes and goes.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.330
It's impermanent.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:36.830
However, that which
is aware, it stays.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.110
That is a deeper meditation.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.741
SHIFALI MUDUMBA:
How do we get there?

00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:45.680
HAEMIN SUNIM: The truth
is we are already there.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.000
We just have to simply
see what is already there.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.620
We don't try to be aware.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.090
When you look at
me, do you try, say,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.550
OK, I'm going to try
to be aware of what

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.020
is happening in front of me?

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.350
No, it just happen
automatically.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.560
So it is already
there, this awareness.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.390
It follows everywhere.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.570
Even when you are in a
dreaming, you are aware.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.460
This awareness you can
never escape so to speak.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.800
But do you have any memory
of this awareness being born?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.110
Do you have any memory of the
birth of you or your awareness?

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.940
No, we don't.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.330
Awareness is ever present.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.251
It was never born, and
therefore it will never die.

00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:38.500
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: But you
have to tune into it somehow.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.700
And that's attention?

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.170
HAEMIN SUNIM: Yeah,
just to become aware

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.806
of your own awareness.

00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:47.990
SHIFALI MUDUMBA:
How much of that

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.550
is, for example, paying
attention to your breathing

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.480
because I find that
meditation practice,

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.970
it starts with the
simplest way of becoming

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:03.620
aware is being aware of
your breath because it's

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.260
a way of bringing
your mind back.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.430
HAEMIN SUNIM: Exactly.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.210
It's an excellent practice.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.580
If we can just bring
our mind to the--

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.920
our breath, it has
so many benefits.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.050
First thing is our
body feels better.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.760
As we are taking a deep
breath, what happened?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:30.200
We feel much more relaxed,
our heart starts to slow down,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:36.530
and we feel a different part of
our mind becomes more relaxed

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.790
and has space.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.745
And also as we breathe--

00:27:40.745 --> 00:27:44.570
pay attention to our breath,
we are bringing our mind

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.070
into the present moment.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.370
When we bring our mind
to the present moment,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:54.050
there is no more
attachment to what

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.990
happened in the past, no
more anxiety about what's

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.820
going to happen in the future.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.810
Also when your mind
becomes empty and quiet,

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.060
that's where the
creativity comes.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.290
If you want to be creative,
notice that usually you

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.400
have this creative idea when
you are not constantly thinking.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.700
You might be thinking a
lot and then give yourself

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.960
some one hour of rest time
while you're walking around

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.780
in a park or something or
taking a shower, and then

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.030
all of a sudden, what happens?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.529
Boom!

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:28.310
I have a new idea.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:33.470
So when we do not have
a lot of thoughts,

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:38.080
when our mind become very
quiet, we have this creativity.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.580
Another benefit
is when the breath

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.550
itself does not have any form--

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.800
breath doesn't have any form--

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.280
can you capture any
form of a breath?

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.180
No because it's formless
because we are paying attention

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.520
to what is formless, which
is very close to awareness.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.160
Awareness does not
have any form or shape.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.120
So it is very good entry
point to become aware

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.532
of your awareness.

00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:08.990
SHIFALI MUDUMBA:
With that, I would

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:14.514
like to hand it over to
Googlers to ask some questions.

00:29:14.514 --> 00:29:17.160
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank
you for being here.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.640
I just wanted to ask because
obviously the scenarios

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.570
that you are touching on--

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.570
cancer, losing a child,
something like that--

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.450
what if that is the
present and that's--

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.005
we're focusing on the present
but the present sucks?

00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:35.030
I agree with letting
go of the past

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.710
and not looking to
the future, but I

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.250
think it's harder to do if
there's actually something

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.340
going on in the present that
doesn't deserve focus maybe

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.530
or drags us down.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.207
What do we do?

00:29:45.207 --> 00:29:46.040
HAEMIN SUNIM: Right.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.020
Right.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.780
First of all, my
heart goes out to you.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.080
You'll be in a very difficult
situation, especially when

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.460
your child is sick.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.280
It's a really daunting thing.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.545
Or you yourself has
some kind of illness.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.040
What I would say is this.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:13.000
If you are carefully examine
your body or examine your mind,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.790
you will notice that you
are not sick 24 hours.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.720
You know what I mean?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.190
Even if you are sick, even
if you have an illness,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.660
you are not sick 24 hours a day.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.480
But what's troubling
you is whenever

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.380
you have a thought
of illness, whenever

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.890
gosh I have an illness.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.440
I don't know what to do.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.980
Then that thought
triggers this depression

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.650
or depressive emotions.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.430
So realize that when
you are little bit

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.910
in a difficult
situation, maybe it

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.660
is the thought that keep
thinking about it again

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.480
and again that is
causing the problem.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.840
What-- but sometimes
we do forget,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.920
and then we watch TV and watch
some funny episode of sitcom

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.290
or something then we can
laugh because our mind is not

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.150
dwelling on that thought.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:20.781
So as the thought we momentarily
not dwelling on, then we

00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:21.280
don't--

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.020
we can appreciate what is
happening in spite of this.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.610
For example, I remember I
was in a difficult situation

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:38.980
where I had a fan in
Korea who really liked me

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.630
obsessively and tried to
follow me around and show up

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.310
on every single talk that I was
giving, and I was a little bit

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.780
scared.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.440
This person was
almost stalker right.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.000
Whenever I thought about her,
I was feeling a little bit

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.770
depressed because this
person is projecting

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.810
a lot of this person's
emotion onto me.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.410
And if I do not tell--

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.010
or satisfied this person's
needs, then this person

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.000
goes online and ended up
saying all the negative things

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.180
about me and then
making people believe

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.970
this person's testimony.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.720
But whenever I was
thinking about her,

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.900
I realized that my mind
became very depressed.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.500
However, when I was
not thinking about her,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.050
I realized that I was OK.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.520
So the very source of suffering
was a thought I realized.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.210
What is making us feel
really depressed and angry

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.570
is whether we dwell
on that thought.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.870
So if we can just bring our
mind to present moment, what

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.180
is really happening
right in front of us,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.240
you can have a cup of
tea with your best friend

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.700
or you can be listening
to inspiring talk,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.820
then you don't have to think
about those kind of problems.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.090
You see what I mean.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.690
So I would say that
pay more attention

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.712
to present moment even more.

00:33:10.712 --> 00:33:12.045
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: More questions?

00:33:12.045 --> 00:33:14.080
AUDIENCE: I have a
question on whether you

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.600
have any suggestions--

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.490
I know you've talked a lot
about individual practice

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.820
to be more present
and more aware.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.630
As a family with children
and with your partner,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.310
is there any practices
that you think

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:31.152
could help as a family--
the whole family?

00:33:31.152 --> 00:33:36.050
HAEMIN SUNIM: When you are
living with many children

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.380
then you have a
very demanding job

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.650
and when you go back you have
a partner waiting for you,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.500
then it's very difficult for
us to have a sense of calmness

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.780
in everyday activity.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:53.230
So what I usually suggest is
see if you can still carve out

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.080
a little bit of time even
if it's five minutes a day

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.560
or 10 minutes a day.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.720
So what that means is
rather than getting off

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.480
at your regular bus stations,
you can get off like a three

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.170
stop before, and
then you can maybe

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.770
enjoy you know walking
back home while listening

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:12.790
to your favorite song.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:18.190
So carving out-- just having
this intention to care about

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:22.300
myself first, you can go to
your favorite coffee shop

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.410
and while you are
enjoying coffee or tea,

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:29.300
you can have a more
relaxed time and checking

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.139
in with my mind and my body.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.239
Or you can go to your
favorite bookshop.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.060
Whenever I go to bookshop
and see a empty chair,

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.695
I'm so happy.

00:34:38.695 --> 00:34:42.909
I go sit there and read, and
this gives me a downtime.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.520
And then when I go to--

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.280
back to your home or
go back to your work,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.870
then you can go back
with your refreshed mind.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:58.600
And also in your daily activity
with your family member, what

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.200
I would suggest is rather
than thinking that we already

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.410
know about our family
member, we often

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.780
think that I already
know everything

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.965
there is to know about my
boyfriend, girlfriend, husband,

00:35:10.965 --> 00:35:13.840
and wife or my children,
then what happen

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.960
is we stop asking questions.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.550
We are not curious about
what happened to their lives.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.100
But the thing is
we always change.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.140
We are changing.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.540
Our children are changing.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.130
Our husband or
partners are changing.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:36.850
So if we approach to your family
member with sense of curiosity

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.330
and humility that you don't know
everything there is to know,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.580
then you can have a
deeper conversation.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.520
You can ask, oh, how
have you been today?

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.930
How was-- what is going on?

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.820
And then it is also important
to share not just the fact.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.500
People often just say, oh what
time are you getting home?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.570
Oh, 7:00.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.800
What did you have dinner?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.780
I had chicken teriyaki.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.840
That's like a fact.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.940
You just asked.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.360
However, I think it is
important that we also

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.100
ask how we are feeling,
which is the deeper self.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.630
How are you feeling?

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:17.090
So allowing some time for
us to unpack our own feeling

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.230
and feeling that the other
person is really hearing me

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.765
out, it can create deeper bond.

00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:24.070
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.810
Thank you for being here today.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:31.390
There's a situation that I
find puzzling in general,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.450
which is on one hand the--

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.240
I buy into the power
of vulnerability,

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.750
the importance of
embracing imperfections,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.350
of knowing them, et cetera.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.140
But on the other hand,
I have the feeling

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.550
that the world and
especially social media world

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.890
can be a great
medium for knowledge,

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.770
et cetera, there is this
race towards perfection

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:57.520
and only actually
depicting what's perfect.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.840
When you look at people
today on social media,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.629
no one really puts their picture
when they're feeling ill or bad

00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:05.420
or when they're arguing
with their partner.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.890
It's all like how
happy, clappy, peppy.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.390
And I find it really puzzling
because I think it's antinomic.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.460
What would be your
advice to maybe,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.950
especially the
younger ones that are

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.880
going to experience more and
more social pressure on media

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.260
and to still keep that
philosophy of loving

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.870
imperfections?

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.490
Thank you.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.390
HAEMIN SUNIM: I was in
Canada near Vancouver.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.550
I was invited to
give a talk there.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:42.070
And then after the event,
I drove up with my friend,

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.440
and I heard there's
a beautiful mountain.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.180
And if you just walk
about four hours,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.160
and you'll see snow-capped
mountain with beautiful lake.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.410
So I decided to go there.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.080
So I went there,
but what I did not

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.690
know was that while
climbing up going up,

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.830
up up, there were
a lot of flies.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.020
You know the box flies?

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.400
And so for the last four hours,
as I was growing up, I would--

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.290
I have to do this.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.920
I have to do this constantly
because there are so

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.810
many flies and bugs around me.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.520
And then once I get to that
in a beautiful scenic spot,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.470
I was very happy,
but at the same time

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.750
I was extremely
hungry and exhausted.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.950
However, when I
took the photo, I

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:33.310
was smiling as if
you know there was

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.970
no bug, as if there was
no exhaustion, as if there

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.620
was no hunger.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:46.270
So when you see very happy face
on your friend's Facebook entry

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.410
or Twitter or
other social media,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.490
Instagram or YouTube,
just remind yourself

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:57.490
that maybe this person
was fighting off

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.330
the flies for the
last four hours

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:04.180
and then suffering from
the exhaustion and hunger.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:13.180
So I think having that
awareness helps quite a bit.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.120
And also rather than
comparing ourselves

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.490
with somebody who's doing
a lot better because there

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:24.010
will be always somebody who is
always doing better than you--

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.090
I was advised--

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.320
I remember we have to compare
ourselves to our old us.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.940
So, for example, I remember
in Korea, the richest person

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.560
in Korea is the owner of Samsung
you know the Samsung right?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.220
And so I thought that, wow,
this guy must be really rich.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.150
And then one day I was
reading a newspaper article,

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.560
and it ranked the wealth of
different people in the world.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.740
And he ranked like
170-something.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:59.180
And then I realized that even
if he was to comparing himself,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.880
then he would feel, oh, gosh,
I only made it 170-something.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.950
You see what I mean?

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.810
So we shouldn't do that.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:13.690
Rather we should become proud
of how much we have achieved

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.380
so far for the last
10 years or 15 years,

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.350
how much we have grown
spiritually, emotionally,

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.650
and also career-wise.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.125
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: I think
we'll take one last question.

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:27.000
AUDIENCE: Right here.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.124
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: Oh, sorry.

00:40:28.124 --> 00:40:29.341
Yes.

00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:32.170
AUDIENCE: I think we can learn
a lot definitely and apply

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.750
a lot to our lives.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:37.630
I am just thinking if we take
this idea of being content

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.130
and being constantly
present in our--

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.240
to the extreme and let's say
everyone became like a Buddhist

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.920
monk or close to that,
what would happen?

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.100
Because a lot of the stuff that
we do is because the problems

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.170
we have, the things
that bugs us,

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.630
the ambitions and
insecurities that drives us.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.360
So how do you view being
content with ourselves

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.400
and really enjoying the
life versus our obligation

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.750
towards society or
civilization to progress it

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:13.150
by constantly seeing the bugs
and trying to get rid of them

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.480
or put them aside or make
them not bite you right

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.312
rather than being content
that they are around you

00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:20.270
and just ignoring them?

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.860
HAEMIN SUNIM: Like connecting
to the present moment

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.480
and being mindful
of what's going on,

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.290
it doesn't mean that
you become lazy.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.140
It doesn't become-- it
doesn't mean that you become

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.450
I don't care about the world.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:41.470
I think just being
content actually

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:48.640
allows us to engage in our
work in a much proficient way.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.240
When you are happy, notice
that you can actually

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.460
respond quickly.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:59.230
There is a space for you
to tolerate annoyances

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:05.170
of other people because you find
much more peaceful at heart.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.660
The opposite is the problem.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.470
That is if your heart is closed
off and feeling that you're

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.930
completely isolated
and you are thinking

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:18.430
about what happened in the past
while ignoring the bug that

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:24.190
is coming up right now, then I
think this can become problems.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.180
Your stress level is already
up and feeling like a victim

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.960
because I have another
wok that I have to do.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.870
So I would say that
just being mindful

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:41.050
doesn't mean that you
become like a corpse.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:45.520
Instead you can actually respond
much more compassionately,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.080
much quickly to the demands
or difficulty of other peoples

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.586
having.

00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:54.765
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: One last
question in the back, Dennis.

00:42:54.765 --> 00:42:57.820
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.600
So we have a mindfulness
meditation community here

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.222
at Google.

00:43:01.222 --> 00:43:02.680
And there's a lot
of people who are

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.480
I think trying to get
into a daily practice.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.896
I'm really curious
to hear what is

00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:09.010
your take on the benefits
of a daily practice

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.520
and also maybe
some practical tips

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.310
around how to
establish one because I

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.960
think it's quite hard
in the beginning.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.460
It takes a while
to get the benefits

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.080
or to start feeling the impact.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.747
So if you've any tips on how to
best get into that a routine.

00:43:21.747 --> 00:43:22.580
HAEMIN SUNIM: Right.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.700
Right.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.820
Well, I would say
that if you are

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.560
interested in
mindfulness meditation

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.990
and you want to
get into that but I

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.740
don't know how to do that, then
the first thing I would say

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.780
is make a--

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.570
have a very low expectation.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.840
So rather than
say, oh, I'm going

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.330
to sit quietly for the next 20
minutes without any thinking

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:51.670
and then paying attention fully
to my breath, just reduce.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.020
Scale back and say
that well I'm going

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.480
to spend next two minutes.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.840
See if we can--

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.540
if I can just sit quietly
and enjoy my breath.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.550
And if you accomplish two
minutes, then you can say,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.060
oh, I will do 2
minutes and 30 seconds,

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.400
and then slowly you
can increase it.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.700
So you don't have to say I'm
going to somehow bliss out.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.550
And if I'm not, then
maybe I'm a failure.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.020
But that is not the case.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.970
Meditation isn't so much to get
to a certain state of our mind,

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:30.010
rather whether we can mindful
of whatever the state we are in.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:31.780
So if we can be
mindful of, oh, I

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.220
feel frustrated because
nothing is happening

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.400
or I feel wasting of my time
because I'm not focusing,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.430
then become mindful
of that thought.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.860
Oh, I just had that
frustration thought.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.205
Oh, interesting.

00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:47.080
You know what I mean?

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.570
Oh, I had that
frustration feeling.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:50.510
Interesting.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.820
This is mindfulness.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.195
So I would-- that
would be my answer.

00:44:55.195 --> 00:44:56.510
SHIFALI MUDUMBA: Thank you.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.510
So I should say

00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:59.320

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.750
