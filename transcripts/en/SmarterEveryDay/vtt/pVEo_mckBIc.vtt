00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:02.555
Hey it's me, Destin. Welcome
to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:04.673
Today we-
(Jörg) Nope. [Chuckles]

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:08.087
Welcome to the Slingshot Channel.
[Laughs]

00:00:09.908 --> 00:00:12.748
(Destin) As you can see, today
I've been taken over by Germans.

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:15.810
We're going to look at slingshots today.

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.375
The physics of slingshots.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.664
So why do they call your channel the
Slingshot Channel? I don't understand.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.721
(Jörg) You know, I don't understand either.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:26.826
You know, you would think that
we'd call it the Nice Guys Channel

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.608
or something like that, so... No,
they called it the Slingshot Channel.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.211
- I think it makes sense.
[Both laugh]

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.959
We're going to talk about
the energy use in bands.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:37.749
Do you want to say anything about it?

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.545
- Yes. Well, this is of course the
lightest slingshot that I've ever built.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.214
[Both laugh]

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.804
Not exactly. It's actually
the most powerful one.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.658
The energy of a rifle shot, and it
has the momentum of a sledgehammer.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.746
- Alright, so we'll do the
math and see if Jörg is right.

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:56.478
So let's look at the physics of slingshots.

00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:59.869
Kinetic energy is 1/2 mass
times velocity squared.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.352
For a .22 it's about 153 joules,

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:07.007
but for a Springfield
.30-06 it's 3841 joules.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:10.615
I calculated the momentum of a sledgehammer
by smashing bricks in the back yard

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.441
and analyzing the high-speed.

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.096
It worked out to about 46 newton seconds.

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.826
There is an angle between the
band and the point of anchoring.

00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.992
This angle... I'm not going to get my hand
in there, 'cause I don't want to die.

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:25.235
But this angle... if you take
the cosine of that angle,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.436
that is the amount of force going
into accelerating the projectile.

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:33.432
So the closer the bands, the
more efficient the slingshot.

00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:36.099
Is that correct, Jörg?
- Yes, exactly.

00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:41.020
- Yeah, this is as awesome as it looks.

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:42.096
[Click, wooden clang]

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.858
(Jörg) So because it's rather cold now,

00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:50.202
and also we kept the bands in drawn
out condition for quite a while,

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:51.777
the shot went low a little bit

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:54.621
because the rubber was a
little bit tired already,

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:58.545
and in cold weather rubber doesn't
work as well as in hot temperatures.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.396
- Ah. Makes sense.

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:04.116
It was almost a complete momentum
transfer between that ball and the wood.

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:08.133
The mass-times-velocity of the
ball went all into the wood,

00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:12.882
So the mass-times-velocity of the wood
after the shot would be equal to the ball.

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:16.035
[Music]

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.030
[Man speaks German]

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:21.041
[Click, splat]

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.490
(Destin) Yes!
[Laughs]

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.383
[Music]

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.635
So I'm Destin, and you are
getting smarter every day.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.088
And if you want to, go check out Jörg's
channel - the Slingshot Channel.

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:41.810
Yeah?
- Yes. Make sure.

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:44.208
So I'll put a link for you to click,

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:46.766
so go to his channel and
if you like it, subscribe.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.732
That's it. Bye.

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:51.326
(Jörg) This is the only
slingshot that I've ever built

00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:53.643
that makes grown men giggle
like they're small girls.

00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:56.185
[Both laugh]

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.134
- Okay, slingshots are all about turning
potential energy into kinetic energy.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.788
So the first thing we have to do, is we
have to build up the potential energy,

00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:06.173
so Jörg is doing that now...

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:08.717
with his sissy device.

00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:11.051
[Destin giggles]

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.427
That translates, right?
[Giggles]

00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:18.685
(Jörg) Pretty much. And I
will soon be done here, so...

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.671
- So I'll have to start running.

00:03:20.696 --> 00:03:26.034
So this is a very, very large steel
ball, clasped here between the dowels,

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.015
and we're going to try
to destroy this pumpkin.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.001
The pumpkin really has no chance.

00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:33.547
It's just a question of if we can hit it.

00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:38.047
