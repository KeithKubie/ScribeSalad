00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.670
We're on problem 66.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.550
In the accompanying diagram,
the measure of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.540
angle a is 32 degrees.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.770
And AC is equal to 10.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.060
Which equation could be used
to find x in triangle ABC?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.380
So we want x.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.960
So let's write our
SOHCAHTOA down.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.880
What are they giving us?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.250
Well x is the opposite side,
this is equal to the opposite,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.760
it's opposite of our
angle in question.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.190
And then this 10 side
is the adjacent.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.150
So I haven't looked at the
choices yet, but if we say the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.650
tangent of 32 degrees should be
equal to the opposite side,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.670
which is x, over the adjacent
side, which is 10.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.870
And then if we multiply both
sides of this by 10, we get 10

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.580
tangent of 32 degrees
is equal to x.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.860
Let's hope that's one
of the choices.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.410
Yep, sure enough, C.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.270
x is equal to 10 tangent
of 32 degrees.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.200
Everything in trigonometry
really does

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.310
boil down to SOHCAHTOA.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.350
You'll be amazed.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.910
When you actually take
trigonometry as a class,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.420
you'll see that they
have all these trig

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.350
identities and all that.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.160
But all of those things can be
just proved from SOHCAHTOA.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.880
And these are just definitions
of ratios that have been very

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.280
useful in the world when
studying triangles.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.700
All right, 67.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.010
But you can watch, we have a
whole playlist on trigonometry

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.610
and we talk about all the
ratios and the unit

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.320
circle and all that.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.500
So if you're enjoying these
problems, I encourage you to

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.520
watch those videos.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.455
Or if you don't understand these
problems, I encourage

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.870
you even more to watch
those videos.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.240
All right.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.610
The diagram shows an 8 foot
ladder leaning against a wall.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.800
The ladder makes a 53 degree
angle with the wall.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.030
Which is closest to the distance
up the wall the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.230
ladder reaches?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.990
So this is what they
care about, this

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.810
distance right here.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.430
So let's see how we
can figure it out.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270
If we write SOHCAHTOA, maybe
we don't have to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.620
to write that anymore.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.460
So we have this angle and
what have they given us?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.910
This deals with the hypotenuse,
which is 8.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.535
And it deals with this
adjacent side.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.630
So what trig function deals with
the adjacent side and the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.020
hypotenuse.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.820
Well, I'll write it down.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.070
SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.050
We want to figure out adjacent,
we have the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.540
hypotenuse.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.940
What trig function
deals with it?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.100
Well, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.870
So the cosine of 53 degrees is
equal to the adjacent side of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.950
this triangle, of this
right triangle.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.190
So that's A.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.960
And you should only be applying
these, right now,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.220
with right triangles.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.610
Later on we'll learn, in
trigonometry how trig

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.640
functions are useful
for any triangle.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.480
Because obviously, only
a right triangle has a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.050
hypotenuse.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.330
So these h's wouldn't be too
meaningful if you're not

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.470
dealing with a right triangle.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.380
Back to the problem.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.520
Cosine of 53, it equals the
adjacent side over the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.410
hypotenuse, which is 8.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.960
I can write x there, x
is the adjacent side.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.720
So we multiply both sides of
this by 8, we get 8 times the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.460
cosine of 53 degrees
is equal to x.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.960
And they give us
a little chart.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.680
They tell us that the cosine of
53 degrees is approximately

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.240
equal to 0.6.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.070
So we get 8 times 0.6
is equal to x.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.770
8 times 0.6 is 4.8.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.800
So x is equal to 4.8.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.420
And that is choice B.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.920
Problem 68.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
Triangle JKL is shown below.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.200
Fair enough.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.530
Which equation should be used
to find the length of JK?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.560
This is JK.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.270
All right so we have
this angle here.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.920
JK is the opposite side.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.480
We want to figure out
the opposite side.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.519
We have the hypotenuse.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.920
So what trig function deals with
opposite and hypotenuse?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.800
Well I could just
write SOH down.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.970
I'm don't even have to write
the whole SOHCAHTOA.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.210
Because sine is equal to the
opposite side over the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.350
hypotenuse.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.520
So in this case, sine of 24
degrees is equal to the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.780
opposite side, which is side
JK, over the hypotenuse.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.840
This is the hypotenuse
right here, 28.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.840
The longest side of the right
triangle, or the side that's

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.800
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.160
And so maybe we're done.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.690
So sine of 24 degrees is
equal to JK over 28.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.940
That's choice A.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.070
Problem 69.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.650
These are kind of fun,
aren't they?

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.710
What is the approximate height
in feet of the tree in the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.260
figure below?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.080
Now you'll see why trigonometry
is useful,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.160
because I'm sure you often
wonder how tall is that tree?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.050
And it might be hard
to climb it.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.320
And now you can use
trigonometry.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.440
If you just have a way to
measure the angle between your

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.350
line of sight and between you
and the top of the tree.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.120
You've probably seen those
surveyors, actually they use

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.760
things like this.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.090
And you can figure out the
heights of things far away if

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.630
you know how far away
you are from it.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.070
But anyway, let's work
on this problem.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.880
What is the approximate height
in feet of the tree in the

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.580
figure below?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.990
OK, so this is 50.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.580
So let's think about it.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.780
What do they tell us?

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.460
This is 90, this is 50.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.390
So the approximate
height in feet.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.120
OK, so this is the opposite
side of this angle.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.320
So let's call this h.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.480
So what deals with the
opposite side?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.125
Actually I should use h,
let's call that O.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.450
O is the height of the
tree because it's

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.930
opposite the 50 angle.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.870
So what deals with the opposite
and the hypotenuse?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.580
So once again, SOHCAHTOA.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.220
We just have to look
at the SOHA part.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.870
Sine is equal to opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:36.790
So the sine of 50 degrees is
equal to the opposite side of

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.660
this triangle, that's the
height of the tree.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.810
So I'll say O for the
height of the tree.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.010
Over the hypotenuse, the
hypotenuse is 100 feet.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.730
Multiply both sides by 100.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.710
You get 100 sine of 50 is equal
to this opposite side,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.430
which is equal to the
height of the tree.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.830
Sine of 50 is 0.76.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.360
So 0.76 times 100
is equal to O.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.610
That 76 is equal to O, or
the height of the tree.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.600
Oh, they said 0.766.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.160
So let's put another 6.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.480
That becomes 76.6.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.730
And that's choice B.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.720
All right.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560
Problem 70.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.320
These go fast. If a is equal
to 3 roots of 3 in the

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.570
triangle below.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.690
I think you're going to learn a
little bit about 30, 60, 90

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.140
triangles now.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.695
What is the value of B?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.600
OK, maybe they assume that you
already do know something

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.070
about 30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.330
But anyway, if a is equal
to 3 root 3, what is B?

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.830
And I'm debating on what
I should assume

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.130
that you already know.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.530
But let's think about
it a little bit.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.090
Let me see how I can do this
without resorting to just the

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.200
definition of 30, 60,
90 triangles.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.350
I'll prove it for you.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.940
Although, later you
can memorize.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.360
Because when I keep saying 30,
60, 90 triangles, we know that

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.260
this right here is 60 degrees.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.040
Because 30, plus 60, plus 90
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.090
So that's why we could
we keep calling this

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.510
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.280
So how do we figure out
this side, if we

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.310
just know that side?

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.830
And we know this
is 30 degrees.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.840
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to try to redraw

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.620
this same triangle but I'm
going to flip it over.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.799
And this is actually the proof
of figuring out the measures

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.950
of a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.330
So maybe I'll do it in
a different color.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.420
And I have some time
so I'll do it.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.840
Let's see.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.520
So I'll do it like that.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.840
I have to bring another line
down, something like that.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.495
And then I'll have to draw
another line more like that.

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:02.590
I think you get the idea.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.660
And then bring a line
across like that.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.930
And actually, I'm going to draw
another line straight

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.360
down like that.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.360
OK, let's see what we
can do with this.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.660
Maybe there's an easier
way to do it.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.400
But this is just what my brain
is thinking of right now.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.140
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.510
In this drawing that I've done,
this triangle is just a

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.590
mirror image of that one.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.060
So this right here,
this is also 60.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.990
This is 60, this is 60, what's
this angle going to be?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.710
Well they're all collectively
supplements of each other.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.030
If you go all the way
from there to there,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.340
you have 180 degrees.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.540
So this big angle right here
has got to be 60 degrees.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.340
This angle right here, it's
a complement of 30.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.140
So this is 60 degrees.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.890
And then this is 60 degrees.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.380
So this is an equilateral
triangle.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.550
All the sides are going
to be equal.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.690
So that side is equal to
that side, which is

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.650
equal to this side.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.230
Now let me ask another
question.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.650
What is this side right here?

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.630
Let me just draw the
shorter part.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.050
And once you memorize 30, 60,
90 triangles, you don't have

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.180
to go through all this.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.310
But it's good to be able
to reprove it.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.460
So what's this length
right here?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.190
Well if we look right up
there, that's length a.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.750
This was just a mirror image,
so this is also length a.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.860
This whole base of the
equilateral triangle is 2a.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.700
Well it's an equilateral
triangle so all the sides are

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.330
the same, so this is
2a and this is 2a.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.890
And just like that we were
able to figure out the

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.290
hypotenuse.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.580
And they want to know
what the b is.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.660
Once we know two sides of a
right triangle, it's very easy

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.230
to figure out the third side.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.270
So we know that a squared
plus b squared

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.000
is equal to c squared.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.250
Let me write that down.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.036
Now what's a squared?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.510
a is 3 roots of 3.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.680
So a squared would be, let me
write it down, 3 roots of 3

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.420
squared plus b squared is equal
to, let me do it in

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.670
another color.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.320
What's c? c, we just figured
out, is 2 times a.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.630
So it's 6 roots of 3 squared.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.680
That's what we did all this
stuff for, to figure out that

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.370
this length is twice
that length.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.500
Fair enough.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.340
Now let's simplify.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.990
So if we take 3 roots of 3 to
the second power, that's the

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.060
same thing as 3 squared times
square root of 3 squared.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.450
So that's 9 times 3
plus b squared is

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.920
equal to 36 times 3.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.820
And so that's 27
plus b squared.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.030
36 times 3 is 108.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.060
Subtract 27 from both sides.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.300
b squared is equal to 81.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.070
b is equal to 9.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.160
So that is choice a.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.550
Anyway, you should watch the
videos I've done in the

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.410
trigonometry playlist on 30, 60,
90 triangles if you want

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.570
to be able to do this faster.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.440
But I think that was useful.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.770
Because you've actually seem
how you can figure out the

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.130
sides of a 30, 60, 90 triangle
without having memorized it

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.810
ahead of time.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.170
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
