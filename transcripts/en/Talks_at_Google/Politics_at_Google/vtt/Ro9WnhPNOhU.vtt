[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.310
CARNE ROSS: I think I'm
going to try and talk

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.840
for 20, 30 minutes.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.391
And then maybe we
have a discussion

00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:15.140
about some of the
things I've talked about

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.540
or anything, really.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.080
What I'm going to try and
do is tell you the story--

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.550
a little bit of which is in this
book-- but the story of what

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.670
happened to me as a British
diplomat, what it showed me

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.350
about diplomacy, and indeed,
about government, which I hope

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.910
will be interesting.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.870
There's also, I should add,
if you want the full story,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
there's a movie that's just
been broadcast on BBC Four

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.800
last Sunday on
"Storyville," which

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.790
you can watch on iPlayer,
which is the full movie

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.600
version of this talk.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.580
Anyway, it's not a terribly
common thing to be a diplomat.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.790
I always wanted to
be one, I think,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.040
partly because it was
venerated in my family.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980
My grandfather worked
as a codebreaker

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.190
at Bletchley Park
with Alan Turing.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.810
That was, in fact, a
foreign office institution.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.210
And I was celebrated
in my family

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.660
as the stupidest, because
evidence of which is I'm

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.160
a twin.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.800
And my twin brother was put
in the year ahead of me.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.400
So the manifestation of my
inferiority was very public.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.250
So nobody expected me
to succeed in passing

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.560
the exams to become a
British diplomat, which

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.090
were quite competitive.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.240
In the year I got in, 20 people
got out of 5,000 applicants,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.380
so a bit like coming
to work for Google now.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.882
And this surprised everybody,
not least of all me.

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:53.840
But I was very pleased.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.006
Because I was fascinated
by international relations.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:58.910
I'd always read the newspaper
from a very early age

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.980
from cover to cover
reading about Afghanistan,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.340
the Soviet invasion,
nuclear deterrence.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.950
I was particularly
fascinated by nuclear weapons

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.760
theory, mutually assured
destruction, stuff like that.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.900
And so I became a diplomat in
1989, which as Jan particularly

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.780
would testify, was an
extraordinary year in world

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.980
history, the collapse
of the Soviet Union,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.000
and the Warsaw Pact
dispensation, a real sense

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.770
of triumph in the West
of the ultimate victory

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.490
of Western values, of Western
democracy, of what you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.680
might call neoliberal
economics market.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.990
Economics has many
terms for it, but a sort

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.990
of modulated capitalism
like what we have now.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.330
And indeed, British diplomats
were sent particularly

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.550
to Eastern Europe to
share the know-how of how

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.820
we ran democracy and
capitalism in the West

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.360
to help other countries
live like we did.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.260
Francis Fukuyama was often
misquoted as calling it

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.710
the end of history.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.680
But a sense of us
having reached some kind

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.890
of apogee irreversibly in
the human project very much

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.030
suffused the air in places
like the Foreign Office.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.440
And indeed, I was a believer.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.510
I very much believed
in that system.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.900
I believed that sensible
people in government,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.830
like me, had the ability, the
competence, the knowledge,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.030
and indeed, the authority
to make decisions

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.802
on behalf of the whole.

00:03:33.802 --> 00:03:36.010
For that is the premise of
representative government,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.120
that small numbers of
people take decisions

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.370
on behalf of large
numbers of people.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.070
And in my field, I was
making decisions along

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.320
with my colleagues
about foreign policy,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.410
where really remarkably
small numbers of people

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.910
make decisions of
extraordinary importance.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.180
I worked on various
different issues.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.230
I was sent to Bonn--

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.560
Jan's hometown, so we've been
comparing street addresses

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.174
this morning--

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:03.590
which was then the
British Embassy

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.850
before it moved to Berlin
after reunification.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.050
I worked on the global
environment, the first world

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.800
summit on the environment
in Rio in 1992,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.130
the so-called Earth Summit, when
we talked about climate change

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.879
as a danger to humanity
300 years from now,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.670
and I think all the
precautionary principle

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.130
that we should act now to
make it easier for humanity

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.560
in 300 years time.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.690
I worked on the Middle
East peace process,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.480
as it was then known
in better days.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.230
I don't think you could
call it a peace process now.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.380
I worked on
international terrorism.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.190
I was, for a while, speechwriter
for two foreign secretaries,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.970
for a conservative and then
for a labor foreign secretary,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.490
Robin Cook, who promptly fired
me as his speech writer--

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.160
again, a very public humiliation
in the Foreign Office.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.105
So humiliation I
am familiar with.

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:03.480
Because you're not really
fired in the British government

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.790
or in the civil service.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.450
You're just moved
on to another job.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.510
And a minister actually
firing his speech writer

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.330
is quite a public act.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.180
And everybody responded
with great glee

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.630
to this public dismissal.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.590
And I was rather upset.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.040
Because I saw myself as
a sympathizer with labor

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.400
foreign policy and [INAUDIBLE]
with Robin Cook himself,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.710
with whom, of course, I
was working closely with,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.170
so I thought.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.780
And with that, I was sent
to the British Mission

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.240
to the United
Nations in New York

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.490
as a kind of consolation prize.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.450
Because it's a very,
very good posting.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.520
It's sort of really
high-level diplomacy.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.730
Of course, it's a very
nice place get posted to.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.610
And I was given responsibility
for the Middle East

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.910
in the British Delegation
to the United Nations, which

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.740
was an amazing, amazing job.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.270
I was responsible for dealing
with Middle East issues

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.600
at the UN Security Council
negotiating resolutions,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.430
statements.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.680
And in those days, the
UN Security Council

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.220
was an incredible cockpit
of world diplomacy,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.260
of world affairs.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.600
And we were dealing with
extraordinarily important

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.170
issues, from Israel Palestine,
to the occupation of Western

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.960
Sahara, to the Libya
Lockerbie issue,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.920
and, above all, Iraq and its
weapons of mass destruction.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.460
And I was responsible for
that issue in the British

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.540
Delegation.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.014
And I was the main
British liaison

00:06:35.014 --> 00:06:36.180
with the weapons inspectors.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.780
So I got to know,
in great detail,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.220
all about weapons
of mass destruction.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.630
I could tell you the
residual chemicals

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.190
left by the nerve gas,
VX, after it has been

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.990
left in a desert for 10 years.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.210
I could tell you the
names of the officers

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.420
in charge of Saddam Hussein's
special weapons regiments.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.220
I could tell you how exactly to
adapt a imported scud missile

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.800
to make it a longer
range Al Hussein

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.300
missile, as it was called.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.430
I knew the exact
number of missiles

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.400
that the inspectors
were looking for.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.200
You can tell where
this is heading.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.160
And it was an amazing job.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.310
One felt very important.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.890
I was chased around the UN
by CNN film crews and scores

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.822
of diplomats.

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:24.530
Britain is, of course,
a permanent member

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.560
of the UN Security
Council, and, thus,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.810
of considerable importance--

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.230
not as important as one or two
others, but very important.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.560
And we drafted all other
resolutions on Iraq

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.370
during my time there.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.450
I spent a year negotiating
a resolution that set up

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.820
the weapons inspection
body that was eventually

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.430
headed by Hans Blix, UNMOVIC--

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.070
which is an acronym
that I came up with,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.750
my small footnote in history--

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.550
a combination of the letters
M-O-V, Monitoring Observation

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.270
Verification
Inspection Commission.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.500
And that's the only way you
can turn those-- anyway,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.880
Scrabble friends
might be interested.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.530
So all of this
started to unravel

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.430
with 9/11, which was the
most spectacular shock to all

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.040
of us dealing with the Middle
East, although, in some ways,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.880
not a surprise.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.630
Because we knew immediately
who was responsible.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.070
The US turned into something
else after that date.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.890
And the Bush
Administration decided

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.870
to pursue war with Iraq.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.909
And in order to provide
a veil of legitimacy,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.460
the British tried
to get a resolution

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:43.370
through the UN Security Council
to authorize that use of force.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.670
And of course, those resolutions
or that particular resolution

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.280
was not agreed by the
UN Security Council.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.650
By that time, I was
actually on sabbatical

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.420
from the Foreign Office.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.600
I was sitting in the New York
Library scratching my head,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.110
trying to work out what might be
a better political and economic

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.580
system than the one we had.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.120
Because 9/11, like
for most people,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.670
it kind of flipped
a switch in my head.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.826
But also, living
in New York City,

00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:12.200
you have to be an
idiot not to be

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.140
aware of the profound
economic injustice manifested

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.380
in America, the fact that
children are literally

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.540
going without meals four
miles away from where

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.410
people are stuffing high-grade
sushi down their throats.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.500
It's pretty blatant there.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.130
The dynamics of climate
change were becoming clear.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.780
And I was starting to
doubt the sorts of words

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.810
I had written for my foreign
secretary about how governments

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.700
had things under control.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.240
Because I began to
see that they didn't.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.720
And I began to see that those
words were kind of fake.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.280
And so I took a year off.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.900
And whilst I was
sitting in that library,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.350
Britain tried to get these
resolutions through the UN

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.200
Security Council.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.980
I was very, very conscious
of what was going on.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.050
I was in touch
with Blix, who was

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.840
trying to understand
the resolution that I

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.830
had negotiated on the
weapons inspections.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.950
I was in touch with my
colleagues, weapons inspectors

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.490
amongst them, David Kelly,
the biological weapons expert,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.460
who later to commit
suicide after being outed

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.379
by the British government
as the source of a story

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:25.170
that the British
government had exaggerated

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.900
the evidence on WMD.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.820
Anyway in 2004, those of
us who'd worked on Iraq

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.490
were invited to testify to
the first official inquiry

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.160
into the war, the
Butler Inquiry.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.260
And I decided to testify.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.050
I wrote a long document
explaining my views

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.810
that the threat from
Iraq had been grossly

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.180
exaggerated by the
British government,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.940
that the war was illegal
according to the resolutions I,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:57.930
myself, had negotiated,
and the British government

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.850
had ignored alternatives
to war, which

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.810
is a complicated
story about sanctions

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.310
and economic restrictions.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.100
It's never talked about,
because everybody focuses on,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.952
did they lie or not?

00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:11.160
But in fact, it's, in many
ways, much more important,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.320
because there were
peaceful alternatives

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.970
to undermining Saddam regime.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.232
I read papers about them.

00:11:16.232 --> 00:11:17.940
And I know for a fact
that these were not

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:26.250
considered before Britain
went to war in 2003.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.510
Anyway, when I wrote that
testimony, I had a crisis.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.930
I thought, I can't
send this testimony in

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.910
and remain a British diplomat.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.220
You can't ride two
horses at once.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.859
I negotiated that my
testimony would be secret,

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:42.900
because I wanted to remain
in the Foreign Office.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.935
I wanted to have it both ways.

00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:47.310
I'd just been promoted to the
senior ranks of the Foreign

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.890
Office.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.050
Everything was tickety-boo.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.910
I was well on my way to being
an ambassador somewhere, maybe

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.410
Belarus.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.190
But things were pretty
good with my career.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.310
And I thought I could tell
the truth to this Inquiry

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.080
but still have my career.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.930
And the act of--

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.230
literally, I remember very
clearly pressing the button

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:12.510
on the computer where I was, the
Send button or Return button.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.660
And I realized when I
pressed that button,

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.810
I couldn't do this.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.940
I couldn't go back and
work with my colleagues.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.700
I couldn't sit
with ministers who

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.630
I knew had done this
terrible, terrible thing.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.740
And so this was the end
for me as a diplomat.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.820
And I had no idea what
I was going to do next.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.720
I'm just going to
get a drop of water.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.090
And thankfully, I was married
to an incredible woman, who

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:48.560
kept me going, but
also gave me the idea

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.970
that I should
become a consultant.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.910
And at the time, I
was living in Kosovo,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.280
on succumbent to
the United Nations.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.010
And Kosovo, at that time, was
subject to a diplomatic process

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.000
about the future of Kosovo that
concerned six countries that

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.820
were secretly negotiating
about whether Kosovo

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.980
should become a state or not.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.470
The UN Security Council would
have meetings about Kosovo,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.770
where 15 members of the
Security Council could speak.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.765
And indeed, any
member state of the UN

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.190
could speak in the
so-called open meetings,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.070
including Serbia.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.700
But guess what?

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.310
Kosovo could not speak, had
a democratically-elected

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.800
government, but was
not entitled to speak,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.510
was not entitled to engage
with this diplomatic process

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.540
about the future of Kosovo.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.800
And this seemed to me to be
somewhat foolish, but also

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.120
profoundly unjust.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.510
And living in Kosovo, I
saw how it contributed

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.930
to immense political
tension, frustration

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.830
of people who felt they had
no control over their future.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.390
Beginning to sound familiar?

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.970
Anyway, that led--
in part, it was

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.490
one of the factors behind
horrible violence in March

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.190
2004, in which 18
people were killed,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.090
mass riots, and attacks
across the country, which

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.010
I saw very, very up close.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.040
Buildings were burned
next to my house.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.505
We escaped a mob of people
charging after the UN.

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:17.360
Because the UN, as the
symbol of this inequity,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.070
this unjust process, was
very widely hated in Kosovo.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.940
Anyway, so my wife
had the idea, why

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.190
don't you become a consultant?

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.630
And I flew back to Kosovo.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.049
Oh, by the way, a small detail--

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:32.090
I had, in fact, resigned
from the Foreign Office.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.030
When I pressed that button,
I also sent that evidence

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.130
to the Foreign
Secretary, Jack Straw,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.350
as my resignation letter.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.310
They never replied.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.320
But a few weeks later,
I did get an email

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.990
from my former personnel
manager inviting me

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.380
for psychological counseling
in the Foreign Office,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.150
perhaps for fear that
I would do the same

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.770
as my poor friend, David.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.130
Anyway, so I flew
back to Kosovo.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.547
I could no longer
work for the UN.

00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.379
I was no longer with
the British government.

00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:00.260
I flew back to
Kosovo and had dinner

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.350
with the Kosovo prime minister,
a former leader of the Kosovo

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.180
Liberation Army,
a remarkable man

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.910
called Ramush
Haradinaj, who I've just

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.400
been discussing in the barbers
in Edgware Road, which,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.060
of course, is full of
Kosovars and Albanians.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.150
And I said to him, why
not come and advise you

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.160
about the diplomacy
about Kosovo?

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.120
And we clinked a glass of raki,
which is Albania's spirit.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.940
And he said, yeah,
come and advise me.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.970
And that was the beginning
of this organization

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.730
that I run to this day called
Independent Diplomat, which

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.080
is a charity here in the UK,
a nonprofit in the US, which

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.930
advises countries and
political movements

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.920
all over the world on
their diplomacy about them.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.380
And so it started with Kosovo.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.110
I took the Kosovo prime minister
to the UN Security Council,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.600
where hitherto he
had been prohibited.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.910
I told the Kosovars
what was really going on

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.640
in the diplomatic process.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.610
I talked to Martti
Ahtisaari, the Finnish UN

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.060
envoy who was dealing with
the Kosovo Serbia negotiations

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.420
to decide the future
status of Kosovo.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.360
Interestingly, all
of them accepted

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.770
the need for what I was doing.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.620
Because they realized it
really helped the process

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.680
for the Kosovo government
to understand it.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.160
It also helped them push
back against the extremists

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.710
in Kosovo who were
saying, oh, this diplomacy

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.970
is such bullshit.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.470
The international
community is never

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.170
going to release us
from Serbia's hold,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.950
never going to make
us independent.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.370
We should unilaterally
declare independence,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.680
which would have been a
highly provocative thing,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.810
and probably would have
led to a resumption of war

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.300
between Serbia and Kosovo.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.100
And of course,
the, quote unquote,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.750
"international community"
did not want that to happen,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.900
but hadn't taken the step
of actually explaining

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.320
their expectations that Kosovo
would become independent

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.610
at the end of this process.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.230
And Martti Ahtisaari would
tell me this privately.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.990
He would say to me things
that he couldn't say formally

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.530
to the Kosovars, which I would
then convey in Pristina--

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.020
the capital of Kosovo--

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.020
to the Kosovars.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.739
And when they came
to the UN, I would

00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:06.030
help them prepare their
speeches, their talking points,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.849
press conferences, yada,
yada, ya, the sorts of things

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.210
I did as a British diplomat
for my foreign secretary.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.240
Anyway, that, in essence, is
what an independent diplomat

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.770
does to this day, which
is do the sorts of things

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.520
that I did as a British diplomat
for all kinds of peoples,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.770
political movements,
and governments

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.910
who are the subjects of
diplomatic processes,

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.980
often, where they
are not actually

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.960
part of those
diplomatic processes,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.920
where other states, who have
far less of a stake than them,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.050
are deciding their future.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.880
It's only in
diplomacy that people

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.130
think that this is actually OK.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.100
And even diplomats, when you
put that proposition to them,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.050
wouldn't it make sense
to have actually people

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.330
from the ground talking
to you about what

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.820
to do about Palestine, Western
Sahara, Somalia, Syria, yada,

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.630
yada, ya, they say, of
course, it would make sense.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.180
But we can't.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.455
They can't come to the UN.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.750
That's just not how it's done.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.250
That's the state of diplomacy
to this day, I'm afraid to say.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.800
Though, we are beginning to
chip away at these assumptions

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.700
through our work.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.500
And also, the world is changing.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.340
The mode of diplomacy, the
means of diplomacy has changed.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.250
Diplomats now, of course, have
to scrutinize Donald Trump's

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.920
tweets to understand what
he is thinking, which

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.280
is a different form of diplomacy
than the one I was brought up

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.330
with in the '80s, the
'90s, and early 2000s.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.820
So what we do today is we give
advice and political strategy

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.130
in what's called public
diplomacy, which is basically

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:45.870
PR, and international law,
the legal advice on the often

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.540
very, very complicated
international law

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.080
pertaining to situations
like Palestine,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.090
or the state of the Rohingya
in Burma, Myanmar, or Syria.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.220
And today, to give you some
examples of what we do,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.740
we advise the Frente
Polisario, which

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.890
is the legitimate
representatives

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.830
of the people of the Western
Sahara, which is illegally

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.120
occupied by Morocco after
an invasion in 1975.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.080
Nobody talks about this
place, but a great injustice

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.690
that the world
does nothing about.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.490
And I'm very proud
to advise them.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.500
Interestingly, their biggest
parliamentary supporter

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.210
in the British parliament
was one Jeremy Corbyn,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.190
which speaks to me
that he was prepared

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.740
to [INAUDIBLE] for a people that
nobody talks about, who Bono

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.780
doesn't celebrate
in his concerts, who

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.910
Richard Branson doesn't meet,
doesn't invite to Davos.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.630
They're my kind of people.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.370
And we advise-- one of
the interesting-- well,

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.720
they're all interesting
in their different ways.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.750
We advise the Marshall Islands,
which is a low-lying island

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.620
state in the middle
of the Pacific,

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.690
which is extraordinarily
vulnerable to sea level rise.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.440
The average height
of it's atolls

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.530
are 70 centimeters
above the sea.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.780
They're already suffering
extensive flooding and drought,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.915
a double whammy
of global warming,

00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:14.040
and are looking at the
destruction of their country

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.810
within 50 years.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.430
And with their help
and with us, we

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.090
have worked to create a whole
coalition of countries called

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.170
the Higher Ambition Coalition,
High Ambition Coalition, which,

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.920
as its name suggests, wants more
ambition in global agreements

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.460
on climate change.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.390
And at the Paris Agreement,
the negotiation of Paris,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.550
in the last days, the
High Ambition Coalition,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.030
which we had been putting
together in secret for years,

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.030
suddenly surfaced as the
most important coalition

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.960
of countries demanding a
particular kind of agreement.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.671
It broke up the traditional
negotiating blocks of the UN,

00:20:53.671 --> 00:20:56.970
and helped get some of the most
important elements of the Paris

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.620
Agreement inserted.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.390
I could talk to you
in detail about those

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.330
if you're interested.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.190
But one of them, for instance,
is fairly well-known.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.110
The agreement aims to
limit global warming

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.530
to 1.5 degrees centigrade
to 2 degrees centigrade.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.050
Before the High Ambition
Coalition came along,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.090
that was 2 degrees centigrade.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.030
You may not think that's a big
deal, but in diplomatic terms,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.600
it's pretty important.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:26.290
And we also inserted, in Paris,
a stipulation that countries

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.650
need to come back to the table
five years after the signature

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.570
of Paris with better
carbon emissions

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.460
commitments than
they made in Paris,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.470
the so-called ratchet
that was invented

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.300
by two members of
independent diplomat

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.061
sitting in a cafe in Majuro, the
little capital of the Marshall

00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:41.560
Islands.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.520
So a real example of
empowering the most affected,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.670
the most vulnerable, in
diplomacy, and a great

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.610
cause to be fighting.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.570
Because one of the things
I've learned about this work

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.940
is that, actually, by
comparing the most vulnerable,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.750
you're empowering everybody.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.630
Because when you give those
most affected a voice,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.770
they tend to speak of what
needs to be done in a way that

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.500
carries enormous authority.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.880
And of course, we need to
deal with climate change.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.000
And there is no more
authoritative voice

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.940
than a country that is
actually facing destruction

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.860
from climate change.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.670
And as a result of the Marshall
Islands and the High Ambition

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.880
Coalition, the Paris Agreement
is significantly stronger

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.170
than it otherwise
would have been,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.340
which is a global result that
is important to every one of us.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.760
How shall I put this?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.670
A different kind of
project is our work

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.240
with the Syrian Opposition, the
Democratic Syrian Opposition,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.220
the Higher
Negotiating Committee,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.920
which is an aggregation of
democratic groups in Syria.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.260
And we've also helped
create a coalition

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.340
of Syrian civil society
groups from all over Syria--

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.700
doctors' groups,
women's refugee groups--

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.390
to empower them to take part
in the diplomacy about Syria.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:14.510
Because of course, one of
the problems with diplomacy

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.610
is that it privileges
governments and states.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.380
And it privileges leaders.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.420
And the sorts of people
who become leaders

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.900
of political movements, who are
often great people, who often

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.800
are legitimate in what
they say to the world

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.785
community about the
needs of their people--

00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:34.910
but there is nothing more
powerful than the people,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.320
themselves.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.630
And having been
with this delegation

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.720
of Syrian civil society at the
UN General Assembly, meeting

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.820
world leaders,
diplomats, officials,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.770
it is extraordinarily
powerful when

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.100
they speak of what needs to
happen in Syria for their needs

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.380
to be addressed.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.150
And we get beyond the bullshit
of, Russia thinks this,

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.650
and Trump thinks that, and ISIS,
and no fly zones, and Security

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.780
Council resolutions,
and the crap that

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.270
flies between the left and
right in this country about what

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.860
to do in Syria.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.680
And you actually get to the
brass tacks from Syrians.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.450
Because of course,
funnily enough,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.340
it is Syrians who
should have the largest

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.420
voice in the future of Syria,
not us, not the West, not

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.380
diplomats, not Sergey Lavrov,
not Donald Trump, but Syrians.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.650
And if Syrians get to
decide the future of Syria,

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.780
then maybe what
follows will actually

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.990
be a resilient and
decent outcome for Syria,

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.520
and thus, for the rest of us.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.390
You follow my reasoning.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.150
Anyway, that's what we do today.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.580
Going back to the
sorts of stories

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.910
you'll read about in this
book of what goes on at the UN

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.830
Security Council,
the negotiations,

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.670
how diplomacy really
works, which, I daresay,

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.380
is actually pretty interesting.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.630
Because it is very different
from the public face

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.210
of diplomacy.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.450
We now bring
parties to conflicts

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.040
on the Security Council's
agenda to New York

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.980
to meet Security Council
diplomats in private,

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.590
in a hotel room, across
the road from the UN.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.510
Because they're not
allowed into the UN,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.430
because they're not
governments and don't have

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.030
the right badges.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.990
But we take leaders
of guerrilla armies,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.885
victims groups from
Darfur, leaders

00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:24.860
of the Democratic Opposition
in DRC, Congo, or Burundi.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.560
And it's an extraordinary,
extraordinary event sitting

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.190
in these meetings
in bland hotel rooms

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.260
where leaders of
opposition groups

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.050
will say to these diplomats,
unless the UN intervenes

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.800
in my country, there
will be genocide.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.650
And in a way, it's come
full circle for me.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.960
Because that is
where I used to work,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.780
where I was one of the
people making decisions

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:53.090
about other people's countries,
decisions about which today I

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.750
feel great shame, in
particular, sanctions on Iraq,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.840
which did enormous damage
to the Iraqi people

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.140
long before the US, UK invaded
that benighted country.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.840
So that is the
story, if you like,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.300
of Independent Diplomat,
the organization.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.130
The analysis of how it came
about, and why it came about,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.840
and the deficits
of diplomacy is all

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.880
in this book,
which has just been

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.334
republished after 10 years.

00:26:22.334 --> 00:26:23.750
And there is a
broader story here,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.320
which is not in the book,
which is in the movie, which

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.620
is about my own conversion,
partly through this experience,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.840
and partly through
dealing with civil society

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.500
groups and legitimate opposition
movements all over the world,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.720
meeting, if you
like, quote unquote--

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.590
I don't like this word--
"ordinary" people in Somalia,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:49.250
Palestine, Britain, Detroit, and
realizing that they generally

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.570
have a far better idea about how
to fix the problems that they

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.890
confront than the rest of us.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:01.040
And experiencing and looking
into more democratic forms

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.674
of self-government,
direct democracy

00:27:03.674 --> 00:27:05.090
where large numbers
of people take

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.700
part in their own government,
including in a place

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.950
called Rojava in Northeast
Syria, which some of you

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.340
may have heard about.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.430
And through that
experience, having become

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.490
convinced that that form
of self-government, which

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.490
some called anarchism, is
the right way forward for all

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.620
of us, including
in the West where

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.670
we confront a very serious
crisis of democracy,

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.040
of disillusionment, and
the profound injustice

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.990
wrought by the sort of
capitalism that we have today.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.340
Anyway, that's another
story told in another book.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.690
And I shall stop
there and look forward

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.310
to the discussion,
which is always

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.319
more entertaining and
interesting than my talk.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:43.860
So thank you.

00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:49.870
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious, can
you explain a little bit more

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.170
about your version of anarchism?

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.180
I'm curious to understand
what you mean by that.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.430
CARNE ROSS: Anarchism
is self-government.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.380
It's the rejection
of one person having

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.310
power over another, which is
a very beautiful principle.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.840
Because I think the act of
using power over other people

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.330
humiliates the
person using power

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:17.670
as much as it humiliates
the person subject to it.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.410
Of course, in its
extreme versions,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.050
it's a kind of nasty
libertarianism,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.150
of individualism, of
doing whatever you want.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.890
That's not the
anarchism I believe in.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.790
I believe in an
anarchism of putting

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.830
the community above all.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.730
And communities, through
democratic assemblies

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.220
and new habits of
direct democracy,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.500
govern themselves, and
indeed, make rules themselves,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.460
and arbitrate disputes
and wrongdoing themselves.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.870
There's been written about this.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.910
I've written about it myself.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.090
Anarchism is, unfortunately,
very widely misunderstood,

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.580
and I think,
deliberately denigrated

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.520
by defenders of the current
system, who, funnily enough,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.190
may benefit from
the current system.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.620
Because to me, it's
actually democracy.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.460
What we have today here and
in America is not democracy.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.425
You don't have the
government's rule

00:29:10.425 --> 00:29:11.550
in the collective interest.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.230
They rule in somebody
else's interests.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.440
We could talk about whose
interests it does rule in.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.100
But I profoundly believe,
having witnessed this up close

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.650
and been part of a government,
that our current system is not

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.631
working.

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.380
And it's actually
driving us towards great

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.620
social and ecological
crisis, which

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.780
if we don't wake up and
address pretty soon,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.679
is going to get pretty bad.

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:36.970
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.030
I'm wondering what's
your view on, A, Brexit?

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.890
And, B, what's your view on
the government's decision

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:50.680
to withhold the report on
foreign funding of terrorism?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.357
CARNE ROSS: Ugh, Brexit.

00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:54.440
I don't mind the question.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.590
And I respect your
right to ask it.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.780
It is depressing
coming back to Britain,

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.900
dealing my life in Syria, and
Palestine, and global warming.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.870
And suddenly, the
world shrinks down

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.910
to soft Brexit, customs union,
the pathetic shenanigans

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.675
of the Tory party.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.990
My feelings about
Brexit are complicated.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.850
And as an anarchist,
you can imagine

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.040
that they might be complicated.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.500
I am a very great
believer in open borders,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.870
in the fact that
our lives should not

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.400
be determined by
where we're born,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.060
that everybody should be free
to travel wherever they want.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.070
I feel that partly
because of living

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.940
in Germany, which was an
incredible instruction in what

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.850
humanity is capable
of, but also how

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.840
humanity can transcend that.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.699
And I think the EU embodies
that beautiful dream.

00:30:49.699 --> 00:30:51.740
That was never talked
about in the Brexit debate.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.698
It was always treated as
a transactional thing.

00:30:53.698 --> 00:30:54.330
Do we benefit?

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.180
What are the costs?

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.920
What will we get back?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.327
Which, to me, was very much
a discourse of capitalism,

00:30:59.327 --> 00:31:00.910
unfortunately, the
discourse we've got

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.330
used to when there were
bigger principles at stake.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.930
And for that reason,
I was against Brexit.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.767
I'm profoundly hostile to
the bureaucracy of the EU,

00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:13.600
which I've obviously
had to deal with a lot.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.770
I think it's unaccountable.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.582
I think it's un-transparent.

00:31:16.582 --> 00:31:18.790
I think the British actually
have extraordinary power

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.960
to transform the EU.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.330
Because I think most
people feel that it

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.000
needs to be much more
transparent and accountable

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.530
than it is, Germans,
Poles, French.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.420
And that would have
been a better policy

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.380
to pursue than this silly binary
choice between Brexit or not

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.810
Brexit, which was a
reductive form of democracy.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.870
Referendums in this
context are not democracy.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.700
It is a mistake to
think they're democracy.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.150
They're a particular snapshot of
opinion at a particular moment.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.230
Where I believe democracy is a
process of constant interaction

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.880
of me listening to your
needs, you listening to mine,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.820
us finding compromises,
ways forward,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.860
because we have
to live together.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.340
And a one-off vote
about something divisive

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.624
is not a good way of
governing ourselves.

00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:06.790
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.280
I'm curious about Syria.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.370
On the one hand, you say that
you advised the opposition

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.104
groups in Syria.

00:32:13.104 --> 00:32:14.770
And on the other hand,
I read-- and this

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.186
may be simplistic
and inaccurate--

00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:19.330
but I read that,
there, President Assad

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.000
has majority support.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.030
And so how do you
reconcile what looks

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.030
like anti-democratic
movements in Syria that

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:34.750
want to go against the system
while the current system has

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.670
most of the people's support?

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:40.947
How do you reconcile that
with support for democracy?

00:32:40.947 --> 00:32:43.280
CARNE ROSS: I have to say,
that's the most extraordinary

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.630
thing you've just said.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.880
There is absolutely
no evidence whatsoever

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.460
that Assad is actually
supported by the majority,

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.960
not least because
there's never been

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.290
a democratic process in Syria.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.560
So that's false from the start.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.440
Let's just remember how all
of this started in 2012.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.450
It was people demonstrating
on the streets

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:07.010
for democracy, which the Assad
regime violently put down,

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.170
arrested teenage boys,
tortured them to death.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.580
So let's just remember
how this war started.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.760
Yes, there were extremist
groups on the rebel side.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.860
Assad has successfully destroyed
many of the moderate groups,

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:28.590
leaving not only extremist
groups on the ground,

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:33.830
but also moderate Free
Syrian Army groups.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.450
It's a highly
complicated picture

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.360
with thousands of different
armed groups across Syria.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.920
Every single Syrian I know,
every single one, particularly

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.410
those living in refugee
camps in places like Turkey,

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.540
particularly those
coming from Aleppo--

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.380
which has been besieged
by the Syrian regime using

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.590
the most indiscriminate
tactics, dropping barrel bombs

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.410
on hospitals, which are
deliberately targeted

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.690
with their Russian
allies who have used

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.990
heavy strategic bombers
to bomb indiscriminately

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.400
civilian areas.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.410
The Assad regime has
used chemical weapons

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.520
on its own people in
a suburb of Damascus,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.280
as well as other places.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.300
You talk to Syrians, what
they want is democracy.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.550
That is not Assad.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.260
There will not be democracy
until Assad steps down.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.630
And in my view, we
ought to be talking

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.070
much more vigorously about
how to get rid of the regime.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.679
And until that happens,
there won't be democracy.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.050
Because this regime
is not a democracy.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.020
It does not represent the
majority of the people.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.469
I can understand that there are
some supporters of the regime.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.800
And their needs and
their need for protection

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.040
should be respected in any
future dispensation in Syria.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.480
But it is a grotesquery to
claim that Assad somehow

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.989
represents the democratic
wishes of the Syrian people.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:55.850
AUDIENCE: I do
respect your opinion.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:35:00.230
And I do think it
is based on facts.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.330
All I was referring
to was surveys

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.110
where Assad was found to
be popular among Syrians

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.725
who are in Syria.

00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:08.600
Is that not accurate?

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.330
CARNE ROSS: There's no
meaningful way of conducting

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:12.540
a survey of that kind.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.250
I mean, that's absurd.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.540
That's absolutely absurd.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.240
I'm sorry.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.730
I don't, I'm afraid, have a
great deal of respect for that.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.220
I mean, it's obviously
a ridiculous proposition

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.780
to hold a meaningful survey
of people's democratic wishes

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.350
when a good 50% of
the population, 50%,

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.690
has been driven out of the
country in the first place.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.648
How about, how are you
going to survey them, go

00:35:34.648 --> 00:35:38.210
to camps in Jordan, speak to
asylum seekers on the streets

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.080
out here?

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.670
How do their views
get heard in a survey?

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.150
Large areas of Syria
are not peaceful.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.150
They're not accessible to
foreign independent observers

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.920
of any kind.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.200
It is extraordinarily
dangerous for Westerners

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.600
to go to large areas of Syria.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.570
So the possibility
of having anything

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.450
like an objective assessment of
Syrian opinion, collectively--

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:04.920
which in any case,
is meaningless.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.560
Because it is a
highly-fragmented country,

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.184
where clearly, there
are lots of people

00:36:08.184 --> 00:36:10.250
who want different things.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.680
The idea that there can
be a singular assessment

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.630
of their opinion is ridiculous.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:17.930
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to ask
another question on the EU.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.510
It seems that here
in Northern Europe,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:25.130
in general, the anti-EU
Sentiment comes from the right.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.370
Whereas, in Southern
Europe, it seems

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:33.380
to proponents of non-EU deals
seem to come from the left.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.072
Why do you think there's
this dissonance, I guess?

00:36:38.072 --> 00:36:39.280
Hope my question makes sense.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.060
CARNE ROSS: That's a
really good question

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.000
and it's an
interesting observation

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.280
on what's happening
in Greece, Spain,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.880
really quite important seismic
political developments, which,

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.290
in many ways, I think overturned
the traditional understandings

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.410
of left and right.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.530
And I think, probably,
we need a richer language

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.930
to describe what's going on.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:04.130
I'm very hostile to terms
like nationalist, populist.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.070
I think they are just labels
that really obscure more

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.220
than they describe
having got to know

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.160
a lot of these movements
in different ways.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.910
What I think unites
left and right,

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:21.670
all the movements,
anti-Brexit, and hostility

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.250
in the left in Greece
against the EU,

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.710
is a common theme, which
is disenfranchisement

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.660
of people who feel
that they have

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.930
no control over their economy,
and over their livelihoods,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.750
and over their futures.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.580
And they are right to
feel disenfranchised.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.830
And actually, I
think, frankly, this

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.260
is much more about the
nature of modern capitalism,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.820
that people feel that
the work they're doing

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.760
is not properly rewarded.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.405
They are getting
relatively poorer,

00:37:49.405 --> 00:37:50.905
whilst a very small
number of people

00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:54.150
are getting a great deal
richer and flaunting it

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.170
in the faces of the rest of us.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.080
They feel that the work they're
doing in the modern economy

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.580
is not respected.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.620
Burger flipping,
and filling shelves,

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.500
and looking after the old are
not respected professions.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.710
So I think these are about
profound social forces that

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:17.560
are expressed in moments
like the Brexit referendum,

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:24.880
and expressed in movements like
Syriza, and others in Greece,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.550
or elsewhere in Italy.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.090
And I think the questions we
need to be answering ourselves

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.050
go far beyond EU or not EU.

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.970
One can talk about the
way the EU handled Greece,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.620
for instance.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.536
And there are many things
to be said about it.

00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:42.400
But I think that our broader
forces at play here, which

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.900
need to be addressed.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.230
And unfortunately,
settling ourselves

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:50.550
in a narrow debate
about Brexit, or not

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:55.350
Brexit, the EU or not EU, is not
embracing these bigger themes,

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.450
which I think all of us sense.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.930
Everybody senses that
there's something basically

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.360
wrong with the economic
model we're pursuing,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.320
where only a few really
reap the benefits,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.290
and where immense damage,
irreversible damage,

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.080
is being done to the
world's environment.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.420
I think future
historians will look back

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.230
at our generation, our society
as the most irresponsible

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.220
in history.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.690
Because we knew.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.280
We knew what was being done.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.320
And we didn't do
enough about it.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.290
And I genuinely think
the governments are not

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.610
going to fix this.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.040
Unless people like us, you
and me, actually get busy,

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.260
it ain't going to get fixed.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.310
AUDIENCE: I have a
related question.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.810
So, like, you're very critical
about current so-called

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.970
democratic system
we have in the West

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.510
and how it deals with the
big issues at hand right now.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.300
And you come up
with an alternative,

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.540
like, you call it anarchy.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.340
But how would you go
from point A to point B?

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.600
There's a huge step.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.270
And I fail to see
how it's actually

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.070
possible to go to there?

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.070
CARNE ROSS: Yeah, I mean
that's a good question.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.450
And it's one I get a lot.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.940
I have to say, in a sense, I
don't want to single you out.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.780
Because I really
respect the question.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.740
But it disappoints me that
it's not so easily imaginable.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.420
All I'm talking about
is direct democracy.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.030
And I think it is plausible for
us to, A, make this demand, B,

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:30.980
learn about it, and C,
start setting up assemblies

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.180
and forums that practice it,
where basically you invite

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.000
everybody concerned with an
issue or a group of issues--

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.740
you could do it here at Google.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.600
You don't need to
call it unionization.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.610
You just need to call a meeting.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:50.030
And make sure everybody who
is affected by your decisions

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.960
is included.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.450
And you start to discuss
the things that bother you.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.450
And I would broaden it beyond
your terms, and conditions,

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.750
and your promotion prospects,
but actually to every impact

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:00.890
Google has in the world.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.600
Because Google's impact
is extraordinary.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.290
And you have far more
influence than most people.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.620
Your views in this room
are of immense importance,

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.550
immense importance.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.910
You're determining culturally,
sociologically, economically,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:17.690
and politically, our
futures in important ways.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.560
Personally, I would
like to see Google think

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.270
about collective ownership.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.310
I believe that the
form of ownership

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:29.720
in our society of celebrating
individual entrepreneurs who

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.640
get lucky and make
enormous fortunes,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.150
and that the rest
of us are supposed

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.850
to bow down to this form
of the economy is wrong.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.330
I think that we all want
agency in the workplace.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.630
We all want to feel we're
respected and have a share--

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:51.620
economic, but also political,
in that, we have a voice.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.720
And the best way to achieve
that in the workplace

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.550
where most of us
spend a lot of time

00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:00.170
is through a form of collective
ownership, a cooperative.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.490
It is not implausible.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.890
It is not at all impossible.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.550
John Lewis, a big retail
chain, lovely shop down

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.680
on Oxford Street--

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.760
John Lewis, Jr. was lying
in bed after riding accident

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.090
when he realized that
his family was worth more

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.550
and earned more than all
the hundreds of employees

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.280
of his family
stores put together.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.210
And somehow, he had an epiphany
and decided that was wrong.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.150
And he turned over the
stores to the workers.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.900
And that company has
endured well over 100 years,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.300
and is one of the most
successful companies today

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.660
where the employees, in
general, are pretty happy.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.260
Mondragon in Spain is
Spain's 10th largest company.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.580
It's a coalition, a
collective of cooperatives.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.200
It has transformed
the Basque region,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.240
which was one of the
most economically

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.760
backward areas of Spain.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.930
It works.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.170
I absolutely reject
the notion that this

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.140
is kind of silly idealism.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.200
It's not at all.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.690
It can happen.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:03.410
It is doable.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.270
But it is in your hands.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.990
And I profoundly
feel that we need

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.750
to change the way we think
about the possibilities

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.620
of political action.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.320
We have been taught in the
current dispensation that

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.010
political action is
activism-- not a word I like--

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.250
putting money in somebody's
tin, making a donation,

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.250
voting for politicians-- who,
by and large, don't really do it

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.290
for us-- every five years.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:29.450
We have been anesthetized.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:34.310
Our political power has
been eviscerated from us.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.281
And we have extraordinary
power, if only we use it.

00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:39.530
AUDIENCE: I want to come back.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.385
So I actually did that.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.500
I started political
party in Belgium,

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.965
which is in my home country,
to actually go for there

00:43:45.965 --> 00:43:46.860
to democracy.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.150
And I have first-hand
experience with how impossible

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.840
the process is.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.410
Like, there's literally
no road to go.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.090
The media is not on your side.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.470
Everyone is against it.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.995
And within Google, Google
is not a democracy.

00:43:59.995 --> 00:44:04.370
And so it's not up to us
to decide on that process.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.430
So what is the path?

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:15.840
CARNE ROSS: Yeah, I hear you.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.100
I don't think this is easy.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.290
I have learned, in political
struggles all over the world,

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.620
that victory goes
to the determined,

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.665
to the people who don't give up.

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.040
I'm not saying
you are giving up.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.420
Please, don't get me wrong.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.790
I really respect what
you're trying to do.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.950
But there are multiple
ways to change.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.080
We are trying to
change a behemoth--

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.300
not just Google-- but a
behemoth of the world's

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.430
capitalist economy,
a system that

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.910
is defended by not
only its beneficiaries,

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.420
but by the laws which it has
co-opted by the governments,

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.390
which it is captured by
the media, which it owns.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.350
And I sound like a
kind of radical lefty.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.840
I'm a straightforward
mainstream guy.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.550
I'm Bourgeois.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.350
I'm a white male.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.300
If people are middle-aged--

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.310
people like me are
saying this, then

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:12.330
there's something really
wrong with the system.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.090
And I think there is
enormous appetite for this.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.180
Everywhere I go, I hear
people saying, how do I do it?

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.750
What can I do?

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:23.310
It's an electrifying question.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.370
And I think that, if
you sit with people

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.650
who care about it in the
same way that you do,

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.940
you will figure something out.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.280
I can't tell you
what that thing is.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.140
I'd be glad to
meet again and talk

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.200
about the specific circumstances
that you're facing.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.690
Because I think this
is about specifics.

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:42.810
I can make bland
pronouncements about how

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:46.350
political change happens and
sort of fire everybody up.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.990
I do think the devil
is in the detail.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.370
I work constantly
on political change,

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.450
everyday from the Western
Sahara, to Palestine,

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.430
and Syria.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.320
And it is a detailed struggle.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.360
I think one of the
lies that we're told

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.550
is that society can be
transformed by Jeremy Corbyn,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.450
by Theresa May, by leaving
the EU or not leaving the EU.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.920
These are not true.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.950
A society is each
one of us atoms.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.330
I believe in complexity theory,
where each of our actions

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.590
creates the whole.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.690
But actually, each
of our actions can,

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.600
in certain circumstances--
so-called criticality--

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.070
transform the whole.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.620
I actually think we're at
a point of criticality.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.750
The Arab world was at
a point of criticality

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.810
when the Arab Spring
swept the Middle East.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.210
I think young people,
in particular,

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.840
are at a point of criticality in
the West, because they get it.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.739
They get that this
is not working.

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:43.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.550
My question is about Turkey.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.210
And if you could comment
the last recent events

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.490
from the coup to the referendum
and the current crackdown?

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.322
Thank you.

00:46:55.322 --> 00:46:57.030
CARNE ROSS: Could I
ask, are you Turkish?

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.636
AUDIENCE: No

00:46:57.636 --> 00:46:58.260
CARNE ROSS: OK.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.041
Is anybody Turkish here?

00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:01.540
OK.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.970
Well, I know a bit about Turkey.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.160
I'm no expert.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.250
And I would say--

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.620
if there was a Turk here, I
would actually turn to them.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.030
And I really believe that's
the right thing to do.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.970
Erdogan is a proto-fascist.

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.250
He is cracking down
on the free press.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.280
There's a trial going on
right now of journalists.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.860
He's cracked down on the
democratic opposition.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.400
And he is waging a
war, a merciless war,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.230
against the Kurdish
population in the Southeast.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:35.760
Which the West, I'm afraid--

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.490
this government here, and the
German government, and others

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.620
are not doing anything
like enough about.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.600
Because they've struck
a deal with Erdogan

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.200
to stop people swimming across
the small strait between Turkey

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.900
and the nearest Greek island
to try to migrate to Europe.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.480
And that deal, to them, is
more important than the lives

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.300
of Turks, and human
rights in Turkey,

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.710
and democracy in Turkey.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.610
It's very, very
depressing to see.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.440
And the level of
violence and repression

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.131
is really staggering.

00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:08.130
It's a story that's not
being told, particularly

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.140
what's going on in
Southeast Turkey

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:14.190
where whole towns
are being shelled.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:19.710
Heavy weapons, tanks have
been used in civilian areas.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.510
And this country
is not a democracy.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:24.890
It is an emerging dictatorship.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.690
I don't think you can really
argue that democracy exists

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.460
in a situation where
the opposition are

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.430
as repressed as they are, and
where a free press does not

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:34.440
really exist.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.220
And yet, they are treated
as a legitimate government,

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.600
not subject to sanction.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.870
But in fact, we sit down with
them and do deals with them.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.830
Because we want the--

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.800
Erdogan's no fool.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.807
He has played us.

00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:51.890
AUDIENCE: I wanted to come
back to the involvement

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.620
of the British in Iraq.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.930
I find this deeply fascinating.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.794
I think this has not come
anywhere near a resolution.

00:48:57.794 --> 00:48:59.210
From your vantage
point, from what

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.930
you've seen behind the
scenes, how did this happen?

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.930
What was the motivation?

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.990
What are the forces behind it?

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.600
This is a narrative that
Tony went to the states, then

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.130
had a chat with
his friend Georgie.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.026
And they agreed, yeah,
I'm going to help you.

00:49:12.026 --> 00:49:13.400
But there's got
to be more to it.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.780
What were the
driving forces that

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.960
resulted in such a disaster,
and that necessaried

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.722
all the lies around it?

00:49:20.722 --> 00:49:22.930
CARNE ROSS: That's a really
good question, obviously,

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.020
one I've dwelt on a lot,
and to which I do not

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.910
have a complete answer.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.650
Because this was a
top-down decision

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.240
driven by Bush and Blair.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.690
The view in the
British government

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:39.280
when I worked on Iraq was
absolutely that regime change

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.330
was a bad idea.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:44.410
Because Iraq would fracture
between Shia and Sunni.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.540
And that is, of course,
what's happened.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.130
When I was a
British diplomat, we

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:53.500
would go to the State Department
every quarter for our big Iraq

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.670
bilaterals, where a few of us
from the British government who

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.500
dealt with Iraq would sit
facing a whole team of the US

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.150
administration.

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.830
And sometimes, the
State Department

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.870
would privately
ask us beforehand

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.660
to bring up the subject
of regime change,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.660
so that we could say
what a bad idea it was,

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.000
so that the hawks in the
Department of Defense,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.480
the Pentagon, and elsewhere
would hear that their closest

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.300
allies did not support it.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.760
That was the view.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.200
I know for a fact--

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:23.920
for fact.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.160
This isn't speculation, the
he said, she said debate.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.760
I know for a fact that the
reason they give about the war,

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.710
that they thought
Iraq was a threat,

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:36.520
that they were misled by the
intelligence, that is a lie.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.500
That is a lie.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.660
I know the intelligence
in great detail.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.942
I probably know more about it
than almost anybody who worked

00:50:44.942 --> 00:50:46.150
for any of these governments.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.170
I worked on almost nothing
else for four and a half years.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.910
And our assessment
for all of those years

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:54.190
was that Iraq's WMD--

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:58.240
we thought they may have some
so-called residual stocks.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.850
There were accounting errors in
the destruction of Iraq's WMD,

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.280
its ballistic missiles,
chemical and biological weapons,

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.340
for which Iraq
could not account.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.410
And we thought
that what was then

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.350
called the material balance
indicated that there might be

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:16.100
stocks we did not know about.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.520
But we had no hard evidence of
anything, missiles, CW or BW.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.070
And certainly, at
these bilaterals

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:25.930
I attended, we would
begin them by saying,

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.210
the policy of
containment is working.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.770
Iraq is not a threat.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.310
And almost overnight,
that changed.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:37.360
And the thing that
changed it was 9/11.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.070
And looking at this through
the lens that I now look at it,

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.790
I realize that part
of what was going on

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.340
was that the authority of
the American government

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.530
was deeply challenged by 9/11.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.330
It had failed in
its fundamental duty

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:53.935
to protect the people,
which is the contract we all

00:51:53.935 --> 00:51:54.810
make with government.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.393
We're not asked to
make this contract.

00:51:56.393 --> 00:52:00.000
But we're in this contract,
that we give up our liberty,

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.400
and allow ourselves to be
ruled, and legislated about,

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.330
and rule by law in return
for them protecting us.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.430
That's the deal, the
Lockean contract,

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.020
the Hobbesian contract.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.970
And they failed in that deal.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:19.290
And they had to do something
to show that they could still

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:20.550
protect the people.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:24.150
It was an assertion, a
deliberate assertion of power,

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:26.730
in order to reaffirm
its legitimacy.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.980
And it was a lie.

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.100
Without 9/11, it would
not have happened.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.480
I saw, day by day, how a
narrative was created in the US

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.760
administration by
the neoconservatives,

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.410
Richard Perle, Wolfowitz, and
others, that Iraq was a threat,

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.570
that toppling Saddam would lead
to broader change in the Middle

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.810
East, which would
drain the swamp,

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.180
which would cause a sort
of modern-day version

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.770
of the domino effect--

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:56.675
that, of course, had been the
logic in Vietnam, ironically--

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.820
that would bring democracy
to the Middle East, and thus,

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.260
make Middle
East-based terrorism--

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.140
to starve it at its roots.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.410
And that theory became
dominant after 9/11,

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.270
because nobody had a better one.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:16.290
And this was an epic
failure of government.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.020
We think the governments sit
there and rationally debate

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.210
different alternate
policy options.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.070
That is not how it happens.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:28.230
Politicians make decisions
that are often emotional, ill

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.520
thought through, spontaneous.

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.740
And the officials go out
and collect the evidence

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.190
to justify that policy.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:40.780
It is the opposite of
scientific method, which

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.310
is to go out, look
at the evidence,

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:46.240
then make a theory about
how to deal with it,

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.321
as I learned from Thomas
Kuhn in that library.

00:53:50.321 --> 00:53:52.320
That's one of the things
that was going on, not,

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.850
by any means, the only one.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:56.300
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
very much, Carne Ross.
