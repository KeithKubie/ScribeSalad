00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.828
When we reflected this function in the x axis, we ended up with a new equation,

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:08.485
this one. So we can see that all that we did was replace the square root of x

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:14.336
by negative square root x. Now in terms of functions, if we said that our

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:18.620
original equation was y equals f of x, then what we see with our reflection in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.824
the x axis is y equals negative f of x. Reflection in the X axis just involves

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:29.528
negating the entire function that we're working with. But what about reflection

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.664
in the y-axis, we've seen one example of a graph showing that before, but what

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:37.906
happens with the equation? Well, going back to our three simple points that we

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:42.854
saw before, where did they end up if we reflected them in the y-axis? Please

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:45.390
fill in the coordinates of the new reflected points here
