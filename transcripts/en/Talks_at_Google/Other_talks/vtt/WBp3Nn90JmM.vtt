BART YASSO: Thank you so much.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.210
I love this venue.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.510
I love your building.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.320
This is so cool.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.890
How many people are running
a marathon in the next couple

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.390
weeks?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.740
Chicago, New York, Philly.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.240
Yeah.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.727
This is the crazy
season right now.

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:20.560
So it's kind of fun.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.140
I want to talk just a little
briefly on some training stuff,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.540
and then I'll do my
PowerPoint presentation, which

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.980
I call Never Limit Where
Running Can Take You,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.495
which is really based
around my life on the run.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.300
But just some
training things I've

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.270
learned from coaching
all these people

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.720
and being a runner
myself for 38 years.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.960
People do not run slowly
enough on those, what we call,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.740
easy days.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.417
Recovery days.

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.000
When you're doing
long runs and you're

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.910
doing speed workouts or hill
repeats or things like that.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.300
Those easy days
after those workouts

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.450
have to be done at
a very easy pace.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.090
And we tend to be crazy about
our little bit of free time we

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.760
have, and we tend to
run those too quickly.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.780
The other mistake a
lot of people make

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.170
is they run their
long runs too quickly.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.990
And by the time they get to the
race, their body's too tired.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.570
They don't have that peak
performance on race day.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.490
And so those long runs should
be about a minute per mile

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.680
slower than the pace
you're projecting yourself

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.320
to run in the
marathon or the pace

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670
you think you could
handle for 26.2.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.430
I know it sounds
counter-intuitive to say

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.500
running slower you will make
you faster, but trust me

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.510
it really does.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.870
So if you slow down
on those long runs

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.390
and slow down on
those recovery days,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.610
it'll allow you to
run faster on those

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.440
what I call quality
days where you're

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.870
doing a specific
type of workout.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.045
And that's how you get faster.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.670
And then the other
part of the equation

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.480
is to stay injury free.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.270
And that's hard to do in
running, especially marathon

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.100
running.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.000
But it can be done because
I did it for-- I really

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.980
didn't have any injuries
for 25 plus years,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.590
and I used to run
a lot of miles.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.170
But I really listened to
my body and I was never

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.540
afraid to take a break.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.770
I was always willing
to take some downtime

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.100
to allow my body to recover and
do some cross training, things

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.820
like that, in that time period.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.040
And it was the way I was
able to stay injury free.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.120
Because I find the people that
hit these peak performances,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.090
that run a time they
never thought they could

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.880
do for a 10K, half
marathon, marathon,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.320
is they stayed injury
free and trained

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560
consistently for a
long period of time.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.840
And that's when they
hit that ultimate goal.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.520
Yasso 800s, that workout that's
named after me-- first thing,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.060
never have a work
out named after you.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.030
Amby Burfoot, a gentleman
who won the Boston Marathon

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.450
and was executive editor
at "Runner's World"

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.655
for many years, he named them
after me without me knowing it.

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.030
Because what
happens to me-- I'll

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.090
be somewhere like
Portland, Oregon,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.070
and I'll be in a Starbucks
working on my computer.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.350
And this young woman will
come in and recognize me

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380
and she'll go,
you're Bart Yasso.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.590
And I say yes, and
I get a big smile.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.360
I want to find out her
name and she'll go,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.270
I curse your name
every Wednesday night.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.380
Because her running
club does the Yasso 800s

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.010
every Wednesday night.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.440
And if she says
that in-- if someone

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.092
would say that in
a group of runners,

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:28.050
they would understand
what she's talking about.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.180
When you're in a coffee shop,
everyone looks at me like wow,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.477
that guy is really mean.

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:35.060
I wonder what this guy does to
this poor woman every Wednesday

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.490
night that she curses his name.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.040
But the Yasso 800s is
a marathon predictor,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.070
so it's 10 times 800 meters
or the 400 meter recovery.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.330
If you're trying to run a
marathon in four hours and 10

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.630
minutes, you do this workout.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.630
Each 800 meter repeat
of four minutes

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.255
and 10 seconds, that's
the correlation.

00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.220
You can Google it.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.680
There's tons of stuff out there.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.010
Most of it's not mine.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.397
It's all the other people
that talk about Yasso 800s.

00:04:03.397 --> 00:04:04.980
I think the last
time I searched there

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.350
were over 100,000
views on Yasso 800s.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.170
So it's obviously used
by a lot of people.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.329
But the beauty of all of this--
if you can train well, stay

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.329
injury free, do these races,
that's where the fun is.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.990
So I go around and tell my
story because I went out

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.950
to run one mile 38 years ago,
just to kind of get in shape,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.750
never thinking I
would run marathons

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.180
or work at "Runner's
World" someday.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.740
But it changed my
life in so many ways.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.160
And it literally has
taken me around the world.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.460
So I talk about some of the
benefits, the experiences

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.970
I got to have through
this great sport.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.980
I start out with
Sarah Reinertsen,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.910
who I consider the greatest
athlete I've personally met.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.140
Now I get to meet Olympic
gold medalists, world record

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.970
holders.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.470
Working at "Runner's
World," you get

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.150
to meet the fastest
people in the world.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.850
And a lot of them are
personal friends of mine.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.400
But I got to admit, I
think the greatest athletes

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.600
are these people that
overcome so much just

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.360
to get to the starting
line, then let alone go out

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.280
and do these races.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.170
And a person like Sarah,
who was the first female

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.760
to do the Hawaii Iron
Man on a prosthetic leg.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.304
Forget about, you
know, she started--

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:20.720
she did the New
York City Marathon

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.230
and then she got this idea
to do the Hawaii Iron Man.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.620
And when you do a
Hawaii Iron Man when

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.930
you're an above
the knee amputee,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.280
you have to have a cycling
prosthetic, a running

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.630
prosthetic, and swim
without your one leg.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.630
I mean, it's amazing
what these people can do.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.720
So I consider her the greatest.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.100
Not only her athletic ability,
but she shares her story.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.915
She's just a
powerful individual.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.420
And then this woman, Kimberly.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.720
This was taken at the
New York City Marathon--

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.440
photo was taken at the New York
City Marathon expo last year.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.480
The New York City
Marathon weekend.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.260
And it was the third
marathon I saw Kimberly

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.650
at in about a four-week span.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.230
And every time
she'd come up to me

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.380
and we'd get our
picture together.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.480
I knew she had a
story, but she wasn't

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.480
really willing to talk about it.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.270
In New York she really came
clean and told me her story,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.730
that she was actively being
treated for breast cancer,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.040
getting chemotherapy on Friday,
running the marathon on Sunday.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.810
And she told me she
works with her oncologist

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.669
to time when she
gets her chemo based

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.210
on the starting time
of the marathon.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.100
So she knew how many
hours out from the start

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.590
of the race where she would
feel good about running,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.490
where her body would
react the best.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.990
And I thought wow.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.700
What other sport do you
experience things like this?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.630
And I get to experience
this every weekend.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.650
These people blow me away.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.820
We have no limitations when
you meet people like Kimberly.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.860
And this gentleman, Brian Boyle.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.850
This was at the finish line
of the Philly Marathon.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.360
I was the race announcer
that year and Brian came in

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.070
and he's giving me five and I'm
screaming over the microphone.

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:04.480
What I was screaming
over the microphone,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.146
I knew he was running
a personal record,

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:08.110
because I knew his time.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.730
And he wanted to stop
and he was saying,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.886
I want to be Bart Yasso.

00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:13.510
I want to do all the
races that you do.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.766
And I was like, dude, get
across the finish line,

00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:17.390
because you're running
a personal best.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.820
Then come back and talk to me.

00:07:19.892 --> 00:07:21.850
And I don't know why he
wants to be Bart Yasso,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.830
but we have a very
good friendship.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.340
But his story is amazing.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.390
He was in a horrific
car accident

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.340
and in a coma for two months.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.810
When he was in that coma, he was
pronounced dead a couple times.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.320
And they never thought
this kid would live.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.570
And he wasn't a runner prior
to this horrific accident.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.730
But eventually he
loses 100 pounds,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.450
he goes through all this trauma,
and then what does he do?

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.260
When this picture
was taken, I believe

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.250
it was his fourth
marathon in six weeks,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.180
about three years removed
from being pronounced dead

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.760
in a coma.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.870
When you meet people like this,
again I get this every weekend,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.080
it's mind-boggling.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.820
The last marathon I did
was in Tacoma, Washington

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.232
this past May.

00:08:09.232 --> 00:08:10.940
And I went there to
be the guest speaker.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.231
I wasn't going to run the race.

00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:16.650
I wasn't really in good shape
to run a marathon at the time.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.690
But the day before the
race, I'm interacting

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.890
with all the runners and
this guy comes up to me

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.660
and he said he just survived--
this is his first marathon

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.471
after surviving fourth-stage
pancreatic cancer.

00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:31.970
And he said, when I was really
sick, I was reading your book

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.390
and some of those
chapters made me laugh

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.520
and it kept my spirit up.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.370
And he said to me, can
I run with you tomorrow?

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.220
I was like, whoa.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.220
I had to tell him I
wasn't running the race,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.372
but I got second thoughts.

00:08:45.372 --> 00:08:47.830
Maybe I should go out and run
so I could run with this guy.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.413
And I thought well,
maybe I could just

00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:51.630
run part of the
course or something.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.920
Within another 30
minutes or so, this woman

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.030
comes walking towards me.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.730
And I recognized her and she
said, we met at this marathon.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.080
And she goes, my husband Brian
is running his last marathon

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.580
tomorrow.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.850
He came down with ALS and it's
already affecting his arm.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.410
His arms barely move and it's
starting to affect his leg.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.480
So he's going to do
his last marathon

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.126
and his dream is to run
part of it with you.

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:18.410
And I'm like, do I
have a sign on my head

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.645
that says anyone with
any problems come get me?

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:22.740
I was like, wow.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.899
So I texted the race
director right away

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.690
and I said, you got to
get me a bid number.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.231
I gotta go out and
run this marathon.

00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:32.190
So I went out and ran and met
up with these two runners.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.170
And it was amazing to
have that experience,

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.370
to run just part of
the course with them.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.050
They ended up, both of them,
they ran faster than I did,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.820
I'm pretty sure.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.080
But I did go out there
and experienced-- just

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.470
run alongside them for a mile
or so and got some pictures.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.240
And it was really fun.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.490
But in that same context,
all this crazy stuff

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.590
happens to me at
races like Tacoma.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.970
So I had that real
serious side that happens.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:02.382
And then the day before, we
did these little shake out

00:10:02.382 --> 00:10:04.340
runs that we do to kind
of shake out the nerves

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.120
and shake out the cobwebs.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.300
And afterwards we all-- a
group of about 20 of us--

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.170
we got coffee afterwards.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.909
And this one runner
said to me, she said,

00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:16.700
you've got to tell all
the stories tonight.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.240
I'll tell the
stories this morning.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.890
So I said great,
I'm off the hook.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.780
So I thought she
was going to tell

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.390
some kind of running stories.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.020
But she was a flight
attendant, and she

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.910
started talking about
passengers on her planes trying

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.950
to join the mile-high club.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.450
These stories were
awesome stories.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.602
I was cracking up.

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:36.560
And I was so happy I
didn't have to say a word.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.435
I was just listening.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.890
And I travel a lot on planes.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.220
I have never experienced
anything obviously

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.400
what a flight attendant
would experience.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.710
So the next day in this
marathon, after I connected

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.910
with the two runners I did, and
I was a pretty emotional wreck.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.723
There was a little out-and-back
section of the marathon.

00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.320
And we're coming along.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.360
And it just so happened to be
as I was running this direction,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.270
that woman was running
the other direction.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.630
Her name was Heidi.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.960
And we go running up.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.140
And she looks over
and she says, Bart!

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.090
Bart!

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.030
And I'm running with a
group of eight or 10 people.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.250
And she's screaming my name.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.730
And I yell over and
recognize her and say, hey.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.400
And she said, it's me, your
favorite flight attendant

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.400
Heidi-- the mile-high club.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.375
That's all she said.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.470
Now these runners that I was
running with, they were like,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.930
dude, you are the man.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.790
And I had to explain
to them that I'm not

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.615
a member of the mile-high club
and explain the whole story.

00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:37.960
But that's the beauty of
this sport-- the things

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.760
that can happen out
there, the fun I

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.140
get to experience all the time.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.730
When I say never limit
where running can take you,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.250
places like a
marathon that started

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.140
at the base of Mount Everest.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.970
That is me in my younger
days, believe it or not.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.900
Did have hair back in the day.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.750
That's the finish
line of a race.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.735
My friend [? Danelle-- ?] we did
a course tour the day before.

00:12:02.735 --> 00:12:04.770
It's the finish line
of a race in the South

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.040
Island of New Zealand.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.720
They are crazy trail
runners in New Zealand.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.100
Typical-- they don't
think anything of that.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.870
I'm one of those
people fortunate enough

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.750
to go to all seven continents.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.840
That's the way we
got to Antarctica--

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.250
a Russian freighter from
the tip of South America.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.190
The beauty of Antarctica,
the leopard seals.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.530
The only spectators in
the Antarctica marathon

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.280
right there.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.940
A little different than running
in Chicago and New York.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.640
You're running on glaciers,
but it was beautiful.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.900
Such a cool place to be.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.810
And then I did a
race which was--

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.390
so we were in
Antarctica down here.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:42.890
Flip.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.210
So this race was called
the Arctic Circle Marathon.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.200
So we're up in the
Inuit land and running

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.710
near the Arctic Circle.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.900
And the same thing,
the beautiful wildlife.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.140
A pretty arduous
course, pretty tough.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.230
We actually got to see 13
polar bear in the wild, which

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.600
to me was, as an animal lover,
one of my coolest experiences,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.690
to see polar bear
swimming from one island.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.182
And it was amazing to
physically witness.

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:12.390
All right.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.700
I use this race, this
Badwater race as something

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.610
that-- I speak at a
lot of pasta dinners

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.940
the night before the race or two
nights before the Chicago, New

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.630
York, Philly.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.650
And I always get
these people that say,

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.300
I only made it 20 miles-- it's
their first marathon-- I only

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.080
made it 20 miles in training.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.430
Am I going to make
it that last 6.2?

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.510
Or it's a half
marathon, they only

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.020
went up to 10 miles in training.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.220
Am I going to make
it that last 3.1?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.230
Well, when I did
the Badwater race,

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.400
146 miles in Death
Valley, finish line

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.040
on top of Mount Whitney, which
is 14,496 feet, the highest

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.320
mountain in the
contiguous 48 states.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.000
And they hosted in
mid-July, because it's

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.590
the hottest time of the
year, 123 degrees and all

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.690
that craziness.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.280
I just remember
being at the start.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.840
And the race director had
this little starter pistol.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.950
And he just said,
one minute to go

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.000
to the start of
the Badwater 146.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.550
And that 146 just went
through my brain like,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.840
I never ran past the marathon
finish line at that point.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.520
I had a lot of
marathons under my belt,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.800
but I was like, this race is
120 miles longer than I've ever

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.570
run.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.350
That is scary.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.210
And this is not the
time to think about it.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.870
And I'm not that stupid.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.650
I knew that going there.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.590
I just never really processed
it until right then and there.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.230
And I'm like, wow.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.290
How do you run 120 miles
longer than you've ever

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.500
done in training?

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.990
And then I had two crew
people from "Runner's World."

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.570
Each runner had to have
a vehicle and two crew.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.660
And my crew, they were
worried about these 123 degree

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.970
temperatures.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.370
So they literally,
as the race director

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.220
is saying all these little
words of encouragement to us

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.520
as we're ready to
start, my crew kind of

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.450
ducked behind the little
mini RV that we had.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.220
And I followed them, but they
didn't know I followed them.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.189
And I heard them say-- first
thing they said is, OK.

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:05.730
Somebody's going to
die in this race.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.970
We hope it's not Bart.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.020
And I'm like, guys,
I can hear you.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.380
And they-- and I thought wow.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.540
The 120 miles longer, the
123 degree temperature,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.390
my crew actually
really thinks someone's

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.340
going to die in this race.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.890
I just remember now
there's like 20 seconds

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.090
to the start of this race.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.500
I just remember telling
myself, just all those miles

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.340
you've run, all these years,
just go out and enjoy it.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.496
Don't get crazy about it.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.120
Thank God I did that
because I went out

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.977
there and had the
time of my life.

00:15:33.977 --> 00:15:35.560
And now I'm not going
to say it wasn't

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.380
arduous to run 146 miles in the
extreme weather and the finish

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.380
on top of Mount Whitney.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.360
But I can stand
here today and say

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.530
that it was actually fun to do.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.430
It was a crazy fun kind
of work assignment.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.020
There's Mount Whitney.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.130
And then the finish line-- when
you're standing on the highest

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.960
peak in the
contiguous 48 states,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.130
you get a beautiful view of
the Sierra Nevada mountains.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.190
But then you have to walk 11
miles off of this mountain

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.980
back to meet your crew.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.900
And I think they should count
that in as part of the race,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.460
because it's one
of those things.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.630
Again, like I knew I had
to walk up that mountain,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.040
but I was just so focused on
getting to that finish line.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.930
You get there and then you're
loving this view and then, wow.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.130
It's like a three hour walk
to get back to a vehicle

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.790
to get back to another
couple hour drive

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.900
to get to Vegas where
there's any civilization.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.890
It was crazy.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.845
Because I hear runners
complain all the time

00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:31.220
that do the New York City
Marathon when they send you out

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.410
on Central Park
West, and then you've

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.700
got to walk back down to
kind of get out of that area.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.871
That's like a mile or two.

00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:39.370
And you're in New
York where there's

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.050
coffee shops and places to go.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.660
A little different
than doing Badwater.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.280
But if I did that, you
guys will have no problem.

00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:49.640
I really thought I was
going to die in this race.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.050
And I had no clue what
I was getting into.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.830
But I was told to do this race
in Westcliffe, Colorado, called

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.314
the Burro Run.

00:16:57.314 --> 00:16:58.980
And I said well, I
can't do a burro run.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.020
I don't own a burro.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.816
And they said, oh.

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:02.690
You go there, you're
going to meet Taco Bell.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.760
And you and Taco
Bell do this 10K.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.140
Well, I didn't know
that burros run

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.839
as fast as they
do until that day.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.979
So you've got this rope.

00:17:09.979 --> 00:17:11.770
And actually there's
a picture of Taco Bell

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.750
and I before the race.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.619
And we didn't get along
prior to the race.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.410
He was dragging me
around, but eventually I

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.240
got control of him.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.327
There were about 40
runners in the race.

00:17:20.327 --> 00:17:21.160
We get to the start.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.050
You've got this burro
and this 20-foot rope.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.909
And the guy shoots this shotgun.

00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:28.170
This bang goes off, and
the burros get scared

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.880
and they jump up in the air.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.960
And then they touch down,
and my buddy Taco Bell

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.590
did the first mile in about
four minutes and 30 seconds.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.159
And I was 20 feet
behind him attached

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:40.950
to the rope that was
attached to Taco Bell.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.910
And I remember going
that fast saying,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.530
I'm going to die
in a burro race.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.780
This is going to be my demise.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.460
I cannot hold this pace anymore.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.390
My lungs are going to explode.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.950
But not only Taco Bell, but all
the burros, about two miles,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.920
three miles into the race,
they completely stop running.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.890
About four miles
they stop completely

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.560
and get that stiff leg thing.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.690
And you literally
drag this animal

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.290
the entire rest of the race.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.110
It was crazy.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.880
But it sounded really
easy in my office.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.940
Sounded like an easy
work assignment.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.620
My favorite race that
never came to fruition

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.920
was a race in the
lowlands of Nepal

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.130
in a place called Chitwan
Park, which Chitwan Park is

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.660
a reserve for tiger
and rhinoceros.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.549
And this guy Jim
Crosswhite, he knew that,

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:27.840
but he was convinced he could
set up this half marathon

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.900
trail.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.890
But he was a smart guy.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.220
He wanted to do a test run
before he had the race,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.020
so he convinced me into
doing this test run.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.460
And there we are, about three
miles into our test run.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.196
I'm on the left.

00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:40.570
You can see who
is in the middle.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.180
My buddy Jim on the right.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.207
My favorite picture
is two seconds later

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:45.540
because I'm not in that picture.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.290
And that line you
always wanted to use,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.860
I didn't have to outrun the
rhino, just my buddy Jim,

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.060
and I knew I was faster than
Jim, so I wasn't scared?

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.040
But I remember saying to
him-- I said Jim, just

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.570
say you've convinced 25
people into doing this race.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.650
What do you do with
25 runners coming

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.100
down a trail with a rhino
in the middle of the trail?

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.800
Like, you can't do this.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.590
So he said OK, I get it.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.090
So I said if we
run back to where

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.580
we camped, we'll get in a
6-mile run, have breakfast,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.080
everything will be good.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.370
As we ran back to
where we camped,

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.770
we ran into at least
six or seven more rhino.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.670
Someone would have gotten
killed in this race, I swear.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.390
But luckily, he ended
up scratching the idea.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.290
Now, my scariest work
assignment is this race.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.810
I'm going to go through
these slides really quickly.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.060
The Bare Buns Fun Run, and
you'll get the gist of it.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.560
The start of the Bare Buns Race.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.380
There's me finishing naked.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.560
And then I got my medal to
prove I did it and my t-shirt.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.160
So the Bare Buns Run is 5K.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.240
It's held on this nudist camp
outside of Spokane, Washington.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.670
When I committed
to this thing, I

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.500
didn't know the
race would promote

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.770
that I was coming to the race.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.620
I didn't think that
was part of the deal.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.960
So the race starts promoting,
Bart's running naked,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.670
doing this 5K.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.720
And the race swells in size.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.600
And then they say to
me-- they called me--

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.891
the race director called me
about a month before the race.

00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:10.890
And he said, Bart, we
have so many people coming

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.125
to this race, we're going
to have our own dinner

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.250
because there's not enough
restaurants close enough

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.047
to the nudist camp
to feed everybody.

00:20:17.047 --> 00:20:18.630
So we're going to
have a pasta dinner.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.930
We're going to set you up
to speak at the dinner.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.310
So I committed to
that over the phone.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.020
When I got there,
I realized people

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.370
are going to come to
this pasta dinner naked.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.410
And get in the buffet
line to get their pasta

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.436
and then sit at
these round tables.

00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:34.310
And they're going to
throw me up on the stage

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.890
naked to do my presentation.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.680
And I thought, they didn't tell
me any of this over the phone.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.519
So I thought, OK.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.060
By the time they
get the room set up,

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.576
this will be my easiest
presentation ever.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.700
I'm not going to look at
naked people eating pasta.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.324
I'll just look over
their heads and act

00:20:48.324 --> 00:20:49.410
like I'm looking at them.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.120
And I'll do my PowerPoint,
hide behind the podium

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.400
that they'll have for
me, and then I'm gone.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.050
I did not have a podium.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.570
They gave me like
two cinder blocks

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.240
that were like this high
to put my computer on.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.990
So I do my presentation
and I thought, OK.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.860
Every talk I do when I'm done,
I hang out and meet and greet

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.060
everybody.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.910
I'm not sticking
around after this talk.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.370
I'm literally finishing my
talk and running out the door.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.120
So I thought, I better
have a good closing line

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.600
to just depart this
room in a second.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.480
So I figured out my line.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.630
I finished, got
to my last slide,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.300
I wished everybody luck
in the race tomorrow.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.920
I said, I hope everyone
has a goal in this race.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.387
And I said, I got one goal.

00:21:31.387 --> 00:21:33.720
I don't want to come back to
the "Runner's World" office

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.710
on Monday with some
medal in my hand

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.610
that says I was smallest
in my age group.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.040
And I literally ran out the
door and left them thinking.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040
And it was crazy.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.180
So you got to watch
what you commit to.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.650
I had no clue what I was doing.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.970
I've done a couple
races in Africa.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.110
The first race I
did in East Africa

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.110
was the Mount
Kilimanjaro Marathon,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.330
which I was fortunate enough to
do three times over the years.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.410
The first time I did it,
I was the only non-East

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.470
African in the race.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.890
You want to line up with
120 runners, and 119

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.080
of them come from Tanzania,
Kenya, and Ethiopia,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.390
it is the scariest thing.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.850
When that gun went off there
wasn't anyone running slower

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.350
than six minute per mile pace.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.990
No one in the race.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.730
And the thing I remember
during the race--

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.840
I always say if you run a
marathon in North America,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.810
people lie to you.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.400
They always say,
oh you look good.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.200
At 25 miles in the
marathon and you've

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.420
got like drool coming
down and you're just

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.962
trying to get to the finish,
and they tell you you look good.

00:22:37.962 --> 00:22:39.336
And you don't look
good, but they

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:40.980
don't want to tell
you you look bad.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.040
Or you'll hear people
say you're almost there

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.457
or there are no more hills.

00:22:44.457 --> 00:22:46.915
Well, when I was running this
race, I kept hearing Swahili.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.800
They would be cheering
for us and I'd come along,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.060
and in Swahili they would
say, [SWAHILI] and smile at me

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.580
and cheer.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.560
And I was like, wow,
they're telling me

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.890
I look good in Swahili.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.800
Because for me, I
had a good race.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.890
I was running pretty well.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.260
But I was way in the back
in this field of runners.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.390
So I found out after I finished
what [SWAHILI] means in Swahili

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.820
is look at the slow white
man, is what they were saying.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.950
But they weren't being
mean, to be quite honest.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.200
It's just matter-of-factly
what they saw.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.410
And when I was there
on one of my trips,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.510
I got to-- I challenged
some young Maasai warrior

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.340
kids, way off the
beaten path, to see

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.045
is everyone in East Africa fast?

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.700
The answer is yes.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.200
Because I went to these kids
who had never really done

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.130
an organized run in their life.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.380
We set up this little race.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.090
And I'm running with my
camera just to get pictures.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.650
And these kids were so
fast it was ridiculous.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.420
And that is, you can tell, a
pretty good running stride.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.840
But when I was there, I tried
to get the young women to run

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.390
with me, the young Maasai women.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.265
And they wouldn't do it
for cultural reasons,

00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:57.810
and it really bummed me out.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.460
But they took my running medals.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.540
I take all my running
medals to-- actually,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.470
all my running medals now are
being auctioned off on eBay.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.220
But back then I used to take
a lot of them to East Africa.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.310
So they took these medals.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.950
I don't know what it says
on the back of the medals.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.212
Something about first
place in the 55 to 59

00:24:15.212 --> 00:24:16.170
age group or something.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.610
I don't know what's on
the back of those medals.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.870
But ceremoniously they
took those medals.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.410
And they gave me that beautiful
smile that I never forgot.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.290
And so whenever I get
a medal around my neck,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.590
the first thing I think of
is this moment that I had,

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.130
and I always remind
myself culturally

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.380
how lucky we are
to do what we do.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.170
Because it doesn't
happen everywhere.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.950
This is a pretty spec--
if I went back there now,

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.110
I know I could get these
women to run with me.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.770
But prior to a lot of the
East African women doing well

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.600
in big races like
London and New York,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.440
the Maasai women were told not
to do anything with a man--

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.960
certainly not anything in sport.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.340
I just threw that animal stuff
in there because I love it.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.100
And in my personal-- in all
my years at "Runner's World,"

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.140
I'm going to close with my
two feature stories that

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.490
come to mind as my
favorite in this 28 years

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.810
I've been at "Runner's World."

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.960
This was a race-- it's
called the Comrades

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.920
Marathon in South
Africa-- the largest

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.550
ultramarathon in the
world and the oldest

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.910
ultramarathon in the world.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.160
They've been running
this 56 miles

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.640
run through the hills of
South Africa since 1921.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.750
And 20,000 people
line up to run it.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.020
It's amazing.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.670
And I wanted to do it
back in my younger days

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.440
when I would run this distance
at a pretty fast pace.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.520
I used to run 50 mile races
right around 7.20 per mile

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.250
pace.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.906
I can't do one mile at
that pace these days.

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:45.530
But I always wanted
to do it back then.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.980
And because of
reasons like apartheid

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.520
and different reasons, I
never got over there to do it.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.750
So I did get over in 2010
and got to finish that race,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.990
and it was the
coolest experience.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.660
To see the human spirit
that lives within this race.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.530
It changed the physical
makeup of South Africa.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.020
They suppressed
the black athletes

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.322
from running Comrades
for many years.

00:26:08.322 --> 00:26:10.030
But then the white
athletes were the ones

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.560
that said if you don't
allow the blacks to flourish

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.060
in this sport, we're not
going to come and do Comrades.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.120
So it all changed
and now there's

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.960
many black citizens
running Comrades,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.330
in fact winning Comrades.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.950
To see that change,
that's the reason

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:27.180
I really wanted to go over there
and run this 89 kilometers, 56

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.930
hilly miles through
South Africa.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.760
And we did a whole video series
on it and a big feature piece.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.240
And then the other
feature piece,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.280
this picture was in
"Runner's World,"

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.820
called "Running with the Amish."

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.900
And this is as the
Amish race that they

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.255
do outside of
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:47.785
And when I first
went to this, it

00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:49.840
was this handful
of Amish runners.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.950
Literally, four or
five Amish runners.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.075
They would run in their
traditional Amish clothing.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.260
Wait until 10 o'clock
at night to run,

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.620
because they didn't
want anyone to see them.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.840
They would run through
the Amish fields.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.640
And they asked me if I would
come run with them, and I did.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.566
And it was a cool experience.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:11.440
And then they asked me
to come back and speak

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.610
to the entire Amish
community about running.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.650
So I committed to this talk.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.800
And I went to this barn and
no electricity, no anything.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.345
But they told me they would--
my PowerPoint would work,

00:27:22.345 --> 00:27:23.220
they had a projector.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.636
And this guy went
out and fired up

00:27:24.636 --> 00:27:26.530
a generator, this
big old Amish guy.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.720
And boom, the lights came
on, some artificial lighting

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.550
that they set up.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.590
And I look and there's
all these teenagers,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.472
and people in their 20s and
30s, and then the adults

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:38.180
and then these bishops
in the background.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.000
And I'm in this barn with 500
Amish people, and four of them

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.660
run.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.220
And I got to sell
them on running.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.380
And it was a challenge,
which I love,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.122
but just that opportunity--
it was the coolest thing.

00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:55.830
And then I helped them
out with this race

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.530
they do called the Bird
in Hand Half Marathon.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.607
Bird in Hand is a small
town outside of Lancaster.

00:28:01.607 --> 00:28:03.190
And when I went there
that first year,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.060
there were literally
four or five Amish people

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.400
participating in the race.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.830
This past September, the
numbers are over 400,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.410
plus Amish people
either doing the kids

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.700
run, the 5K, or
the half marathon.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.040
In that short period of
time, the Amish community

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.210
just embraced running.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.830
And it wasn't me or what
I talked to them about.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.230
It was the power of
the running community

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.440
and the way they
engage with people.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.730
I think I got one slide here.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.630
I think-- yeah.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.350
That Amish kid is
finishing a half marathon.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.630
Look at the stride on that kid.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.500
Now they are wearing
Garmin watches, which

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.420
I don't know-- I'm not
saying-- they may break

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.970
a few of the Amish rules, but
I'm not going to go there.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.762
But that is amazing how
fast these kids are.

00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:51.470
I don't know this
kid's time in the half.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.270
I don't remember, but when
I did the awards ceremony,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.710
all the younger
age groups were all

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.842
won by the Amish boys or girls.

00:28:58.842 --> 00:29:00.050
All those younger age groups.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.925
These kids were so fast,
it was unbelievable.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.000
And now, why would the
Amish really want to run?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.100
A couple reasons.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.420
The simplicity of it.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.430
You don't need any
fancy clothing.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.340
They can run in
their Amish clothing.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.215
They just need shoes.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.475
The other part of it is
that running community.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.520
And I just think
they embraced it.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.480
And the Amish community
is now having problems

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.880
like we're used to.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.620
They all used to be farmers and
everybody was skinny and fit.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.750
But now they're landlocked, so
not everyone can have a farm.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.440
So now they turned
to traditional jobs

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.490
like a carpenter, a
plumber, and a roofer.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.180
And they got a little
lazy in the big picture

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.630
and started diabetes and started
having Amish overweight, which

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.470
never was-- it was never
a problem in the past.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.990
So to have running as
part of their lifestyle,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.140
it's changed their
community all to the better.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.835
So whenever I do
my talk, I always

00:29:59.835 --> 00:30:01.460
throw it back to the
running community,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.020
because they're such a
powerful group of people,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.770
such a compassionate
group of people.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.590
And that's truly what I
love about this sport.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.520
And my tagline, never limit
where running can take you,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.100
you can see it literally has
taken me all over the world.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.326
Thank you.

00:30:19.326 --> 00:30:24.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.170
Questions?

00:30:29.804 --> 00:30:30.720
No one has a question.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.011
Someone has to have a question.

00:30:32.011 --> 00:30:32.746
Oh, here we go.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.880
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much for
speaking here today, Bart.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.010
So I wanted to ask you
about some of your thoughts

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.000
about where the running
community, industry is going,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.190
going forward.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.190
Especially now with the, I
guess, international popularity

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:55.530
of running really rising over
the past four or five years,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.730
as we've seen the American
professional athletes really

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.360
come into their own, both
in the marathon distances

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360
as well as on the track.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.190
Just in terms of promotional
sponsorships from companies,

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.110
where the incentives go,
and things like that.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:15.420
And then I have a separate
question about the recent world

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.789
record in the marathon.

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:17.830
The whole two hour thing.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.160
BART YASSO: Two hours,
two minutes, 57 seconds.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.027
Yeah.

00:31:22.027 --> 00:31:23.610
I'll start out with
that world record.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.030
Unbelievable.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.410
There's all this talk
about, will someone

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.380
break two hours in
the marathon someday.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.910
Well, they've gotten a lot
closer, running 2:02:57.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.940
I never thought I
would physically

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.530
see somebody run that
fast in my lifetime.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.570
So they're already
at high 2:02's.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.812
I think to get sub-two hours
is going to take a long time.

00:31:45.812 --> 00:31:47.770
A lot of times the world
record in the marathon

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.710
will level off for many
years, like 20 or 30 years.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.590
They hit a certain level
and then it will level off.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.940
But I see a couple more
records in the near future,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.410
and maybe hitting like
2:02:30ish and then leveling

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.550
off for awhile.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.820
Again, that's my own opinion.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.194
I could be totally
wrong on that.

00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:09.060
We could witness
sub-two hours someday.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.930
But you know,
someone comfortably

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.970
has to run a half marathon in
57 minutes to run sub-two hours.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.080
And I just don't see
that happening right now.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.815
So the other part-- what
running is happening globally.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.790
You know, it's still growing.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.610
These marathons are
more popular than ever.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.986
The six majors that they have,
New York, Chicago, Berlin,

00:32:36.986 --> 00:32:38.110
which just happened, Tokyo.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.170
I mean, there's
hundreds of thousands

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.040
of people trying to
get in these races that

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.740
only have space
for 50,000 people.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.800
It's a good problem,
I guess, to look at.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.830
I wish we could accommodate
everybody, but we can't.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.470
But there's so many
races out there.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.940
I see a lot of
people gravitating

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.870
towards smaller races that
only have 5,000 or 6,000 people

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.920
because they just want
a more intimate feel.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.430
But the big races are
obviously still doing well.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.470
But I see a lot of
those smaller races

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.700
really thriving and doing well.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.230
At "Runner's World,"
we do a-- in two weeks

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.530
we have what we call the
Runner's World Half Marathon

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.800
and Festival.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.700
So we do a 5K, 10K Saturday,
half marathon on Sunday,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.310
and then a festival all
day Saturday with clinics

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.360
on nutrition and training.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.916
And so I see a lot of
races going that way.

00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:30.290
So there's something
for everyone

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.970
to do over a two to
three day period.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.510
Disney is big at it.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.010
People do the Dopey Challenge
and the Goofy Challenge

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.980
where you run multiple races.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.510
In our race, of the
6,000 runners that we'll

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.290
have in two weeks,
about 1,000 of them

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.130
do what we call the Hat Trick.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.500
They do all three events.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.440
And that's a new phenomenon
and has been very popular.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.510
People love more t-shirts,
more finisher medals,

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.530
all that stuff.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.680
They just thrive on it.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.680
It's kind of fun to see that.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.300
It is more being involved,
being part of the community.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.982
It's not just about running
fast for a lot of people.

00:34:05.982 --> 00:34:06.815
And that's a change.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.370
But by far the biggest
change that I physically

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.310
witnessed in this
sport is the amount

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.929
of women doing the sport.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:18.170
When I used to do races
in the '70s, if there were

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.860
200 people in the race, there
were five women, 10 women.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.969
Now to go to some half
marathons and the race announcer

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:29.980
goes over the demographic and
says, today's race, 58% women,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.835
I mean, that's
amazing to witness.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.772
They didn't allow women in
the Boston-- in the old days,

00:34:36.772 --> 00:34:38.730
we didn't go on the
computer to enter the race.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.800
We had to fill out a
form and mail it in.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:46.719
There was no gender box on the
Boston Marathon until 1972.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.150
So there were Kathrine
Switzer, Roberta Gibb--

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.159
there were a few women
that ran it prior,

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.580
but they weren't counted,
they weren't official.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:59.380
So to think that this just goes
back to 1972 is amazing to me.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.430
In that short period of time
how much women's running

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.190
has taken off.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.669
It's been the big
growth in running.

00:35:05.669 --> 00:35:06.960
Does that answer your question?

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:07.700
Thank you.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.616
BART YASSO: Thank you.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.090
Yes.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:10.631
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:10.631 --> 00:35:11.492
Thanks for coming.

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:12.950
You mentioned
earlier how important

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.890
it is to take it slow
on the long runs.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.340
BART YASSO: Yeah, recovery day.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.260
AUDIENCE: That has
been really great,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.410
but what about the
day after a long run?

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.440
How do you approach-- say you've
run, I don't know, 20 miles,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.960
and you want to
get some miles in.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.471
I think "Runner's World"
has called that junk miles.

00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:28.470
You want to get them in.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.782
How do you approach those?

00:35:29.782 --> 00:35:30.490
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.554
So there is a term
called junk miles.

00:35:32.554 --> 00:35:34.720
You did your long run, but
you still want to go out.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.630
I don't call any
mile junk miles.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.560
Every workout should
have a purpose.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.447
Every workout should not be
a fast workout or a quality

00:35:42.447 --> 00:35:44.030
workout, but it
should have a purpose.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.830
And that purpose
could be you just

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.080
want to go out and cover
five miles and have fun.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.560
You don't wear a watch.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.100
You consciously tell yourself
just run as easy as you can.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.780
Run along the west side highway
and look out over the water,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.727
look at New Jersey,
look at the sky.

00:36:01.727 --> 00:36:03.810
Whatever you want to do,
just go out and enjoy it.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.250
Or, more importantly, find
someone new to the sport

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.670
that you know is a lot slower
than you are, and take them out

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.310
for a run.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.060
And encourage them that
they can improve on this.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.670
They can finish a
marathon someday

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.380
if they put in the hard
work and commit to it.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.800
And that's the better thing.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.880
Then it's not junk miles.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.160
Then it's like a quality day.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.530
You get to help somebody.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.640
You get to go out
and enjoy the views,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.290
and you're not
worried about time.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.720
And the best thing is
not to wear a watch

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.450
and to tell yourself
the minute you

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.206
leave to slow down
the whole time.

00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:39.330
Run around that reservoir,
whatever you want to do.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.080
Just take in-- you know,
and the two things I

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.500
say to myself all the time.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.210
How lucky we are physically
to do what we do,

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.990
and culturally to do what we do.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.370
We have this freedom.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.530
We can run anywhere.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.780
Go out and enjoy it.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.194
Don't get caught up in what
kind of miles they are.

00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:57.610
And I don't believe
in junk miles.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.910
I think every mile
helps you at some point,

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.243
whether it just helps you
mentally or physically.

00:37:04.243 --> 00:37:05.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.639
BART YASSO: Thank you.

00:37:06.639 --> 00:37:07.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.350
Thanks for coming.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.200
What do you recommend
for beginner runners

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.722
for learning proper running
form and good pacing?

00:37:13.722 --> 00:37:14.430
BART YASSO: Sure.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.720
So beginning runners.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.420
The first thing
beginning runners do

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.540
is they run too
quickly, because they

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.030
think you have to run fast.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.299
You know, everybody's watching
you, they're timing you.

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:29.340
And they're really not,
but you get that feeling.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.690
So beginning runners, I
always tell them to slow down.

00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:36.600
If you slow down, you'll be able
to cover a little more distance

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.550
than you think is possible.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.410
You'll build endurance, which
is going to help you long term,

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.107
and then you can
get a lot faster.

00:37:43.107 --> 00:37:43.940
But it's hard to do.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.870
It's hard to slow people down.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.890
But if you slow down, you'll
learn better running form.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.350
You'll learn a better
way to pace yourself.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.500
And if you can learn
how to pace yourself

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.147
so that when you're doing
a race you stay consistent,

00:37:57.147 --> 00:37:58.980
that's when you're going
to run a good race.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.080
But you really teach
yourself that in training.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.100
You don't need a
coach to do that.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.190
It's something you can do
by really paying attention

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.610
to what you're doing,
the workout you're doing.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:14.020
Start out slowly and
build up that endurance,

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.310
and then it's a lot easier.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.210
People that go from the
couch to the marathon

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.210
is not the way to do it.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.720
The couch to the 5K, the
5K to the half marathon,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.150
the half marathon
to the marathon,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.790
is a much better formula
than couch to marathon.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.510
So if you're patient
about it, allow your body

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:36.230
to gain the endurance of
running slowly and adding more

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.679
miles as you're
able to do that, all

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:40.470
the other stuff, the
good form and the pace

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.730
will just happen naturally.

00:38:42.652 --> 00:38:43.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.068
BART YASSO: Sure.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.140
Yes.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.410
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.035
BART YASSO: Hi.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.210
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to
sort of ask a pre-question

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.852
about the run the day after.

00:38:51.852 --> 00:38:52.560
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.060
AUDIENCE: One thing
I'm particularly

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.399
bad at is recovery
right after a run.

00:38:57.399 --> 00:38:58.940
So I was wondering
what your thoughts

00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.500
were on stretching and--

00:38:59.500 --> 00:38:59.760
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.690
So I mean, you've
immediately finished a run.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:02.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.530
BART YASSO: So a lot happens
on especially a quality workout

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.230
within the 10 to 15 minutes
after you've finished the run.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.750
The hydration part of it, a
little bit of food part of it,

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.151
the stretching part of it.

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.150
Because that's going to
allow you to feel better

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.830
the next day.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.610
If you're really
gutsy, you can take

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.490
an ice bath, which
ice baths aren't fun.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.180
But they really work
after a long run.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.917
But there's a small
window 15, 20 minutes

00:39:27.917 --> 00:39:29.000
after you finish that run.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.170
If you do a few things,
it's going to help you out

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.150
and you'll recover faster.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.110
Number one is to make sure
you rehydrate properly.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.120
Because even if you take fluids
with you, most of the time

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.210
you'll get dehydrated,
especially on the longer runs.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.810
So if you can
hydrate right away.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.820
And then get a little
bit of food in you,

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.100
which is going to help the
glycogen in your muscles

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.780
recover a little bit better.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.290
And then some form
of stretching,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.540
light stretching after
the run, that you

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.745
can keep that flexibility.

00:39:57.609 --> 00:40:00.150
Because the worst thing to do
is to go to bed at night really

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.130
stiff and sore, and
then you're going

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.010
to wake up much stiffer
than when you went to bed.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.900
So that little
bit of-- you know,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.116
I'm not crazy about stretching.

00:40:12.116 --> 00:40:13.740
I don't think you
need a whole routine,

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.430
but just a little bit
of smart stretching.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.450
I like to do stretching that
has a little bit of strength

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.550
and flexibility.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.050
So just light weights
and I do a little thing

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.660
in our workout facility
when I can after a run.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.780
And I find then I
recover so much better.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.280
So it's a hydration,
a little bit of food,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.810
proper food like a banana,
get that potassium,

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.610
something like that after a run.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.460
And then to do some form
of strength and flexibility

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.470
afterwards that you feel
better the next day.

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:45.620
That's what you're looking for?

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.245
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:46.245 --> 00:40:47.400
Thanks.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.750
BART YASSO: Thank you.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.270
Yes.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.936
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:49.936 --> 00:40:52.800
Thank you so much for sharing,
especially the pictures,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.640
because it just helps
to put us in your shoes

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.160
while you were
doing those races.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.090
But I was hoping maybe you
could tell us a little bit more

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.762
about how you go into running.

00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:03.470
BART YASSO: Sure.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.386
AUDIENCE: And how you
got to "Runner's World."

00:41:05.386 --> 00:41:06.630
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.140
Two crazed, crazy routes.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.504
And I like to do
my PowerPoint a lot

00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:12.170
because people don't
believe my stories.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.595
They don't believe I
was chased by a rhino.

00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:15.040
They don't believe
I was attached

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.540
to a burro and
drug down the road.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.510
When they see my
pictures, they know.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:22.680
I did have one kid
challenge my rhino picture.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.470
I was speaking to
a third-grade class

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:30.519
and this little kid said I
used Photoshop on that picture.

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:31.810
And I remember asking his name.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.070
His name was Johnny.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.320
And I said Johnny,
that picture's way

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.336
older than Photoshop.

00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:37.710
And I'm way older
than Photoshop.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.050
And I never use Photoshop.

00:41:39.837 --> 00:41:42.170
And then I said, if you want
to get to the fourth grade,

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.140
wait till after the presentation
to ask the speaker a question.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.660
Because he blurted it out
right in the middle of my talk.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.540
It was so funny.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.630
But to get to your
question, 38 years ago

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.510
I was not living
a good lifestyle.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.870
I really needed a
change in my life.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.760
I didn't want to go
out drink every night,

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.100
like what I was doing.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.550
I really wanted a change.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.290
And I used running as a
way just to get in shape.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.850
I wasn't really thinking
I'm going to be a marathoner

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.000
and do all these races.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.330
I just went out and I
just started running.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.980
I fell in love with the sport.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.759
And I just increased
my mileage and started

00:42:16.759 --> 00:42:19.300
running two days a week, three
days a week, four days a week.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.310
And it just came along
for me at the right time.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:27.770
And then "Runner's World" at
the time was owned by a company

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.605
and published in Mountain
View, California.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.872
Gentleman by the
name of Bob Anderson

00:42:32.872 --> 00:42:33.830
owned "Runner's World."

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.490
And he sold it to the Rodale
family, and "Runner's World"

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.240
moved into Pennsylvania
close to where I was living.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.581
And then "Runner's World" moved
into Pennsylvania and Rodale

00:42:45.581 --> 00:42:46.080
bought it.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.270
After Rodale bought it, I got
to meet all the people that

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.478
work at "Runner's World."
and they said, we like you.

00:42:50.478 --> 00:42:52.780
We're going to get
you to work for us.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.110
I was pretty connected
with the running community,

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.260
and it was something that the
magazine needed at that time.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.350
So that's how I started
out-- working with events,

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.520
physically going
to events, and then

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.680
my job just evolved
over the years.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.260
And having the job title,
Chief Running Officer,

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.750
it is the coolest title ever.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.790
I spoke to these
high school kids

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:18.050
who were going on to
college, all had GPAs of 4.5.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.684
And this one guy
said, you've got

00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:20.850
to come speak to this group.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:24.360
And you know, I said my
GPA wasn't anywhere near

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:24.910
those kids.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.470
And he said but
you're the right guy.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.950
So I showed them my experiences
and what I do for a living.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.400
And I told them, I
said, get a vague title

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.260
that you really-- nobody knows
what you're supposed to do.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.200
It's the greatest thing.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.860
If I was the Editor
in Chief, you

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.790
know you're responsible for
every page in the magazine.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.800
If you're Editor
in Chief Digitally,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.570
you're responsible
for every story that

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.080
appears on everything
we do digitally.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.770
So there's all these
job titles which

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.880
absolutely you know
you're responsible for.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.840
The CEO.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.140
But when you're the CRO,
the Chief Running Officer,

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.250
you get to do a little
bit of everything.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.777
And that's what I love.

00:43:59.777 --> 00:44:01.610
I get to work in all
facets of the magazine.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.960
So it's fun.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.144
I ended up there.

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:08.560
I don't think I would've ever
ended up at "Runner's World"

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.904
if it wasn't purchased by Rodale
and moved into Pennsylvania

00:44:11.904 --> 00:44:13.070
close to where I was living.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.690
But when I got my position at
"Runner's World," the first

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.400
job, I just knew this
is where I wanted to be.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.880
I had to work hard to flourish.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.770
So I just put that commitment
out there that I was going

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.900
to work-- not harder
than anyone at Rodale,

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.920
not harder than anyone
at "Runner's World"--

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.190
I personally said to myself I
was going to work harder than

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.870
anybody in the running industry.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.570
That was my goal I
personally set for myself,

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.730
and I've been going at it
pretty hard for 28 years.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.700
And I absolutely love what I do.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.326
People come to me
all the time and say,

00:44:46.326 --> 00:44:47.658
aren't you ever going to retire?

00:44:47.658 --> 00:44:48.840
Don't you get tired of this?

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.800
And I go, no, I actually
love it more now than ever.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.500
Why would I step away from that?

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.920
If you're loving something,
you've got to keep it going.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.300
And you never know
where the sport will go

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.600
or what changes will happen.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.888
So I'm still riding that
wave and having fun doing it.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.450
Thank you.

00:45:10.997 --> 00:45:12.580
AUDIENCE: Thanks
very much for coming.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.620
And thank you for all the
fun and motivating stories

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.720
that you told us about.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.120
My question is actually
about motivation.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.450
I've been running marathons and
so on for a number of years.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.989
Nothing crazy, like a few,
one or two races a year.

00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:28.030
BART YASSO: That's crazy.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:33.010
AUDIENCE: As masters runner,
now injury is setting in,

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.660
the recovery takes longer, you
notice it's harder to go out.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.060
And I realize that I'm not going
to improve my time, you know.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.940
So I did a marathon
in the spring,

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.040
and my running has
been kind of flagging.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.970
I haven't been running as much,
haven't been as motivated.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.370
So I was kind of curious
as to whether you

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.420
went through periods where
you're less motivated

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.822
and how you got yourself out.

00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:56.530
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:57.946
Yeah, I went through
it yesterday.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.460
And it's so true.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.090
But I did a 50K
trail run yesterday.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.910
31 miles.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.020
It was pretty hilly and outside
of Reading, Pennsylvania,

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.760
around this lake
call Blue Marsh Lake,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.980
and I didn't realize it was
going to be as hilly as it was.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.540
For some reason I did
this stupid thing.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:18.510
I looked at what my personal
record was in 50 kilometers

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.690
before I went to the race,
just out of curiosity,

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.479
because I knew I was going
to go so much slower.

00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:24.020
And I looked.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.340
My personal best
for 50 kilometers

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.740
was three hours and 24 minutes.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.850
Yesterday I ran eight
hours and three minutes.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:35.570
So why would I be out there?

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.910
Why would I want to
do a race that I'm

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.140
so much slower at
than I used the run?

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.200
And I finished like
fifth from the end

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.580
where I used to win a lot of
these races in the old days.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:51.480
Well, a mile into this race
this runner came alongside of me

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.820
and he said, Bart, man, I'm
one of your biggest fans.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.300
I want to run a mile with you.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.960
And I said, no problem.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.205
We'll run a mile together.

00:46:58.205 --> 00:47:01.590
Well, we ran 30 miles together.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.670
He ended up being
like a Siamese twin.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.710
Like I think we were
literally attached

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.470
by the hip for 30 miles.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.090
To have that experience, it
was worth being out there.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.660
And that's what I personally
use for motivation.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.410
Because you're right,
there is a bell curve

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.660
in running like anything else.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.160
And if you've been at it for a
long time and start when you're

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.880
younger, you can
improve for many years.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.100
And then all of a sudden
you hit this high spot

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.360
and you become on this
side of the bell curve.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.980
And you slow down.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.940
It's inevitable.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:37.000
I'll be 60 next year, so I'm
not going to get any faster.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
I'm only going to get slower.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.730
But that's what I
use for motivation.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.957
I just go out there and be
happy I have these experiences.

00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:46.790
I really don't know why
I entered that race.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.831
I kept saying to myself
when I was driving there,

00:47:48.831 --> 00:47:50.055
what was I thinking?

00:47:50.055 --> 00:47:53.430
I'm not in any shape to run
31 miles, but thank God I did,

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:58.640
because to run 30 miles
with this guy, Daryl,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.190
it was such a cool experience.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.920
And I don't think
he would have--

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.980
I don't want to brag about it
and say that I had to be there

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.407
for him, but I was talking to
him, how to do these hills,

00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:10.240
and how to do the
downhills, because I still

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.323
know how to do that stuff.

00:48:11.323 --> 00:48:13.380
I just can't do it
as fast as I used to.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.924
So I was coaching him
for literally 30 miles

00:48:15.924 --> 00:48:17.340
and talking him
through this race.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.120
And when we got to the finish
and I got that big bear hug

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.680
from this guy, man, it was
worth the eight hours and three

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.270
minutes or whatever
we were out there.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:28.740
And literally 30 miles
of it with that guy.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.670
But that's what I use for
that motivation to keep going.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.020
You know, there's other
things to do in this sport

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.400
to help people, to work
with beginning runners,

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.150
because you have a
lot of experience.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.040
And I think that
keeps you motivated.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.230
But don't give up on the running
just because you get slower.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.870
There's so many
experiences out there.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.800
If I didn't ever do
Comrades or the races

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.350
that I did so much slower
than I used to run,

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.900
I would feel that
I cheated myself.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.340
Because even though
I was slower,

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.720
the clock was still there.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.630
I still get that same feeling.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:06.090
I get excited about it, just
being part of the community

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.650
and ending up in these
locations to do these events.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.240
So that, to me, is
what it's all about.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.690
When I did Comrades, I
did a TV interview right

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.420
before the start.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.160
And I was up at the front.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.200
And like I said, if I was
doing Comrades back in my 30s,

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.475
I would have one of those
runners at the front

00:49:25.475 --> 00:49:29.350
of the race trying to run 7.20
per mile for the entire 56

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:29.850
miles.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.300
But when I went
there in 2010, I was

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.510
going to run 13-minute miles
and start way in the back.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.690
When I did this interview,
I couldn't get to the back

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.050
where I needed to be.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.940
And the race announcer
and the race director

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.398
said, you've got
to go in the front

00:49:43.398 --> 00:49:45.120
and start with this lead group.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.126
You don't have a choice.

00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:47.750
The race is going to
start in a minute.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:49.800
And I was like,
wow, these guys just

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.807
heard me say on
the TV station I'm

00:49:51.807 --> 00:49:54.570
going to run 13-minute miles,
and that lead group was all

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:57.600
going to run under six minute
per mile pace for the entire 56

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.730
miles.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.720
So you think I got
to get off that stage

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.380
and mix it up with those guys,
they're going to be mean to me.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.966
They all hugged me.

00:50:04.966 --> 00:50:06.840
And then they did say,
when the gun goes off,

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.530
move off to the side,
which I told them

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.160
I was definitely going to do.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.090
I already had that plan,
but that's the stuff.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.039
If I didn't get to
live those experiences,

00:50:15.039 --> 00:50:16.830
I really think I would
have cheated myself.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.030
It happens to everyone.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.660
It's the way you deal with it.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.330
If you can keep it fun
and attach yourself

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.690
to some other people
that you can help out,

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:29.924
you can keep doing
it for a long time.

00:50:29.924 --> 00:50:31.715
I still think you
probably run pretty fast.

00:50:31.715 --> 00:50:32.620
You just--

00:50:33.755 --> 00:50:34.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.400
You motivated enough that
I'm going to go out for a run

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.050
this afternoon.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.300
So we'll see.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.270
BART YASSO: Thank you.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.520
That's the cool thing to hear.

00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:44.350
No more questions?

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.845
Oh yeah.

00:50:46.845 --> 00:50:47.170
Go ahead.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.461
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think the right amount of time

00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:51.730
to run, you know, I
guess the average mileage

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.822
per week for optimal health.

00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:54.530
BART YASSO: Yeah.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.460
I really believe
that if you're just

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.890
using running to stay fit, if
you can get out there four days

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.780
a week and run 30 to 40 minutes,
you're going to be happy.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.120
That's enough to
relieve that stress,

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.240
keep your weight at
the proper level.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.350
I mean, you really don't have to
go out there and kill yourself.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.710
And then once, maybe once a
month, really think about,

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:17.950
I'm going to do a long run.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.539
So I usually just run at lunch,
get away for 30 or 40 minutes,

00:51:21.539 --> 00:51:23.080
but on Saturday I'm
going to just try

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.270
to run two loops
around Central Park.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.160
And you could do that stuff
if you slow the pace down.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.910
And that's kind of
a cool thing to do.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.515
And then it's kind
of cool to say--

00:51:32.515 --> 00:51:34.640
you know, you go to a coffee
shop and say, oh yeah,

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.410
I just did two loops
of Central Park.

00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:39.370
Because not everyone in that
coffee shop has done that.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.530
It's kind of fun and
you'll motivate people.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.570
But I really think that's
the beauty of running.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:45.890
You can do it anywhere.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.930
Traveling for work,
whatever you've got to do,

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.891
you've just got to take some
running clothes and running

00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:51.390
shoes.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:52.930
It's easy to pack.

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:55.650
And that 30, 40
minutes can sustain you

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:56.960
for a long period of time.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.010
Now, if you want
to get into racing,

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.440
then maybe get a
little more technical.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:07.110
But just absolute fitness, I
mean it really is beneficial.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.085
The benefits of
running are incredible.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.365
Yes.

00:52:11.365 --> 00:52:13.240
AUDIENCE: What do you
think of the treadmill?

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.948
BART YASSO: Question
about the treadmill.

00:52:14.948 --> 00:52:15.940
I love the treadmill.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.640
The beauty of the treadmill,
if you use the same treadmill

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.450
in the same type of environment,
the environment doesn't change.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.610
So when you run outside, it's
raining, it's cold, it's windy,

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.230
it's hot, it's cold.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.415
And your body changes based
on what your body likes.

00:52:31.415 --> 00:52:32.830
If you're running
on a treadmill,

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.204
it's usually the
same temperature

00:52:34.204 --> 00:52:37.890
whether it's in a garage or in a
fitness center, whatever it is.

00:52:38.826 --> 00:52:41.450
And if you tend to use the same
treadmill, because some of them

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.110
are programmed differently, you
can actually see improvement

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.165
because it's right there.

00:52:46.165 --> 00:52:47.540
The numbers are
staring you right

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.560
in the face the whole
time you're running.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.070
We tend to run a little
faster on a treadmill

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.910
than we would outside,
because everyone's

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.139
staring at you because
you're at the gym.

00:52:58.139 --> 00:53:00.680
And you don't want to be thrown
off the back of the treadmill

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.260
so you tend to put those
numbers, that speed up

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.050
a little too high
and kind of look

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:06.280
good for everyone in the gym.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.310
It's just human nature.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:11.300
But some people have run
very well, very fast,

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.010
off of treadmill training.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.640
And it's a great--
I hope we don't

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.240
have any winter like
we had last year.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.720
People lived on the treadmill.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.804
All I saw on my Twitter feed was
the devil's-- they called it--

00:53:23.804 --> 00:53:24.970
they had all kinds of names.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:28.880
The deadmill, the devil's--
I forget all the names now,

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.191
but oh.

00:53:30.191 --> 00:53:34.800
People were used to getting
on the treadmill maybe 15

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.230
times over the winter because
of snow or stuff like that.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.810
Now they were on it every day,
and it was driving them crazy

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.580
because it is not the
most exciting thing to do.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.750
But it is really a good
way to test yourself

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.670
to use on that quality workout.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.760
Because like I said, the
environment's the same.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.060
You set that speed
that doesn't change.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.650
So you can use it and
try to improve and record

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.520
those workouts.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.770
And it's a good device.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.450
And it does help on those foul
weather days or cold days.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.190
I used to love to
run in the cold.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.590
I would go out and run 25
miles and come back with ice

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:10.320
everywhere on your face.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:10.891
I loved it.

00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:11.390
Now?

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.840
I fire up a cup of coffee
and look out the window.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.377
Hope to see a runner go
by, wait until it warms up,

00:54:19.377 --> 00:54:21.210
and maybe go out and
run two or three miles.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.740
Nothing like I did
in the old days.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.660
That cold weather
bothers me these days,

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.640
but it didn't faze me early on.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.870
But the treadmill's
a good thing.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.062
Use it to your advantage.

00:54:31.062 --> 00:54:32.020
And it's a smart thing.

00:54:34.632 --> 00:54:35.465
Any other questions?

00:54:37.281 --> 00:54:40.340
Well, I hope those books
arrive from Rodale.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.892
I don't know what happened
with the FedEx thing,

00:54:42.892 --> 00:54:43.850
but I hope they arrive.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:48.000
And good luck to everyone racing
in this fall in a marathon,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.400
or people just starting out.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.370
It's a great sport.

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.600
It's an enjoyable sport.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.810
Keep it fun.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:55.064
Thank you.

00:54:55.064 --> 00:54:56.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:56.832 --> 00:54:57.720
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.350
Thank you, Bart.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.900
Appreciate it.
