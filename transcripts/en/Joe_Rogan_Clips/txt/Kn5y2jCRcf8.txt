Speaker 1:          00:00          Now as a journalist when you see shit like that that has got to hit home. Oh yeah. The last few years for, for journalist, especially if your, I mean he wasn't an American citizen, but he did write for the Washington Post and was a resident. But, but I mean I was, I was, I was arrested in Iran for a week, a long, long time ago and roughly the same time and Iranian Canadian photographer was arrested and she was raped and beaten to death. So the people that are citizens of these countries there, they're really, really bearing the brunt. Um, and again, that's why I'm uncomfortable if people call me brave because I get to come home with these guys, you know, they can get to them and they can get to their families very easily. And that, that takes a whole other level of bravery. And the woman who was raped and beaten to death, what was she involved with?

Speaker 1:          00:46          What happens? Photographer. She was just taking pictures of, yeah. Yeah. And the usual thing with, I mean, certainly we in Iran, but this is common all over the place. Um, if you're a dual citizen working as a journalist in for example, around they'll accuse you of being a spy. I was accused of being a spy. They tried to get me to confess to being a spy. That's a very normal assumption out there. And how long were you in jail for? Just seven or eight days. He was out like actually not, not too bad. I mean psychologically it was bad because they were threatening torture and execution. Um, physically it wasn't, it wasn't too bad. I was fed. Um, I had a bad bed that was roughed up a bit. I wasn't, I wasn't beaten. Um, but I did think it could last months and months and months and I did think I could go to Evin prison.

Speaker 1:          01:26          They actually put me in a car and drove me to what they said was ever in prison once and then just took me somewhere else. Evan prison, even prisoners where people have been tortured and executed. So they just drove you there are scarier. Drove me around for a few hours to scare me and then took me to another place here. What were they trying to get you to confess to the being a spy? And they said, at one point they said, uh, do you honestly expect us to believe you travel the world collecting all this information and you don't share it with your government? I said, yeah, that's exactly how it works. And they thought I was insulting their intelligence by, by saying that. What were you over there covering? We were, I did a series. One of the first series I did was called holidays in the access of evil.

Speaker 1:          02:03          So I spent my first four years as a journalist undercover wearing a secret camera. And Luckily I appeared on a couple of docs with the guy who was not very good. And so I looked genuine next to him. Um, so the control to BBC Two said, give this guy a series. And I was racking my brains trying to think. I wanted to be a foreign correspondent and wanting to cover conflict than George Bush made the axis of evil speech. And John Bolton added three countries to the list. So it was Iraq, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea. Uh, Libya, Cuba with a six evil countries. So we went to all six countries. Me and one camera man held out handheld camera chain, actually saw it and that's when he first reached out. And I started talking to vice about eventually joining them, but kind of documentaries from the streets up to, we're just trying to say, you know, despite all the rhetoric about Iran, this is what the people are actually like.

Speaker 1:          02:55          And it was, it was kind of youth led. We, we interviewed a bunch of students who are involved in some famous protests in 1999 where the police came in and smashed the dormitory and burned them down and beat them. I think because we interviewed them, we were then tracked in and arrested. Oh, so how'd you get it free? How did I get, how'd you get free? Uh, it's, I didn't know at the time, but if to come 10 countries have diplomatic relations. It's only a big deal after a week. So on the night of the seventh day or the, or the eighth day, they, they let me go. Oh yeah. But I had no idea. At the time. I thought, I thought this could go on months and months. A month now when you were over there in around what is their perception of the United States when you're talking to the young people over there?

Speaker 1:          03:37          Oh, uh, love the United States real music culture, sports, everything and over extremely well educated about the United States. Um, American foreign policy is a completely different discussion, but I mean, one of the things we tried to cover was the Friday rally at Tehran University where you see everyone chanting death to America, death to Israel and we wanted to cover it because they bus in old men from the countryside who sent their guy. Yeah. Death to America. Death to Israel. Real. It's not something to be seeking some propaganda. Staged event. Yeah. I mean if there was a turning point in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and with Iran, Ryan Crocker, who was the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan, s straight off the nine 11, he was sent to Geneva where a number of countries affected by the refugee crisis. We're meeting to discuss how to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          04:28          One of the countries that are wrong, so that have this meeting. And then he and his Iranian counterpart would disappear for, he says seven or eight hours over tee to discuss the future of American Iran relations. They knew that they were going to get rid of the Taliban. Um, so the Uranian said, okay, here's a map of the Taliban leaders homes. If you take out those homes on day one, Taliban have finished and Ryan Crocker set up, thank you. Can I, can I take notes from this map? They said, the map is yours. We made it for you. Gave him the map. Uh, let the Americans use Iranian airspace, handed over some prisoners. They were absolutely key in us overthrowing the Taliban so quickly. And Ryan Crocker was making good progress. And then talking about the future of Iraq post Sudan one night he gets a knock on his door. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:16          and two of his staff has come in and say, boss, you'll, you'll really not kind of like what's just happened. And he said, what's just happened? And it was the axis of evil speech. So the moderate so-called in Iran who had fought hard to get permission to negotiate with the Great Satan, the u s said, you've made us look stupid. You know, it was hard for us to get this chance. We helped you in Afghanistan. We were willing to discuss future relations between our two countries and, and this is, this is what happens. So it's over why. And then fairly soon after that, obviously there's the invasion of Iraq and Iran is sponsoring the insurgency and giving them sophisticated ids and all that rather than, you know, potentially helping. So you think that with wow, with one speech. Yeah, the whole thing shifted. Yeah. So they would, they would've been willing to somehow or another negotiate or cooperate or I mean at work alongside getting rid of sedan was obviously an in their interests.

Speaker 1:          06:12          You know, they put a brutal eight year that year were with it. We have a very strange relationship with Iran. I mean, going back to the hostages from the Jimmy Carter era. Yep. I buy, I do think it's one of the most misunderstood countries in the region. I mean, when you actually go there, um, you know, that people are so smart and so educated and, and potentially such, such good allies. So what is the key issue? It's the government. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And you know what I just explained and I think they're capable of thing being far more rational than, than the speeches by the crazy odd mullahs what would suggest, Huh? They proved it. Yeah. And the idea that the Saudis and Mrr teas can somehow bomb the WHO sees in Yemen into submission and push back Iranian influence on their southern border is, is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          07:00          That's just never going to happen. Um, and, and I think even if you ignore the obvious moral argument, um, just from a pragmatic point of view, the idea that we should back this, um, unconditionally is, is ridiculous. Let's see. This is just part of the real problem when you're dealing with world advanced, is trying to parse all this stuff out and look at so many different stories from so many different parts of the world in so many different areas of conflict. And it's almost impossible to pay attention to it all. Yeah. Every time I meet people from these countries, I'm, I, I'm, I feel like a fraud because there's so much that they know that I don't know and I shouldn't. Right. Um, and you know, I get paid to do this and I get paid to pay attention to this for a living and I feel out of my depth regularly and that's focusing on the five or six countries that I focused on, let alone everything else. What other countries do you focus on? Uh, I mean, the last few years has been Congo quite a bit. Afghanistan, mostly Iraq, Yemen, I focused on a lot of the last three, four years. Um, they're the main ones. I've been to Brazil recently, been to Central African Republic recently that, but Nah.
