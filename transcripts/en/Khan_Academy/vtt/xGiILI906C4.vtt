00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.110
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.240
we were focused on surface
two, this blue kind of outside,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.020
or I guess the blue side of our
little kind of chopped cylinder

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.240
that we were dealing with.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.670
And we found a decent
parametrization.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.170
And then given that
parametrization,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.400
we were able to come up
with dS for that surface,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.480
for surface two.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.060
It just simplified, all this
business simplified to 1.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.670
So it just equalled du dv.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.787
And so now we are ready to
evaluate the surface integral.

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:29.370
This surface integral
right over here.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.150
We're ready to evaluate
the surface integral

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.280
over surface two of zdS.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.200
And it's going to be equal to
a double integral over u and v.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.890
So let's write this.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.080
I'm going to do two
different colors

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.230
for the different
variables of integration.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.950
So yellow for one and
maybe purple for the other.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.720
And we're taking
the integral of z.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.200
And in our parametrization,
z is equal to v.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.599
So this right over here
is the same thing as v.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.520
So we can write v
right over there.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.050
And we already saw that dS
is the same thing as du dv.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.270
Or we could even
write that is dv du.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.930
We could just switch the
order right over there.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.300
And I'm going to choose to
integrate with respect to dv

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.670
first, to do dv on
the inside integral,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.150
and then do du on
the outside integral.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.420
And the reason why I'm choosing
to integrate with respect to v

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.350
first is based on the
bounds of our parameters.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.505
v is bounded on
the low end by 0.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.060
But on the high
end, it's bounded

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.290
by essentially a function of u.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.351
Its upper bound changes.

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.100
Because you see right
over here, depending

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.590
where we are, depending on what
our x value is, essentially

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
we have a different height
that we need to get to.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.430
And since it's a
function of u, we

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.090
can integrate with respect to
v. Our boundaries are going

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.090
to be 0 and 1 minus cosine of u.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.860
This, all of this
business in magenta,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980
will give us a function of u.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.350
And then we'll be able to
integrate with respect to u.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.250
And u just goes from 0 to 2 pi.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.620
So that will give us a nice
straightforward number,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.790
assuming all of
this works out OK.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.250
And so this is simplified to
a straight-up double integral.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280
And now we're ready to compute.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.050
And so let me write
the outside part.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.820
The outside part is
from 0 to 2 pi, is du.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.780
And so the inside part,
the antiderivative of v

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.520
is v squared over 2.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.060
And we're going to evaluate that
from 0 to 1 minus cosine of u.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.330
And so this is going to
be equal to, once again,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.120
the outside integral is 0 2 pi.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.130
I'll write du right over here.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.370
And so this is going to
be equal to all of this.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.480
Let me just write 1/2.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.521
And, actually, I can even
write the 1/2 out here.

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:06.280
I'll just write 1/2 times
1 minus cosine u squared.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.160
Well that's just going to be 1
squared minus 2 times a product

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.780
of both of these, so
minus 2 cosine of u.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.370
Actually, let me give myself
a little bit more real estate

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.870
here.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.810
1 minus 2 cosine of
u plus cosine of u

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.000
squared minus this
thing evaluated at 0,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.150
which is just going to be 0.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.990
So we just get that
right over there.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.580
And then we have du.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.570
And so now we can evaluate this.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.450
We can integrate this
with respect to u.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.322
So let's do that.

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:48.780
So the answer--
and I'll just-- let

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.430
me just take the
1/2 on the outside

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.540
just to simplify things.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.410
So we have the 1/2 out here.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.050
And so if you take
the antiderivative

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.810
of this with respect to u, you
still have this 1/2 out front.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.210
So this is equal to 1/2.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.000
And we're going to take
the antiderivative.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.092
So let's do it carefully.

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:07.050
Actually let me just
simplify it so it's easier

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.830
to take the antiderivative.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.950
So it's going to be
1/2 times the integral.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.310
I'll break this up into
three different integrals.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.529
1/2 times the integral
from 0 to 2 pi

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:28.710
of 1 du, which is just du minus
2 times the integral from 0

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.570
to 2 pi of cosine of u du.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.640
That's this term
right over here.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.280
Plus the integral from 0 to
2 pi of cosine squared u.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.850
And cosine squared
u, it's not so

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580
easy to take the
antiderivative of that.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.850
So we'll use one of
our trig identities.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.399
I always forget the formal name.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:51.190
I just think of it as
the one that takes us

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.170
from cosine squared
to cosine of 2u.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.860
So this trig identity,
this thing right over here

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.990
is the same thing.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.580
This comes straight out
of our trigonometry class.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:11.050
This is 1/2 plus 1/2
cosine of 2 theta,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.720
or I should say [? dot ?]
theta, cosine of 2u.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.380
So this last integral
right over here,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.010
I can rewrite it as, I'll just
rewrite in that same color,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.680
actually.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.720
1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of 2u.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.860
And then we have our final du.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.810
And now let me
close the brackets.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.326
And all of that is times 1/2.

00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:38.450
So this thing right over
here, cosine of squared u,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.840
just a trig identity,
takes us to that.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.420
Now this is pretty
easy to evaluate.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.960
The antiderivative
of this is just

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.090
going to be u evaluated
at 2 pi and 0.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.300
So it, essentially-- let
me just write it out.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.190
This part right
over here is just

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.430
u evaluated from 0 to 2 pi.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.340
It's 2 pi minus 0.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.340
It just gets evaluated
and we get 2 pi.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.160
So out front, you have your
1/2 and then times 2 pi.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.010
And then this right over
here, the antiderivative,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.490
this is going to
be equal to minus 2

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.860
times the antiderivative
of cosine of u.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.210
Well that's just sine of u
evaluated from 0 to 2 pi.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.680
Well sine of 2 pi is 0.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.120
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.380
So this whole thing is
going to evaluate to 0.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.590
So we could say minus 0.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.410
And then we take
the antiderivative

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.620
of this right over here.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.780
The antiderivative
of this is going

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.970
to be-- the antiderivative
of 1/2 is 1/2 u.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.290
And the antiderivative
of 1/2 cosine of 2u,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.330
well if we had a 2
out front here, then

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.400
that would be the
derivative of sine of 2u.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.710
But we don't have a 2 out here.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.954
But we can add a 2.

00:06:53.954 --> 00:06:55.370
Let me actually
write it this way.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.109
We can add a 2 right over
here, and then divide by a 2.

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:03.400
We can add a 2-- and that's
a little bit too confusing.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.630
Let me make it very clear.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:13.880
1/2 cosine of 2u is
equal to 1/2 times 1/2--

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:21.310
let me write it this way-- is
equal to 1/4 times 2 cosine 2u.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.100
These are the exact
same quantities.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.950
And the reason why I wrote it
this way is this is clearly--

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.240
this is the derivative
of sine of 2u.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.680
So when you take the
antiderivative of this,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.170
it's the same thing
as plus-- do it

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:43.170
in that same color--
plus 1/4 sine of 2u.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.200
And we're going to evaluate
that from 0 to 2 pi.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.797
And you could
confirm for yourself.

00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:50.130
You take the derivative of this.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.190
You do the chain rule.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.570
You get the 2 out front.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.060
2 times 1/4 gives you 1/2.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.560
And the derivative of sine
of 2u with respect to 2u

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.410
is cosine of 2u.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.160
Now we need to evaluate
this at 2 pi and at 0.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.720
When you evaluate it at 2 pi,
you get have 1/2 times 2 pi,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.960
which is pi.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.970
So this is plus pi plus 1/4
times sine of 2 times 2 pi,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.560
sine of 4 pi.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.643
That's just going to be 0.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.580
So this is going
to evaluate to 0.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.310
And then minus 1/2 times 0.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.732
And then 1/4 sine of 2 times 0.

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.690
This is all going to be
0 when you put 0 there.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.480
So this whole thing
of value is just 2 pi.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.920
And we're in the home stretch
at least for surface two.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.370
And I'll switch back to
surface two's color now,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.058
now that we're near the end.

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:37.520
So this, the surface
integral for surface two

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.570
is just going to be 1/2
times 2 pi minus 0 plus pi.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.482
So it's 1/2 times 3 pi,
which is equal to-- we

00:08:48.482 --> 00:08:50.690
can have our drum roll, or
I guess our mini drum roll

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.650
since we're not really done with
the entire problem right now.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.970
But it's equal to 3 pi over 2.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.600
So we're making
pretty good headway.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.780
This was 0.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.330
And now this part right
over here is 3 pi over 2.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.560
And in the next video we will
try to tackle surface three.
