on so next up we're going to dive in

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:30.940
on so next up we're going to dive in

Andrew hi everyone so let's imagine that

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:43.510
Andrew hi everyone so let's imagine that
 

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.540
Andrew hi everyone so let's imagine that
you've got an existing app and you'd

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:45.550
you've got an existing app and you'd
 

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.140
you've got an existing app and you'd
like to add an mp4 player to that app so

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.150
like to add an mp4 player to that app so
 

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.550
like to add an mp4 player to that app so
just showing a simple video in your

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560
just showing a simple video in your
 

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.590
just showing a simple video in your
existing app I'm going to go through the

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600
existing app I'm going to go through the
 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.180
existing app I'm going to go through the
minimal changes that you would need to

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.190
minimal changes that you would need to
 

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.330
minimal changes that you would need to
make to use exoplayer so the first step

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.340
make to use exoplayer so the first step
 

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.920
make to use exoplayer so the first step
is going to be to add a dependency on

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:58.930
is going to be to add a dependency on
 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.610
is going to be to add a dependency on
exoplayer

00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.620
exoplayer
 

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.320
exoplayer
and there are two main options here you

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.330
and there are two main options here you
 

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.480
and there are two main options here you
can either bring in the whole of the

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
can either bring in the whole of the
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.060
can either bring in the whole of the
exoplayer library and that will include

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.070
exoplayer library and that will include
 

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.160
exoplayer library and that will include
support for adaptive streaming formats

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.170
support for adaptive streaming formats
 

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.320
support for adaptive streaming formats
like - an HLS and for that you can use

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:10.330
like - an HLS and for that you can use
 

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.740
like - an HLS and for that you can use
this line in your build up Gradle file

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:12.750
this line in your build up Gradle file
 

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.210
this line in your build up Gradle file
this is kind of the kitchen sink option

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:15.220
this is kind of the kitchen sink option
 

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.550
this is kind of the kitchen sink option
so the alternative is that you can just

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560
so the alternative is that you can just
 

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.230
so the alternative is that you can just
pick and choose the specific modules

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240
pick and choose the specific modules
 

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.780
pick and choose the specific modules
from the XO per library that you need so

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:21.790
from the XO per library that you need so
 

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.250
from the XO per library that you need so
for this example I'm going to add a

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.260
for this example I'm going to add a
 

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.380
for this example I'm going to add a
dependency on the core library which

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:25.390
dependency on the core library which
 

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.300
dependency on the core library which
contains the main file obviously and

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:27.310
contains the main file obviously and
 

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.730
contains the main file obviously and
also support for regular media files

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:29.740
also support for regular media files
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.180
also support for regular media files
like mp4s and mp3s and there's also a

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.190
like mp4s and mp3s and there's also a
 

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.700
like mp4s and mp3s and there's also a
dependency here on the UI library which

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:35.710
dependency here on the UI library which
 

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.010
dependency here on the UI library which
we which brings in simple exoplayer view

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:38.020
we which brings in simple exoplayer view
 

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.130
we which brings in simple exoplayer view
which is a minimal that customizable

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.140
which is a minimal that customizable
 

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.840
which is a minimal that customizable
player that you've a player view that

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:42.850
player that you've a player view that
 

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.130
player that you've a player view that
you can put in your app ok so once we've

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.140
you can put in your app ok so once we've
 

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.780
you can put in your app ok so once we've
added the dependencies the next step is

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:48.790
added the dependencies the next step is
 

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.640
added the dependencies the next step is
to add some code snippets to your

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:50.650
to add some code snippets to your
 

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.700
to add some code snippets to your
activity which will create a player and

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:53.710
activity which will create a player and
 

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.090
activity which will create a player and
use it so we have this exoplayer Factory

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.100
use it so we have this exoplayer Factory
 

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.510
use it so we have this exoplayer Factory
which has several methods for creating

00:10:59.510 --> 00:10:59.520
which has several methods for creating
 

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.190
which has several methods for creating
player instances and this is the easiest

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200
player instances and this is the easiest
 

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.630
player instances and this is the easiest
to use one it takes the context

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640
to use one it takes the context
 

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.420
to use one it takes the context
a track selector and for this simple use

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.430
a track selector and for this simple use
 

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.890
a track selector and for this simple use
case we can use the default track

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:08.900
case we can use the default track
 

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.470
case we can use the default track
selector which has sensible defaults for

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480
selector which has sensible defaults for
 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.680
selector which has sensible defaults for
almost everything you want to do once

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.690
almost everything you want to do once
 

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.360
almost everything you want to do once
we've created the player the next step

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.370
we've created the player the next step
 

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.130
we've created the player the next step
is to drop a view into your apps layout

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.140
is to drop a view into your apps layout
 

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.950
is to drop a view into your apps layout
and then bind it to the player by

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:20.960
and then bind it to the player by
 

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.700
and then bind it to the player by
calling the set player method now most

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:24.710
calling the set player method now most
 

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.410
calling the set player method now most
importantly we need to tell the player

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:26.420
importantly we need to tell the player
 

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.780
importantly we need to tell the player
exactly what we want to play and for

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:28.790
exactly what we want to play and for
 

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.070
exactly what we want to play and for
this we're going to use a media source

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:30.080
this we're going to use a media source
 

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.620
this we're going to use a media source
in EXO player everything that you can

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:32.630
in EXO player everything that you can
 

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.990
in EXO player everything that you can
play is a media source it's responsible

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000
play is a media source it's responsible
 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.700
play is a media source it's responsible
for loading the media and providing it

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:36.710
for loading the media and providing it
 

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.670
for loading the media and providing it
to the player so we're going to create

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680
to the player so we're going to create
 

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.770
to the player so we're going to create
an extract a media source which has

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:41.780
an extract a media source which has
 

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.230
an extract a media source which has
support for regular media files like mp4

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240
support for regular media files like mp4
 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.830
support for regular media files like mp4
mp3s and matroska files and so on so you

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:47.840
mp3s and matroska files and so on so you
 

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.480
mp3s and matroska files and so on so you
passed that to the prepare method and

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:49.490
passed that to the prepare method and
 

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.490
passed that to the prepare method and
then we call set play when ready to tell

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.500
then we call set play when ready to tell
 

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.020
then we call set play when ready to tell
the player that as soon as buffering is

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.030
the player that as soon as buffering is
 

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.120
the player that as soon as buffering is
completed and playback can begin then

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.130
completed and playback can begin then
 

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.260
completed and playback can begin then
say that should start

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.270
say that should start
 

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.190
say that should start
and finally it's very important that you

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200
and finally it's very important that you
 

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.410
and finally it's very important that you
release the player when playback is

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:02.420
release the player when playback is
 

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.750
release the player when playback is
complete because the player holds system

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760
complete because the player holds system
 

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.760
complete because the player holds system
resources like codecs and it uses memory

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:06.770
resources like codecs and it uses memory
 

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.940
resources like codecs and it uses memory
for bottles so these code snippets would

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:09.950
for bottles so these code snippets would
 

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.290
for bottles so these code snippets would
generally go in activity lifecycle

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:11.300
generally go in activity lifecycle
 

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:17.770
generally go in activity lifecycle
methods in your app okay so this is a

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:17.780
methods in your app okay so this is a
 

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.020
methods in your app okay so this is a
video of what you get got a nice video

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.030
video of what you get got a nice video
 

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.440
video of what you get got a nice video
of the skyline of London and and you can

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:23.450
of the skyline of London and and you can
 

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.420
of the skyline of London and and you can
see there that it had basic playback

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.430
see there that it had basic playback
 

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.520
see there that it had basic playback
controls like play and pause button and

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.530
controls like play and pause button and
 

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.760
controls like play and pause button and
a sequel so if you'd like to try this

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:30.770
a sequel so if you'd like to try this
 

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.290
a sequel so if you'd like to try this
out and there's a codelab

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:32.300
out and there's a codelab
 

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.360
out and there's a codelab
being published as part of i/o which you

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.370
being published as part of i/o which you
 

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.670
being published as part of i/o which you
can go and try out and there's also a

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680
can go and try out and there's also a
 

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.290
can go and try out and there's also a
developer guide on our project page

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:38.300
developer guide on our project page
 

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.730
developer guide on our project page
which will walk you through these steps

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:41.740
which will walk you through these steps
 

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.680
which will walk you through these steps
ok so as I mentioned everything that you

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:44.690
ok so as I mentioned everything that you
 

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.350
ok so as I mentioned everything that you
can play is a media source and it's

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360
can play is a media source and it's
 

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.060
can play is a media source and it's
responsible for loading media for the

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.070
responsible for loading media for the
 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.670
responsible for loading media for the
player and we in that example we use the

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680
player and we in that example we use the
 

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.050
player and we in that example we use the
extractor media source but there are

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.060
extractor media source but there are
 

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.760
extractor media source but there are
actually other more advanced media

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:54.770
actually other more advanced media
 

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.720
actually other more advanced media
sources available so you may have heard

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:58.730
sources available so you may have heard
 

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.240
sources available so you may have heard

streaming which allows for adaptation
between qualities to handle varying

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.420
between qualities to handle varying
 

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.480
between qualities to handle varying
network conditions and we provide -

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.490
network conditions and we provide -
 

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.260
network conditions and we provide -
media source so support for - we also

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.270
media source so support for - we also
 

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.810
media source so support for - we also
have a HLS media source for supporting

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:13.820
have a HLS media source for supporting
 

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.689
have a HLS media source for supporting
HTTP Live Streaming

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:15.699
HTTP Live Streaming
 

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:18.629
HTTP Live Streaming
and a media source of Smooth Streaming

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639
and a media source of Smooth Streaming
 

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.349
and a media source of Smooth Streaming
and with our recent v2 release we've

00:13:22.349 --> 00:13:22.359
and with our recent v2 release we've
 

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:24.869
and with our recent v2 release we've
also added a new category of media

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:24.879
also added a new category of media
 

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:26.369
also added a new category of media
sources which are designed for

00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:26.379
sources which are designed for
 

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:28.559
sources which are designed for
composition and by composition we mean

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:28.569
composition and by composition we mean
 

00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:31.679
composition and by composition we mean
joining together other media sources why

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:31.689
joining together other media sources why
 

00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:32.970
joining together other media sources why
would we want to do this well I'll go

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:32.980
would we want to do this well I'll go
 

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.650
would we want to do this well I'll go
through an example so let's say we've

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:34.660
through an example so let's say we've
 

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.409
through an example so let's say we've
got a video that we want to play and

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:37.419
got a video that we want to play and
 

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:39.210
got a video that we want to play and
also some subtitles which are in a

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.220
also some subtitles which are in a
 

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.840
also some subtitles which are in a
separate file and SRT file in that case

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:42.850
separate file and SRT file in that case
 

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.090
separate file and SRT file in that case
we can create an extractor media source

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.100
we can create an extractor media source
 

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.929
we can create an extractor media source
to load the video a single sample media

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:48.939
to load the video a single sample media
 

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:50.819
to load the video a single sample media
source which is going to load the SRT

00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:50.829
source which is going to load the SRT
 

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:53.159
source which is going to load the SRT
file and then we're going to play the

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:53.169
file and then we're going to play the
 

00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:55.650
file and then we're going to play the
the subtitles alongside the video now

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.660
the subtitles alongside the video now
 

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.299
the subtitles alongside the video now
you could try and do this yourself by

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:57.309
you could try and do this yourself by
 

00:13:57.309 --> 00:13:58.679
you could try and do this yourself by
looking at the player position and

00:13:58.679 --> 00:13:58.689
looking at the player position and
 

00:13:58.689 --> 00:14:00.900
looking at the player position and
synchronizing the playback position with

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:00.910
synchronizing the playback position with
 

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.609
synchronizing the playback position with
the subtitles that you're showing but

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:02.619
the subtitles that you're showing but
 

00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:04.079
the subtitles that you're showing but
this is actually quite difficult to do

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:04.089
this is actually quite difficult to do
 

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:06.900
this is actually quite difficult to do
in general it's much easier to use a

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:06.910
in general it's much easier to use a
 

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.419
in general it's much easier to use a
merging media source and the merging

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:09.429
merging media source and the merging
 

00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:11.699
merging media source and the merging
media source just takes the video you

00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:11.709
media source just takes the video you
 

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:13.199
media source just takes the video you
want to play in the subtitles and

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:13.209
want to play in the subtitles and
 

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:15.599
want to play in the subtitles and
handles everything for you and so we'll

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:15.609
handles everything for you and so we'll
 

00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:17.939
handles everything for you and so we'll
handle synchronization and then they'll

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:17.949
handle synchronization and then they'll
 

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:22.439
handle synchronization and then they'll
be shown in the player another time you

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:22.449
be shown in the player another time you
 

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:26.129
be shown in the player another time you
use composition is for playlists and so

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:26.139
use composition is for playlists and so
 

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:29.009
use composition is for playlists and so
in this case you have say you have an

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:29.019
in this case you have say you have an
 

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:30.900
in this case you have say you have an
album of mp3s that you want to play

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:30.910
album of mp3s that you want to play
 

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.169
album of mp3s that you want to play
backs back and you could try and do this

00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:34.179
backs back and you could try and do this
 

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:37.199
backs back and you could try and do this
yourself by playing the first screen and

00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:37.209
yourself by playing the first screen and
 

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.789
yourself by playing the first screen and
then swapping out the source for the

00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:38.799
then swapping out the source for the
 

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:39.359
then swapping out the source for the
next one

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:39.369
next one
 

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:40.949
next one
but that's not going to be great because

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959
but that's not going to be great because
 

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:43.259
but that's not going to be great because
the player is going to buffer when you

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:43.269
the player is going to buffer when you
 

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.650
the player is going to buffer when you
swap out the source so we've added a

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.660
swap out the source so we've added a
 

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.549
swap out the source so we've added a
concatenated media source which takes a

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:50.559
concatenated media source which takes a
 

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.319
concatenated media source which takes a
list of sources that you want to combine

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:52.329
list of sources that you want to combine
 

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:54.720
list of sources that you want to combine
together and then play them back back

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:54.730
together and then play them back back
 

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.449
together and then play them back back
with a consistent buffering policy so if

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:57.459
with a consistent buffering policy so if
 

00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:58.710
with a consistent buffering policy so if
you tell the player to have three

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720
you tell the player to have three
 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.419
you tell the player to have three
seconds of media buffered at all times

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:00.429
seconds of media buffered at all times
 

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.309
seconds of media buffered at all times
then it will ensure that that is the

00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:02.319
then it will ensure that that is the
 

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:04.229
then it will ensure that that is the
case even across transitions from one

00:15:04.229 --> 00:15:04.239
case even across transitions from one
 

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:06.479
case even across transitions from one
source to the next and it also supports

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:06.489
source to the next and it also supports
 

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.489
source to the next and it also supports
capless playback metadata so you can

00:15:08.489 --> 00:15:08.499
capless playback metadata so you can
 

00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:10.559
capless playback metadata so you can
play that album of mp3s with completely

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:10.569
play that album of mp3s with completely
 

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:14.970
play that album of mp3s with completely
seamless playback and and also

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:14.980
seamless playback and and also
 

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.769
seamless playback and and also
composition is very flexible so we can

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:16.779
composition is very flexible so we can
 

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:18.359
composition is very flexible so we can
combine those two examples that we saw

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:18.369
combine those two examples that we saw
 

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:21.509
combine those two examples that we saw
so we can concatenate a video with the

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519
so we can concatenate a video with the
 

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.039
so we can concatenate a video with the
merged source that we created earlier

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:23.049
merged source that we created earlier
 

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:24.740
merged source that we created earlier
that had subtitles

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:24.750
that had subtitles
 

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.869
that had subtitles
and if you do that this is what you're

00:15:26.869 --> 00:15:26.879
and if you do that this is what you're
 

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:29.269
and if you do that this is what you're
going to get so the first video plays

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279
going to get so the first video plays
 

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.999
going to get so the first video plays
and then when the first video completes

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:32.009
and then when the first video completes
 

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:33.800
and then when the first video completes
we get a seamless transition to the next

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:33.810
we get a seamless transition to the next
 

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.689
we get a seamless transition to the next
video and you can see the subtitles are

00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699
video and you can see the subtitles are
 

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:41.150
video and you can see the subtitles are
coming up as we'd expect there okay so

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160
coming up as we'd expect there okay so
 

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.759
coming up as we'd expect there okay so
this is great we can play these

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:42.769
this is great we can play these
 

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:47.179
this is great we can play these
compositions of media but then so we

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:47.189
compositions of media but then so we
 

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:48.470
compositions of media but then so we
implemented this and then we thought

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480
implemented this and then we thought
 

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.230
implemented this and then we thought
hold on a moment we've got this speak to

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240
hold on a moment we've got this speak to
 

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.600
hold on a moment we've got this speak to
you method on the player but now we've

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.610
you method on the player but now we've
 

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.819
you method on the player but now we've
got playlists that we want to play back

00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:55.829
got playlists that we want to play back
 

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:58.069
got playlists that we want to play back
that have multiple sources and a

00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079
that have multiple sources and a
 

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.689
that have multiple sources and a
timestamp is not really enough

00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699
timestamp is not really enough
 

00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:01.189
timestamp is not really enough
information to know where you want to

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199
information to know where you want to
 

00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:04.999
information to know where you want to
speak to you anymore so and we thought

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:05.009
speak to you anymore so and we thought
 

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:06.319
speak to you anymore so and we thought
about this and we thought about other

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:06.329
about this and we thought about other
 

00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:07.999
about this and we thought about other
types of media source you won't want to

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:08.009
types of media source you won't want to
 

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.309
types of media source you won't want to
play like live media sources and we

00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319
play like live media sources and we
 

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:11.809
play like live media sources and we
realized that we really need a way to

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:11.819
realized that we really need a way to
 

00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:15.499
realized that we really need a way to
and expose to the app the structure of

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:15.509
and expose to the app the structure of
 

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:17.240
and expose to the app the structure of
the media source and what media is

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
the media source and what media is
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.949
the media source and what media is
available so to solve the issue of

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959
available so to solve the issue of
 

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:24.829
available so to solve the issue of
needing to have a know which source you

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839
needing to have a know which source you
 

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.210
needing to have a know which source you
want to speak in to you we added a

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220
want to speak in to you we added a
 

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.179
want to speak in to you we added a
parameter that tells the player which of

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:29.189
parameter that tells the player which of
 

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:31.160
parameter that tells the player which of
the sources in the playlist you want to

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.170
the sources in the playlist you want to
 

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.179
the sources in the playlist you want to
speak to and and then we thought we're

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:35.189
speak to and and then we thought we're
 

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:36.650
speak to and and then we thought we're
going to need a description of the media

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660
going to need a description of the media
 

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.650
going to need a description of the media
available so we added a new data

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660
available so we added a new data
 

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.840
available so we added a new data
structure called a timeline and a

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:41.850
structure called a timeline and a
 

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.780
structure called a timeline and a
timeline basically is a representation

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:44.790
timeline basically is a representation
 

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.759
timeline basically is a representation
of all the media that is available in a

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:46.769
of all the media that is available in a
 

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:48.590
of all the media that is available in a
media source and it consists of a list

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600
media source and it consists of a list
 

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.019
media source and it consists of a list
of Windows each of those windows

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:51.029
of Windows each of those windows
 

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:52.689
of Windows each of those windows
corresponds to one item in a playlist

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:52.699
corresponds to one item in a playlist
 

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:55.519
corresponds to one item in a playlist
and it describes which parts of the

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:55.529
and it describes which parts of the
 

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:56.960
and it describes which parts of the
media you can seek to at any given

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:56.970
media you can seek to at any given
 

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.939
media you can seek to at any given
moment so I'm going to show an example

00:16:58.939 --> 00:16:58.949
moment so I'm going to show an example
 

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:01.340
moment so I'm going to show an example
of this to make it a bit clearer and so

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:01.350
of this to make it a bit clearer and so
 

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.230
of this to make it a bit clearer and so
let's imagine we've got a single source

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240
let's imagine we've got a single source
 

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.659
let's imagine we've got a single source
where you can see Kenny where the red

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:05.669
where you can see Kenny where the red
 

00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:08.630
where you can see Kenny where the red
line here represents one window the dot

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640
line here represents one window the dot
 

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.419
line here represents one window the dot
at the left hand side represents that

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:11.429
at the left hand side represents that
 

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:13.460
at the left hand side represents that
the default start position for this

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:13.470
the default start position for this
 

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.949
the default start position for this
media source is at zero so when the

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959
media source is at zero so when the
 

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.539
media source is at zero so when the
player reaches this source if it's in a

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:17.549
player reaches this source if it's in a
 

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:19.189
player reaches this source if it's in a
concatenation that it will go to time

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199
concatenation that it will go to time
 

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.770
concatenation that it will go to time
zero and the window extends all the way

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780
zero and the window extends all the way
 

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.370
zero and the window extends all the way
to the duration of the media source more

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380
to the duration of the media source more
 

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.439
to the duration of the media source more
interesting case is if you can catenate

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:27.449
interesting case is if you can catenate
 

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:29.510
interesting case is if you can catenate
two sources together and in this case

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520
two sources together and in this case
 

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.220
two sources together and in this case
you end up with a timeline that has two

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.230
you end up with a timeline that has two
 

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.560
you end up with a timeline that has two
windows and as you can see for both

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:33.570
windows and as you can see for both
 

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.240
windows and as you can see for both
windows the start position is at the

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.250
windows the start position is at the
 

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.390
windows the start position is at the
beginning of that source

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400
beginning of that source
 

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.470
beginning of that source
what about if we have a live media

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480
what about if we have a live media
 

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.800
what about if we have a live media
source well in this case the timeline is

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:42.810
source well in this case the timeline is
 

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.110
source well in this case the timeline is
actually dynamic so as the live event

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120
actually dynamic so as the live event
 

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.330
actually dynamic so as the live event
progresses more media is becoming

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340
progresses more media is becoming
 

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.340
progresses more media is becoming
available in the window and you can see

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.350
available in the window and you can see
 

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.350
available in the window and you can see
that the default position is tracking

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360
that the default position is tracking
 

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.660
that the default position is tracking
the live edge and then when the live

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:53.670
the live edge and then when the live
 

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.490
the live edge and then when the live
event completes the default position

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500
event completes the default position
 

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.160
event completes the default position
snaps back to the beginning and so that

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.170
snaps back to the beginning and so that
 

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.110
snaps back to the beginning and so that
this becomes a regular stream where play

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120
this becomes a regular stream where play
 

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.400
this becomes a regular stream where play
that begins at the beginning and you can

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.410
that begins at the beginning and you can
 

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.080
that begins at the beginning and you can
see - any position and we can build on

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.090
see - any position and we can build on
 

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.030
see - any position and we can build on
top of this to have concatenations of

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.040
top of this to have concatenations of
 

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.770
top of this to have concatenations of
regular streams and live streams and

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780
regular streams and live streams and
 

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.480
regular streams and live streams and
this works in the way you'd expect so

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:11.490
this works in the way you'd expect so
 

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.790
this works in the way you'd expect so
when you concatenate sources you end up

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:13.800
when you concatenate sources you end up
 

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.350
when you concatenate sources you end up
with a timeline that consists of the

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360
with a timeline that consists of the
 

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.300

talk a bit about the internals of the

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740
talk a bit about the internals of the
 

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:51.200
talk a bit about the internals of the
player okay so as Andrew says we're now

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.210
player okay so as Andrew says we're now
 

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.270
player okay so as Andrew says we're now
going to dive in a bit deeper select a

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280
going to dive in a bit deeper select a
 

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.470
going to dive in a bit deeper select a
player and really talk about what

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480
player and really talk about what
 

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.140
player and really talk about what
happens internally during a playback and

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.150
happens internally during a playback and
 

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.490
happens internally during a playback and
the reason that we're going to do list

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500
the reason that we're going to do list
 

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.770
the reason that we're going to do list
of the apps that we've talked about some

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780
of the apps that we've talked about some
 

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.120
of the apps that we've talked about some
of the internal components we're then

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.130
of the internal components we're then
 

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.350
of the internal components we're then
going to go on to talk about how we

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360
going to go on to talk about how we
 

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.530
going to go on to talk about how we
might customize those to very fine tune

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:09.540
might customize those to very fine tune
 

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.160
might customize those to very fine tune
the player to your specific use case so

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.170
the player to your specific use case so
 

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.330
the player to your specific use case so
here we have an extra player and it's

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340
here we have an extra player and it's
 

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.340
here we have an extra player and it's
just received this media source that is

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.350
just received this media source that is
 

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.950
just received this media source that is
going to playback so what are the

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960
going to playback so what are the
 

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.710
going to playback so what are the
important internal components well the

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720
important internal components well the
 

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.600
important internal components well the
first important component that we should

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:23.610
first important component that we should
 

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.660
first important component that we should
mention our renderers a renderer is

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:26.670
mention our renderers a renderer is
 

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.390
mention our renderers a renderer is
responsible for rendering a single

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400
responsible for rendering a single
 

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.030
responsible for rendering a single
component of media so a video renderer

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.040
component of media so a video renderer
 

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.130
component of media so a video renderer
will decode and display just video and

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140
will decode and display just video and
 

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.680
will decode and display just video and
an audio renderer similarly will decode

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:36.690
an audio renderer similarly will decode
 

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.040
an audio renderer similarly will decode
and output just audio and a real

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.050
and output just audio and a real
 

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.240
and output just audio and a real
ex-employer instance will have

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.250
ex-employer instance will have
 

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.470
ex-employer instance will have
additional renderers for things like

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480
additional renderers for things like
 

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.060
additional renderers for things like
text and metadata as well but we're

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.070
text and metadata as well but we're
 

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.350
text and metadata as well but we're
going to emit lows from this diagram

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360
going to emit lows from this diagram
 

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.240
going to emit lows from this diagram
just for simplicity

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.250
just for simplicity
 

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.430
just for simplicity
another component is important is a

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440
another component is important is a
 

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.520
another component is important is a
track selector a media source may

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:53.530
track selector a media source may
 

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.409
track selector a media source may
actually expose multiple tracks that

00:19:55.409 --> 00:19:55.419
actually expose multiple tracks that
 

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:57.590
actually expose multiple tracks that
could be playback by the player

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600
could be playback by the player
 

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.299
could be playback by the player
particularly if you have a - or HLS

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:00.309
particularly if you have a - or HLS
 

00:20:00.309 --> 00:20:01.950
particularly if you have a - or HLS
adaptive playback the media source may

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960
adaptive playback the media source may
 

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.390
adaptive playback the media source may
actually expose multiple video streams

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400
actually expose multiple video streams
 

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.640
actually expose multiple video streams
at different resolutions and maybe

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:05.650
at different resolutions and maybe
 

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.100
at different resolutions and maybe
multiple audio languages as well and

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.110
multiple audio languages as well and
 

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.110
multiple audio languages as well and
it's the job of the track selector to

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120
it's the job of the track selector to
 

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.820
it's the job of the track selector to
select the subset of those tracks so it

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:11.830
select the subset of those tracks so it
 

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.380
select the subset of those tracks so it
should actually buffered and plays by

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:13.390
should actually buffered and plays by
 

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.130
should actually buffered and plays by
the player the last component that we

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.140
the player the last component that we
 

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.950
the player the last component that we
need to talk about is a load control a

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960
need to talk about is a load control a
 

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.260
need to talk about is a load control a
load control actually has two jobs its

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.270
load control actually has two jobs its
 

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.029
load control actually has two jobs its
first job is to tell the media source

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039
first job is to tell the media source
 

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:26.220
first job is to tell the media source
whether it should be buffering at this

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:26.230
whether it should be buffering at this
 

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.220
whether it should be buffering at this
point in time and this is indicated in

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:29.230
point in time and this is indicated in
 

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.840
point in time and this is indicated in
this diagram by the green dots on the

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
this diagram by the green dots on the
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.330
this diagram by the green dots on the
left hand side since we haven't started

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:33.340
left hand side since we haven't started
 

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.950
left hand side since we haven't started
playback yet we don't have anything

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960
playback yet we don't have anything
 

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.659
playback yet we don't have anything
buffered and therefore it's green to

00:20:36.659 --> 00:20:36.669
buffered and therefore it's green to
 

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:38.010
buffered and therefore it's green to
represent the low media source should be

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.020
represent the low media source should be
 

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.490
represent the low media source should be
buffering a second job is to tell the

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.500
buffering a second job is to tell the
 

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.990
buffering a second job is to tell the
player when playback is actually allowed

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000
player when playback is actually allowed
 

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.330
player when playback is actually allowed
to start this is represented by low

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:45.340
to start this is represented by low
 

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.310
to start this is represented by low
right hand side dot and because we don't

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320
right hand side dot and because we don't
 

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.230
right hand side dot and because we don't
have any media yet it's obviously too

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240
have any media yet it's obviously too
 

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.970
have any media yet it's obviously too
soon start playback and therefore is red

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980
soon start playback and therefore is red
 

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.960
soon start playback and therefore is red
one other component that we should

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:54.970
one other component that we should
 

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.960
one other component that we should
mention our data sources media sources

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:57.970
mention our data sources media sources
 

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.909
mention our data sources media sources
use stage sources to load the actual

00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919
use stage sources to load the actual
 

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:02.820
use stage sources to load the actual
media layer I'm going to provide to the

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:02.830
media layer I'm going to provide to the
 

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:08.220
media layer I'm going to provide to the
player for playback ok so I've kind of

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.230
player for playback ok so I've kind of
 

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.620
player for playback ok so I've kind of
given you some major components but

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:10.630
given you some major components but
 

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.450
given you some major components but
let's talk a little bit about how these

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:12.460
let's talk a little bit about how these
 

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.220
let's talk a little bit about how these
components actually interact during a

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.230
components actually interact during a
 

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.470
components actually interact during a
playback

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480
playback
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.060
playback
well we haven't bought anything yet and

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.070
well we haven't bought anything yet and
 

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.890
well we haven't bought anything yet and
load control is telling the media source

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:19.900
load control is telling the media source
 

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.560
load control is telling the media source
that they should be buffering and so the

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:22.570
that they should be buffering and so the
 

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.850
that they should be buffering and so the
media source is going to start loading

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:23.860
media source is going to start loading
 

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.590
media source is going to start loading
data through its data source and after

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600
data through its data source and after
 

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.419
data through its data source and after
it's loaded enough media probably not

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:30.429
it's loaded enough media probably not
 

00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:32.159
it's loaded enough media probably not
very much just the header for a normal

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:32.169
very much just the header for a normal
 

00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:34.710
very much just the header for a normal

media file the media source is going to
 

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.270
media file the media source is going to
be able to work out what tracks that can

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:36.280
be able to work out what tracks that can
 

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.520
be able to work out what tracks that can
actually expose to the player and it

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:38.530
actually expose to the player and it
 

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.020
actually expose to the player and it
does this by exposing something called

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.030
does this by exposing something called
 

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.020
does this by exposing something called
track groups now we know that the track

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.030
track groups now we know that the track
 

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.610
track groups now we know that the track
selector is the thing that's going to

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:44.620
selector is the thing that's going to
 

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.350
selector is the thing that's going to
choose which of the tracks to actually

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360
choose which of the tracks to actually
 

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.600
choose which of the tracks to actually
play when the tag selector needs

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:48.610
play when the tag selector needs
 

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.060
play when the tag selector needs
something else and the reason it needs

something else and the reason it needs
 

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.950
something else and the reason it needs
something else is that different devices

something else is that different devices
 

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.539
something else is that different devices
have different capabilities and in

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:54.549
have different capabilities and in
 

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:56.730
have different capabilities and in
particular the video renderer may only

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:56.740
particular the video renderer may only
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.320
particular the video renderer may only
be able to decode up to a particular

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.330
be able to decode up to a particular
 

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.960
be able to decode up to a particular
resolution and so even if the media

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:00.970
resolution and so even if the media
 

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.070
resolution and so even if the media
source exposes

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080
source exposes
 

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.250
source exposes
a 4k video stream if you're on a low-end

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.260
a 4k video stream if you're on a low-end
 

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.620
a 4k video stream if you're on a low-end
device it's not going to make sense for

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:07.630
device it's not going to make sense for
 

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.000
device it's not going to make sense for
the track selector to actually choose

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.010
the track selector to actually choose
 

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.000
the track selector to actually choose
that stream and the way we represent

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.010
that stream and the way we represent
 

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.130
that stream and the way we represent
these kind of capabilities in the player

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.140
these kind of capabilities in the player
 

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.140
these kind of capabilities in the player
is we have each renderer exposed

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.150
is we have each renderer exposed
 

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.670
is we have each renderer exposed
something called a renderer capabilities

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:17.680
something called a renderer capabilities
 

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.670
something called a renderer capabilities
object that describes specifically what

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:20.680
object that describes specifically what
 

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.300
object that describes specifically what
it's actually able to handle so what

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.310
it's actually able to handle so what
 

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.220
it's actually able to handle so what
happens next is that the track groups

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:26.230
happens next is that the track groups
 

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.870
happens next is that the track groups
and the renderer capabilities are fed

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880
and the renderer capabilities are fed
 

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.940
and the renderer capabilities are fed
into the track selector the track

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:29.950
into the track selector the track
 

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.590
into the track selector the track
selector does it's magic it produces a

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600
selector does it's magic it produces a
 

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.110
selector does it's magic it produces a
selection and that selection goes back

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120
selection and that selection goes back
 

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.800
selection and that selection goes back
to the media source at this point the

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:37.810
to the media source at this point the
 

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.510
to the media source at this point the
media source knows what is going to

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520
media source knows what is going to
 

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.040
media source knows what is going to
buffer because it knows what the track

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.050
buffer because it knows what the track
 

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.530
buffer because it knows what the track
section is and so allocates some buffers

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:43.540
section is and so allocates some buffers
 

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.890
section is and so allocates some buffers
of course we still haven't actually

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:46.900
of course we still haven't actually
 

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.560
of course we still haven't actually
loaded any useful media for playback the

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:49.570
loaded any useful media for playback the
 

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.910
loaded any useful media for playback the
load control is still telling the media

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:50.920
load control is still telling the media
 

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.600
load control is still telling the media
source to lows and therefore the Loken

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:54.610
source to lows and therefore the Loken
 

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.310
source to lows and therefore the Loken
the media source continues to load data

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320
the media source continues to load data
 

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.400
the media source continues to load data
and it starts to fill its buses and what

00:22:59.400 --> 00:22:59.410
and it starts to fill its buses and what
 

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.690
and it starts to fill its buses and what
you can see here is that as soon as

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:00.700
you can see here is that as soon as
 

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.390
you can see here is that as soon as
these buses start to get fill for the

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400
these buses start to get fill for the
 

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.680
these buses start to get fill for the
renderer is actually start consuming

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:04.690
renderer is actually start consuming
 

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.080
renderer is actually start consuming
from those buses and feeding that media

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.090
from those buses and feeding that media
 

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.670
from those buses and feeding that media
data through layer decoders getting

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:08.680
data through layer decoders getting
 

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.000
data through layer decoders getting
ready for playback so at this point we

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.010
ready for playback so at this point we
 

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.670
ready for playback so at this point we
have some media buffers the renders have

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:14.680
have some media buffers the renders have
 

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.410
have some media buffers the renders have
decoded a bit of media filler kind of

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:16.420
decoded a bit of media filler kind of
 

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.380
decoded a bit of media filler kind of
primed and ready to go and so the load

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.390
primed and ready to go and so the load
 

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.060
primed and ready to go and so the load
control may at this point actually start

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.070
control may at this point actually start
 

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.250
control may at this point actually start
the playback so that little red circle

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:23.260
the playback so that little red circle
 

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.860
the playback so that little red circle
has gone green and of course the media

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:25.870
has gone green and of course the media
 

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.220
has gone green and of course the media
source is continuing to buffer and at

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.230
source is continuing to buffer and at
 

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.960
source is continuing to buffer and at
this point we've actually buffered quite

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:30.970
this point we've actually buffered quite
 

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.960
this point we've actually buffered quite
a lot of media so these buses on the

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:33.970
a lot of media so these buses on the
 

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.690
a lot of media so these buses on the
left-hand side are quite for course you

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:36.700
left-hand side are quite for course you
 

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.160
left-hand side are quite for course you
don't want to buffer arbitrarily far

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.170
don't want to buffer arbitrarily far
 

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.440
don't want to buffer arbitrarily far
ahead so a load control may stop

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:40.450
ahead so a load control may stop
 

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.750
ahead so a load control may stop
offering at this point because playbacks

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760
offering at this point because playbacks
 

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.190
offering at this point because playbacks
continuing the renderers are still

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200
continuing the renderers are still
 

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.470
continuing the renderers are still
consuming and therefore these losses of

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480
consuming and therefore these losses of
 

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.520
consuming and therefore these losses of
draining back down to a lower level of

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:50.530
draining back down to a lower level of
 

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.690
draining back down to a lower level of
course you don't want the bosses to run

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:51.700
course you don't want the bosses to run
 

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.250
course you don't want the bosses to run
out so the load control might toggle

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:53.260
out so the load control might toggle
 

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.590
out so the load control might toggle
buffering on it on again and so you see

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600
buffering on it on again and so you see
 

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.240
buffering on it on again and so you see
this pattern emerging of data being

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.250
this pattern emerging of data being
 

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.040
this pattern emerging of data being
pulled through the data source into

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.050
pulled through the data source into
 

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.460
pulled through the data source into
media source and out surrenders one

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:02.470
media source and out surrenders one
 

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.170
media source and out surrenders one
additional complexity to keep in mind

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.180
additional complexity to keep in mind
 

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.550
additional complexity to keep in mind
when you're thinking about this is that

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:05.560
when you're thinking about this is that
 

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.380
when you're thinking about this is that
I've Andrew said that media source can

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:07.390
I've Andrew said that media source can
 

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.420
I've Andrew said that media source can
actually be a concatenation of for

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:09.430
actually be a concatenation of for
 

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.880
actually be a concatenation of for
example different videos and those

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:11.890
example different videos and those
 

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.740
example different videos and those
videos may have a different selection of

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:13.750
videos may have a different selection of
 

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.220
videos may have a different selection of
tracks available

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:15.230
tracks available
 

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.039
tracks available
and so as this process is continuing you

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:18.049
and so as this process is continuing you
 

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:19.539
and so as this process is continuing you
may actually get additional tracks

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:19.549
may actually get additional tracks
 

00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:21.240
may actually get additional tracks
elections taking place at the same time

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.250
elections taking place at the same time
 

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.460
elections taking place at the same time
and so here we have the playback

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:24.470
and so here we have the playback
 

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.039
and so here we have the playback
continuing the bosses are filling up and

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:27.049
continuing the bosses are filling up and
 

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:28.629
continuing the bosses are filling up and
draining down and you see this pattern

00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:28.639
draining down and you see this pattern
 

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:30.730
draining down and you see this pattern
of data being intimate in the irregular

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:30.740
of data being intimate in the irregular
 

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.279
of data being intimate in the irregular
data source and continuously consumed by

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:33.289
data source and continuously consumed by
 

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:40.299
data source and continuously consumed by
the renderers again so now we know a bit

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:40.309
the renderers again so now we know a bit
 

00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:42.549
the renderers again so now we know a bit
about actually how the important

00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559
about actually how the important
 

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:45.940
about actually how the important
components works during a playback let's

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:45.950
components works during a playback let's
 

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.009
components works during a playback let's
talk a little bit about how we might

00:24:48.009 --> 00:24:48.019
talk a little bit about how we might
 

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:52.389
talk a little bit about how we might
customize those internal behaviors so

00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399
customize those internal behaviors so
 

00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:54.549
customize those internal behaviors so
here is a code snippet and we showed you

00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559
here is a code snippet and we showed you
 

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.159
here is a code snippet and we showed you
earlier we're creating an X a player

00:24:57.159 --> 00:24:57.169
earlier we're creating an X a player
 

00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:59.769
earlier we're creating an X a player
with X a player Factory there are

00:24:59.769 --> 00:24:59.779
with X a player Factory there are
 

00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:01.240
with X a player Factory there are
actually more complicated methods for

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.250
actually more complicated methods for
 

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.940
actually more complicated methods for
creating an active player this is one of

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:03.950
creating an active player this is one of
 

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.379
creating an active player this is one of
them and you can see that what we're

00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:05.389
them and you can see that what we're
 

00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:07.539
them and you can see that what we're
injecting into this player instances

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:07.549
injecting into this player instances
 

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:09.490
injecting into this player instances
that are exactly the components that

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:09.500
that are exactly the components that
 

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.870
that are exactly the components that
we've just been talking about so the

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880
we've just been talking about so the
 

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.820
we've just been talking about so the
renderer is a track selector and the

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:12.830
renderer is a track selector and the
 

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.250
renderer is a track selector and the
load control and here we're just

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:14.260
load control and here we're just
 

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.460
load control and here we're just
inserting p4 implementations so let's

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:18.470
inserting p4 implementations so let's
 

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.870
inserting p4 implementations so let's
look at how we might fine tune the

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880
look at how we might fine tune the
 

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.909
look at how we might fine tune the
player by pulling one of those out so

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919
player by pulling one of those out so
 

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.529
player by pulling one of those out so
we'll look at the load control and here

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:23.539
we'll look at the load control and here
 

00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:24.850
we'll look at the load control and here
we're still using the default

load control is saying that it wants

00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:35.299
load control is saying that it wants
 

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:37.360
load control is saying that it wants
between 15 and 30 seconds in the buffer

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:37.370
between 15 and 30 seconds in the buffer
 

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.759
between 15 and 30 seconds in the buffer
and it wants to start playback when

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:39.769
and it wants to start playback when
 

00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:44.350
and it wants to start playback when
there's 2.5 seconds buffett so what does

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360
there's 2.5 seconds buffett so what does

there's 2.5 seconds buffett so what does
that look like in terms of wall clock

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:46.190
that look like in terms of wall clock
 

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.159
that look like in terms of wall clock
time versus duration of media in the

time versus duration of media in the
 

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:50.919
time versus duration of media in the
buffer well the buffer starts to fill in

00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:50.929
buffer well the buffer starts to fill in
 

00:25:50.929 --> 00:25:53.169
buffer well the buffer starts to fill in
at 2.5 seconds we allow playback starts

00:25:53.169 --> 00:25:53.179
at 2.5 seconds we allow playback starts
 

00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:55.210
at 2.5 seconds we allow playback starts
as indicated by the little orange dot

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:55.220
as indicated by the little orange dot
 

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.629
as indicated by the little orange dot
and the load control allows buffering to

00:25:58.629 --> 00:25:58.639
and the load control allows buffering to
 

00:25:58.639 --> 00:26:01.590
and the load control allows buffering to
continue up until 30 seconds

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600
continue up until 30 seconds
 

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.700
continue up until 30 seconds
buffering will then be turned off for a

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:03.710
buffering will then be turned off for a
 

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.230
buffering will then be turned off for a
while and the media source buffers will

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240
while and the media source buffers will
 

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.330
while and the media source buffers will
drain down to 15 seconds which is lower

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:07.340
drain down to 15 seconds which is lower
 

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.070
drain down to 15 seconds which is lower
than it

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080

I'm buffering would then turn on again

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.490
I'm buffering would then turn on again
 

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.159
I'm buffering would then turn on again
and so you get this kind of sawtooth

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:12.169
and so you get this kind of sawtooth
 

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:15.090
and so you get this kind of sawtooth
pattern in terms of buffering behavior

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:15.100
pattern in terms of buffering behavior
 

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.500
pattern in terms of buffering behavior
so at this point is probably quite clear

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:17.510
so at this point is probably quite clear
 

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.210
so at this point is probably quite clear
that you can start to really influence

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.220
that you can start to really influence
 

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.460
that you can start to really influence
this behavior so you could change this

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:21.470
this behavior so you could change this
 

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.529
this behavior so you could change this
number from 15 to 25 if you're not

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:23.539
number from 15 to 25 if you're not
 

00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:24.970
number from 15 to 25 if you're not
comfortable with allowing a buffer to

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:24.980
comfortable with allowing a buffer to
 

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.060
comfortable with allowing a buffer to
drain that low

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.070
drain that low
 

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.610
drain that low
and because we understand how default

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620
and because we understand how default
 

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.800
and because we understand how default
load control works we can show the new

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:30.810
load control works we can show the new
 

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.710
load control works we can show the new
graph so here the buffer is kept more

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720
graph so here the buffer is kept more
 

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.300
graph so here the buffer is kept more
full at all points during the playback

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.310
full at all points during the playback
 

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.850
full at all points during the playback
and buffering is toggled on and off far

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860
and buffering is toggled on and off far
 

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.330
and buffering is toggled on and off far
more frequently we could also decide we

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340
more frequently we could also decide we
 

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.860
more frequently we could also decide we
might want to be more conservative that

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:42.870
might want to be more conservative that
 

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.410
might want to be more conservative that
when we allow playback to start so we

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:45.420
when we allow playback to start so we
 

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.680
when we allow playback to start so we
bump up the value from 2.5 seconds to 10

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:48.690
bump up the value from 2.5 seconds to 10
 

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.170
bump up the value from 2.5 seconds to 10
seconds and again we can understand the

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.180
seconds and again we can understand the
 

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.490
seconds and again we can understand the
difference in terms of this graph we can

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500
difference in terms of this graph we can
 

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.870
difference in terms of this graph we can
now take our modified default load

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880
now take our modified default load
 

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.460
now take our modified default load
control and inject it back into the

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:58.470
control and inject it back into the
 

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.150
control and inject it back into the
player okay so what if default load

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.160
player okay so what if default load
 

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.770

control just isn't flexible enough for

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:03.780
control just isn't flexible enough for
 

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.540
control just isn't flexible enough for
the actual buffering policy that you

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.550
the actual buffering policy that you
 

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.790
the actual buffering policy that you
want where you can go further and you

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:07.800
want where you can go further and you
 

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.290
want where you can go further and you
can just implement your own load control

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:09.300
can just implement your own load control
 

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.680
can just implement your own load control
from scratch so one of the methods that

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:12.690
from scratch so one of the methods that
 

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.150
from scratch so one of the methods that
you have to implement if you do this is

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:14.160
you have to implement if you do this is
 

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.070

returns a boolean is polled during

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:17.970
returns a boolean is polled during
 

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.270
returns a boolean is polled during
playback and this is exactly the method

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:20.280
playback and this is exactly the method
 

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.920
playback and this is exactly the method
that's actually controlling whether the

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:21.930
that's actually controlling whether the
 

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.870
that's actually controlling whether the
media source busses or not and you could

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
media source busses or not and you could
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.330
media source busses or not and you could
implement all kinds of behaviors and

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340
implement all kinds of behaviors and
 

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.220
implement all kinds of behaviors and
logics and your own implementation you

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:31.230
logics and your own implementation you
 

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.600
logics and your own implementation you
can do similar things with the track

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:32.610
can do similar things with the track
 

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.560
can do similar things with the track
selector as well

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:33.570
selector as well
 

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.020
selector as well
so in this case we can actually get some

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.030
so in this case we can actually get some
 

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.690
so in this case we can actually get some
parameters and we can start manipulating

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700
parameters and we can start manipulating
 

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.640
parameters and we can start manipulating
the way in the default track selector

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:40.650
the way in the default track selector
 

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.770
the way in the default track selector
actually chooses tracks so here we're

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:42.780
actually chooses tracks so here we're
 

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.480
actually chooses tracks so here we're
limiting the video tracks to SD so 480p

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:47.490

really great bandwidth you probably
 

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.230
really great bandwidth you probably
don't want to use all of their data very

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240
don't want to use all of their data very
 

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.180
don't want to use all of their data very
quickly so you might want to keep a cap

00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.190
quickly so you might want to keep a cap
 

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.300
quickly so you might want to keep a cap
on the quality that you deliver

customization but you could do it if you
 

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:55.159
customization but you could do it if you
really want to and you kind of have a

really want to and you kind of have a
good handle on exactly what you have to

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:56.730
good handle on exactly what you have to
 

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.080
good handle on exactly what you have to
do to achieve up and you could extend

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.090
do to achieve up and you could extend
 

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.299
do to achieve up and you could extend
default renderers factory override the

00:29:02.299 --> 00:29:02.309
default renderers factory override the
 

00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:04.249
default renderers factory override the
bills video renders method and actually

00:29:04.249 --> 00:29:04.259
bills video renders method and actually
 

00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:06.320
bills video renders method and actually
inject your own video renderer into the

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.330
inject your own video renderer into the
 

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.149
inject your own video renderer into the
player instead of the default that would

normally be created okay great so

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:14.610
normally be created okay great so
 

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.519
normally be created okay great so
hopefully you can see a pattern emerging

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:16.529
hopefully you can see a pattern emerging
 

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:18.609
hopefully you can see a pattern emerging
in each of the examples of custom ADA

00:29:18.609 --> 00:29:18.619

customizations that Olli talked about so

00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539
customizations that Olli talked about so
 

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.930
customizations that Olli talked about so
the first step was establishing which

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940
the first step was establishing which
 

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.730
the first step was establishing which
component in the player we need to

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740
component in the player we need to
 

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.549
component in the player we need to
customize whether it's the track

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559
customize whether it's the track
 

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:31.669
customize whether it's the track
selector or the load control then you

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679
selector or the load control then you
 

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.590
selector or the load control then you
look at the API for that component and

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600
look at the API for that component and
 

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.710
look at the API for that component and
see if there's a way to customize its

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720
see if there's a way to customize its
 

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.480
see if there's a way to customize its
behavior using say a different parameter

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:38.490
behavior using say a different parameter
 

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.239
behavior using say a different parameter
as we did with load control if that's

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:41.249
as we did with load control if that's
 

00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:43.159
as we did with load control if that's
not a possibility then you might be able

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:43.169
not a possibility then you might be able
 

00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:45.139
not a possibility then you might be able

imagine that we need to send an
 

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.779
imagine that we need to send an

we know that we're passing in a data

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:05.669
we know that we're passing in a data
 

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.779
we know that we're passing in a data
source HTTP data source Factory and this

00:30:08.779 --> 00:30:08.789
source HTTP data source Factory and this
 

00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:10.639
source HTTP data source Factory and this
has a convenient method to get the

we can actually set a new header to set

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360
we can actually set a new header to set
 

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.570
we can actually set a new header to set
the authorization header on the HTTP

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580
the authorization header on the HTTP
 

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.789
the authorization header on the HTTP
request and once you've done that you

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799
request and once you've done that you
 

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:25.100
request and once you've done that you
pass that HTTP data source factory into

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.110
pass that HTTP data source factory into
 

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.749
pass that HTTP data source factory into
the media source and that header will

00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:26.759
the media source and that header will
 

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:31.639
the media source and that header will
appear on all requests that it makes as

appear on all requests that it makes as
 

00:30:31.649 --> 00:30:34.100
appear on all requests that it makes as
another example let's say that you know

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.110
another example let's say that you know
 

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.049
another example let's say that you know
that users are going to rewind videos

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059
that users are going to rewind videos
 

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:37.730
that users are going to rewind videos
quite a lot so you want to add a cash-in

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740
quite a lot so you want to add a cash-in
 

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.060
quite a lot so you want to add a cash-in
so that the player doesn't repeatedly

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.070
so that the player doesn't repeatedly
 

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.419
so that the player doesn't repeatedly
load the same media off the network

00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:43.429
load the same media off the network

exoplayer has a simple cache which you
 

00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:48.499
exoplayer has a simple cache which you
can use and and in this example I'm

00:30:48.499 --> 00:30:48.509
can use and and in this example I'm
 

00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:50.450
can use and and in this example I'm
passing in a least recently used cache

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460
passing in a least recently used cache
 

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.849
passing in a least recently used cache
of extra so the way this is going to

00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:52.859
of extra so the way this is going to
 

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:53.720
of extra so the way this is going to
work is the cache

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:53.730
work is the cache

the maximum size but if the media is

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.010
the maximum size but if the media is
 

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.490
the maximum size but if the media is
longer than that then when the media

00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500
longer than that then when the media
 

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.380
longer than that then when the media
finishes if they've watched the media

all the way through then the cash will

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:01.920
all the way through then the cash will
 

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.470
all the way through then the cash will
actually have started to evict they're

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480
actually have started to evict they're
 

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.550
actually have started to evict they're
very beginning on it okay and so this

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:07.560
very beginning on it okay and so this
 

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.100
very beginning on it okay and so this
cash gets passed into a cash data source

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.110
cash gets passed into a cash data source
 

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.470
cash gets passed into a cash data source
Factory and it also needs to take a

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480
Factory and it also needs to take a
 

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.630
Factory and it also needs to take a
normal data source which is used if

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640
normal data source which is used if
 

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.100
normal data source which is used if
there's a cache miss and also to

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.110
there's a cache miss and also to
 

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.010
there's a cache miss and also to
populate the cache and then you pause

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020
populate the cache and then you pause
 

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.480
populate the cache and then you pause
the cached data source factory to the

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:20.490
the cached data source factory to the
 

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.150
the cached data source factory to the
extracted media source so hopefully to

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:23.160
extracted media source so hopefully to
 

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.380
extracted media source so hopefully to
make this a little bit clearer let's

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:24.390
make this a little bit clearer let's
 

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.330
make this a little bit clearer let's
clearer let's see how it fits in with

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340
clearer let's see how it fits in with
 

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.330
clearer let's see how it fits in with
the player architecture we saw earlier

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:28.340
the player architecture we saw earlier
 

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.590
the player architecture we saw earlier
this cache is actually going to sit

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600
this cache is actually going to sit
 

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.720
this cache is actually going to sit
between the media source and the HTTP

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:32.730
between the media source and the HTTP
 

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.060
between the media source and the HTTP
data source and when the player when the

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.070
data source and when the player when the
 

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.830
data source and when the player when the
media source requests data it starts

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840
media source requests data it starts
 

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.840
media source requests data it starts
going to look it up in the cache it's as

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:38.850
going to look it up in the cache it's as
 

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.640
going to look it up in the cache it's as
a cache miss then it's going to go to

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:40.650
a cache miss then it's going to go to
 

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.650
a cache miss then it's going to go to
the network and use a HDTV data source

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:42.660
the network and use a HDTV data source
 

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.020
the network and use a HDTV data source
then on the way when that request is

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.030
then on the way when that request is
 

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.520
then on the way when that request is
satisfied it's going to come back and

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:46.530
satisfied it's going to come back and
 

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.260
satisfied it's going to come back and
fill in the cache so that next time the

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:48.270
fill in the cache so that next time the
 

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.390
fill in the cache so that next time the
media source requests the same chunk

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:50.400
media source requests the same chunk
 

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.920
media source requests the same chunk
then hopefully it's going to be in the

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:51.930
then hopefully it's going to be in the
 

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.760
then hopefully it's going to be in the
cache okay

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:55.770
cache okay
 

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.910
cache okay
so we talked about how the kind of

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:58.920
so we talked about how the kind of
 

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.740
so we talked about how the kind of
extreme case of customization is

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:00.750
extreme case of customization is
 

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.320
extreme case of customization is
providing a media source or whatever

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:03.330
providing a media source or whatever
 

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.220
providing a media source or whatever
that you've implemented yourself and so

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:07.230
that you've implemented yourself and so
 

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.540
that you've implemented yourself and so
I'm going to go through an example of

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:08.550
I'm going to go through an example of
 

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.820
I'm going to go through an example of
doing that let's say that you've got an

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:10.830
doing that let's say that you've got an
 

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.200
doing that let's say that you've got an
app where you're showing some content

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:12.210
app where you're showing some content
 

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.580
app where you're showing some content
but now you want to monetize that

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:13.590
but now you want to monetize that
 

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.840
but now you want to monetize that
content by showing ads alongside it and

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:16.850
content by showing ads alongside it and
 

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.890
content by showing ads alongside it and
let's have a think about what the

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:18.900
let's have a think about what the
 

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.140
let's have a think about what the
timeline is going to look like in this

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.150
timeline is going to look like in this
 

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.530
timeline is going to look like in this
case well it might be very simple and in

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:24.540
case well it might be very simple and in
 

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.150
case well it might be very simple and in
this example on the screen there's just

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:26.160
this example on the screen there's just
 

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.370
this example on the screen there's just
one ad at the beginning of pre-roll ad

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380
one ad at the beginning of pre-roll ad
 

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.640
one ad at the beginning of pre-roll ad
or it may be more complicated and so in

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:31.650
or it may be more complicated and so in
 

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.190
or it may be more complicated and so in
this case there's a pre-roll ad and a

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200
this case there's a pre-roll ad and a
 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.800
this case there's a pre-roll ad and a
mid-roll ad and a poster or ad and they

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:36.810
mid-roll ad and a poster or ad and they
 

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.390
mid-roll ad and a poster or ad and they
kind of split up the content so at first

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:41.400
kind of split up the content so at first
 

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.130
kind of split up the content so at first
glance you might think this is a place

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140
glance you might think this is a place
 

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.750
glance you might think this is a place
where we could use concatenating media

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760
where we could use concatenating media
 

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.110
where we could use concatenating media
source but unfortunately normally when

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120
source but unfortunately normally when
 

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.460
source but unfortunately normally when
you're loading ads you can't actually

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:49.470
you're loading ads you can't actually
 

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.760
you're loading ads you can't actually
commit to a particular ad URI until the

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:52.770
commit to a particular ad URI until the
 

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.170
commit to a particular ad URI until the
time when you're about to play it it's

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.180
time when you're about to play it it's
 

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.580
time when you're about to play it it's
not the case that we have a list of

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:55.590
not the case that we have a list of
 

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.960
not the case that we have a list of
exactly what ads we're going to play

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:56.970
exactly what ads we're going to play
 

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.620
exactly what ads we're going to play
upfront so let's see what would happen

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:00.630
upfront so let's see what would happen
 

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.990
upfront so let's see what would happen
if we try to use just one player and

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000
if we try to use just one player and
 

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.260
if we try to use just one player and
with conventional media sources to play

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.270
with conventional media sources to play
 

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.569
with conventional media sources to play
these

00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:07.579
these
 

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:10.310
these
so at the beginning of playback we get

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320
so at the beginning of playback we get
 

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.769
so at the beginning of playback we get
the URI for the first ad and then we can

00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779
the URI for the first ad and then we can
 

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:15.349
the URI for the first ad and then we can
play it but then we know that we need to

00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:15.359
play it but then we know that we need to
 

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:16.729
play it but then we know that we need to
play the content so the player is

00:33:16.729 --> 00:33:16.739
play the content so the player is
 

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:18.739
play the content so the player is
actually going to buffer when we tell it

00:33:18.739 --> 00:33:18.749
actually going to buffer when we tell it
 

00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:21.459
actually going to buffer when we tell it
that we want to play the content instead

00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:21.469
that we want to play the content instead
 

00:33:21.469 --> 00:33:24.139
that we want to play the content instead
then the content will play back and the

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:24.149
then the content will play back and the
 

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:25.989
then the content will play back and the
user is going to see buffering again

00:33:25.989 --> 00:33:25.999
user is going to see buffering again
 

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:30.109
user is going to see buffering again
then the add more buffering and I guess

00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:30.119
then the add more buffering and I guess
 

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:31.219
then the add more buffering and I guess
you're seeing how this is going to work

00:33:31.219 --> 00:33:31.229
you're seeing how this is going to work
 

00:33:31.229 --> 00:33:33.469
you're seeing how this is going to work
there's a lot of buffering and this is

00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:33.479
there's a lot of buffering and this is
 

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.049
there's a lot of buffering and this is
not a good user experience so one way

00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059
not a good user experience so one way
 

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:37.849
not a good user experience so one way
that people try to work around this is

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:37.859
that people try to work around this is
 

00:33:37.859 --> 00:33:40.489
that people try to work around this is
they will try and use two players and

00:33:40.489 --> 00:33:40.499
they will try and use two players and
 

00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:42.199
they will try and use two players and
the idea is that one player is going to

00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:42.209
the idea is that one player is going to
 

00:33:42.209 --> 00:33:43.430
the idea is that one player is going to
play what's on the screen at the moment

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440
play what's on the screen at the moment
 

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.469
play what's on the screen at the moment
while the other player is in the

00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:45.479
while the other player is in the
 

00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:47.119
while the other player is in the
background buffering whatever is coming

00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:47.129
background buffering whatever is coming
 

00:33:47.129 --> 00:33:49.399
background buffering whatever is coming
up next and so when they're you're as

00:33:49.399 --> 00:33:49.409
up next and so when they're you're as
 

00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:50.779
up next and so when they're you're as
soon as the add URI arrived

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:50.789
soon as the add URI arrived
 

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:52.249
soon as the add URI arrived
you can populate the background player

00:33:52.249 --> 00:33:52.259
you can populate the background player
 

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:53.809
you can populate the background player
and hopefully get some data buffered

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:53.819
and hopefully get some data buffered
 

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:57.759
and hopefully get some data buffered
before playback begins and in this case

00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:57.769
before playback begins and in this case
 

00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:00.169
before playback begins and in this case
the playback will switch in between the

00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179
the playback will switch in between the
 

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:02.689
the playback will switch in between the
ad and the content but this solution

00:34:02.689 --> 00:34:02.699
ad and the content but this solution
 

00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:06.019
ad and the content but this solution
also has its drawbacks these two players

00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:06.029
also has its drawbacks these two players
 

00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:07.430
also has its drawbacks these two players
are both going to use out memory for

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440
are both going to use out memory for
 

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.319
are both going to use out memory for
buffering and they may even both be

00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:09.329
buffering and they may even both be
 

00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:11.569
buffering and they may even both be
using codecs at the same time and so

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:11.579
using codecs at the same time and so
 

00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:14.029
using codecs at the same time and so
that's not very good and also this is

00:34:14.029 --> 00:34:14.039
that's not very good and also this is
 

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:15.139
that's not very good and also this is
just very difficult to implement

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:15.149
just very difficult to implement
 

00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:16.789
just very difficult to implement
correctly if you've ever tried doing

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:16.799
correctly if you've ever tried doing
 

00:34:16.799 --> 00:34:20.869
correctly if you've ever tried doing
this so we thought about implementing a

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879
this so we thought about implementing a
 

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.669
this so we thought about implementing a
media source that specifically does

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679
media source that specifically does
 

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.339
media source that specifically does
design to ads and this media source is

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:25.349
design to ads and this media source is
 

00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:26.990
design to ads and this media source is
implemented in the slightly similar way

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000
implemented in the slightly similar way
 

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.139
implemented in the slightly similar way
to the concatenated media source except

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:30.149
to the concatenated media source except
 

00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:33.049
to the concatenated media source except
that it has these playlist items which

00:34:33.049 --> 00:34:33.059
that it has these playlist items which
 

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:34.579
that it has these playlist items which
are not populated and those are

00:34:34.579 --> 00:34:34.589
are not populated and those are
 

00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:36.619
are not populated and those are
represented by the question marks those

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:36.629
represented by the question marks those
 

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:38.240
represented by the question marks those
are going to get filled in with the ads

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.250
are going to get filled in with the ads
 

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.839
are going to get filled in with the ads
as soon as they arrive okay so let's see

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:41.849
as soon as they arrive okay so let's see
 

00:34:41.849 --> 00:34:43.519
as soon as they arrive okay so let's see
what playback would look like with this

00:34:43.519 --> 00:34:43.529
what playback would look like with this
 

00:34:43.529 --> 00:34:46.789
what playback would look like with this
hypothetical media source playback

00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:46.799
hypothetical media source playback
 

00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:48.769
hypothetical media source playback
begins and we get the first ad then the

00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:48.779
begins and we get the first ad then the
 

00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:50.749
begins and we get the first ad then the
content plays hopefully we get the next

00:34:50.749 --> 00:34:50.759
content plays hopefully we get the next
 

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:52.700
content plays hopefully we get the next
add a little bit early and that

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:52.710
add a little bit early and that
 

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.470
add a little bit early and that
placeholder is filled in in the timeline

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480
placeholder is filled in in the timeline
 

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.400
placeholder is filled in in the timeline
and if this works well then the user is

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:58.410
and if this works well then the user is
 

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.990
and if this works well then the user is
actually not going to be any buffering

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000
actually not going to be any buffering
 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.710
actually not going to be any buffering
during playback so as a real practical

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720
during playback so as a real practical
 

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.900
during playback so as a real practical
example of this Google provides the

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:05.910
example of this Google provides the
 

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.150
example of this Google provides the
interactive media ads SDK you may have

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160
interactive media ads SDK you may have
 

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.339
interactive media ads SDK you may have
heard of it and we're using that for

00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:10.349
heard of it and we're using that for
 

00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:13.680
heard of it and we're using that for
loading ads in this IMA ads media source

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:13.690
loading ads in this IMA ads media source
 

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.430
loading ads in this IMA ads media source
and as you can see and the arrow kind of

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440
and as you can see and the arrow kind of
 

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.559
and as you can see and the arrow kind of
highlights when the ad is loaded from

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:19.569
highlights when the ad is loaded from
 

00:35:19.569 --> 00:35:23.430
highlights when the ad is loaded from
ima and the the media source is rapping

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440
ima and the the media source is rapping
 

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.289
ima and the the media source is rapping
ima so you don't the player doesn't need

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:25.299
ima so you don't the player doesn't need
 

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:26.880
ima so you don't the player doesn't need
to worry about any details of how ads

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:26.890
to worry about any details of how ads
 

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.220
to worry about any details of how ads
are actually loaded and in this timeline

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:29.230
are actually loaded and in this timeline
 

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.779
are actually loaded and in this timeline
you get seamless transitions between

00:35:30.779 --> 00:35:30.789
you get seamless transitions between
 

00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:36.390
you get seamless transitions between
contents and ads so we've actually

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400
contents and ads so we've actually
 

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.190
contents and ads so we've actually
pushed this to our development branch

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200
pushed this to our development branch
 

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.960
pushed this to our development branch
today if you want an early preview if

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:39.970
today if you want an early preview if
 

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.460
today if you want an early preview if
you want to try inserting ads in your

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.470
you want to try inserting ads in your
 

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.920
you want to try inserting ads in your
content it's very easy to use so you

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:43.930
content it's very easy to use so you
 

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.049
content it's very easy to use so you
take your content media source and you

00:35:46.049 --> 00:35:46.059
take your content media source and you
 

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:48.359
take your content media source and you
pass it into the constructor of an ima

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:48.369
pass it into the constructor of an ima
 

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:50.730
pass it into the constructor of an ima
ads media source along with an ad tag

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:50.740
ads media source along with an ad tag
 

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.460
ads media source along with an ad tag
URI which defines what ads are playlists

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:53.470
URI which defines what ads are playlists
 

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.220
URI which defines what ads are playlists
to load and it also takes an overlay

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.230
to load and it also takes an overlay
 

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.410
to load and it also takes an overlay
view group which interactive media ads

00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:58.420
view group which interactive media ads
 

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.750
view group which interactive media ads
will use to show any add user interface

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760
will use to show any add user interface
 

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.339
will use to show any add user interface
on top of your player likely to get

00:36:02.339 --> 00:36:02.349
on top of your player likely to get
 

00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:05.940
