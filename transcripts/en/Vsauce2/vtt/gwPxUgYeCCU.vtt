00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.830
Energize your tired, hairy face by shaving
with Caffeinated shaving cream just be careful

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.080
not to nick your face-transforming Hyperlip.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.400
Because it’s episode 56 of LÜT.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.500
Add some extra entropy to your existence with
the Chaos Machine. A DIY toy that lets you

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.279
explore some of the math and real world applications
of chaos theory by connecting a series of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939
pendulums and axels to a magnet.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.260
If that repels you perhaps you’ll find a
silent guitar more attractive. Built to emulate

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
the sounds of an acoustic guitar, simply plug
in a pair of headphones to play discreetly

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.380
and quietly whenever you’d like.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.800
For a sleek and subtle way to organize scrap
there’s the Totem Intelligent Waste System.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.050
It takes up as much space as a typical trash
can, but is divided into different compartments.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.469
So recycling, food waste, trash, and other
household items can be separated and stored

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.469
easily.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.050
Ease your cold, sleepy head into the Hoodlum,
a sleeping bag designed for your dome.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.619
Then sink your body into an Inada Dreamwave
massage chair. It offers a full body massage

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.810
with 100 air cells and heated cushions to
help relax and rejuvenate your entire frame

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.159
from your feet all the way to your HandiTaur!
the most noble of all mythological creatures.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.490
Have the Handitaur help sculpt these blocks
of clay into erasers with the Creatibles make

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.240
your own eraser kit. Sculpt whatever you want
and bake it in the oven to turn your creation

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.009
into a functional eraser.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.109
Raise your organization game and desert dirty
desks with your Cork Cactus. A prickly pot-plant

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.399
which acts as a pin cushion and requires no
water.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.999
However water will be required for the Tarzan
Boat, a mobile floating water park that comes

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.429
with a slide, multiple trampolines, a rope
ladder, and can be parked at a marina.

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.859
Conquer the water and the air thanks to the
Parrot Hydrofoil drone. Which uses four propellors

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.679
on a mini drone to charge across the water
two inches above the surface.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.989
Charge up the Luminaid Packlite Spectra using
only the sun. The lantern has LED’s that

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.989
change color, the whole thing folds up, and
features a durable solar panel on the top.

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.680
But if you’d rather use the sun to draw
something you’ll need Febo, the solar paintbrush.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.610
Made from wood and glass it can be used to
draw with solar energy by concentrating sunlight

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.400
on a specific point.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.019
Now that you’ve used the sun to draw turn
out the lights and watch the Sands Alive Glow.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.319
An indoor sandbox that never dries up, comes
with different tools to shape the sand, and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.390
glows in the dark.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.159
Put your Dogecoin into the Sci-Fi wallet which
not only does it look awesome, but when opened

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.209
makes sci-fi sounds.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.260
Take your sound untethered with the Air LP
Wireless Streaming Turntable. Which can connect

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.640
to bluetooth speakers making your vinyl collection
cordless and can even connect it to your phone,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.780
which you could then place inside of the hugvie&nbsp;a
vaguely human shaped pillow that makes talking

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.150
with your friends and family on the phone
more comforting?&nbsp;

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.709
Comfort yourself about potential natural disasters
with the Prepper Gear Box a monthly box subscription

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.220
that sends you gear that’ll come in handy
should disaster strike.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.620
Right. But does it come with a hotdog toaster?

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.730
Be careful you don’t eat too many hotdogs
or you’ll end up just like Barfin Barney

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.659
the Desktop Gnome. Honestly, Barney, it’s
ok that you threw up.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.739
I donut carrot all.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:04:09.489
And as always - thanks for watching.
