&gt;&gt; Hi.
I'm Linda Boland Abraham here at Davos.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.510
I've been asked to answer a question what
one thing can governments,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.110
and individuals, and companies do to make
the world a better place.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.249
And, umm, in my view it really comes down
to finding the one thing

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.449
that you're passionate about.
Resources and money, of course, are a critical

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.789
part of the equation
and we certainly need a lot of the world from

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.919
all three of those
groups to step up and provide them but what

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.210
really makes it work at
the end of the day in my view is the passion

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.660
and the talent that
individuals give in order to make -- make

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.969
things happen.
So whether you -- you go into writing, or

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.559
organizing, or, uh,
something artistic, everybody has something

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.950
special that they're
really good at and really passionate about

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.219
and I think taking the
initiative to find an avenue for that and

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.870
someone in the world that
could benefit from it.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.920
And I think collectively if you begin to think
about the impact that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.350
that could have, it's really special and that's
the great thing about

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.690
Davos is there's so many people doing that
and it's really very, very

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.190
inspiring.
So I hope to take some of that home.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.870
Thanks, and hi to all my kids.
