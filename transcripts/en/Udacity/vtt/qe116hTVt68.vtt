It's tough to run a business,
but you need to do it alone.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.180
Many businesses have
more than one founder.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.109
This let's you focus on your strengths,
while they focus on theirs.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.150
So let's take some time to decide
if a co-founder is right for you.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.780
We'll look at what a co-founder does and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.260
why they're important, and
we'll also hear from Noam and

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.219
Kristy about their experiences
finding and working with co-founders.
