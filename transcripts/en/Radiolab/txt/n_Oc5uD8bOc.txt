Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio

Speaker 2:          00:05          from the beginning. W N Y. S t. E n n. P. R. E. You ever get a good sense of what to what you want to tell me? Yeah. All right. Hey, I'm Jen. I am Robert. This is Radiolab, the podcast, the podcast. Can I just start us off with a moment of appreciation? I'm very excited for what you're going to play for us today because sometimes, you know, you talk to people on stage smart people and uh, you did one recently for the world science festival. Yes. And we put it on every so often on the podcast, but we don't do it enough. Well, we're going to do it now.

Speaker 3:          00:40          So

Speaker 1:          00:40          in, in just a moment, I'm going to introduce you to two gentlemen who are nothing short of remarkable, but before I do, I'd just, so we go now [inaudible] and Sylvia k auditorium at the campus at Hunter College in Manhattan. Uh, Louise and we'll just set it up for us a little bit. Like what are we about to do? Um, well, so the, the, the idea of this world science festival evening, um, there are people who wander around the world who have a problem which is called face blindness. Weirdly, both these men are face blind. So when they look at a face for 10, 20, 60 minutes, the other guy's face just doesn't get in or sticking to their heads. I chose two people. One of them is Oliver sacks are irregular. Oliver, he's a neuroscientist and he's like all over his Facebook. Oh boy is he phased by it? I mean he came recognize faces but you'll see the other guy who we are going to call chuck, the other guy is one of the greatest portrait artists in the world. He has as many of you know for decades now created art big paintings. I'm little but usually huge paintings, mostly of faces. Here he is chuck close.

Speaker 3:          01:49          I thought it would be interesting to bring these two people together, face blind, Oliver face blind shot and discuss what many people think of as a very rare situation. Lauren. It does. Again, we don't know who you are yet.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Both of you. How long ago did you discover if indeed that's the right word, that you were unusual in this regard? I'll, um, I think probably when I, hi, I can't hear. Okay. So I'll tell you what, I'll just stick this thing in front of you and say something. Say something.

Speaker 3:          02:24          That's all you missed the first part of the program. But all of it was saying,

Speaker 1:          02:30          uh, so you, you were in a class with other kids. If you, if, if you had a friend who was like, you know, a pow, would you take a bit a beat to know who it was when? Yeah. So say Jonathan Miller became a good friend. He's tall and gangly. He has red hair and his, his movements, uh, are fluid and evocative and wonderful. And if Jonathan Miller was brought in paralyzed and totally straight, would you know it was Jonathan Miller? Do you have to see the hair, the movements? No.

Speaker 4:          03:00          Um, when I, when I have got to know someone, well, uh, then I, then I will recognize the face, but it takes a long while and with, um, and even mirror has to be reinforced. Right. You have to keep saying. So if you spent four minutes with the person and you walk away and come back two minutes later, do you know who the person is? It does if 20 minutes with the person time make a difference, um, uh, I tend to lose it within minutes. Every minute you,

Speaker 5:          03:27          same problem. Same problem. I um, I can spend an evening talking to someone, looking at them across the table and I've see them the next day. I'd have no idea I've ever seen them nor do I remember their name.

Speaker 1:          03:38          But when they open their mouth, would you say, oh, that's the one or not even know.

Speaker 5:          03:43          And a lot of it is context. If they walk into my studio, I figured they've walked into my studio because they're supposed to be there.

Speaker 4:          03:50          Alright.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Then I interview them for a while to find out who they are. Are you just trying to subtly find like, so who is the, is that this whole is this person? Why are they in my studio now in your case, if that person were to suddenly flatten out and [inaudible] still on a page.

Speaker 5:          04:08          The thing in my work is I'm determined by my learning disabilities. So face blind. I'm sure I was driven to paint portraits by being faced blind. Uh, that is, I am, I know now that if I can, uh, flatten an image out and scan it the way I work, I can commit it to memory and I have almost photographic memory for things that are flat and still still, yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Three being in space and moving around makes the face and visible. Fixing it makes the face men move your head a half an inch. To me it's a whole new, yeah.

Speaker 5:          04:47          Face I've never seen before. Wow. Wow.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Have you ever not recognized

Speaker 4:          04:52          yourself? Um, yeah, I'm, I'm always, um, well, several times I have started apologizing to launch clumsy at people and realize that it's a mirror. It's a mirror, it's a mirror. Um, but it's even going to stage further than that. Fairly recently. I was, uh, in a, uh, a cafe in Chelsea market with tables outside. And, um, while I was waiting for my food, I do what people would be as often to, I started to, to preen myself. And when I realized that my reflection was not doing the same thing

Speaker 3:          05:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:39          well should I, and the inside there was a man with a beard. Possibly you?

Speaker 3:          05:45          No.

Speaker 4:          05:46          Who wondered why I was sort of, you know, making faces with him, so, so I may take out the people to be myself as well as fun. Nice. My, I just was wondering how you result

Speaker 1:          05:58          once you realize that you were preening your beard in front of the bearded man.

Speaker 4:          06:03          Um, did you, could you, did you like look down and I, yeah, I, I did look abashed I often put dashed.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Well, now let me just ask you about, is this just a face problem? What about emotional? Can you, if you can't see a face, can you ever read sadness? Happiness?

Speaker 5:          06:21          Yeah, I don't think I have any trouble reading, um, how someone is feeling. I think I'm actually pretty good at that. You know what the, the way, the way I work is to make this kind of Bob Dick Maillian world in which I make the face into a landscape. And I journey across that landscape like Gulliver's Lilliputians crawling over the face of a, of a giant, not knowing that they were on the face of a giant, but knowing everything about that face. And then what I do is I put all that information together or the kind of knows the nostril, low corners of the mouth, whatever, and I can commit it. I can commit it to memory. So I know that this is no accident that I was driven to make, um, uh, portraits of people who matter to me

Speaker 1:          07:11          can, but if, if the person who's face you can't read lips are trembling or if they are, have a downcast look in the eye or if they're being brave, can you assign emotion to a facet of a face? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          07:24          And you too. Okay.

Speaker 4:          07:26          Well, I look talked at Mike. Okay, well I, I can't paint or whatever, but I think I'm a sensitive to emotions. You know, and, and, and little things including little grimaces which indicate that someone is, is lying or here's a difference. I sent this to complete this sort of look of what you can and can't do.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Oliver can remit. I, when I ask you about things you've written 22 years ago, a lot of times if you've talked to an author about something they wrote 22 years ago, they give you a sad look of, you know, well, that was a long time ago, but you seem to remember much of what you have learned. You seem to remember very little of what you

Speaker 4:          08:05          before.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Well, let me, let me, let me be gentlemen about that. Ah, when you were in high school, it was time to take the test, right? You once to describe to me a, um, an all night bathtub. No, I

Speaker 5:          08:19          used the kind of sensory deprivation tank in order to memorize things and um, uh, it's very hard for me. I'd still, I don't know how to add or subtract without using the spots on dominoes of visual system. I still don't know the multiplication tables. Um, I didn't take Algebra, geometry, physics, or chemistry at the junior college in my hometown. Didn't, I had not taken every taxpayer, his son or daughter. I could never have gone to college. Wow. So you're a wreck. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:50          Yeah. But

Speaker 1:          08:51          that's the coping part of this for both of you. It's been kind of interesting because both of you are very, very smart. So you just put your intelligence where you have,

Speaker 5:          08:59          one of the great quotes I've ever heard this from, uh, the, the great painter Robert Rauschenberg, who was, uh, the, about the most learning disabled, a dyslexia person I've ever known. And he said, when you're this way, you have to find other venues for your intelligence, right? You have to prove to your teachers that even, Oh, you're not going to be able to spit back the name of the names or dates that you, that you care about the material. And we have to prove to the people who we see that we care about them, even though we're not going to recognize their faces and maybe remember their names. So you have to be charming. You have to be a bullshit.

Speaker 4:          09:41          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          09:43          you have to be fast on your feet and figure out how you're going to explain your way out of the fact that you don't, uh, know who they are or remember them.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Do you find people calling you like a snob or I mean like, like what do you mean you don't know me? I'm the host of this dinner party kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          10:01          Um, yes. Um, usually my, my assistant cakes will say to people beforehand, before they come in, don't ask if, if he remembers you because he'll say no to me. She says, don't just say no. Say I'm awful with faces. I wouldn't recognize my own mother. Um, but I am, but I'm not good at. Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Um, yeah, I, I tend to withdrawal. You withdraw. Yeah. So you, you solve it by going into a corner and not talking to anybody. Well, it doesn't solve it. I just talked to makes it worse. But, um,

Speaker 5:          10:40          my approach is to be more outgoing, more friendly, whatever, and to try and, um, charm my way, uh, through things. And I also lecture and talk all the time about face blindness and my other problems. So that people are aware that I have then Manhattan, they'll cut me some slack.

Speaker 1:          11:01          But, but, but you, you go out like every chance you can. Right. And you stay in every chance you can write well,

Speaker 4:          11:08          more or less. Yeah. No I don't stay in, but I, there are other things besides human beings.

Speaker 3:          11:18          And um,

Speaker 4:          11:19          when, when for example, I first visited Australia, I came back with, with hundreds of photos and people look through with [inaudible]. Yes. But didn't you meet any human beings? Books? All my photos were of scenery and plants where I'm very at home

Speaker 1:          11:35          and I, I noticed that when you get in the elevator, in your apartment, you don't have any idea who the neighbors are, but you do look down. Right? Oh, I know that dogs. So if they were to switch dogs, you'd just be a, yeah. Well I wouldn't notice. Yeah. But if you see them without the dog, you don't know who they are. No, I don't know. So, so this charm offensive that you go on, what does that like how if you have no idea who you're talking to, what are they, what are the charm moves? Well, not always

Speaker 5:          12:14          charming. I didn't recognize a woman I'd lived with

Speaker 1:          12:17          for a year, two years, two years later, and there's no amount of charm, but it's going to get you through a mistake like that. It's like, do you just, do you make fun of yourself? Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          12:32          Self deprecating humor will, will cover a great deal. And um, if you laugh at yourself, you're giving permission to other, for other people to see it as less than the most tragic a condition. It, it is funny. You know, it's funny, I wish I didn't have it, but it's funny.

Speaker 4:          12:54          What am I, am I that I'm lots of neurological conditions are all comic. They can be both awful and comic and it's,

Speaker 5:          13:02          well, there's a gallows humor in rehabilitation hospitals for that, for that very reason. You know,

Speaker 1:          13:08          what about it that's narrowed down the techniques here at, can you sometimes not see the face but see the hair, the ears, the something?

Speaker 4:          13:19          Oh, I'm, I'm a, absolutely. If someone has large out sticking ears or hook nose or, or a little triangle of beard, uh, off the glasses of a particular sort, um, I'm better at recognizing cow couture's and portraits book say in a caricature. Salient features are exaggerated. And for me it's, uh, to some extent I have to make an inventory of salient features.

Speaker 1:          13:43          You talk about Gulliver and that process. Do you think of what you do as an expression of the situation you find yourself in?

Speaker 5:          13:52          Sure. In every way. I mean, I'm, uh, I have trouble, uh, in a global sense with the whole, but if you break it down into small enough bite-size, uh, units, incremental units, then I made this big overwhelming problem into thousands of little more solvable problems. I've just found a way to, um, you know, take my deficits and uh, and use them rather than the Bang my head against the wall.

Speaker 2:          14:23          Let me, let me show you lie all this is Chuck 15 and then the truck 16. So the truck 15, it's going to be a person you know named who is liable. Wait, now what's happening? What is this right here? So yeah, what you should do is you should imagine a, um, it's a detailed slide and what you see is lots of boxes with almost like mirror, like shiny nuggets in each mocked as this one. You're looking at a checklist painting really close. Is that what you're describing? Yes. It's a detail. So it's the lower lip and chin of somebody. Somebody who he calls the while when people stand right in front of Lyle's mouth, there's a little bit of confusion. You can't quite read it

Speaker 5:          15:03          right away. Well, the closer you get the something normally the more information you'd get, but the closer you get, the one on mine, the less information you have. You have information.

Speaker 2:          15:12          When you step Mack, these very abstract flat little cells suddenly turn into a very interesting phase. Well, here's what I don't understand that if he's blind to the face, how do you even build it up? Like don't you have to be able to see the thing that you're building too. If he can fix it, which the photograph does. Oh he takes a picture first he takes a picture first and then what? Then he graphs it. So he makes it into lots of little boxes. It looks like a giant checkerboard and then he goes to into each checkerboard and he then repaints it magically when you step away there is the thing that you can put. Interesting. So he's able to, he's able to see the details within those boxes well enough to be able to construct them and then trust. Then what will emerge as the face, the, and the magical part is not only do you suddenly get the reveal of the face, but with the reveal comes a sense of the person.

Speaker 4:          16:07          Okay, so let's go back to the situation. So now all the way you have been losing your depth perception. So he, he's now go, he takes where the world in three D and puts it into two D in all these fleshy and interesting ways. You have always been all your life or 3d man, cashiers here passionate. What's happening to you now? Well now I've lost the sight of one eye. Um, I'm, everything for me is on a plane and on a flat surface. Does that mean that when you look at art, that things that used to bore you now the flat things getting better and spacial things get worse? We'll the has been a a paradox. Um, and that, uh, for me previously until a few months ago, the world consisted of solid objects residing in space and with space between them. Uh, now the objects are as well painted on, are on a flat plane. And I think that the sense of visual composition, uh, which is not a word I ever use or to the concept I ever had strongly. I think that is stronger. Unfortunately I can't paint, but I do in fact find myself enjoying painting small, especially sort of are the flat medieval ones. I partly feel I'm in a sort of 13th century world and I'm sitting here with

Speaker 5:          17:31          one eye closed, which is what I've done my whole life. Right. Well, because I have double vision if I have both eyes open and uh, you know, so I closed one eye and I flatten the world out and I have a much better chance of getting around in it. So you see the wrinkles on this aisle because it's been closed virtually my entire life.

Speaker 4:          17:53          Oh, okay. Well, by the way, is there any cure for this that we know that if you have this, if this facial blindness, does anyone get cured of it? Not so far as I know. Okay. Empty. But, you know, I think it's important to say, and, uh, you know, I, I portrayed myself as sort of as is withdrawn or helps us, but I, I think I also have a, a vivid love of humanity as chuck has. But for me, the portraits take the form of narratives, the stories smell, um, you,

Speaker 5:          18:25          your words paint the most, uh, specific portraits of people's lives. And, uh, I always have identified your characters as a, as vivid portrait, as anything anybody could do in any other art form. And uh, um,

Speaker 3:          18:45          we [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          18:47          you celebrate your connectedness with humanity in a really important way. I mean, it's a way that we can identify with, even if it's a problem we don't have. Empathy is the basis of I think the mortar, that whole society together and uh, telling stories in a riveting way that allows us to empathize and care about these people up. My, my grandfather had Tourette's syndrome and reading, uh, about a character with Tourette's syndrome. And what are your books? I cried through the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          19:24          Hm. Um, can I ask about the cause of this condition? You can get face blindness from a stroke, right? Can you get it from a tumor? Ah, yes, yes. Well, head injury or whatever affects a particular part of the brain. A small area in the, in the visual Cortex, people call it the, the fusiform gyrus, the fusiform face area. Actually there are a number of different face areas and normally these connect up with memories of faces and things. Um, but something which was not recognized until very recently and it's still very insufficiently recognized is what chuck and I have, which has lifelong face blindness and which is often strongly familiar. And there if you do strongly familial meaning genetic perhaps. Yes. How widespread is this condition? The tooling you have it, the best estimates is that fairly severe? Um, I mean the May well abuse a symmetrical curve. Uh, um, chuck and I are in the worst two or 3%, but probably not the worst 1%. There are people who are far, far worse. Um, but um, so you're going to give me a guess when you think it's like 10% of the world and 1% a, the fairly severely affected people are two to 3%, which is six to 8 million

Speaker 1:          20:48          people in this country. Well, let's, let me, let's do a test to see whether this audience, how, let's just see how, how good or bad you guys are. We're going to do a little fun test of your face. And the way it works is the 10 celebrity faces. What does that show? Here's what happening. We decided to give the whole audience a face test. 10 celebrity faces will be flashed on the screen for 15 seconds. Each took 10 very famous celebrities. They included the president of the United States of America. Fabulous movie stars from the past and the present. You just put their face up and say, do you recommend we put their faces up? But we erased here. Here, Huh? Oh, just the face. Only the face. That's interesting. So imagine like Johnny Depp, but no here takeaways here. The question is would they rent? Would you recognize this person?

Speaker 1:          21:35          I've been thinking how we think people would recognize. I mean, well so when I, but when I read out the names, you're hand reading out the names. Number six is Johnny Depp, Johnny Duh. That's what he's like without hair. That's what he's like without here. People Sound surprised. I'm going to ask for a show of hands. All right now. And so then I said, well please raise your hand if you got any person, right. Anyone at all. You know, almost everybody. Oh, maybe lower your hand if you only got one or two. Right? Okay. So now some hands go down. Lower your hand if you only got three, right? So now, yeah, we're beginning raising this in an odd way. Only got three, right? Lower your hand if you only got four, right? Oh, he is such a funny word.

Speaker 3:          22:21          Yeah. Thank you, chuck.

Speaker 1:          22:24          Going please now lower your hand if you only got nine rights. The remaining hands with how many hands are up at this point? That's six out of like a thousand. Yup. How many? The remaining hands I got in CN. Could you stand if you got 10 I just like this,

Speaker 3:          22:46          but the number of

Speaker 1:          22:48          people, but wow, they're all women. That's interesting. All right. Sit down. Sit down. Super People. How many people got none, right? Could you please rise? Absolutely none. I mean, let's see how their moral man,

Speaker 3:          23:02          I wanted to know if anyone was just totally blind and about 10 people were totally blind. Got None right at all. My wife got none. Oh my God. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:17          she was amazed. So this is the thing. So, so, so the question then becomes so, so wow. A lot of people really do have this problem so that a lot of people who may be leading lives of embarrassment and partial disability and secrecy and shame and I, uh, I evolved all sorts of coping mechanisms with a dyslexia, um, many of which are now taught, you know, to

Speaker 5:          23:46          people who have other problems. But I, but there unfortunately no real answers to, uh, to coping with.

Speaker 2:          23:56          Well, you have some charm it up high. I mean,

Speaker 5:          24:02          um, you're, you're not going to lessen the deficit by having a good attitude or trying harder or whatever it is what it is.

Speaker 3:          24:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          24:19          I want to thank the world science festival to Brian Green and Tracy de who run the thing. It comes every spring in New York City. Lots of scientists. And boy, does it come, it comes like a comment. Yes. And we over at Radiolab or the Jed was there this year. He did a, he did animals. Animals, yes. And uh, like we haven't done that enough. Well like, like we don't know faces when it's the world science festival. So will you say hello to the world? We say thank you to science. Thank you. Two festivals. We know how to body with the best of them and thank you to you for listening. Thank you. I'm Jen. I'm Robert. See Ya.
