00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.100
Deep in a refrigerated vault on the snowy
hillside of a remote island in the arctic

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.790
circle, a library of seeds may be humanity’s
only hope for botanical salvation.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.110
Hi everyone, Crystal here for DNews with some
good news about the apocalypse.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.631
It’s probably already here but the earth’s
plants may survive and through them, humans

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.810
could too.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.240
If we draw an analogy between the apocalypse
and a rapid, mass extinction of the number

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.990
and variety of living things on Earth; we
may just be the middle of one.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.760
Mass extinctions, like the one that killed
the Dinosaurs, are characterized by a narrowing

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.640
of biodiversity due to environmental change.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.070
And some scientists say that’s happening
right now.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.390
Estimates place the current rate of extinction
of plants and animals at anywhere from 100

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.490
to 1000 times faster than our recent geological
past, and this rate appears poised to increase

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.780
as 1) our globe continues to warm, 2) human
populations continue to expand, and 3) geographical

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.110
regions continue to be devastated by wars
and natural disaster.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.659
Humans have been concerned about protecting
the earth’s biodiversity since biblical

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:09.659
times.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.350
Why else would we have a story about animals
lining up 2 by 2 to be preserved on a giant

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.350
ark?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.000
“Biodiversity” refers to the number and
variety of living species within an ecosystem.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.940
And this variety, specifically among plants,
is crucial for human survival since plants

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.270
are the source of our nutrients and energy,
as well as providing shelter and the starting

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.200
point for many medicines.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.459
Seed banks, like the Svalbard Global Seed
Vault, are one way to preserve the biodiversity

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.219
of commercially significant crops, and of
wild native plants.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.399
These libraries of seeds can be used to reintroduce
species into existing habitats, or to strengthen

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.460
genetically depleted populations.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.619
But, maintaining a one stop shop of viable
seeds can be costly and challenging.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.069
Recognizing the need for a more secure, global
effort, an organization called The Crop Trust,

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.419
with support from many well known private
foundations, has stepped in.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:04.520
Their most dramatic program maintains an enormous
warehouse with the capacity to house a cache

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000
of 4.5 million varieties of seeds.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.280
Located on a Norwegian island north of the
arctic circle, this vault is envisioned as

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.360
a fail safe; a back-up to smaller more local
seed banks.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.730
And in fact, that is exactly how it is being
used.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.019
The first and only seed withdrawal was made
by Syria who used seeds they had previously

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.959
deposited in Svalbard to reconstruct a seed
bank recently destroyed by civil war.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.530
Currently, more than 864,000 species of plant
life from over 100 countries are being preserved

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010
within the cold, dry interior of this vault.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.300
And its contents are estimated to approach
half of the known macroflora like trees and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.660
grains, on the planet.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.230
As this is a global project with diplomatic
implications, concerns over seed ownership

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.680
have naturally arisen.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.099
For now, the vault acts as a high tech storage
facility, filtering out possible genetic duplications

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.129
in deposits but also ensuring that only the
original depositor will have access to their

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.219
contribution.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.049
This restriction is to protect the library
of heirloom seeds from exploitation and for-profit

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.299
manipulation by biotech companies or agribusiness.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.189
Not everyone agrees that locking up the seeds
to every known plant on earth is the way to

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.189
go.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.590
Some critics say, libraries like these are
just historical records, offering simply a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.730
snapshot in evolutionary time, and that the
plants preserved by this method would have

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.900
a low chance of survival after reintroduction.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.189
Plants resulting from the preserved seeds
wouldn’t have had a chance to evolve with

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.260
the demands of their environment and they
may lack resistance to modern pests and disease.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.579
Opponents of the seed bank approach often
focus on commercial crops and advocate for

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.220
preservation of seed diversity in the fields.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.239
This in situ preservation requires the long-term
cooperation of farming communities to cultivate

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.920
a variety of the same crops over generations.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.790
But, for example, with emphasis on profit,
it seems unlikely farmers would be able or

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.220
willing to keep growing every known variety
of corn if they were only making big money

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.290
on one.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.909
Debate continues as to which path is best.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.170
Large libraries of genetic diversity like
the Svalbard Global Seed Vault inspire the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.340
imagination.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.370
Will astronauts of the future be eating ancient
forms of terrestrial plants that just happen

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.010
to survive the demands of space?

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.290
The existence of home grown lettuce on the
International Space Station says “maybe”.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.570
Certainly, select microflora like cyanobacteria
will have a one way ticket to Mars when the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.570
time comes.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.480
Evolution needs a starting point, and whether
it is a seed bank or a library of biodiversity

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.190
with galactic significance, when it comes
to life, more is better.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:53.310
And may the best seed win.
