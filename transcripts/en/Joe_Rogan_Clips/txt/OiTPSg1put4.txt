Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, how do you think there's going to affect things like competitive athletics? Hugely. So, um, right now, um, we have this problem, someone like Lance Armstrong is, he was doing, he's manipulating his, uh, his body and what he's basically doing is adding more red blood cells so that he can carry more oxygen and people feel that that's cheating. It's a, it's a different topic that probably everybody in the Tour de France was doing exactly that when he, when he went. Um, but what if it, which will be the case, we're going to be able to sequence the people, let's say nobody's doing drugs and we sequence all these athletes, some of them will just have a natural genetic advantage. Their bodies will naturally be doing what Lamstar Lance Armstrong had manipulated his body to. Do you know, that's happening with a sprinter right now? Yeah. Well that female sprinters, high levels of testosterone.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yeah. No. And it's, I feel really sorry for her, but we have categories. I mean, yeah, you with your world and in mixed martial arts, I mean I think I remember it in the past, there was some person who has, who was kind of a borderline on, on uh, uh, between genders and we're just kicking the shit out of all of these women in cage fighting. It's like we have these categories of man and woman and we know that the gender identities are fluid, but how do we think about it when these genetic differences confer advantages? So if your body is primed to do something, um, maybe you could have like a Plato's republic world where everybody fulfills a function that you are genetically optimized to do and that you could imagine that being a very competitive kind of a of environment. But what do you do it for now in something like the Olympics, if somebody has this huge genetic advantage, should we let somebody else manipulate their bodies?

Speaker 1:          01:49          There's a thing called gene doping in order to change the expression of genes. So your body to act like you're as Jeanette naturally genetic enhances somebody else. It's complicated. Are they capable of doing certain physical enhancements through gene doping right now? Yeah. Like what can they do right now known as? So, so the way it works is so your, your genes instruct your cells to make proteins. That's, that's, that's how the whole system works. So you can change genes or you can trigger the expression of proteins so you can get people's bodies to behave as if they had the, uh, these periodic optimization. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's why now the, the World Anti Doping Agency, I mean, they are now starting to look at gene doping and this is the first time, uh, that, that's, that that's even being considered as a category. And then there are other people that have done that.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Are there people that have done that successfully? You know, I don't know the answer to that. I know that [inaudible] is looking for it, which makes me assume that it must have done, but I haven't seen it. I've looked for it and I haven't seen any reports on it starts winning everything. Which line is so, so my, my rope, my uh, one of my Psi Phi novels, Genesis Code was about this. So China as you know, has their system of their Olympic sports schools and the way it works is they test kids all around the country. So let's just say it's, it's diving and they identify what are the core skills of a diver, what do you need? And then they go around the country and they test kids and then they bring a bunch of them to their Olympic sports schools and then they, you know, they get them all involved and then some kids are the best of those kids and the best of those kids.

Speaker 1:          03:27          And then you get with these champion, that's why China advance. So, uh, so rapidly, but what happens if they're doing that? But it's at the genetic level and there are countries like Kazakhstan that are already announcing that they are going to be screening all of their athletes. So the science isn't there yet. So it's really, it's impossible right now to say out, well, I'm going to do a genome sequence of somebody and I know this person has the potential to be an Olympic sprinter, but 10 years from now that's not going to be the case. Wow.

Speaker 2:          03:56          Yeah. It's sort of going to throw a monkey wrench in the whole idea of what is fair when it comes to athletics. Yeah. What is fair? What is human right? What is human? Yeah. I mean look, it's not like people don't already alter their bodies by training, by diet, exercise, all sorts of different recovery modalities, cryo therapy, sauna, all of it. Um, you know, high elevation training, all these different things that they do that manipulates the human body. But it's not like there would be kind of crazy if you had sports but you couldn't practice and you couldn't work out. Like we want to find out what a person's really like. No practice, no working out.

Speaker 1:          04:36          And that's the thing is like we are moving, it comes back to, we were saying before about in nature it's like we have this, this feeling nature somehow feels comfortable to us. That's what we're used to is all this stuff that you're talking about it, nobody was doing that 10,000 years ago. It's like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm running after a buffalo and so and so as these boundaries change as the realm of possibility changes, then we're going to be faced with all of these questions. Even now look at a sport like competitive weightlifting, they have these like the, the real competitive bodybuilding and you see these guys in there, they're monsters and then they have these drug free guys and everybody looks like a Yogi. And so it's still a pretty big, they look pretty big, but not compared to these, these other guys.

Speaker 1:          05:24          The only way to get those freak levels is to steroids. Yeah. And so like how are we going to pull these, this and I think it's going to be very difficult. And so maybe we can have some kind of natural area of life. But I think that our, our model of what's normal is just going to change. Because like I was saying in the beginning, we set our baseline based on how we grew up and that it seems about right, like it seems about right to us that everybody gets immunizations. Immunizations are a form of superpower. Imagine if our ancestor, they couldn't even imagine immunizations. What an unfair advantage when you have 100 million people dying of, of Spanish flu. So we're this, all of this stuff is scary and it's going to normalize. But how it normalizes is, is that's what's at play now. Well, the world has changed so much just in the last 20 years, but it feels like this is just scratching the surface in comparison to what's coming.

Speaker 1:          06:17          It was a, people miss understand and they underestimate the rate of change. And the reason that they do that is since the beginning of the digital revolution, we have experienced a thing called exponential changes that you've heard of Moore's law, which is basically computing power roughly doubles every two years. And we've internalized Moore's law. And that means that every new iPhone, we expect to be better and stronger and faster and all these kinds of things. But now we're entering in a world, a world where we're going to have exponential change across technology platforms. And so we think about, well what does exponential change mean in the context of biology? Well, at the very, very beginning, it's genome sequencing is, is, is going to be basically a basically free, but we're going to be able to change life. And because we're on this j curve, like when you think of what's a 10 year unit of change, looking in the, in the rear view mirror, that amount of change is only going to take five years going forward. And then two years and then one year. And so that's the reason why I've written this book cause I, we have to get to, this stuff is coming fast and if we want to be part of it, we have to understand it and we have to make our voices heard.
