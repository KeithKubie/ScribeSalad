00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
[NC]: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.860
and welcome back again to Sequel Month.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.300
(toilet and fart sounds)

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Or in this case,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.160
Squeakquel Month?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.520
No!

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.600
That is not the case.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.180
I will not give in to your rodent based puns, you unfunny bucket of toilet leavings!

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.300
The Chipmunks are an...

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.340
interesting franchise to say the least.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.600
That is to say, they've been around for years and nobody's really thought that much about them until their movies.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.680
The chipmunk movies always pulled in a big amount every December when they were released.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.860
I guess people just saw them as an extra Christmas present

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.020
in the same way your cat giving you a dead mouse is technically an extra Christmas present.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.580
Though in this case, I'd accept it.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.000
People started to get pissed because these movies would keep popping up,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
obviously having little to no effort thrown in,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.700
and yet still make enough money that their shit-obnoxious faces would show up all over the place!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000
Well you know what?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800
I'm sick of it.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.900
I'm sick of entertainment clearly not trying and somehow getting tons of rewards for it!

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.600
So you know what?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
I'm gonna figure out the magic formula in today's movie,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.500
and see how to get the same results.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.420
Because if THEY don't have to try,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.860
I shouldn't have to try!

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.400
Something of value is finally gonna come out of these damn movies!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.180
I WILL BE REWARDED FOR MY SUFFERING!

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.020
MY SOUL IS PREPARED!

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.100
HOW'S YOURS!?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.940
...Let's take a look.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.660
Okay, so it opens up with the chipmunks at a concert called "Save the Music."

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.020
...Trust me, if you want to save the music,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.120
The Chipmunks are not the band you want playing there...!

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.220
* bark*

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
[NC]: Even dogs seem to hate 'em!

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.940
We then see their caretaker Dave,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.100
played again by Jason Lee,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
reprising his role as a pair o' shredded vocal chords with a human being attached.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.400
[Dave]: You got to to share the spotlight!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.100
[Alvin]: Dave!

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.800
[Dave]: Its not all about you!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.840
[NC]: *subtle laugh* Yeah.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040
Where would Alvin get that idea in a band called

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.200
"Alvin and the Chipmunks!?"

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.700
You know for the longest time, I didn't even know they were called Simon and Theodore -

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.540
I thought they were called

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.840
"And The" and "Chipmunks"!

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680
But please continue to keep him modest

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.880
[Alvin]: I can't hear you over the thousands of fans screaming my name

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.580
[NC]: This does make me realize, though: bringing back characters from a previous installment often equals success...

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.560
Well that's what I'm gonna do.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.500
I'm going to bring back characters from the previous review!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.460
BRING IN THE "AWW" GIRLS!

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.180
(explosion)

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.020
(all three in unison) AAAAAWWWWWWWW!!

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.040
[NC]: Come on in, ladies!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.280
If your awkward remembrance can help my fortune, all the better!

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.780
(the girls laugh)

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.760
[AWW Tamara]: You got it, Critic!

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.340
[AWW Aiyanna]: Setting adorable letters to "iwwitating"!

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.920
[AWW Heather]: Let's do this!

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.400
[NC]: So Dave is taken down by a clumsy cardboard cutout...

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.580
— sounds like a metaphor for Lee's career to me —

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
...and he's left out of most of the movie.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.180
...Okay! Off you go!

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.240
[AWW Heather]: W-Wait, that's... it?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.580
[NC]: Yeah! Apparently it's better to remind people you exist and then totally terminate you from the project!

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.220
[AWW Aiyanna]: But we barely did anything...!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.160
[NC]: ...And that's what's gonna make us tons of money...

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.580
-Now, off you go! Off you go!

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.080
Out! Out, Out!

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.320
Get out! Out out!

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.080
To the couch of underused cameos!

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.620
[AWW Aiyanna]: Hey...

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.860
...Weren't you in the Spy Kids 3D review?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.060
[Doesn't Count]: Doesn't count...

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.300
[AWW Tamara]: I hear that...

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.540
[NC]: Dave tells 'em that they're gonna stay with their aunt Jackie

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.580
[Jackie]: ...its just me and my ganja...
*laugh track*

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.160
[NC]: ...Noo, not that one - though it would explain why shes seeing chipmunks.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.700
No, this character is similar to miss Miller From the cartoon...

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.600
...though its not ms. Miller from the cartoon,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.280
because that means someone who made this movie would have had to actually WATCH the cartoon.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.200
[Jackie]: (...) have a hug first...?
[Alvin]: Get over here, ya ol' teddy bear!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.400
[Simon]: ...I'm not really much of a hugger.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.500
[NC]: That's okay, that wasn't really much of a joke...

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.020
...But, okay, I'm catching on: aunt Jackie is going to be the new caretaker and there's of course gonna be some comedic adjustments.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.660
...All right then, I introduce you to Granny Tammy!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.960
Say hi, Tammy!
[Tammy]: Hi, sonny! What's cookin'?!

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.700
[NC]: Oh ho hoo, granny Tammy! I can tell we're gonna have a lot of quirky adventures together!

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.900
...on to the next scene.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.940
[Jackie]: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa...
*braking sound, then crash*

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.540
[NC]: Uhh, d- Oh-kay... *beep*

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.240
*CRASH*
This is what the people wanna see, apparently!

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.620
...Man, in literally five minutes, two of the caretakers who SHOULD have been major roles have been taken out!

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.580
Well, at this rate everyone will be DEAD at the 25- minute mark!

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.040
[Basil Fawlty]: Two dead, twenty-five to go! *laugh track*

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.740
[NC]: ...Instead we get her son Toby, played by Zachary Levy,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.300
who you may remember as Chuck, or Flynn from Tangled,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.840
...and here, where he plays his biggest role as the poor man's Jimmy Fallon.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.460
[Levy]: I'm not gonna do like (in raspy voice): "I know everything, and...

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.760
...you do this and you do that...!" ...Like my dad.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.000
[NC]: ...Okay, NOW I think I'm catching on. Bring in the "D'AWW" Girls!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.340
*smoke bomb*
(D'AWW girls in unison): D'AWWWWWW!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.200
[AWW Heather]: Wait a minute! Those are like the exact same characters!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.780
[NC]: Whaaaat? No they're nooot!

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.740
[AWW Aiyanna]: Yes they are! They look like us, SOUND like us, they even have the exact same characteristics.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.020
[AWW Tamara]: Yeah - you can't even tell us apart!

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.320
[NC]: No! It's totally different, see:

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.700
...they have shirts of countries with no names on 'em.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.400
...you know, those obscure shirts you saw all over the place...!

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.040
[D'AWW Tamara]: Look, mine's U.S.!
[D'AWW Heather]: Mine's Canada!

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.060
[D'AWW Aiyanna]: ...And mine's SO obscure it doesn't even HAVE a country.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.100
[D'AWW Heather]: It's an ironic statement.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.060
[AWW Tamara]: ...Of what?

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.920
[D'AWW Aiyanna]: That we... l-like... 
irony?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.160
[NC]: I'm SO glad you see the brand new comedic possibilities of this.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.760
...Now, you three - into the studio...!

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.120
[D'AWW Tamara]: Wait, what.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.920
[NC]: Yeah! You're still barely in this.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.160
*all three try to protest at the same time*

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.700
[NC]: INTO THE STUDIO! *cracks whip*
*girls yelp*

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.740
*NC keeps cracking the whip and yelling, the girls keep making high-pitched noises*

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.100
[NC]: ...It's so hard to make a family franchise...!

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.040
...So they partake in all sorts of comedic gold.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.580
Like singing "Staying Alive", except making it about... cheese balls...

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.460
[Alvin]: ♪Well you can tell by the way I use my walk, I'm a cheese balls man, no time to talk...♪

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.240
*slaps table*
[NC]: ...Because SOMEBODY finally saw the comedic possibilities in THAT!

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.660
...And of course, the essential "slow-mo kicking pan to open cheese balls,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.220
...while holding high note for song about... cheese balls".

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.980
Oh, yeah - NOW that joke suddenly makes sense.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.340
...You know, I'm not gonna lie, I expected more out of the director of "Private Parts" and "The Brady Bunch Movie"...

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.960
...but I also suspected less out of the same director of "Dr. Dolittle" and "John Tucker Must Die".

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.180
...So I guess it evens out!

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.400
...But fear not, literally 42 SECONDS LATER they sing ANOTHER pointless rendition of a musical hit!

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.520
[Alvin]: ♪You spin me right round,
[Chipmunks, in harmony]: ♪baby right round, like a record baby, right round round round♪

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.120
[NC]: Mhm. Yeah. Why don't you just sing what it really is, guys?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.400
[NC, as 3 chipmunks]: ♪You're a flimsy pretext for another rendition of a classic song gone wrong!♪

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.780
[Alvin]: Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.620
[Simon &amp; Theodore] (laughing): ALLVIIIIIN!

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.140
[NC]: ...I think realistically he's probably shouting "PAYCHEEEECK"...

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.200
...Speaking of which, how you doin' over there, Aww Girls?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.960
That's the spirit.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.900
It also looks like Toby has a cat that he talked about earlier,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.220
...and look! A few scenes later, there he is!

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.120
Okay, a cuddly pet side character! Always a big money-maker! I give you Mr. Yama the Llama!

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.140
*Unseen crowd: AWWWW....*
[NC]: Let the hi-jinks ensue!

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.820
*Toby's cat hisses loudly*
[Toby, almost crying]: ...I treated you good.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.580
*Car door slams*
*Another hiss*

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.720
*click*

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.640
*BANG*
[NC]: Yeah, I don't follow it, I'm just doing what they're doing!

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.200
...But the film tries to punish you further by taking the ONE funny element from the last film - David Cross,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.260
...aand suck out anything that made him enjoyable.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.440
[Cross]: ...I lost everything!
...And it's all because of them...!

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.460
I WILL get you, Chipmunks...

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.820
[NC]: Again, I'm pretty sure that's an exact quote from him from "Chip Wrecked".

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.620
But he's not the only one who gets "chipped off" in this movie:

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.120
the Chipettes enter the film, in their birthday suits...

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.000
...How do these flicks not have censor bars....?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.940
Don't you know the nineties gave cartoon animals private parts?!

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.740
...But what sucks MOST is they got some really funny voice talent behind them:

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.880
Amy Poehler, Anna Faris, and Christina Applegate!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.560
These are all very funny people who are given very unfunny things to do!

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.100
[Brittany]: I'm Brittany, and this is my sister Eleanor.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.320
[Jeanette]: And I'm the sister Jeanette!
...Although I feel more like an Olivia...

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.020
...Or sometimes a...-
[Brittany]: Anyway... we're the Chipettes.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.460
[NC]: Ah ah ah aaaah! I haven't seen such a wasted Anna Faris performance since...

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.220
...Oookay, a lot...
But that "Keanu" cameo was pretty funny!

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.200
What makes it even stranger is that they have almost the exact same voice as the Chipmunks!

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.060
They're, I dare even say... the exact same character!

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.740
Just give 'em the Tumblr treatment!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.320
[Brittany]: Mr. Hawke?
[Cross (Hawke)]: That voice... I can't get it outta my head!

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.060
[NC]: This trope of course goes back a long ways of incorporating a gender-swap of a famous character, or characters.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.220
...And apparently, it still equals gold!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.660
...Well, they're not the only ones who can exploit that- Chester! Doe!

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.500
[Chester]: ...Are you aware that there's three strange ladies with confusing shirts in there...?
[NC]: Never mind all that.

[Chester]: Finally the Bum Mythos will be revealed!

[Cross]: Fascinating. Great. Impress me.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.340
[NC]: Yeah. Okay. I guess we don't need to know your backstory.
[Chester &amp; Doe]: Awww...

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.840
[NC]: Come on, it's like how Baze and the blind guy know each other in Rogue One! They work together!

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.980
That means we immediately know everything about them!

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.780
[Chester]: ...I think that's more how they MET each other rather than how they know each other...
[NC]: ...Exact same thing.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.900
All we need now are some dance numbers - Go!

[Doe]: ...Oh... Uuuuummm...?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.160
[NC]: Nyehh, on second thought: the movie seems tired of that too, now it's about Alvin and the Chipmunks trying to blend into high school.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.540
So um... go to school I guess while... performing some... musical... sequences.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.800
[Doe]: I guess going to dance school could kill two birds with one stone!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.340
[NC]: But be prepared to change your motivations on a whim! That's what makes the big bucks.

This gets him a trip to the principal's office.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.860
[Principal]: I should suspend all three of you.
[Alvin]: Please do.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:59.460
[NC]: ...Okay. How unfocused does a film have to be when looking at a bobblehead made it into your script?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.480
[NC, as Chipmunks writer]: She says "I should suspend you", he says "Please do"...

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.580
Aw crap, I just wrote that into the script!

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.000
(under breath) Eh what do I care, it's Alvin and the Chipmunks...

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.460
...But of course violence towards others is fine, as long as the principal is a fan of your work.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.920

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.640
...But Alvin and the gang find out about the Chipettes and try to save them.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.060
...Except in the first film, when the chipmunks were in a cage, and they skipped the lame pointless climax...

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.640
...this time we GET the lame pointless climax! Ohh, y ip- fucking pee.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.940
[Alvin]: IAN! In the words of the Donald: "You're fired!"

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.380
[NC]:...Yes...!

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.560
THOSE will be the most memorable words that we ever take away from "the Donald".

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.120
...I suppose when you think about it there's-
*Twitter notification*

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.580
How is he tweeting about me already!? I'm not even done with the joke!

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.620
They say they can make it back to the school competition in time, with their good friend: Digger.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.020
[Alvin]: I'm gonna get a little help from my friend, Digger!

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.600
[Digger]: Roger that, Alvin!
[Cross]: Look out!
[Digger]: WHOA! Feels like I'm back at the racetrack!

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.480
[NC]: Don't make me do it. Please, God - don't make me do it.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.860
(sarcastically) WHO'S DIGGER...?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.460
"Digger is a character from NASCAR when shown on the Fox network".

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.300
How DARE you make me look up NASCAR, you MONSTERS!

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.800
Cross chases 'em down with a toy helicopter,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.660
- because a toy NASCAR would have been too obvious...-

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.940
...as they try to get the remote out of his hands.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.720
[Jeanette]: I'm going for it! Grab my ankles!
*slow-mo yell*

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.020
[Jeanette]: I got it!
*gasp* ...I got it...!

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.940
[No idea which chipmunks say this]: Way to go, Jen!/ Nice work Jeanette!/ Good going Jen!

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.340
[NC]: Because of course!!!!

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.920
This was Jeanette's story the whole time! How friggin' obvious!

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.540
...Here, I thought maybe... -- Just MAYBE...

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.020
...it was about...

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:52.420
the concert, the football game, going to school, parenting, working together, egos, Toby's girlfriend, jealousy, fitting in, family values or trusting your heart...

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.200
But NO!

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.180
It was about Jeanette conquering her fear of heights!

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.500
Which has NEVER been brought up in the entire movie, until right. NOW.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.800
*bonk.*

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.340
...So they get to the concert at the school and perform.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.020
[Principal]: I give you the Chipettes and the Chipmunks!
[NC, as chipmunk]: But we haven't had any time to rehearse-- okay.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.300
[Chipmunks perform "We Are Family", obviously]

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.260
[Announcer]: It's clear that we have a winner...!

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.340
[NC]: Uh *ahem* yeah, the judges haven't voted yet--
[Announcer]: ...Of the 25.000 dollars...!

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.200
[NC]: Lotta money to give away, just... on the fly--
[Announcer]: And it's WEST EASTMAN HIGH!

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.060
[NC]: You know the uh... first act was technically a lot better a- okay, the chipmunks win.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.820
[Alvin]: We did it!

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.240
[NC]: Creepy announcer, gladly give them to creepy principal! This seems very wrong!

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.820
Meanwhile at the Stadium, despite the movie preetty much promising us Britney Spears,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.660
she never shows up in the film and instead, we get... this.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.360
[Cross] (in falsetto): ♪All the single ladies, all the single ladies... *crowd violently boos* ...you wanna get married... and have a ring... put your riings on-♪

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.740
[NC]: Again, is this... REALLY that much different from how we've seen Britney before...?

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.940
...I'm kinda shocked the audience could tell the difference.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.240
[Chris Crocker]: SHE'S A HUMAN!!!

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.840
[NC]: Okay, 2007...!

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:22.120
...So that was "the SUCK-quel". It's all over the place, not funny, boring, unimaginative... and has no focus.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.480
It's stupid, it's dumb, it's...

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.460
"Dum-pid".

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.680
(evilly) ...And I just imitated it perfectly...!

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:35.540
Practically line for line, I got the formula down! That means I'm gonna be making MILLIONS in a matter of seconds!

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.520
All I have to do is count all the moolah I'm gonna make from this point on!

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.720
And the turnout iiis...
*computer beeping and dramatic rising note*

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.820
AVERAGE!!?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.020
W-w-w-- What about being number one at the box office!?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.800
[Malcolm]: Uhh, Critic...

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.660
None of the Chipmunk movies were ever number one at the box office.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.820
Ever.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.860
[NC]: WHAT!?
[D'AWW Tamara]: They did okay, because they rode on the success of other December movies.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.920
[D'AWW Aiyanna]: They've been the one family film clearly not trying to win any awards.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.900
[NC]: ...But then why did so many people go and see it?

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.480
[D'AWW Heather] (gradually rising in pitch): High pitched voices are CUUUUTE!

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.280
[D'AWW Girls]: D'AWWWWWWWWWW!
[Malcolm]: Aw...

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.980
[NC] (mockingly): So by THAT logic I can make a million, just by--

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.240
[Hannibal Lecter] (sped and pitched up a lot): Quid pro quo, I tell you things, you tell me things.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
...Yes or no Clarice?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.240
[Clarice]: Go, doctor.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.360
[NC]: You know, the movie was right -  more kids DO need to see this film...

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.220
[Malcolm]: ...And now they will because you put it in the kids' section on Netflix!

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.680
[Hannibal]: The significance of the moth is change... caterpillar into chrysalis... or pupa.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.100
*cell phone rings*
[NC]: That'll be one of millions of angry parents!

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.720
Your money's already mine, I don't care!

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:42.860
I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I don't get it, I just exploit it!
[D'AWW Tamara]: D'aww, it's like Hannibal ate Fred...!

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.300
[D'AWW Aiyanna]: ...I smell a squeak-quel...!
[Hannibal]: ...You use Evyan skin cream... but not today...

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:55.520
[Nostalgia Critic Theme]

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.860
[Alvin]: ...with some fava beans and a niiice Chianti! *slurping*

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.940
[Doug]: Hey, Doug Walker, doing the charity shout-out, and this week we are doing the American Red Cross.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:57.600
American Red Cross prevents human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.900
Through its strong network, they're always there in times of need,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.440
aspiring to turn compassion into action,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:10.080
they work so that all people affected by disaster around the world receive care, shelter, and hope.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:19.540
They make sure their communities are ready and prepared for disaster so everyone in that country has access to safe, life-saving blood and blood products.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.340
They also make sure that all members of our armed forces and their families find support and comfort whenever it's needed.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:33.580
And that in emergencies, there's always trained individuals nearby, ready to use their Red Cross skills to save lives.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:39.380
If you check out their site or their Youtube channel, you can see where both your financial or blood donation goes.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.200
You've probably heard this name dozens of times, and there's a good reason:

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.440
it's a good, GOOD organization that does such incredible work.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.160
They help anyone and everyone in need.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.340
So definitely, take a look, and see how you can help, in their great cause.
