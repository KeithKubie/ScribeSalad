00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
I love problems like this, they're so much fun,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.480
they're like logic puzzles you have to work through. Even

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.288
if you don't get them right the first try, it's

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:11.880
really fun to keep going, and try to gather as

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.048
much information as you can, to make the best possible

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.619
guess. In this case the answer I was looking for

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.872
is 1 6th, or one out of six. You might

00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:25.455
have also had 1.6 repeating. Or something around 16.6% repeating,

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.639
something like that. Fractions are easier to deal with

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.250
here so let's try to work with that. Let's think

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.150
about this for a second. We know it's an autosomal

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.310
recessive pedigree so if that's true, it means males and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.210
females are affected equally because this is on an autosomes

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.300
somewhere. This affected male here, this must mean that he

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.970
is homozygous recessive. If he's homozygous recessive, we know that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.730
his parents had at least one recessive copy a piece,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580
because he would have had to have gotten both

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.140
of his copies from his parents. Well, they must

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560
have a recessive copy, but they're not affected. This

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.390
means they must have a dominant, normal copy here. So

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.610
his parents must be heterozygous. We figured all that

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.046
out already. So now let's look at his siblings. We

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:12.030
know they're not affected so they're not minus minus,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530
but they could be either plus plus or plus minus.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.660
Right, so there are two options here. Let's focus on

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.400
this female, because this female is involved in the reproductive

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.990
event here. So to figure out what the probability is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.600
that this individual is heterozygous because that's the only way that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.870
they can pass this allele on and have an affected

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.336
child. Is we gotta figure out the probability of this individual

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:37.620
being heterozygous. We're going to do the Punnet squares of the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.830
parents. Right if the mom and dad here are both hets.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.120
Then we could either have a plus plus, a

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.270
plus minus, a plus minus, or a minus minus.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.500
Now, we know already it can't be a minus

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.090
minus. So let's get rid of that option right

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.010
there. That gives us three options left. Two out

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.670
of three of those are the het. So we're

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.490
going to say she's a two thirds probability. Of being

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.970
heterozygous. Now let's do the same thing over here.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.150
We know that the mother is infected, which means

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.380
that she is homozygous recessive, in the same way

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.070
that we figure it out over here. Her son

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.530
is unaffected. So that means he must have at

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.690
least one normal dominant copy. But he must also

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.150
have one recessive copy, because the mother only had

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.190
a recessive copy to give. So he must be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.830
heterozygous. That's a probability of one that he's heterozygous. Now,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.900
if he's heterozygous and the person he's mating with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.050
is also heterozygous. Set up their Punnett squares. They

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.430
could have a plus plus, a plus minus, a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.520
plus minus, or a minus minus. Only one of these

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.510
cases is an effected individual, the homozygous recessive, so

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.100
that's one in four. So now what we have

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.980
to do is multiply all our probabilities together. We

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.920
don't add them we multiply them. So the probability that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.240
this guy is heterozygous. Is one. So we do one. The probability that

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.620
the mother is heterozygous is 2 3rds and the probability that they'll actually

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.760
have an offspring that's affected is 1 4th. So this would be 2 over 12

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.330
which is equal to 1 over 6. Now, that's a simple one.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.490
Imagine if I gave you a hard one. Hopefully,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.100
you'll have a little more respect for those genetic counsellors.
