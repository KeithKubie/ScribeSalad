00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.580
We're having a conversation.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.540
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.080
Right? That's different, than how people generally communicate,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.260
because usually when they communicate,
they're doing something like:

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.260
"Okay, we're gonna have a conversation -

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.560
- and I'm gonna tell you why I'm right,
and I'll win, if you agree."

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.660
Or maybe you're having a conversation, where...

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.220
I don't know what you're trying to do, maybe you're trying to impress the person you're talking to.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.260
So you're not listening to them at all,
you're just thinking about what you're gonna say next.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.480
Okay, so that's not THIS. This is:

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.520
"You might have something to tell me.
And so, I'm gonna listen on the off chance,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.440
that you'll tell me something,
that would really be useful for me to know."

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.740
And so, you can think about it as an-
as an extension of the Piagetian....

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.460
You know, Piaget talked about the fundamental...

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.660
the fundamentally important element of knowledge,
being: to describe, how knowledge is sought.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.720
The process, by which knowledge is generated.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.380
Well... if you agree with me, and I find that out - I know nothing more than I knew before,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.900
I just know, what I knew before.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.420
And maybe I'm happy about that, because you know, it didn't get challenged.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.500
But I'm no smarter than I was before.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.520
But maybe you're different than me, and so,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.360
while I'm listening to you, you'll tell me something I wouldn't- [something] I don't like.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.100
Maybe it's something I find contemptible, or difficult, whatever.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
Maybe you'll find, [that] you'll tell me something
I don't know, and then I won't be quite as stupid.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.660
And then, maybe I won't run painfully into quite as many things.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.160
And that's a really useful thing to know,
especially if you live with someone,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.500
and you're trying to... make long-term peace with them, as they're not the same as you.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.600
And the way they look at the world, and the facts that they pull out of the world, aren't the same as your facts.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.780
And, even though you're going to be overwhelmed
with the proclivity to demonstrate that you're right,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840
it is the case, that two brains are better than one.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
And so, maybe 9 of the 10 things they tell you are dispensable,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.160
or maybe even 49 out of 50, but ONE thing,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680
all you need to get out of the damn conversation,
is one thing you don't know.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.920
And one of the things, that's very cool about a good psychotherapeutic session is, that the whole conversation is like that.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.640
All you're doing, is trying to...
express the truth of the situation

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.460
as clearly, as possible - that's it!

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.540
And so, now... Rogers' proposition
(and I'll you, why he derived it),

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.440
was that if you have a conversation like that
with someone, it will make both of you better.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.500
It'll make both of you psychologically healthier.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.920
So there's an implicit presupposition,
that the exchange of truth is curative.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.880
Well, that's a very cool idea!
I mean, it's a very deep idea,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.760
uh, I think it's the most profound idea...

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.880
[stutter] It's the- it's the idea, upon western civil-

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.980
upon which western civilization (although not only western civilization), is actually predicated.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.460
The idea, that truth produces health.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.280
But for Rogers, that was the entire purpose of the psychotherapeutical alliance.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040
[i.e.:] You come to see me,
because you want to be better.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.080
You don't even know what that means, necessarily,
neither do I - we're gonna figure that out together.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.180
But you come and you say: "Look,
things are not acceptable to me,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.360
and maybe, there's something I could do about that."

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.280
So, that's the minimal precondition to engage in therapy:

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.060
Something's wrong, you're willing to talk about it truthfully, and you want it to be better.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.460
Without that, the therapeutic relationship
does not get off the ground.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.640
And so, then you might ask: "Well,
what relationships are therapeutic?"

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.140
And the answer to that, would be: If you
have a real relationship, it's therapeutic.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.495
If it isn't, what you have is not a relationship.
God only knows, what you have.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.320
You're a slave, they're a tyrant, you know.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.580
You're both butting heads with one another,
it's a primate dominance hierarchy dispute.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.680
Or, I don't know, you're like two cats in a barrel, or two
people with their hands around each other's throats.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.020
But what you have, is not a relationship.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.500
So... alright.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.520
[reads from the slide]
- We may say, that the greater the communicated concrugance of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.060
That's- that's a reference to the same idea,
that I was describing with regards to Jung.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.440
So, let's say...

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.540
You come and talk to me,
and you want things to go well.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.800
Well, I'm gonna have to more-or-less be one thing,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.520
because if I'm all over the place,
you can't trust any continuity in what I say.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.200
[stutter]

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.540
There's no reason for you to believe,
that I'm capable of actually telling you...

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.800
I'm capable of expressing anything, that's true.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.840
So the Truth is something, that emerges as
a consequence of getting yourself lined up,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.260
and beating all the...

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.640
what would you call.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.300
All the impurities, out of your... (x3)
soul, for lack of a better word.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.680
You have to be integrated for that to happen.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.140
And you do that, at least in part,
by wanting to tell the truth.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.620
[reads the slide again]
- The more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency toward reciprocal communication with the same qualities.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.040
So, one of the things that've been quite influenced by Rogers,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.460
[and] one of the things I try to do in my therapeutic sessions,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.340
is, first of all - to listen, to really listen.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.160
And then - while I listen, I watch,
and while I'm listening, thing will happen in my head.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.320
You know, maybe I'll get a little image of something,
or I'll get a thought, or a question will emerge;

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.320
and then I'll just tell that person, what that is.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.620
But it's sort of directionless, you know, it's not like I have a goal - except that we're trying to make things better.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.320
I'm on the side of the person...

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.020
I'm on the side of the part of the person,
that wants things to be better, not worse.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.740
And so, those parts of us have a dialogue, and the consecuence of that dialogue, is that certain things take place!

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.440
And then I'll just tell the person what happened.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.380
And it isn't that I'm right.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.880
That's not the point! The point is, that they get to have an hour with someone, that actually tells them, what they think.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.820
"Here's the impact you're having on me".

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.320
You know? "This is making me angry. This is making me happy. This is really interesting".

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.960
"This reminds me of something that you said
an hour ago, that I don't quite understand."

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.780
And the whole... the whole point is not, for either person,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.520
to make the proposition or convince the other,
that their position is correct,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.560
but merely to have an exchange of experience,
about how things are set up.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.220
And it's extraordinarily useful for people, because it's often difficult

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.440
for anyone, to find anyone to talk to, that will actually listen!

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.080
[inhale]

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.120
And so, another thing that's really strange about this listening, is that

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.120
if you listen to people, they will tell you the weirdest bloody things!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.440
So fast, you just cannot believe it!

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.540
So, if you're having a conversation with someone, and it's dull -

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.340
- it's because you're stupid! That's why.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.760
You're not listening to them properly,
because they're weird, they're like...

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.260
wombats, or albatrosses, or rhinoceroses
or something, like, they're strange creatures.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.880
And so, if you were actually communicating with them,
and they were telling you, how weird they really are,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.720
it would be- it would be anything, but boring.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.960
So... and you can ask questions,
that's a really good way of listening.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.420
But, you know, one of Rogers' points is: Well,
you have to be oriented properly, in order to listen.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.240
And the orientation has to be: "Look,
what I want out of this conversation,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.100
is that the place we both end up,
is better than the place we left.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.360
That's it! That's what I'm after."

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.740
And if you're not after that, you gotta think:
Why the hell wouldn't you be after that?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.840
What could you possibly be after,
that would be better than that?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.980
You walk away, smarter and more well-equipped for the world,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.100
than you were, before you had the conversation - and so does the other person.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.760
Well, maybe if you're bitter and resentful, and angry, and anxious, and you know - generally annoyed at the world,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.100
then, that isn't what you want.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.240
You want the other person to walk away worse,
and you too, cause you're full of revenge!

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.480
But, you know...

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.040
You'll get what you want, if you do that.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.240
So...

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.320
[reads the next slide]
● We know from our research that such emphatic understanding -

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.800
So, I've already defined that:
a) I wanna hear you,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.400
b) I wanna hear what you have to say,
so we can clarify it and move forward,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.500
c) I wanna have your best interest in mind,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.920
d) and mine as well! But, you know,
both at the same time.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.000
e) your family's too, if we can manage that.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.900
We're after making things better.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.500
● We know from our research that such emphatic understanding -

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.180
- understanding with the person, not about him - is such an effective approach, that it can bring about major changes in personality.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.340
● Some of you may be feeling, that you listen well to people, and that you have never seen such results.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.920
The chances are very great, that you have not been listening, in the manner that I've described.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.520
● Fortunately, I can suggest a little experiment that you can do, to test the quality of your understanding.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.180
● The next time you get into an argument with
your wife, or your friend, or small group of friends,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.200
stop the discussion for a moment,
and for an experiment, institute this rule.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.700
● "Each person can speak up for himself only
after he has first restated the ideas and

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.440
feelings of the previous speaker accurately."

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.340
What "accurately" means, is - they have to agree with your restatement.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.560
Now, that's an annoying thing to do.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.580
Because if someone is talking to you,
and you disagree with them,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.240
the first thing you wanna do, is take their argument and make the stupidest possible thing out of it, that you can,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.760
(that's the "Strawman"), and then demolish it!

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.460
It's like... So then you can walk away feeling good about it, that you know, [stutters] you primate domins-

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.860
Dominated them really nicely, so...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.480
But that isn't what you do! You say:
"Okay well, I'm gonna take what you told me,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
and maybe I'm even gonna make your argument stronger, than the one you made."

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.560
That's useful, if you're dealing with someone that you have to live with.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.760
Because maybe they can't bloody well express themself very well, but they have something to say!

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.320
So, you make their argument strong.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.520
Alright, then - you see what this would mean:

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.540
● It would mean, that before presenting
your own point of view, it would be necessary

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.660
for you to really achieve the other speaker's
frame of reference - to understand his

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.820
thoughts and feelings so well,
that you could summarize them for him.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:50.100
● Sound simple, doesn't it? But if you will try it, you'll find that it's the most difficult thing, that you've ever done.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.800
Ok, good. We'll leave it at that,
and then we'll see you on Tuesday.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.940
[applause]
