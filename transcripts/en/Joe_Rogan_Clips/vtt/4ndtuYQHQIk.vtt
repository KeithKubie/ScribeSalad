00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.600
The Joe Rogan experience with you anymore.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.650
Someone that you deeply loved and cared about.
You want them to suffer.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.820
It's weird.
It's weird.
I mean,
it's normal.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.040
So I guess it's not that weird,
but that the evil,
vicious jealousy,
you know,

5
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.130
like you see that vicious jealousy and chimpanzees,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.070
like one of the things that chimpanzees do when the attack people,

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.250
one of the things they attack people over is unfairness.
Like a,

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.440
there was a terrible story about a guy who had kept a pet chimp and then brought

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.200
the chimp a birthday cake on his birthday.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.830
Brian Posehn as a whole bit about it does it does you really?
Yeah.
Um,

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.100
and the other chimps found out that this chimps getting the birthday cake and I

12
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.950
saw it and they weren't getting any cake and they were fucking furious.

13
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:48.530
So someone had inadvertently left one of the gates open.
So the chimps got out,

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.350
tour this guy apart because of a birthday cake.
But it's that thing.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.020
It's not like it was affecting them.
I was like,

16
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.530
he was doing something bad to them.
So they got out and killed him.
No,

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.530
they ripped his dick off because they didn't like the fact that give the other

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:05.250
champ a birthday cake.
Took his dick,
took his fingers,
took his feet.
But yeah,

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.040
yeah,
yeah.
Plus it's so funny.
He's like,

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.490
the worst thing about that story for that guy is that everyone's gonna want to

21
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.350
hear it forever because it starts with,

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.540
so it was bringing a birthday cake to a chimpanzee and then you got to hear the

23
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:22.290
rest.
But that,
that anger and jealousy,

24
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.020
like there's evolution doesn't an evolutionary basis for,
oh,

25
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.100
is that what he looks like now?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I'm going to show.
It's tough.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.960
His fingers are missing his face,
his Muslim,
he's got one eye.
His nose is gone.

27
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.430
Oh,
look at that.
Frown on her face was ripped apart.

28
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.800
The pro stitched it together that way.
Awful.
Yeah.
It's fucking awful,

29
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.120
man.
Yeah.
You can't own a chimp crazy assholes.

30
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.470
They're the most vicious of all the primates next to people.

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.040
Aren't they good for like you can put like train them for like the first like

32
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.170
five years of their life and then they forget everything.

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.800
They just decided they're gonna fuck you up.
Yeah.
And they're so strong.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.440
What does that one doing?
Is that the chimp?
No,
no,

35
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:07.960
but it just popped up in the same group of pictures,
shoes,
hairless champion.

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.840
There's some mean such a,
it's such a mean species.
You know,

37
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.841
there's a problem with Columbus monkeys in parts of Africa where chimps live

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.510
because they've eaten so many columns.

39
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.170
Monkeys that there the populations down 97%.
Yeah.

40
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.270
They rip them apart and eat them a lot while they're alive.

41
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.450
Either tiny colobus monkeys.
It's not big,
big enough to eat.

42
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.690
But uh,

43
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.780
is it David Attenborough documentary from the 90s where they first discovered

44
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.760
that chimps eat monkeys?
They really didn't know.

45
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.500
They thought the chimps were basically herbivores and then they got this video

46
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:47.760
footage of them hunting these monkeys and the way they would corral them and

47
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:49.680
beat them through the trees and then catch them.

48
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:54.681
And this monkey screaming while this chimp is ripping and apart from the hips

49
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.930
and just chewing it up,
pulling it apart from the,
and he's like,

50
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.530
and he's like basically ripping his legs in his ass,

51
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.680
end off and just eating it alive.
God,
Sam,

52
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.030
they're fucking mean man.
They're fucking mean to mean animal.

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.220
But w w what the,
I get the fact that,
look,
everything's mean in the jungle.

54
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.140
There's big cats and poisonous snakes and spiders and it's just a hard,
hard,

55
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.974
hard world.

56
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.880
But the thing that drives that gets me is the jealousy because I don't think

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.440
other animals experience jealousy the way chimps do this is that it right there.

58
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.070
Uh,
from the Attenborough,
they,
them,
they actually caught it.
Yeah.

59
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.420
So that's a monkey in his hand.
Jesus.
Yeah,
Dude.

60
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:41.620
The videos of it killing it while they're pulling it apart.
Like,
Whoa,

61
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.630
but the,
that jealousy that I want you to suffer,
I didn't get that fucking cake.

62
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.720
Oh,
you don't let me have that cake.
I can't get any cake.

63
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.290
I'm going to pull your fucking Dick off on a bite your nose off like that.

64
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.210
That is a,
as a strange trait for an animal to have.
Oh yeah.
No,

65
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.690
I mean,
I think it's a terrible trait for a human being to have.
Oh yeah,

66
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.050
we are animals.
Yeah.
It's something a you got to work on,

67
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.830
but when it comes to divorce,
like that's that same thing.
It's like that same,

68
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.040
I'm on it.
I'll fucking suffer.
I want to play your tech off.

69
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:16.000
And that's why people hire hitman and shit to kill their ex wives and kill her

70
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:20.590
ex husband's Liam.
People don't get less crazy as they age.
No,

71
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.490
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

72
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.490
A lot of times they get more because they realize it's almost over the ride's

73
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:31.300
over and now you know,
you're 65 year old lady.

74
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.500
No one's a fuck you and your 65 year old man,
no wants to fuck you either.

75
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.610
And now all of a sudden you guys are battling,
you know?
Yeah.

76
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.490
Battling over finances and this and that.

77
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.840
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
