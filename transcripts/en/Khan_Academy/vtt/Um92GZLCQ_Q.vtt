00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.270
Male: What I'm going to
talk about in this video

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.401
is one of the darker
periods in Chilean history

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.668
and depending on your point of view,

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:08.539
also one of the darker
periods in American history.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.353
What I want to make clear in this video,

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.348
and it applies to every
video I'll make in history,

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:15.202
is be skeptical of everything
that I'm telling you.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.268
I'm going to do my best
attempt to give a reasonably

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.067
accurate series of events
and draw connections

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.016
when they're clear and
also make it clear where

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:26.599
there might be connections
and no one is sure.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.681
But you should be skeptical
and frankly you should

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.473
be skeptical of anything
anyone is telling you.

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:32.803
I encourage y'all to kind
of use this as a scaffold

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.850
for your own research, for you to look up

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.934
these names and these
events and figure out

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.433
what actually happened.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.096
Now, with that said,
let's rewind back to 1970

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.403
when Chile was having an
election for president.

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:47.269
And they have their
election and it's considered

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.351
a fairly free and fair election,

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:51.872
and one of the candidates in that election

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:53.203
was this gentleman over here,

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:57.267
Salvadore Allende, who
was a known Marxist.

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:59.680
A known Marxist.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.334
He has communist ideologies here.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.204
He's known to be sympathetic to what has

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:10.801
happened in Cuba,
sympathetic to the Soviets.

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:16.127
So you can imagine in this
context America is concerned.

00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:17.401
It's in the middle of the cold war.

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.401
You have Richard Nixon President.

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:22.810
You have Henry Kissinger
is his Secretary of State.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.410
They're actively watching this election.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.127
They clearly do not want Salvadore Allende

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:28.579
to become president.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.915
All of a sudden a major
country in Latin America

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:34.318
being controlled by a Marxist.

00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:37.253
Unlucky for them, Salvadore
Allende actually does

00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:39.383
get more votes than everyone else.

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:44.210
He gets 36% of the votes,
which is a plurality.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.250
Just so you know what
plurality means, it means

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.034
that you got more of the
votes than anyone else

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:50.986
but not necessarily the
majority of the votes.

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.913
If he'd gotten 51% of the
votes that would be a majority.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.517
In this case, he didn't get a majority

00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:58.516
and the standard
procedure in Chile is that

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:00.990
if no one gets a majority
it goes to Congress

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.034
and Congress picks who's president.

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:06.333
The usual thing that they
would do is they would

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.530
pick whoever has the
largest amount of votes.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.201
They normally didn't do a runoff.

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.116
So, you can imagine Nixon and
Kissinger they're worried.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:16.717
So they kind of get into
let's mess with what's going

00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:18.180
on in Chile mode.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.717
And this part is well
established that they had this

00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:21.948
what they called a track one strategy

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:24.784
of actually trying to
get the Chilean congress

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:28.638
to not do what they normally
do, to not pick the guy

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:31.109
with the largest number of votes.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.116
So, they were trying to
mess there, didn't seem

00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:33.983
like something they would
be able to pull off.

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:36.839
The other thing that it
looks like they started

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.183
to kind of get involved
with through the CIA

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:46.336
is they started to at least
interface, it's not clear

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:49.084
how much they actually
supported, they actually

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:52.719
started to talk to people
in the military and see

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.250
how likely is a coup to happen.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.083
How likely is Allende to be overthrown

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.515
if he becomes president?

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.853
They were looking for
people who could I guess

00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:07.666
keep this known Marxist
from becoming president.

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:11.782
And the number one problem
was this guy right over here,

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:14.753
the number one problem was
this guy right over here.

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:17.748
In this whole video I would
say that Rene Schneider

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:21.084
was the only unambiguously
good guy in this video.

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:24.588
He was the commander in chief
of the Chilean military.

00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:29.315
He said, "Look, I don't
care who becomes president.

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:31.586
I don't care how much I disagree with him.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.654
I don't care how much
pressure the Americans

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:35.407
put on me or how much
pressure the rest of the

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:39.115
military puts on me, the
role of the Chilean military

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:42.050
is not to mess with politics."

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.452
The called him the constitutionalist.

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:47.068
"The role of the Chilean
military is not to overthrow

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:49.153
people when we don't like them.

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:52.517
The role of the Chilean military
is only to defend Chile.

00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:54.323
It's only to literally do ..."

00:03:54.323 --> 00:03:55.824
I guess you know what
militaries are supposed to do

00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:59.583
what constitutions say the
military is supposed to do.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.850
So, you can imagine that
the people who wanted

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.818
to overthrow Allende, now that it looks

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:08.114
like he's coming to power.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:11.323
They said this guy is not a
convenient guy to have in power.

00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:13.114
He doesn't like to play the way we play,

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:16.522
even though maybe there
were other elements

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.849
in the military that did want to do that.

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.989
So, this is what's a little bit unclear.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.588
You have this former general
in the Chilean military

00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:27.153
who is clearly anti Allende, and he's also

00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:29.380
anti Schneider because this guy right here

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.585
Roberto Viaux, he thinks
that the military should be

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.652
I guess actively overthrowing dictators

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:39.655
and so there is some
contact between him and

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.121
the CIA.

00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:43.584
It seems like the CIA
may have supplied some

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:45.987
support to him and then
maybe got a little bit

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:47.123
freaked out that ...

00:04:47.123 --> 00:04:48.917
At least Kissinger might
have gotten a little bit

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:52.454
freaked out that this guy
seemed a little bit extreme.

00:04:52.454 --> 00:04:54.916
But remember we're in
this period where Allende

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:58.252
was, he got 36% of the votes, Congress is

00:04:58.252 --> 00:05:00.183
trying to figure out what they do about it

00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:02.657
and during this period there
are some people who say

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:05.111
Well look, if Rene Schneider
is not going to do,

00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:08.455
what's in their mind, the right thing

00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:12.511
and depose the eventual
Allende then we'll have to

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.114
depose Rene Schneider.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.328
So, you have this plot that's worked up by

00:05:16.328 --> 00:05:20.492
Roberto Viaux to essentially
kidnap Rene Schneider.

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:23.248
And that would essentially
depose him from being

00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:24.915
head of the military
and maybe they could put

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:28.112
somebody in his place who
is more likely to have

00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:32.186
a coup, more likely to
want to overthrow Allende.

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:37.741
Unfortunately, when this
guy's people tried to kidnap

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.850
Schneider, Schneider
he's got a gun, he sees

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.568
these guys kidnapping,
he takes out the gun

00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:46.318
and then the kidnappers
shoot him several times

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:48.185
and he eventually dies.

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:53.488
So, this kidnapping turns into
an assasination of Rene Schneider

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:58.184
and they wanted to kill him
or remove him or whatever

00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:00.782
just because he essentially
wanted to do his job.

00:06:00.782 --> 00:06:02.645
So he's the only person
in this whole narrative

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:08.186
where I'll say he was
an unambiguous good guy.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:12.069
Now, what's not clear is how
much involvement the Americans

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.056
or the CIA had in supporting
this kind of assassination

00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:19.283
or this kidnapping of Scheider.

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.919
It does look like they kind of
knew that something was going on.

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.387
This is a quote from Kissinger.

00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:25.111
Seems pretty well substantiated.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:29.132
Where he told Nixon a
few days before Schneider

00:06:29.132 --> 00:06:30.921
was assassinated when
Nixon said hey what's

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.138
going on in Chile?

00:06:32.138 --> 00:06:35.467
Are we working on any
ways through the military

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:37.316
and are we doing anything
about potentially

00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:41.182
maybe about Schneider. I don't
know look that up for yourself.

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:43.723
I don't know how much Nixon
may or may not have known.

00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:47.584
Kissinger told Nixon, "This
looks hopeless. I turned

00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:51.249
it off. Nothing could be
worse than an aborted coup."

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.648
So this quote is interesting
because it looks like

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:55.800
they thought about it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.782
I turned it off.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:59.390
Which implies that at one
point he had it turned on.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.982
So at one point they
were actively thinking

00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:04.391
about working with Roberto
Viaux maybe to kidnap

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:09.473
Schneider, maybe to orchestrate
a coup against Allende,

00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:10.648
but they turned it off.

00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:14.316
So, they're not morally above
doing this kind of thing,

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:16.449
but they decided that this
guy was a little bit ...

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.554
Was not as competent as
maybe they thought he should,

00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:21.051
and at least according
to Kissinger he's saying

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.057
we turned it off because
nothing could be worse

00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:25.057
than an abortive coup.

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:26.782
It turned out that's exactly what happened

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:29.636
because as soon as this
guy got killed everyone

00:07:29.636 --> 00:07:31.516
was like oh my God you have
all these shady elements

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:35.715
who are trying to overthrow
democracy and that

00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:37.919
actually put more pressure
on Congress to say

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.980
hey we have to let
Allende become president.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.724
So, in November he gets
inaugurated president.

00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:49.124
November Allende becomes president.

00:07:49.124 --> 00:07:53.877
There's a bunch of
different stories here how

00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:54.888
much the CIA was involved.

00:07:54.888 --> 00:07:57.223
The counter argument is
look the CIA would not

00:07:57.223 --> 00:08:00.991
have wanted to assassinate
Schneider because this

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:03.382
would have only made Allende
all the more popular.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:06.653
They would have only
maybe wanted to remove him

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.715
and put someone else
there who was more likely

00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:11.651
to have a coup against Allende later.

00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:12.782
Who knows.

00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:14.725
If you believe Kissinger's
words here it looks

00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:17.719
like maybe they provided
some initial support to Viaux

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:19.448
and then they backed off a little bit.

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:20.516
Who knows.

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:24.200
Well, regardless to say by
November of 1970 Salvadore Allende

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.715
became president, and
he started implementing

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:32.382
his kind of Marxist ideology
and it didn't go that well.

00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:35.383
Chile's economy especially
if you fast forward

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:38.910
to 1972, 1973, not doing so well.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.455
He started price-fixing.

00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:43.792
He tried to do the
fairly naive approach of

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:46.254
raising salaries while
keeping prices fixed,

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.382
which will obviously lead to shortages.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.650
So, all around he wasn't
the most popular president.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.873
It didn't look like it,
especially his economic policies

00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:55.313
wereworking out that well.

00:08:55.313 --> 00:08:57.116
People who were pro
Allende would say well look

00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:59.599
just like what the
United States did to Cuba

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:01.594
they started doing to
Chile as soon as they had

00:09:01.594 --> 00:09:03.717
a Marxist in charge,
someone they didn't like.

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:06.929
The United States
started swinging its huge

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:10.677
economic power around to
kind of hurt the Chilean

00:09:10.677 --> 00:09:13.016
economy so that this guy
would come out of power.

00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:15.119
I'll let you decide that.

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:19.677
You fastforward all the
way to 1973 so now Allende

00:09:19.677 --> 00:09:21.978
has been in power for about three years,

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.783
things are not going well for him.

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:25.786
There are strikes going on.

00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:28.183
He tries to clamp down on the media a bit.

00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:31.181
There is unrest.

00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:33.592
There are people who definitely don't want

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:38.516
him to be president
anymore, and the people who

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:40.119
don't think much of the
United States will say

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:41.854
hey but the United
States the whole time was

00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:44.927
kind of actively undermining
Allende and that's probably true.

00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:46.646
The United States will
say no look we were trying

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:48.183
to keep the press free.

00:09:48.183 --> 00:09:49.847
This guy was clamping down on free press.

00:09:49.847 --> 00:09:52.597
We were trying to keep
things so that there will

00:09:52.597 --> 00:09:54.648
be another election so that this guy won't

00:09:54.648 --> 00:09:56.787
turn into another Fidel
Castro and essentially

00:09:56.787 --> 00:10:01.519
just turn Chile into a
totalitarian communist regime.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:06.259
Regardless of which side you
take, on September 11, 1973,

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:08.267
Allende is deposed.

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:12.385
The military surrounds
the presidential palace

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:17.452
and it is said that he commits "suicide."

00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:18.717
I put that in quotes
because once again some

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:21.115
people believe that he
really did commit suicide.

00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:23.775
Some people believe that
he was assassinated,

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:26.118
and some accounts say
that he committed suicide

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:28.182
with an automatic weapon and well I guess

00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:30.099
you could commit suicide
with an automatic weapon

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:32.011
but it doesn't seem like
the weapon of choice

00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.785
for many peoples, but
I'll leave that once again

00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:36.101
for you to decide.

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:40.180
Whether or not he committed
suicide or whether he was killed,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.515
but regardless to say September 11 he gets

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:45.852
thrown out of power and
once again it's not clear

00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:50.051
what role the CIA played.

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:52.115
They clearly were
sympathetic to the people

00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:53.452
that wanted to overthrow him.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.261
Clearly were providing
indirect support throughout

00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:59.648
Allende's regime to all
of the people who were

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:01.519
anti Allende, and you can look up.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.786
There actually are some
declassified documents

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:06.674
that hint at what the
level of CIA involvement

00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:08.049
might have been.

00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:12.386
Regardless to say, Allende
deposed and this gentleman,

00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:18.119
this gentleman comes to power
right over here, Augusto Pinochet.

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:21.979
And he comes to power and he says look

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.925
you know this democracy thing is silly.

00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:26.677
I am the president.

00:11:26.677 --> 00:11:28.431
I am the commander in chief.

00:11:28.431 --> 00:11:32.425
Chile will be run by military junta.

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:35.116
Let me write that down.

00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:37.115
Chile will be run by a junta.

00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:40.009
A junta just means a government that's run

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:41.182
by the military.

00:11:41.182 --> 00:11:43.684
It's a military dictatorship.

00:11:43.684 --> 00:11:45.782
The military is now in charge of Chile.

00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:49.935
We don't need people to do silly
things like voting anymore.

00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:52.849
And you can imagine
Nixon didn't care so much

00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:54.925
that this guy didn't like
democracy but he was happy.

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:57.519
Let me see if I can put
a smile on his face.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:01.514
He was happy that at least
Pinochet was not a Marxist,

00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:05.051
that at least we had stopped the spread

00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.843
of communism in Latin America.

00:12:08.843 --> 00:12:11.517
And Nixon, with that said,
and this is explicit,

00:12:11.517 --> 00:12:14.453
he wanted everything in his power to make

00:12:14.453 --> 00:12:17.428
Augusto Pinochet successful especially

00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:19.056
from an economic point of view.

00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:25.373
So, the United States does
start supporting Pinochet.

00:12:25.373 --> 00:12:27.722
He's viewed as kind of an American friend.

00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:30.247
Unfortunately for America
and unfortunately for Chile,

00:12:30.247 --> 00:12:34.518
this guy is one of those
big time tyrants in history.

00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.759
So, he is a tyrant.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.453
He starts rounding up people.

00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:40.265
He starts killing people.

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:42.584
He's one of those people that anything

00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:45.117
anyone...there was a whiff
of communism, a whiff

00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:47.650
of political opposition
he would round them up,

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.056
he would round their family up.

00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:52.715
He would torture people, and
just to kind of put some ...

00:12:52.715 --> 00:12:54.515
This is another picture
of him when he's older.

00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:57.765
It's amazing how gentle
some fairly evil people

00:12:57.765 --> 00:12:59.851
can look in the world.

00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:03.012
So I'll put some unambiguous horns on him.

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:07.250
He killed many, many people and many, many

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.325
people disappeared.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:11.721
Just to give an idea, these
are some of the people

00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:13.116
who disappeared.

00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:15.185
It was anyone from people
who were critical of him,

00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:18.452
people who were perceived
to be left-leaning,

00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:19.312
whatever it was.

00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:23.516
He tortured including women
and children and all the rest.

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:25.850
So, all around bad guy.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.384
He stuck around in Chile
as president until 1990.

00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:30.852
So, that's 17 years, and he really stayed

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.786
in power until 1998 where
he was commander and chief

00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:34.784
of the army.

00:13:34.784 --> 00:13:36.453
You can imagine if the
military is in control

00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:39.013
President isn't that important of a title.

00:13:39.013 --> 00:13:40.718
Commander and chief is.

00:13:40.718 --> 00:13:44.514
So for 25 years he hung around Chile and

00:13:44.514 --> 00:13:48.315
continued to be this totalitarian guy,

00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:51.115
although he liked free markets.

00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:53.516
He was a capitalist in
the traditional sense

00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:58.098
and the one I guess silver lining if you

00:13:58.098 --> 00:14:00.680
had to throw a silver
lining on Pinochet's regime

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.580
was that the Chilean
economy actually did well

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.172
during his regime.

00:14:05.172 --> 00:14:08.121
Chile is considered one
of the success stories

00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:10.449
economically over that time period.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.255
So, I'll let you decide,
and some people would

00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:16.453
say oh that's because
Pinochet understood economics,

00:14:16.453 --> 00:14:18.786
he didn't try to do all
this price fixing stuff that

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:20.107
Allende tried to do.

00:14:20.107 --> 00:14:22.582
Regardless of the fact
that he was a tyrant,

00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:26.118
at least the economy was doing well.

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:28.430
The other side of the
equation would be well look

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.180
of course the economy
did well, now you had

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.849
the United States doing
everything in its power,

00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:35.980
this huge the largest
economy in the world,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.452
doing everything in its power to make sure

00:14:38.452 --> 00:14:41.090
that Chile's economy
thrives while one of its

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.514
buddies are in power.

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.982
So, I'll let you decide
who's right, who's wrong,

00:14:44.982 --> 00:14:48.676
what was the actual involvement of the CIA

00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:52.044
and Nixon and Kissinger and
all of this mess over here.

00:14:52.044 --> 00:14:54.264
But I think needless
to say that this was a

00:14:54.264 --> 00:14:59.408
not so pleasant chapter
in I guess world history.
