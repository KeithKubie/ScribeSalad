00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.690
A mysterious new crater has been found in
Russia - but what is it?

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.690
How did it get there?

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.900
And what’s INSIDE of it?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.900
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
weren’t already terrified enough of the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.920
world around you, then listen to this - a
mysterious, massive crater has been discovered

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.669
in a remote area of Siberia, and nobody has
any idea what it is.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.199
The crater is located in the Yamal region
of Siberia, commonly referred to as, “the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.199
end of the world.”

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.110
And if that’s not creepy enough for you,
take a look at this video.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.020
This was posted online last week, and many
assumed it was a hoax at first - but it’s

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.660
now been confirmed by Russian officials to
be real, and scientists are heading there

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.660
to figure out what exactly it is.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
The crater is estimated to be about 260 feet
- or roughly 80 meters - wide, and from the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.710
video, it appears to be infinitely deep, although
no one has figured out exactly how deep it

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
goes.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.420
According to The Siberian Times, it’s located
near a forest, about 30 km away from Yamal’s

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.190
biggest gas field - which has prompted many
to theorize that it could be the result of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.170
an underground gas explosion.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.190
Other theories circulating right now, say
it could be a sinkhole, or perhaps the result

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.620
of a meteorite strike - although a spokesperson
from Russia’s Emergencies Ministry says

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.540
it’s definitely not either of those.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.490
The leading theory is that it’s a natural
phenomenon known as a ‘pingo’ - potentially

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.940
caused by global warming.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.690
A pingo is what happens when ice underneath
the ground melts, and pushes up the ground

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.690
from above.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.930
The area surrounding the crater also happens
to contain the largest natural gas reservoir

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.310
in all of Russia, so if that ice contained
a substantial amount of gas, it would’ve

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.620
been released as the ice melted - eventually
causing an underground explosion.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.620
This has been a pretty hot topic on the web
lately, so I’m sure we’ll be hearing more

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.620
about it in the coming days.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.820
In the meantime, if you guys have any wacky
theories on what this giant crater might be

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.040
- leave in the comments below, and we can
all speculate together.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.470
That’s it for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching.
