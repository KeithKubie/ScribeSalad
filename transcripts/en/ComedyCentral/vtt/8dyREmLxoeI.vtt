00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.572
- [Voiceover] Dead Kevin

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Alright guys all we
have is this weird potato

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.777
and a bunch of condiments.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.245 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No no no, I don't think
you're understanding.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.215 align:start position:0%
If we pay this bill we will
literally have negative dollar,

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.283 align:start size:97% position:3%
like what do you recommend?
- Ryan, Ryan!

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.752 align:start size:84% position:16%
Do you want your
work clothes in here?

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.020
- Yeah, whatever.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.254
Now here's my question
why are you telling us

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.922
that our balance is outstanding?

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:23.823
- Hey guys!

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.526
- Hey Richard.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.328
- Hey Richard, what's up?

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.030 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What, what are we gymnasts?
- Sorry

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.065 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (Knocks) What
does that even mean?

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.034 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Richard, we were just
gonna sit down for dinner.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.402
- Ah it's cool, I just ate.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.836
- It's not really a good
time right now Richard.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.371
- What are you doing, bills?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.441
- Yeah, okay I'm gonna have
a word with your manager.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.443
- Mmm, seasoning.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.512
(scoffs)

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.447
So this is literally all of
the clothes that we have.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't think we have
enough quarters for this.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.117
- You guys doing laundry?

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:52.952
- Uhh, nah --

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:53.853
- Can I help?

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.422
- [Ahmed] No thanks.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.923
- No it's cool I just got
a new dryer downs stairs,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.325
I could help you guys
finish this laundry.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.661
- [Ahmed] It's just
kinda weird, Richard.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.796
- Weird?

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.264 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Ahmed] Our
underwear is in there.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.800 align:start size:97% position:3%
- A friend helping a friend,
when is that weird huh?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.469
I'll get this done really
fast, I'll be right back.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.237
Is that cool?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.072
Thank you.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.545
(sighs)

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.713
Guys, before you freak out,

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.850
I want each and every
one of you to know

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.518
how very sorry I am.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:30.557
Obviously I didn't mean for
this to happen, you know.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.992 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was an accident and you
gotta forgive me 'cause

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.462
that's what friends do!

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.363
- You're fucking crazy!

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.867
- We don't have money
to buy new clothes.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.569
- Guys, let's be real.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.104
We're pulling this off together.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start size:84% position:16%
You guys look
cool, you're great.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.273
- This isn't cool.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.975 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Ryan, please
don't be mad at me.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.078
Honestly, I've never seen
your pecks more defined.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.746
- Fucking son of a bitch!

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.981
(yelling)

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.815
You're a monster!

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:56.649
- Get out of here!

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.750
- You're a monster!

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.519
(yelling)

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.353
- You got it?

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.121
- Okay!

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:01.955
- You cool?

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.623
- Yes.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got a job interview
in 20 minutes.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.794 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You're gonna do great,
your hair looks good.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.095
- [Ryan] Thank you.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.463
- Ahmed, I'm sorry.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.764
- Richard.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.266
- Jack, come on man.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.735
- Richard if you could just
pitch in help us buy like

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.237
a couple of shirts.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.606
- I don't have any money
for your guys' clothes

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.541
I just got a new dryer.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.248
- Look Richard,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.383
I don't think you should come
around here anymore, you know?

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.885
- What?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.820
I'm downstairs, I'm your
neighbor, I'm your friend.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.890 align:start size:94% position:6%
Who's gonna help you
guys laundry or whatever.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.125
- This is it, this was
it, this was the last --

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.493
- Fuck you!

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.695
- Ryan, i'm sorry!

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.863
You look good!

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.434
(door slams)

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:52.172
He's not gonna get a job
with an attitude like that.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.774
(guitar music)

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.211
(knocks)

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.149
