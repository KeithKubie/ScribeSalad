00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.680
In the video where we first
introduced the Milankovitch

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920
cycles where we talk
about the precession

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.630
and how the tilt of the Earth,
the obliquity, can also change,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.210
I get this comment here on the
YouTube channel from Vicksoma

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.290
and he or she says, if I
understood this correctly,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.650
precession changes the
time of the seasons

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.580
over long periods of time,
and obliquity changes

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.550
the strengths of the season
over long periods of time.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.850
And so this is a good comment.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.524
So the first comment
isn't exactly true,

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.690
and that's what I'm going
to focus on in this video.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.780
He says or she says
precession changes

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.270
the time of the seasons
over long periods of time.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.980
This is kind of true, but
I don't think in the sense

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.250
that Vicksoma is
referring to it.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.060
The second part is roughly true.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.160
Obliquity changes the
strengths of the season

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.550
over long periods of time.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.000
If you are more tilted towards
the sun in the extreme,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.510
then, yes, you will
have a bigger disparity

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.040
than when you are
less tilted, when

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.414
you are tilted
away from the sun.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:55.980
Or I guess you'd
say, if you are more

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.482
tilted to or away from
the sun, the disparity

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.190
between summer and
winter will be greater

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.420
than if you are less tilted.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.940
So the second statement is
true, although you always

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.790
have to be careful with things
as complicated as the climate

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.080
because it can really depend
from parts of the global

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.980
to parts on the globe
depending on what

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.050
are all of the other
factors that play into it.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.720
So you would want to run some
type of simulation or something

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.729
like that, but the second
part is roughly true.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.270
But I want to focus
on the first part

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.770
because I think
it'll really give us

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.860
a better understanding
of what precession is.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.980
And so this last
statement Vicksoma makes

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.870
is actually not true.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.828
So he says-- I'm assuming
it's a he, maybe it's

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.750
a she-- so in a
several thousand years,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.940
in several thousand years-- not
a-- in several thousand years,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.481
if we still use the same
calendar system, summer

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:39.230
and winter will happen
in different months

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.607
and they will be more
mild or more harsh.

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:43.940
And what we're going to see
is that the second statement

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.010
is not true because our
calendar is actually

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.950
based on when we are most tilted
away from or towards the sun.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.500
So our calendar
is actually based

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440
on-- is actually
to some degree you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.910
could say takes
precession into account,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.450
and what actually does change
according to our calendar is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.780
when we are closest or
furthest away from the sun--

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.389
the perihelion or aphelion.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.190
And we're going to think
about that in this video.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.450
So let me draw the sun here.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.260
Let me draw the sun
right over here.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.340
And let me draw Earth's
orbit around the sun.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.340
And I'm going to draw it
with some eccentricity.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.340
And just so you know what
I'm talking about when

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.560
I say eccentricity, a
circle has no eccentricity.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.300
An ellipse, this
ellipse right here

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.930
has more eccentricity
than this circle,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.530
which has no eccentricity.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.490
And an even more eccentric
ellipse would look like this.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.250
So you can really think
about eccentricity

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.330
as a measure of how
far you are away

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.960
from being perfectly circular.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.920
So Earth's orbit around the sun
is pretty close to circular,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.410
but it has some eccentricity.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.200
It is slightly
elliptical, and I'm

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.860
going to exaggerate it a bit in
this drawing right over here.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.140
So let's say that this is the
closest point that Earth gets

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.900
to the sun so that
is the perihelion.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.620
And let's say this is
the furthest point.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.706
And obviously, it's not
this big of a difference.

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:03.580
It's actually only a 3%
difference right now,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.910
but we'll also learn
that that's changing.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730
But it never becomes
this dramatic,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.600
but this will help
us visualize it.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.100
So Earth's orbit might
look something like this.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.353
Earth's orbit--
let me make it, I

00:03:14.353 --> 00:03:16.840
can do a better job than
that-- Earth's orbit

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.180
might look something like this.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.224
Obviously, I'm exaggerating,
though, the eccentricity here.

00:03:25.224 --> 00:03:26.640
So let's say that's
Earth's orbit.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.810
This is the point where we are
closest, so that's perihelion.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.010
And this is when
we are furthest.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.770
This is aphelion.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.150
And we saw in the first
video when we discussed this

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.460
that right now this perihelion
is occurring in January,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.610
and this will change over time
as we'll see in this video.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.470
So January right now,
and aphelion right now

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.150
occurs in July.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.590
Now, the time where we are
most tilted towards the sun

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.770
is not at the
perihelion right now.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.260
It actually occurs a few
weeks before the perihelion.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.730
So when we are most
tilted to the sun,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.605
this is our winter solstice.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.090
And this is when
we are-- actually,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.110
in the case of the
Northern Hemisphere,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.370
this is when we are most
tilted away from the sun,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.000
I should say.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.886
So if we were to
draw our tilt here,

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.510
if I were to come
out of the North Pole

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.710
it would look like that.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.160
And this right over here,
depending on the year

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.610
and where you are in your
time zone and everything,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.150
this is usually
December 21st or 22nd.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.610
I'll just go with
December 22nd for now.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.510
And when the Northern Hemisphere
is most tilted towards the sun

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.620
occurs on June 20th or 21st,
so roughly six months later.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.160
Or really exactly
six months later.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.740
It's just that all the months
have different numbers of days

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.450
and you have leap year sometimes
with February sometimes having

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.390
28 or 29 days, but if
you go half a year away

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.770
then you are at-- in the case
of the Northern Hemisphere--

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.420
the summer solstice,
and this is when

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.480
we are most tilted
towards the sun.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.780
And once again, it occurs
right now a few weeks

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.260
before the aphelion, before we
are furthest away from the sun.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.730
Now, I want to zoom in a right
over here on December 22nd.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.300
So right over here,
let me zoom in.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.760
So let's say that
this is the Earth.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.240
I'm zooming in on this
circle right over here

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.100
so let me box it to
show this is the one I

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.170
am focused on right over here.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.780
And let me draw the
axis of rotation.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.020
And we know that that angle
versus the vertical that you

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.840
could call the tilt
or the obliquity

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.250
and we know this is
23.4 degrees relative

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.520
to the vertical-- relative
to perpendicular compared

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.250
to the plane of
our orbit, I guess.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.054
So if our orbital axis
was straight up and down,

00:06:02.054 --> 00:06:03.470
it would look
something like this.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.100
It's not, it tilts, and
this angle right over here

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.280
is 23.4 degrees.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.780
And when I say
straight up and down,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.470
I'm saying relative to
the plane of Earth's orbit

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.890
around the sun.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.390
So this right here
is the obliquity.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.290
And as Vicksoma mentioned,
this does change,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.100
it goes between 22 degrees
and 24 and 1/2 degrees

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.640
over very long periods of
time, but it does-- oh, I

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.530
think it's 41,000 years if
I remember that correctly--

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.160
so it will affect on
some level the severity.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.410
So this tilt is going between
that where actually it's

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.560
reducing right now,
and it will get

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.250
to a minimum in a
few thousand years.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.864
So it will get to some
minimum and then eventually it

00:06:42.864 --> 00:06:44.280
will get back to
some maximum tilt

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.320
so it goes back and
forth between those two

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.760
over the course of several
tens of thousands of years.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.940
But anyway, this is as it
is zoomed in right now.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.770
And as we mentioned,
precession you can view it

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.770
as if this arrow right
here actually existed,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.640
it would trace out a
circle and is tracing out

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.860
of this circle over a
huge period of time,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.460
over 26,000 years.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.772
So let me make
everything clear here.

00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:17.980
Right now, I'm just going
to assume Earth is rotating

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.607
and that the orbital direction
is in that direction.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.940
I'm going to assume-- let me
make that a little bit more

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.920
curved-- this is the
rotation of the Earth,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.054
it is in this direction
right over here.

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.220
And what we learned about
precession-- and actually,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.157
to be particular,
it's axial precession.

00:07:35.157 --> 00:07:37.490
There's multiple types of
precession we will talk about.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.250
If someone says just
precession they're

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.480
usually referring
to axial precession.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.120
It's this idea that over 26,000
years, the tip of this arrow,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.490
or you could even imagine
the poles themselves,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.060
will trace out a circle.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.370
If you look at the
same point in our orbit

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.080
at any period in time, the
circle that is tracing out

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.570
is going to be going in this
direction right over here.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.040
So if we wait
1,800 years-- and I

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.998
want to make sure I get
this right because it's

00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:05.060
important to see what
happens to our calendar--

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.280
if we wait 1,800
years this arrow,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.410
it will still have a
tilt of 23.4 degrees,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.160
but instead of pointing
in this direction,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.040
it might be pointing
in this direction.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.960
Or in fact, it will be
pointing in this direction.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.190
I'm obviously not
drawing it that exact.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.590
And then the bottom of the
arrow will come out over here.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.810
So if you think about that,
if you wait 1,800 years,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.565
and once again, the
tilt hasn't changed

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:32.549
or it's changed a little bit,
but what the precession has

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.919
done, tracing out this circle
has changed the direction

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.710
of this arrow, it
changed the direction

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.770
of our axis of rotation.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:46.830
And if you wait 1,800 years when
will the Northern Hemisphere be

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.250
pointed most away from the sun.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.670
Well, now, it won't
be pointed most away

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.000
from the sun at this point
in space relative to the sun

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.160
anymore because now
its axis of rotation

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.710
looks something like this.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.090
So now if we wait-- or I
should say in 1,800 years,

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.740
it will be most pointed away,
or the Northern Hemisphere

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.650
will be most pointed away from
the sun, about a month earlier.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.220
So about a month earlier.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.780
It'll be most pointed away from
the sun about a month earlier.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.970
So this is when it will be
most pointed away from the sun.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.105
To today's time,
we would say, no,

00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:26.730
that's still not the
most pointed away,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.920
but since we have
this precession,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.280
since the direction of the
tilt I guess we could say,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.270
or the direction of our
rotational axis is changing,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.600
we are now at a different
point in our orbit

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.267
where we are most pointed
away from the sun.

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:45.100
So this is 1,800 years
later, approximately.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.010
So now based on
this, and I think

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.040
this is what Vicksoma might have
been hinting at, you say, look,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.570
OK, it's earlier in our orbit.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.040
Wouldn't this now be November?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.100
And the answer is no.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.250
It will still be December 22nd.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:10.800
This will still be December 21st
or 22nd Depending on the year.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.130
Still be the same
date, and that's

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:22.000
because our calendar is based
on when we are most tilted away

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.960
or when we are most
tilted towards the sun.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.540
So by definition, this is
when we are most tilted away

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.930
so this will be the
winter solstice.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.576
So what happens
is every year-- so

00:10:31.576 --> 00:10:32.950
the way I drew it
right over here

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.450
and, actually, this
perihelion actually

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.630
changes over time as well.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.910
There's a precession of
the perihelion as well,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.750
but I'm not going to
go into that right now.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.120
So if you fast
forward 1,800 years,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.220
all that's going to
happen is that what

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.110
we consider by
our calendar to be

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.240
December 22nd in an
absolute point in our orbit

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.760
we'll be earlier in our
orbit, but we're still

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.830
going to call it December 22nd.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.680
And so the perihelion is going
to be further away from that

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.270
December 22nd, it's actually
going to be a month further

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.170
away, so the perihelion
1,800 years from now

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.440
won't be in January,
it will be in February.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.370
So the real takeaway
here is that our calendar

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.210
is based not on the exact point
in space relative to the sun.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.790
Our calendar is based on the
maximum tilt towards or away

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.000
from the sun, and
that, as we see,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.710
that is slightly
changing in terms

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.670
of where it occurs in the
absolute point in space.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.070
I think it's changing by
roughly 20 minutes a year.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.290
So every year, the perihelion
is getting 20 minutes later.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.000
If we wanted to
use the perihelion,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.340
if we wanted to use the exact
point in space as our calendar,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.360
our year would actually
be about that-- I

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.604
don't know what it is-- roughly
20 or 25 minutes longer,

00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:53.520
but it actually makes a
little much more sense

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.470
to think about it from
the tilt because that's

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.570
what dictates the seasons,
and that's actually

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.630
what's most
observable from Earth,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.600
where the sun is in the sky.
