1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
Contributing to the campaigns and
then they scratch each other's backs.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,380
If the resident were to go in and say,
I'm gonna get rid of all lobbyists,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,130
that president would not
make it through his term. Um,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,110
well it's hard to say that. No, it's not.
No, this is too much money, Joe. I mean,

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,100
I know if I'm going to agree
with you in this day and age,

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,890
it's hard to say that because you'd have
to get everybody on board with killing

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,600
a president. I think they
definitely did it with Kennedy. Oh,

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,400
you mean I think a hundred percent you
know, I was talking to, uh, you know,

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,600
do you have to get everybody Bowers?
No,

10
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,660
but do you have to get everybody on board?
Yeah,

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,760
I mean it just to get everybody on board
who knows about it because otherwise

12
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,790
people are going to tell if you,
if you go and kill the fucking president,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,760
you have to get a lot of
people on board as what we're,

14
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:44,310
we're probably going to get raided
by the secret service right now.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,910
But I'm saying if you want to kill
president, it's not like it used to be.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,490
I think it used to be less consequential.
Not that it was always,

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,080
I mean like John Wilkes booth days, right.
Way Easier to kill the president then.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,290
Then Kennedy ways year to kill a president
in 1963 then is to kill the president

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,550
in 2019 could you still do it? Yeah,
but you're probably going to get caught.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,360
Like you would probably get caught.
It let you would have to have,

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,420
I mean there would have to be all,
you would have to have a tiny,

22
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:16,980
small circle of fucking sociopaths and
psychopaths and they all agree to keep it

23
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:20,610
hush. To me, it's just one person
calling another person saying, do this,

24
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,160
pay him off and then you can get caught.

25
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,770
But one per look be of secret service.

26
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:30,240
You have a military protecting them yet
it's different cause you'd have to take

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,690
some layers to get past all that,
you know,

28
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,620
and someone would have to
make a mistake and mapping.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,830
That was one of the things I said about
a Dealey Plaza and they rolled Kennedy

30
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,041
through.

31
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:46,041
They like what fucking security person
would ever agree to let someone roll

32
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,700
through with a convertible with
buildings all around. Yeah.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,660
And then also you have to take that long,

34
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,980
slow turn where you know it's sounds
you just drive by going 50 miles an hour

35
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,670
and you've gotta get your gun and shoot
him quick. No, the guy was driving slow.

36
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,570
It's ridiculous. It's like you're
asking for someone to get assassinated,

37
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,261
but I just,

38
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:07,860
I just really feel like there are rules
like that will never ever know about,

39
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,950
but once you get in there they're like,
hey, here's what you need to know.

40
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,080
Here's what you need to
know not to go against.

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,690
I would think that if anybody's
going to tell us that it's Trump,

42
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,890
I think the best thing that could ever
happen is that Trump gets out of his

43
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,420
terms in the White House and just
starts talking. It starts writing plugs.

44
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,270
Tell us then, yeah, you want to
be the king of the world. Right.

45
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:32,271
A fucking huge book on exactly what it's
like the day you become the president.

46
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,080
That would be insane.
How?

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,630
How do you think he's going to be
treated once it gets out though?

48
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,070
They'll love him. You think so?
They love Bush. People hated Bush.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,020
They called Bush a war criminal. Now
he's an adorable grandpa. Paints. No,

50
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,160
it's true. It's true.
It's true. Look Man, what?

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Whatever you hate Obama
when he was in office,

52
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,320
they're going to love
him within a few years.

53
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,970
I mean most people that were
supporters of Obama, they love him now.

54
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,270
I mean he's like a,
he's a uh Huh. Yeah, I,

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,360
I mean, I don't know. I
think they're going to,

56
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,810
I think a certain percentage of the
population loves Trump right now, period.

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,280
And you know they have reasons to back
it up in terms of like the economy,

58
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,230
what they think is
happening with job creation,

59
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,380
all these different things that he's
doing that may or may not not have

60
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,480
devastating implications
depending on who you talk to.

61
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,260
That's an expert and I'm not one. Yeah,
me neither. But there's obviously,

62
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,640
and then also people say,
wow,

63
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,310
this is a trend that was actually going
on during the Obama administration.

64
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:31,060
He's just riding the wave. Maybe I'm too
stupid. I don't understand that stuff.

65
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,490
But I'm saying there's,
in terms of numbers,

66
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,370
it's not like the country is
completely imploding right now. I mean,

67
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,290
maybe some people buy
some people's metric.

68
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,860
It's not doing as well as he would
like to pretend it is probably.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,750
But my thing is.
