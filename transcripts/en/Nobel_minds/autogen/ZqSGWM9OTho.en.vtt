hello my name is Matthew here's my

hello my name is Matthew here's my
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.550
hello my name is Matthew here's my
question for you west coast what do you

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
question for you west coast what do you
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.730
question for you west coast what do you
think the percentage chances that the

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740
think the percentage chances that the
 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.620
think the percentage chances that the
LHC will find a spasm hi Matthew you're

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
LHC will find a spasm hi Matthew you're
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749
LHC will find a spasm hi Matthew you're
asking what are what odds would I give

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
asking what are what odds would I give
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.099
asking what are what odds would I give
for the LHC to find the Higgs boson well

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
for the LHC to find the Higgs boson well
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.080
for the LHC to find the Higgs boson well
you know I think that the odds are very

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
you know I think that the odds are very
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.019
you know I think that the odds are very
good I don't know whether I would place

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
good I don't know whether I would place
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.609
good I don't know whether I would place
them at eighty percent ninety percent

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
them at eighty percent ninety percent
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.680
them at eighty percent ninety percent
it's almost a hundred percent that we

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
it's almost a hundred percent that we
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.389
it's almost a hundred percent that we
will find if not the traditional symbol

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
will find if not the traditional symbol
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.080
will find if not the traditional symbol
Higgs boson something that plays the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
Higgs boson something that plays the
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.080
Higgs boson something that plays the
same role more might be a slightly more

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
same role more might be a slightly more
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.860
same role more might be a slightly more
complicated but you know the existence

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
complicated but you know the existence
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.100
complicated but you know the existence
of this particle the Higgs boson is the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
of this particle the Higgs boson is the
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.979
of this particle the Higgs boson is the
last nail in this structure called the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
last nail in this structure called the
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650
last nail in this structure called the
standard model which works exceedingly

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
standard model which works exceedingly
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110
standard model which works exceedingly
well and as well tested just about

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
well and as well tested just about
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.109
well and as well tested just about
everywhere it can be so it almost would

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
everywhere it can be so it almost would
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.160
everywhere it can be so it almost would
fly in the face of logic and mathematics

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

if we were not to find the Higgs boson

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
if we were not to find the Higgs boson
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.240
if we were not to find the Higgs boson
or some mild variation of it so I'm

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
or some mild variation of it so I'm
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.380
or some mild variation of it so I'm
pretty confident that in about I it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
pretty confident that in about I it
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539
pretty confident that in about I it
probably will take five or six years

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
probably will take five or six years
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.050
probably will take five or six years
it's a very difficult particle to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
it's a very difficult particle to
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.899
it's a very difficult particle to
observe in the mass range that its most

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
observe in the mass range that its most
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.420
observe in the mass range that its most
likely to be in in about five or six

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
likely to be in in about five or six
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.770
likely to be in in about five or six
years will be pretty confident that we

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
years will be pretty confident that we
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.759
years will be pretty confident that we
have nailed down the Higgs burglar
