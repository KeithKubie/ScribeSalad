00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.440
Working on code with other
developers is something you will do

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.720
all the time in the professional world.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.960
So it's really important to practice
working with remote repositories

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.790
whenever you can, starting now.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.030
Do you have any existing projects?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.560
Add them to GitHub if
you haven't already.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.720
Plan on starting any new projects?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.990
Make sure to add those too.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.050
Even if you're not working with other
developers yet, sharing your projects on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.630
GitHub will allow other developers
to at least view your work.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.130
And why wouldn't you want to
share your projects?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.330
You put so much hard work into them.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.600
Show them off.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.110
You deserve it.
