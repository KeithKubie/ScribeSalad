00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.870
After you answer a question, there's typically going to be a short

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.740
video explaining the answer before moving on to the next video or topic.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.200
&gt;&gt; For example, right now I'm explaining that all

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.700
the answers to the last question were correct. Go us!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.945
&gt;&gt; Woohoo

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:12.780
[NOISE]

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.430
Now some questions are going to have right or wrong answers. If

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.650
you don't get it right the first time, don't worry about it.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.850
&gt;&gt; Just pay attention to any feedback that

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.760
you see appear on the screen and try again.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; And some questions don't have right

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.740
or wrong answers at all. These questions

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.890
are just meant to get you thinking. Or poll the class in interesting ways.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.050
&gt;&gt; And remember, you should have fun answering

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.170
these questions. After all, genetics is all about fun.
