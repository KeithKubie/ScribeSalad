00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.460
Being an intern at a German landscaping company
during 1992 meant Ökoland Dederow was handed

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.480
the tedious task of looking through aerial
photographs for irrigation lines in a forest

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570
located in East Germany.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.019
During the course of this, Dederow came across
something that definitely was not an irrigation

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.940
line in photo 106/88.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.420
Approximately 140 larch trees in the middle
of forest of green pine trees had turned brown

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.879
in the autumn, forming a large swastika.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.949
He immediately showed the picture to his boss,
Günter Reschke, who chartered a plane to

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.020
take him over the section of forest and saw
the symbol with his own eyes.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.320
The forest swastika in Brandenburg, Germany
most likely had been around since the 1930s,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.000
based on estimates of the age of the trees.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.010
Why did it take more than a half a century
for anyone to discover it?

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.820
One factor was that the larch trees only changed
color, making the swastika visible, for a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.860
short period of time in the fall.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.510
The other factor was that the symbol can only
be seen from the air and private planes were

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.960
for a time banned from flying over the region.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.749
Any commercial planes flying over the area
would have been too high for the passengers

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.539
or pilots to see this.

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.320
No one knows who bears responsibility for
the forest swastika in Brandenburg.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.360
A number of rumors surfaced shortly after
Dederow discovered the symbol.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360
One possible explanation places the blame
on nearby villagers.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
One of their own was caught listening to a
BBC radio broadcast in secret and ultimately

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360
sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp
for this act.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360
The story goes that the villagers then planted
the trees in the shape of a swastika to show

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360
their loyalty to the Nazi Party.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
One more version claims the planting occurred
in honor of Hitler’s birthday when a local

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
Nazi leader ordered it done.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
Alternatively, a newspaper, the Berliner Zeitung,
wrote that the Reich Labor Service constructed

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
a road in a nearby village and the trees were
planted in gratitude for this road.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
Whoever really planted it, the forest swastika
in Brandenburg is not the only one discovered

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360
in Germany after World War II.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360
National Socialist foresters commonly created
swastikas via planting trees during the Nazi

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.409
regime, many of which have only been discovered
relatively recently.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.499
For instance, in the 1970s, United States
soldiers in Hesse discovered such a swastika

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.229
and the numbers “1933” on a hillside.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.859
Another such swastika was discovered in Hesse
during the 1980s, and a backwards swastika

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.580
constructed of Douglas firs was found in Wiesbaden
in 2000.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.039
Three years after Dederow discovered the Brandenburg
swastika, in 1995, the local German officials

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.380
took action.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.649
Foresters armed with chainsaws cut down forty
of the larch trees and reported back to their

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.270
superiors that the symbol was no longer recognizable.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.850
However, a picture published in 2000 showed
the foresters had been wrong.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.690
Those larches that remained after they cut
others down filled in the spots left open,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.040
allowing the trees to still form the symbol,
albeit slightly frayed, when they changed

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.040
to yellow and then brown.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.070
Officials in Brandenburg worried that if the
swastika remained in the forest, it would

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.709
become a pilgrimage site for Neo-Nazis.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.489
They also wanted to avoid a situation where
the stumps were left behind and continued

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.849
to show a swastika-shaped outline between
the trees.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.680
To get around these issues, they planned to
remove all the trees in that section of the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.920
forest, but ran into legal issues in doing
so as the ownership of some of the land was

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920
in dispute.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.569
In the end, the Bodenverwertungs- und -verwaltungs
GmbH (BVVG), the federal entity in charge

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.750
of property management, only granted a permit
to cut down twenty-five of the remaining trees.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.260
Foresters again headed to the tree swastika
on December 4, 2000; they strategically marked

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.560
and cut down twenty-five trees ensuring the
swastika would no longer appear from the air.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.260
This all might have you wondering how the
Nazis came up with the swastika in the first

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.260
place.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.909
It turns out, the Nazis weren’t the first
to use this symbol prominently.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.370
The first known record of this symbol popping
up was over 12,000 years ago in the region

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.099
of present day Ukraine, with a version of
the swastika carved into a tusk of a mammoth.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.709
As we traverse through history, we find the
swastika, or some version of it, was prevalent

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.754
pretty much all over the world in a remarkable
number of cultures- from the Navajo and Hopi

00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:24.330
Native Americans (among others) to the Celts,
the Jews, the early Christians, the Indus

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.920
Valley Civilization, the ancient Greek and
Romans, the Egyptians, etc.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.920
How is this possible?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.739
Some of it can be explained by cultural diffusion.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.049
Beyond that, it has been theorized that the
swastika shape would necessarily be something

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.390
any society that weaves baskets would be familiar
with as, when weaving baskets via a square

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.110
weave, this basic shape is readily apparent.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.349
An alternative possible origin was put forth
by Carl Sagan in 1985.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.879
He noted in his book, Comet, when studying
a Chinese text from the Han dynasty (second

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.340
century BC) that included drawn comet tails,
one of the depictions showed a comet with

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.730
a tail that had four bent arms, strongly resembling
a swastika.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.640
Sagan theorized that a comet, or comets over
time, could have approached so close to the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.359
Earth that the jets of gas streaming from
the spinning comet(s), could form these arms,

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.260
making the swastika shape in the sky and thus
leading to the adoption of the swastika as

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.610
a symbol of importance across the world almost
literally overnight.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.910
So why did the Nazi’s use the swastika?

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.990
Heinrich Schliemann found the symbol in the
site of ancient Troy in the late 19th century.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.620
He theorized that the symbol thus linked the
Greek and Germanic cultures as this symbol

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.410
was also often found on ancient Germanic pottery.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.610
The work of Schliemann eventually was used
by the völkisch movement, which in turn ultimately

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.710
influenced Nazism.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.259
As Hitler later stated in Mein Kampf, “The
basic ideas of the National-Socialist movement

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.650
are populist (völkisch) and the populist
(völkisch) ideas are National-Socialist.”

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.009
Matilde_MoisantAt this time, partially thanks
to Schliemann’s work, the symbol experienced

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.669
something of a resurgence across the Western
world.

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.080
For instance, the picture to the right shows
famed American aviator Matilde E. Moisant

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.039
(the second woman in the U.S. to receive a
pilot’s license after Harriet Quimby) in

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.889
1912 wearing a version of the symbol as a
good luck charm, which is also why certain

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.250
sports teams, such as the British Columbian
Fernie Swastikas women’s hockey team used

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.830
it in the early 20th century.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.520
(In fact, the name “swastika” derives
from the Sanskrit “svastika-s,” meaning

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.669
“being fortunate.”)

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.190
The swastika was also still a commonly used
symbol at this time among various groups of

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.860
Native Americans, with it having slightly
different meanings depending on the group.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.310
In any event, Hitler was familiar with the
symbol, thinking it connected Ancient Greece

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.259
to the Germanic peoples as Schliemann had
theorized.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.699
Whether he remembered it later in life or
not, Hitler likely first encountered it as

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.030
a boy at the Benedictine choir school at Lambach
Abbey, Upper Austria, which Hitler attended

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.030
when a child.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.580
The school had a swastika chiseled into the
monastery portal and also in the wall above

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.330
the spring grotto in the courtyard.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.360
Hitler stated of why the symbol was chosen
for the Nazi flag, among other design elements,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.700
“I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable
attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.740
with a red background, a white disk, and a
black swastika in the middle.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.509
After long trials I also found a definite
proportion between the size of the flag and

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.849
the size of the white disk, as well as the
shape and thickness of the swastika…”

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:16.849
“Those revered colors expressive of our
homage to the glorious past and which once

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:17.849
brought so much honor to the German nation…”

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.669
“As National Socialists, we see our program
in our flag.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.880
In red, we see the social idea of the movement;
in white, the nationalistic idea; in the swastika,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.270
the mission of the struggle for the victory
of the Aryan man, and, by the same token,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.830
the victory of the idea of creative work.”

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.800
Given the Nazi’s usurping of this once ubiquitously
symbol, today it’s firmly taboo outside

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.380
of regions where Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism
(although with slightly different orientations)

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.380
particularly are prominent.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.759
Needless to say, this has on occasion created
a bit of cross-cultural misunderstandings

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.560
in the ensuing decades, such as in 1999 when
a 10 year old from New York bought Pokémon

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.160
cards imported from Japan that contained the
Buddhist version of the symbol on two of the

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.300
cards in the set.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.740
This created quite a stir when the media got
a hold of the story after the parents filed

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.180
a complaint with the company, with many misinterpreting
the symbol.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.750
Ultimately, the manufacturer removed those
cards from the sets exported to North America

00:07:07.750 --> 00:08:44.189
to avoid further misunderstandings.
