I'm not sure I guess it is perfect

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
I'm not sure I guess it is perfect

I'm not sure I guess it is perfect
because c60 is a pure carbon molecule

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
because c60 is a pure carbon molecule

whereas diamond and graphite have got to
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.810
whereas diamond and graphite have got to
have dangling bonds on the surface and

have dangling bonds on the surface and
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.620
have dangling bonds on the surface and
on the edges but I think it really was

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
on the edges but I think it really was

on a Tuesday morning on the monday we
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530
on a Tuesday morning on the monday we
had discussed what it might be and we

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
had discussed what it might be and we
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630
had discussed what it might be and we
discussed but mr. Fuller's domes that

that it was related and I had a star

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
that it was related and I had a star

dome back home in England and we went

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
dome back home in England and we went
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090
dome back home in England and we went
out for to a restaurant that evening and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
out for to a restaurant that evening and
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.479
out for to a restaurant that evening and
I remembered describing the stardome had

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
I remembered describing the stardome had
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.760
I remembered describing the stardome had
not just hexagons but also Pentagon's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
not just hexagons but also Pentagon's
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.440
not just hexagons but also Pentagon's
and I was thinking of calling my wife up

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450
and I was thinking of calling my wife up
 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.910
and I was thinking of calling my wife up
asking you know to find this model of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
asking you know to find this model of
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.250
asking you know to find this model of
the stardome that I had to see whether

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
the stardome that I had to see whether
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.940
the stardome that I had to see whether
it has 60 vertices and but I didn't do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
it has 60 vertices and but I didn't do
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.670
it has 60 vertices and but I didn't do
that but that night Rick Cox out

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
that but that night Rick Cox out
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.469
that but that night Rick Cox out
hexagons and tried to make it and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479
hexagons and tried to make it and
 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.730
hexagons and tried to make it and
couldn't make it and then he remembered

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
couldn't make it and then he remembered
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.649
couldn't make it and then he remembered
I'd said that think the structure had

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
I'd said that think the structure had
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240
I'd said that think the structure had
Pentagon's and when he put the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
Pentagon's and when he put the
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160
Pentagon's and when he put the
Pentagon's it magically curled up and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
Pentagon's it magically curled up and
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.219
Pentagon's it magically curled up and
the next morning came in with this

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
the next morning came in with this
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.499
the next morning came in with this
beautiful a wonderful little paper ball

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
beautiful a wonderful little paper ball
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350
beautiful a wonderful little paper ball
and I think we were all totally ecstatic

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
and I think we were all totally ecstatic
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539
and I think we were all totally ecstatic
and realized that this was something

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
and realized that this was something
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.050
and realized that this was something
special and then we realize it was a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
special and then we realize it was a
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.870
special and then we realize it was a
soccer ball and at that point I think it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
soccer ball and at that point I think it
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639
soccer ball and at that point I think it
must be right it was just too beautiful

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
must be right it was just too beautiful
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.510
must be right it was just too beautiful
to be wrong a little bit later I started

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
to be wrong a little bit later I started
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.300
to be wrong a little bit later I started
to have the odd ? because half a dozen

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
to have the odd ? because half a dozen
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.270
to have the odd ? because half a dozen
papers came out just just after hours to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
papers came out just just after hours to
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.990
papers came out just just after hours to
say we were wrong but then I playing

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
say we were wrong but then I playing
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.469
say we were wrong but then I playing
around with little modeling kit and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479
around with little modeling kit and
 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.840
around with little modeling kit and
realized if 60

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850
realized if 60
 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.490
realized if 60
was the right answer then 70 which is an

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
was the right answer then 70 which is an
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.800
was the right answer then 70 which is an
unusual number should be the next favors

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
unusual number should be the next favors
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.510
unusual number should be the next favors
structure and I call it so like Don

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
structure and I call it so like Don
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.970
structure and I call it so like Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza or Batman and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
Quixote and Sancho Panza or Batman and
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.390
Quixote and Sancho Panza or Batman and
Robin alone Ranger and Tonto and in fact

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
Robin alone Ranger and Tonto and in fact
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.770
Robin alone Ranger and Tonto and in fact
that turned out to be correct so it was

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
that turned out to be correct so it was
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.050
that turned out to be correct so it was
ecstatic the day of realizing what it

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
ecstatic the day of realizing what it
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210
ecstatic the day of realizing what it
might be and then a few months later

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
might be and then a few months later
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.780
might be and then a few months later
realizing that if 70 was also strong and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
realizing that if 70 was also strong and
 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.910
realizing that if 70 was also strong and
a favorite feature than it it must be

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
a favorite feature than it it must be
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.340
a favorite feature than it it must be
correct
