00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Let's take a look at the answer about which intellectual property matched

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.740
what is protectable in examples.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.170
For trademark, what is protectable is branding.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.850
Examples are marks and logos and slogans.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.250
For copyright, it's creative, authored works and expressions. Not ideas.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
The examples could be software, songs, movies, website content.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.630
For trade secrets, what's protectable is anything. Secrets that you think have economic value.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.400
Examples are non-public technology like the Coke secret recipe,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.040
or your proprietary customer list, or some kind of algorithm or formula

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.940
you didn't want to patent.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.640
For contract and non-disclosure agreements, what is protectable is whatever you

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.350
and the person who is going to do the deal with you have defined in the contract

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.580
and is enforceable in the law.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.890
You could have technology, business information, etc. as examples.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.090
Finally patents. So what's protectable are non-obvious inventions.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.230
Examples are new technology that haven't been previously patented or applied for,

00:01:03.230 --> 99:59:59.000
and you have to be first.
