00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.535
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Before we start this unit, let's take another look at MathQuill. In the last

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:07.055
section, we were able to type in inequalities and interval notations for our

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:10.787
answers. Now, we're going to try some fractions. In a fraction in MathQuill is

00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:14.518
very similar to what you've done in the past. You simply going to type in the

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:18.317
numerator then the forward slash and then the denominator. Mathquill will do all

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:22.140
the hard work for you and will make your fraction look nice. But sometimes we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.176
don't want just a fraction, sometimes you want a little bit more. After typing

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:30.278
in a fraction, you'll notice that your cursor bar is in the denominator. To move

00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:34.246
the cursor bar from the denominator, simply hit the over arrow key and it will

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:38.133
shift back up to the main line. And now you're ready to continue typing just

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.091
like before. You would type x plus sign and then 1. And it turns out anytime

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.571
you're typing inside a MathQuill box, you can just use your arrow keys as

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.491
navigation. Try playing around with MathQuill and use these arrow keys. Don't

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.238
worry about making a mistake because you can always hit Delete. When you play

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:56.950
around with it, you'll notice that the cursor bar will move up and down inside

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.599
of a fraction. You can even hit the carrot symbol and then you can create an

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:04.922
exponent cursor. We won't cover this now, but if you want to play around with

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:07.312
it, feel free to. We'll do this again later.
