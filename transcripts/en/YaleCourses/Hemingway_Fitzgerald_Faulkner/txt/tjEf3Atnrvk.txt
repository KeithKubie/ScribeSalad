Speaker 1:          00:01          So we're getting started. Um, the sound of fury, and this is, um, just want to show you, um, the field images, um, of, um, Faulkner's Oxford, Oxford, Mississippi. Um, so this is Rowan Oak, Faulkner's house. And um, this is actually the old, um, Faulkner family house. And you notice that I'm actually quite a few American authors changed the spelling of the names. So hot on, um, used to be a t. H. O. R. N. E. So, um, the w is an added on and likewise, and it used to be spelled f a L K and you are out. So I was just an interesting fact, but this is a trek dial, a partner house, um, and 1904 and the little boy on a pony, that's as they thought in there, right there. Um, so, um, this is, um, his stature, um, in the courthouse square in Oxford. Um, and keep that this square in mind, uh, because in fact it will come back at the very end, the sound, the fury, the confederate monument in that squares.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Very important, uh, to apply of design if already. So just to landmark, you know, I mean, it is the most important place in central, square and arts with, so it was very important and falling and sitting right there. Um, and this is an image of him at work and you see that he's, he was a very bookish author, um, you know, surrounded by books as he, um, as, as, as he wrote. Um, and so we have to keep in mind that authors are also leaders as well and what they read, um, make a difference to how they write. So both, um, the creator of his own writings, but also read other people's writings. Um, and this is the mythic a unit to have you and then tell powerful accounting your net top county. I can always have trouble saying this, um, and is mad by Faulkner himself.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Uh, and it's, um, obviously completely made up, but very much based on, uh, uh, uh, Oxford. And this is, uh, Jefferson Mississippi in Faulkner's works. So, um, it's, it's just a really interesting fact of Faulkner's writings, um, that he should create not just in the theology, but also a whole landscape that goes with that. Um, and talking about Faulkner as, um, a reader, not just an author, but also, um, sound of the fury. The phrase is taken from the Beth at five scene five. Um, and it turns out that there's another phrase that's awesome, very important to him as well. So tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted force. The way to dusty that out out brief candle lives for the walking shadow, the poor player that struts and Fred's his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Is it how told by an idiot for Sam and fury signifying nothing. So the title of the novel, um, is taken from the phrase sound and fury, but today's Benji section is obviously a tale told by an idiot. And that's really the challenge that Faulkner, um, takes upon himself is to use mental retardation as a constrain on duration. Um, and to take up the challenge that comes from that constraint. So, um, and here, um, I want to read you two accounts of partners, um, on description of how the sound and the fury began. Um, and one is much less precise than the other. And I'll say a little bit about your upcoming paper in that context. But first, let's look at the two accounts the thought may himself offers, um, that began as a short story. It was a story without plot. Some children being sent away from the house during the grandmother's funeral, they were too young to be told what was going on.

Speaker 1:          04:44          And these are things only incidentally to the childish games they were playing. So, you know, this is a fine, um, description is, is an okay summary of the sound. The fury is about children at the beginning of the [inaudible], um, being sent away from the house, but there's kind of strange central reality given to her grandmother's funeral. Um, and not being able to figure out what was going on. Um, that is not, not in there. It is very much in there in his arm if period. Um, but our experience with reading Benji's exception isn't really revolving around that particular event so far other than obviously has moved away from that initial account way. So let's look at his second account, much more precise, much closer to what we actually see in the Benji's action. And then the idea struck me to see how much more I could have gotten out of the idea of the blind self centeredness of innocence, typify by children.

Speaker 1:          05:52          If one of those children have been truly innocent. That is an idiot. So it was born and then I became interested in the relationship of the idiot to the world he was in, but would never be able to cope with. And just where could he get the tenderness, the hell to show him in his innocence, I mean innocence in the sense that God has stricken him blind at birth. That is mindless at both. So I'll come back to this particular very precise, very, very good summary. Um, of the Benji's section, but I just want to stop for a moment and talk about one strategy to keep in mind, um, as you write your papers because this is a writing wr class. Um, so, um, I want to um, emphasize how important it is to know exactly what you're trying to do in the paper. That is the most important thing.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Knowing what you want to say is important. It's just about the most important thing as important as having something to say. So that's why, um, the two assignments that accompany the first paper at one is the outline in which you name you itemize, you enumerate all the things that you plan to do in the paper. That's very important. Um, and the other is, um, kind of more unusual requirement, um, is the cover page. Um, they're the company as your first paper that will both describe what you're trying to do, um, the parlance that you've run into in the course of writing the paper and what you would do differently if you have more time. So it was recognizing the fact that you guys have constraints on you as well. Time goods, right? You just have to turn the paper in. But if you had more time, what else would you do?

Speaker 1:          07:57          What would you do differently? This is to color a self consciousness about the paper as the paperwork goes into the paper, what you are free and able to put in the paper at one moment and what future projects with future versions of the paper you might want to do. Um, as well as the recognition of what you are trying to do that you haven't quite succeeded in doing. Okay. So that is as important as well is realizing that you're trying to do something but you hadn't quite done it. But knowing that that's really what you should try to achieve. Um, so that self awareness after slight gap between what you set out to do and what you've actually achieved, the self awareness of that gap is crucial to you on your way to becoming the writer that you want to be. So, you know, recognizing rating as the process.

Speaker 1:          08:54          Um, you can get them maybe, you know, three of those are the way still another, um, third of it. Maybe more than that, maybe, you know, three quarters of the way. Um, but you know, you're not completely there. Um, but what else do you need to do in order in your own estimation to get to exactly where you are? So this is, um, you know, I would just encourage you to give a lot of thought to those two additional requirements, the first writing assignment. But now let's come back to Faulkner. Um, and his account of this very good, very precise account of the sound of the fury. And we know there's a number of things. First of all, the he is defining it is there in a very peculiar way, right? He's defining idiocy as the blind self centeredness of innocence. He's not using the word mentor, retired patient that's very, very important to keep in mind is not necessarily a simple deficiency.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Um, it is blind. So, you know, it has that aspect. It is self centered and we'll think about what that means, uh, for it is to be a form of self centered in this. But also more than anything else, it is a kind of innocence, which is a good word for most of us. So what does it mean for it? Is there to be kind of innocence? Well, think about that. And in fact, the argument that I would like to make is that not only is Benji himself innocent innocence is also what he demands from the world. Innocence is the impossible demands that he puts upon the person that he loves the most catty. And it is that impossible demands that catty is not able to fulfill and they add [inaudible] does about that. So both is this about being able to supply that requisite, that demand, that innocence that is coming from, from Benji, the demands made upon her, um, not being able to fulfill it fondly.

Speaker 1:          11:02          And Faulkner, Ashley stepping in, um, to, um, supply that lack, um, by his narrative experimentation. So, um, it's, this is the, what I'll try to show in the course of this lecture, but, um, I want to contextualize Faulkner, um, uh, against the number of thinkers who also thought about mental retardation or you know, the various, uh, ways of designated that condition. And the most, one of the most important is the philosopher John Locke. Um, and this is what he says. I'm new, very, very influential. He was one of the most influential text written in that end of the 17th century incentive, very afraid, influential in the 18th century, the 19th century as well. Um, John Locke here in seems to the difference between idiots and madmen that madmen put wrong ideas together and listen from them, but idiots make very few or no propositions and reason scares at all.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Okay. So we almost recognize something else in what John Locke is describing. Madmen put wrong ideas together and reason from them actually he's describing a lot of the characters and Edgar Allan Poe, right? So it's sort of recognize that, um, but areas, and this is really a very good description of what, five minutes trying to create it is put very few or no propositions and reason scares at all. So not being able to put two and two together, not being able to go from point a to point B, that has been just part. And so point a on beer, always going to be completely separate, discrete, unconnected dots is not able to connect all the dots the world. Um, so, so it really goes back to John Locke in some sentence. Um, and um, in the 19th century, um, the institution, how the what was called a lunatic asylum, it's not car by that designation.

Speaker 1:          13:15          Now a mental institution is the word we use. Uh, but when it first started in the mid 19th century, um, harder lunatic asylum, and this is the one in Jackson, Mississippi and Jackson. Mississippi is a very resonant and loaded word in Faulkner. Sending someone to Jackson just means sending to the lunatic asylum. And it comes up in the sound of your head. That comes up in as I lay dying. So this is the large scale, um, housing, concentration of the mentally retarded in just one place. And, um, as we move on to the early 20th century, um, we're beginning to get the newer kind of taxonomy sciences proceed by way of taxonomy. So we could get this 1910 [inaudible] from the American Association on mental deficiency. So we're sort of moving closer and closer to our own time. It's mental deficiency. So the two, three ways to categorize or classify mental deficiency, um, the most severe form is the word idiot.

Speaker 1:          14:28          So, you know, actually the Falklands taking his word from that classification is development, arrested, age to embersol. You know, first it's just of course, really, you know, that we throw it over people is actually has a clinical definition arrested between two and seven. Um, and moron, again, whether we use without thinking about it, uh, has a clinical definition arrested between seven and 12. Um, so, um, as you can see by the early 20th century in, um, the scientific thinking about mental retardation was moving more and more towards a bonded Tatum approach. Right? You know, so, um, we see the numbers right there, age to age as to the seven and ages to seven and 12. Um, to quantify what's developmental stage, um, the, it was arrested, your mental capacities were arrested. Um, and how that would correlate with various degrees of mental retardation. Um, the person who was instrumental was probably the most important figure.

Speaker 1:          15:41          Um, and turning a kind of a quantitative approach, um, into standard practice, uh, was Henry Garde art. Um, and um, and his quantitative approach, um, took a number of forms. He was physical, he was very important, um, as to director of research at the violence in your school for feebleminded girls and boys. One of the first and one of the most important, uh, for 12 years, um, 1906 to 1918 and then he even more important than that, he was actually a pioneer in Iq testing. So the 1908, uh, translation up in these intelligence testing, uh, it was invented by a French psychologist, been there, um, and God are translated from the French, uh, and was instrumental in getting it to be widely adopted. So you know, what we know as Iq has really dated from that time was getting completely quantitative numerical measurements. Um, and then the 1912, he wrote a book, um, kind cat family and inheritance of feeblemindedness.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Um, so this is God as contribution to um, and widely use. Um, understanding of mental retardation, um, fall can be seen in many ways as rejoinder. Um, and uh, maybe a descent departure from this quantitative approach. Here's it's very much a non quantitative approach. Um, the quantitative approach not only anthracite is numerical measurement, but it's very much an objective look at mental retardation from the outside, right? You know, it is people who are not retarded, uh, looking at people who are retarded and seeing where they're deficient. So the deficiency indexed, the numerical index is a measurement of how deficient they are as defined by people who are not retarded. Um, farmers tell to my period is fairly much the tell from inside the mind of an idiot. It is not the total by someone from the outside looking at Benji from the outside. It is tow from inside the consciousness of an idiot with the blind self centeredness of innocence being front and center.

Speaker 1:          18:02          That is the defining, um, grime of Benji's world. Um, so what we get is the suits, the very recognizable modernist technique, stream of consciousness. Um, and in this case of allowing for extreme subjectivity. So, you know, as opposed to the objectivity of the quantitative approach, this is extreme subjectivity. Um, and we see a number of features associated with this extreme subjectivity. One is we've seen this before, refresh my memory about this. Um, is that the past and the present adjust to post, right? So, and we can call it by different names. That is non linear chronology. Um, we've also seen the private part, primacy of smell and we'll see how that really is the basis on which department tells to central story in the Benji [inaudible]. And another interesting feature is the incomplete syntax. I'll talk about all this. Um, but first, just, um, this is a passage that we looked at before and just want to bring it back.

Speaker 1:          19:08          This is very early in the band section. Um, just opposing, uh, two moments, um, that might not seem connected to the rest of us, but they are connected in Benji's mine does you come to meet Katie? She said rubbing my hands while is it whether you're trying to tell Katty Kay, smell my trees and like when she says we were asleep, whether you're moaning about Lester said you can watch them again. When we get to the brand here, here's you the with so you know, fairy content into they've um, yoking together of two experiential moments for Benji. You can together one episode having to do with his sister Cathy young logo and the other having to deal with luster, a young black surgeon. Um, so those two are connected. Benji makes no racial distinctions that are important to register this flat, no racial distinction. And then Jews life.

Speaker 1:          20:11          That might be one way. Why either it might not be completely deficient in Faulkner's estimation. Um, but in any case, he's not making the usual, you know, distinction, but he is making instead of the connection through the sense of smell rates are catty smelt latreese. Um, lastly, it doesn't exactly smelt like trees, but he's coming up with a good enough substitute, the Jimson weed. So this is thoughtless way of substitution. The logic of substitution is a play now in Faulkner, um, and last days almost good enough and it's the sense of smell the connects, those two moments and Benji's Jay's mind. So here I want to, um, bring up another, um, psychiatrist, psychologist, um, that you would recognize right away. Um, and that in some sense father and is also, um, departing from, and this is Sigmund Freud. Um, and um, in his classic, um, on civilization and its discontent, Freud argues that the development of human sexuality, um, makes it less and less dependent on the census now that the sense of smell becomes, um, less and less central to, um, the demonstration and the articulation of human sexuality.

Speaker 1:          21:48          So this is what throws as the development of human sexuality seems most likely to be connected with. The dual inhibition of the olfactory stimuli by me is a wish. The Mastro process producers. And in fact, on the male psyche, the row was taken over by the visual excitations, which in contrast to the incident mitten or factories, stimuli, we're able to have a permanent effect. So this is, we assume, recognize the truth of what, um, of what fry the saying that we don't get, usually we're not attracted to people because of the way that you smell. Usually the first thing that gets us is the way they look. So, you know, he's described, I'm not overly generalizing, but I think that that's probably true of lots of people. It's the first thing that they see is how some, the first fact that they registered that anyway is how that person looks, not the way they smell.

Speaker 1:          22:51          So I mean Friday's not, um, not, you know, this is not untrue, but, um, the way that he denigrates the importance of the sense of smell is something that one might take issue with. Um, and it turns out that fog nerve actually is taking issue with that denigration of the senses smell. Um, the sound of fury is obviously about hearing that announced in the title of the novel. But the sense of smell is actually very important. So what I like to do today is to use the sense of smell as the, in that as the connecting thread through wish far from the towels, the dramatic story and a dramatic stories, obviously caddies story told through the eyes of her brother who loves him, loves her, but who is completely blind and completely self center in his love for caddy. So the story goes on there like this.

Speaker 1:          23:56          Um, the innocence, sexual innocence of Cali is threatened by this. We store precariously risk toward twice and then it is Trenton yet again. And there's no restoration. This time it is lost. It's gone forever. And that lost does something to Benji. And we stayed in a way that is syntax becomes incomplete and then the something else that it's lost to Benji as well. But father, knowing that innocence has to be sheltered through acts of tenderness, is able through his narrative to supply that af of tenderness that is not coming anymore from Catholic. So it's very complicated story is actually completely, uh, it makes complete sense actually to me. Um, so in that sense, you know, it, it's for them staying extremely coherent story, too complicated, um, non linear chronology of NGS section. Um, but it is a story that we have to reconstruct by following one particular phrase that has to do with the census now.

Speaker 1:          25:17          So let's go to the first step of innocence becoming dangerously in Japanese, but being restore in the nick of time. Okay. So, um, and caddy put her arms around me and a Shining Vale and I couldn't smell the trees and ignore and I began to cry. Benjamin, Kathy said Benjy she put her arms around me again and I went away. What is it? Benji just said, isn't this hat? She told her hat off and came again and I went away. Benji, she that, what is it Benji? Well, this can be done. I went to the bathroom door, I could hear water. I listened to the water, I couldn't hear the water and Kelly opened the door. [inaudible] she said she looked at me and I went and she put her arms around me. Did you find Hattie again? She said she think how they have run away.

Speaker 1:          26:20          Hey, smell like trees. Okay. So that is the phrase that is going to be our guide in the reconstruction of the drama that Faulkner is giving us. Um, and we know this right away that Kelly is the supplier of tenderness for a good pot of Benji's section. Hookers. Ristick gesture is putting her arms around Benji and we can think of it both in terms of the physical act of putting her arms around Benji, but also wrapping her mind around Benji. Um, someone who's not able to tell her what is wrong. Right? So Kathy tried to figure out what it is that is making Benji cry and wish I remember the all this time when Benji is crying, it's actually making this incredible noise is this battling that's just filling up the whole house unbearable. Um, so you know, just like, um, the noise and Hemingway's Indian camp, this is unbearable noise coming from Benji.

Speaker 1:          27:27          So, you know, just to stop that noise. Um, Kelly is to figure out what it is that is upsetting Benji to this extent. And she tries out a number of explanations. Right. So is it this hat that I'm wearing that you don't mind? This making use of upset? Wrong answer. Can I figure out figures, figures out the answer. And it has to do with something that requires go into the bathroom and turning on the Faucet. So this is the only thing that Benji is going to tell us is that Kelly has figured out what it is. She goes to the bathroom, he hears the water running while the runs for awhile can hear the water anymore. Kenny comes out, everything is okay again. Kennedy puts her arm around Benji Kelly's mouth, like trees, everything is okay and lessons has been restored. So what is it that was really upsetting Benji.

Speaker 1:          28:27          We found out very soon. Next page after they've talked me. It actually isn't it? So, um, you know, impossible to read. I mean, you know, this is fairly close. Cluing in what exactly? Uh, was upsetting to Benji. They'll say, Kathy said Benji has gone to prison for you. She stooped down and put the bottle in my hand, holding out to go. They'll now, Kelly held my hand and their see took the bottle. Well I declare due season if my baby and give, they'll see a bottle of perfume. Just look here at Roscoe's caddies. Smells like trees. We don't like earthy ourselves. Said she smelled like cheese. So that is what was upsetting. And J is the use of perfume that sign that Hattie is on her way to losing homosexual innocence. Um, and what is really interesting is that on this occasion a is able to do exactly what is needed.

Speaker 1:          29:36          Much gives away the perfume and she uses the Pronoun we, we don't like perfume anymore. This fusing of herself and Ben j even though really is Benji who objects to the perfume, uh, after putting her on both physically and metaphorically around Ben j Kelly uses the more encompassing pronoun we, that is the syntactic equivalent to the physical act of putting her arm around Benji. So this is one moment when we can see this clear danger. The danger has been averted. Innocence has been restored. Let's look at one other moment when that happens again. Um, it was two now and then one in the swing headache came fast way in the darkness. Benji, she said, how did you slip up? Where's version? She put her arms around me and I hush and held to her dress and try to away caddy and I ran, we ran up the kitchen steps onto the porridge and caddied now done in the dark and held me.

Speaker 1:          30:52          I could hear her and feel her chest. I won't, I won't anymore ever. Benji Benji. Then she was crying and I cried and we held each other hush. Just hush. I won't anymore. So I hush and Kenny got up and we went into the kitchen and turn the light on and catty took the kitchen so and wash your love at the same hot Tevye smelled like trees. Once again, that's very reliable. Thread that five minutes giving us. So we've just looked at one kind of re of arithmetic and the earlier use of the Pronoun we re catty and Benji being two different people but being turned into a single unit by that first person thorough. We, the two of them had become one in that earlier moment here. This, the repetition of that kind of logic except that it is not Benji who's been fused with chaotic, it was two now and then one in the swim calving and who bow in this way, the two of them becoming one and it is that site that is unbearable to Benji.

Speaker 1:          32:16          So that's why she was crying and caddied this time doesn't have to guess. She knows it's not clear what it is that is upsetting. Bangy so much. So once again, she tries her best to make things okay for the energy again, she puts her arm around Benji. Um, and then she does what is one more time. Um, and it is within the capacity to do what is needed. So she goes to the kitchen is not the bathroom, but it's the same really the equivalent functional equivalent of the bathroom, um, turns the light on turns on the faucet one more time, right? This necessary ingredient. Now those are the necessary ingredients to the restoration of innocence. Faster soap and water washing out her mouth. So she wants again, smells like trees. So, um, we can see that cat is doing everything that Benji is demanding from her, but I think that we can also see how unreasonable Benji is.

Speaker 1:          33:26          Right? So let's not romanticize Benji and you know, just call him innocent. He is innocent, but this is an innocent, that is not only blind to the needs of catty. She is going to become a woman. She's not going to be able to wash yourself, clean every time with soap and water. Um, and Benji is simply has no recognition of catty as a separate person who has her own developmental path. She's going to turn from a young girl to a woman that's her developmental path. And because Benji is arrested at age two, he wants everybody or you know, whatever age to age four, um, because he's arrested in such an early age, he wants everybody to be developmentally arrested at that age as well. With that degree of innocence and bad Katie is not able to do for him. So it is a very, um, uh, impossible, very self centered kind of demand that Benji is imposing.

Speaker 1:          34:39          Um, on Kelly, and in that sense, sowing the seed of its own destruction. It is at the demand that cat is, can never meet in the long run is almost like the impossible demand that gaspy is putting on these. Right. You know, we're beginning to see actually a pattern of people who love intensely, um, but in a very intensity of the love, putting an impossible demand on the love object. Um, just no human being is capable of meeting that demand. Um, so not surprisingly, we see, um, this time caddy failing Benji and see what's in this passage and what is not. In this passage, we were in a hall, caddy was still looking at me. A hand was against her mouth. She stopped again against the wall looking at me and I cried and she went on and I came on crying as just ran against the wall looking at me. She opened the door to her room, but I bought a red dress and we went into the bathroom and she stood against the door looking at me though, should put her arm across her face. And I've posted her cry.

Speaker 1:          36:06          So the Kurds rustic gesture coming from Kelly, putting her arms around Benji that is not here in this passage as that, just putting her arm across on those as just doing this because Benji is trying to get her to go the bathroom, you know, to achieve that, that previously try then, you know, solution that worked before on Benji [inaudible] one more time. This time, best solution isn't going to work. So we see it in the nonappearance of that gesture coming from catty arms around years. She's now able to do that. And we also see that non appearance of that phrase, Kelly's smell like triaged smell and trees anymore and she never world smell like trends again. So this is a five way of telling the story of loss of sexual interactions, um, completely through the sense of smell and through it's very indirect way of channeling it through of the mind of some of us were mentally recall, the retired or who can mean they can vision can't really need that loss.

Speaker 1:          37:23          Uh, but who registered that lost as a sensory loss rate, you know, so he's not able to reason but his senses to how him, what actually has happened. So you know, this is one way in which Benji Ashley both knows and not knows me. He knows really in the sense that his reaction and says that he knows, but he doesn't know in the sense that he doesn't, can you give them reason, can mean the condition. Um, so let's look at the consequences of that lost on Kelly's, what happens to energy within the losers. Caddy in this way. And the way father is telling that story is by this technique af Benji not finishing his sentences. So let's look at this income fixed impacts in the very, um, all the way through. Um, the, the Benji action, but especially striking in this moment. They came on, I opened the gate and they start telling, I was trying to say a quarter trying to say, and she screamed and I was trying to say and trying and the right shapes began to stop.

Speaker 1:          38:43          And I tried to get up the trolley, get it off of my face, but the bright shapes we're going again. They would go on up the hill to where it fell away. And I tried to cry, but when I breathe in, I couldn't breathe out again to cry. And I try to keep from falling off the hill and then fell off the hill and to write whether the shapes. So it is tow as a jumble of sensations. How is this the only way, and you can tell the story, but we can sort of know, you know, roughly what is going on. Um, someone, we, we need more to know that someone had left the gate open. So some school goes, we're going by and Benji had lost Kelly at this point. He sees the school goes, it's always looking for substitutes for candidate. So he grabs one of those school goes, um, I caught her trying to say, and we can almost see that this is what happens to this is the consequences of what happens to Benji when this not caddied there to complete his sentences for him.

Speaker 1:          39:51          Right. Catty, putting her arm around Benji is her way of finishing his sentences, saying what he cannot save himself. She's not there, um, to do that for him. So Benji sentences are left hanging incomplete, always trying to say, uh, without the, uh, predicate without an object, uh, without just as grammatical compliments who, uh, finishing that sentence. Um, and um, that's just how things are going to be for him forever. Um, you know, trying to say something, trying to, um, express himself to the world without the resources of the language and without Amanda capacity to do so. So we also know what happens when you know that really this is the moment. What is Faulkner is actually registering mental deficiency. Something is lacking from the Eia is missing from Benji's. Well, um, and something is happening to be energy as well as red. It looks like something has been put on his face. Um, he can breathe, um, that he is fighting it, but this thing is happening to him. So what is it that's happening to Benji at this moment? Uh, we see the physical manifestation was happening to him just a little later. I got an address and I looked at myself and I began to cry hush. Those that said,

Speaker 2:          41:25          looking at looking for them in going to do no good, they are gone. Okay. So

Speaker 1:          41:34          that is what happens to Benji. Um, you know, I don't think it was, you know, I think that we know what happens. We know that people who are mentally retarded, who are threatened to others get castrated. It's still happens. Um, so, um, is, um, a very graphic, um, uh, rendition of the lost that comes to Benji when he loses caddy. But you know, I would say even though it was a horrible fate and you know, Benji can really bear to look at it himself. So he really has that degree of self consciousness. Um, but I have to say that it actually shows, um, some degree of narrative tenderness on the part of the fog. And I really want to emphasize those because they magically, the tendonitis got not going to come from caddy. You know, she's lost that ability. So something else has to supply that tenderness that will show it and shelter Benji and thought that is the one who was doing this.

Speaker 1:          42:43          So on the one hand it is terrible that there should be that lost coming to Benji. But at the same time that lost once again establishes a bond trading Benji and having, they do have something in common even though had he doesn't know it and Ben j the last person to be able to say it. And then that condition nonetheless, there is a bond is almost as though Kenny has suffered this terrible thing that she was very there, she was devastated by it. This was a point in time where, um, you know, to be, um, um, to, to have that loss is a kind of incredible stigma on, on, on, on, on, on, on caddy, um, that when something's rooms alive, um, and Benji's live is also ruined, devastated, um, in a parallel fashion. So the two of them as they do have it would have been pushed this point so far as lily, not the consultation to anyone to have that particular thing in common.

Speaker 1:          43:45          But this is the cemetery, um, that Faulkner is, uh, creating, creating for Benji and, and, and catty. Um, we'll look at one other moment and this is the very and of the Benji section, um, in which we see maybe a more compelling, more, um, you know, um, persuasive, uh, way in which, um, uh, shelter could be device for Benji without it being physically there. So this is the very, and of the [inaudible] section, and I'm telling you what I want to say, but obviously we're back to experimentation, um, on the part of the Faulkner. But let's just look at his. Um, father went to the door and look at us again. The dog came back and he's too black in the door and then the door turn black again. Kelly tells me, and I put here is all and the jobless and something I could smell.

Speaker 1:          44:56          And then I could see the windows where the trees were busing than a doc began to go and smooth bright shapes like it always does. Even when caddies says that I have been asleep. Um, this is coming at the very end of Veggie section where they study three and back again to being a young boy. Right? So this is what the nonlinear finally reveal to us. What the nonlinear chronology is doing for Benji. B being 33 is no place for Benji to be, it's a terrible place. No one wants to in his condition at this course, the age when Christ was crucified and obviously that's in Redlands. Um, so he, Benji is going to be crucified at age 33 and father doesn't want him, you know, was that crucification to happen and to be registered. But he doesn't want that to be the experiential ending for Benji.

Speaker 1:          46:01          So because he is telling the story in a nonlinear fashion, he can choose to end the story at a much earlier point. And he can do that because path and presence that always just oppose and benches mind anyway. And he can tell the difference between past and present. So at the ferry and a brand new section, he actually goes back this a bit of time travel for, he gets to go back to a very satisfying moment in time. And let's look at how this moment reconstitutes all those things to the [inaudible] to Benji. Um, the dark comes back to trees about saying so you know, this, this um, sight and sound fuse. Um, that really is the kind of the defining feature of a band as well and have no explanation of law but very reassuring. Um, visual images. Um, father still alive are black and the door and then the door turning black and that's how Benji wants it to be, wants to be asleep, wants to be in bed with Katee holding him and um, he could smell something was really interesting is that there's almost no need to mention that Kelly smells like cheese and there actually is the best envision.

Speaker 1:          47:23          Even that phrase caddies smelt like smelled like trees already suggest that is she was in of not smelling like trees, right? Bend in this dimension that Kelly's melt like trees when she started smelling like trees when Nolan. And so even the appearance of that phrase say, knows that there's already a danger present and maybe has been avoided, but they injured, has been there not been able to name that. And she actually also smells a month on home muddy draws that she's completely Monday from fighting in the wild with Quentin. So his males tree is males, mark the smell of an innocent young girl and that is the smell that Benji ones to die smelling. Um, so he gets to smell that. But what is also interesting is that there's a kind of a bag with reference to the previous traumatic moment, right? The smooth, bright shapes that we just go back to that horrible traumatic moment.

Speaker 1:          48:22          Um, those are the bright whirling sheds that were forced upon Benji at this moment when he's completely helpless, when it's pen and died down when Katty is nowhere to be seen. Um, those bright whirling shapes and this supremely traumatic moment, those have been reconstituted as comforting shapes that he just doesn't know why they're there, but his falling asleep and caddy is telling him that he's falling asleep. He doesn't even have to work to talk about, describe the condition of being asleep, but as, okay, this is really one moment where not having language is completely okay and Foglar has been managed to bring Benji back to the point with life. Ashley is bearable and in fact satisfying. Um, he can talk on, can't really do more. One that can really bring true happiness, actual objective happen is we can bring objective happiness to Benji at 33. The only way you can bring is subjective satisfaction to Benji at the age 33 acting as if he was much younger and still having Kelly there. So, um, you know, that the narrative experimentation is really completely, um, thematically consequential as well. Um, and that's really is the story that fall in Italian. So we'll move on this time and to Quentin section session too.
