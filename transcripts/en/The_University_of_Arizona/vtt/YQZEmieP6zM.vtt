00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.960
Good evening, and thank you for
coming to today's installment

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.460
of Life in the Universe,
brought to you by UA Science.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.340
So first, I'd like to
point out that we're

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.480
very interested in
your participation.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.010
And in other years,
what we've had

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.160
is answers and questions
from the audience, which

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.704
has become very complicated.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.120
This year, we're going to do
something slightly different.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.620
And what we're going
to do is, we're

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.060
going to have a panel discussion
which is going to be broadcast

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.030
by KUAT on the 20th of March.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.810
And what I ask all
of you is to send us

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.290
your questions between now
and the 20th, so some of you

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.670
will be able to ask those
questions to the panel.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.920
The panel will be on the 20th,
as I mentioned, at one o'clock

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.250
in the afternoon.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.820
And I can tell you,
because I've been in a room

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
with these folks, that the most
interesting conversations I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.660
have ever heard have been
the conversations between all

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.540
the speakers talking
to each other.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.770
And now, they'll be able
to answer your questions.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.020
The second that has to do with
the participation of the public

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.450
is, we're going to
inaugurate this year

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870
an institute at the Biosphere.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.550
And if you want to spend three
days and two evenings embedded

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.900
in science with scientists,
keep your eyes open.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.592
Between now and when the
lecture series is over,

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.550
you'll have information
of how you can actually

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.090
be part of the Biosphere
2 institute this year.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.660
And that's to give
Aspen Institute

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.665
a run for their money.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.560
I'd like to thank the
folks that make it possible

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.500
for us to do this in a way
that it doesn't cost you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.390
anything but the parking.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.280
And I have to deal with
that, but the parking

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370
is sort of the final frontier.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.970
And there is a list of those
that make it all possible.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.110
And in particular, we
should give an applause

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.880
to all of them.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.880
And in particular, Ventana,
TEP, and the Arizona Daily Star

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.060
have been with us since day one.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.350
They have made it possible.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.300
They've made it possible for you
to know that this is going on.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.322
And I thank them sincerely.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.230
Now, another thing
that the folks that

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.960
pay for this allow us to
do is to have middle school

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.790
and high school
teachers take part

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.500
of this experience
in a deeper way,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.890
so that they can actually
create curriculum and take back

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.040
to their classes.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.809
And I'd like to ask the faculty
to stand up for a second,

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.600
so that we can all give
you a big applause.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.800
And in particular, I'd like
two people to stand up.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.077
John Pollard, who is
a person from the U

00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:14.160
of A that's teaching them.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.070
And Margaret Wilch, teach the
most extraordinary high school

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.090
teacher in the world.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.350
It's Dr Wilch, because
she has an honorary degree

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.110
from the University
of Arizona in science.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.206
All right.

00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:42.580
Well, the first
day that you came

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.170
here, the first
Monday you came here,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.490
you heard all about how
little we can actually

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.430
even define life.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.171
And the reason for
that lecture is

00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:51.170
that if we're going to
find life somewhere else,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.620
we should know what
we're looking for.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.610
And you heard that lecture,
and basically, it's hopeless.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.960
But we are trying.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.640
The second lecture went the
step of how do you actually

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.560
create life from chemistry.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.100
So Donte Loretta pointed
out that the elements that

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.470
are required to create life were
not created at the Big Bang,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.330
they were created when
the stars were formed.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.240
And as the stars die, the
whole interstellar medium

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.140
becomes full of these elements,
like carbon and phosphorus

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.600
and nitrogen, which are
required to make DNA and so on.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.240
So he tried to address
the question of,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.100
how do you go from
chemistry to life?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.150
And he was able to
at least address,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.040
in some ways, how you get the
chemistry to maybe RNA or DNA.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.350
And there's still the challenge
of how you make cells.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.180
He didn't even go there.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.920
Today, we're going to talk
about another mystery.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.070
And that mystery is, how do
we get all of the biodiversity

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.200
that we have in a place like the
Earth from the simple building

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.270
blocks that we're
all made out of.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.550
So Brian Enquist
will tell us today

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.090
about biodiversity, how it
starts, what keeps it going,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.430
and the scaling laws in biology.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.580
How do we scale up from a very
small animal to a very large

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.380
animal or plant?

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.020
So the idea of biodiversity,
how we make all

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.790
that we see from
the stuff that's

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.710
Donte Loretta was telling
us about last time

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.510
is an amazing mystery.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.000
Now, Brian is an amazing
individual from the National

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.880
Science Foundation.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.890
He's a Young Principal
Investigator Award.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.540
These are very important things.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.340
From the Ecological
Society of America,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.320
he got one of the most
prestigious awards

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.200
as a young scientist.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.950
And more importantly, Popular
Mechanics, of all places,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.970
named him one of the 10 most
interesting young scientists

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.800
to follow.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.650
So there you go, he
may have something

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.800
to do with cars as well.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.160
So I leave you
with Brian Enquist.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.820
Thank you.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.400
It's an absolute
rush to be here.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.910
What an amazing night
for science in Tucson.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.210
But I think before
I get started,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.380
this series would
not be possible

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.310
if it weren't for the brain,
drive, and passion of Joaquin.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.670
So let's thank Joaquin.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.380
For not only being our leader
in the College of Science

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.270
but also setting a good example
for what science should be,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.100
not only in a real democracy,
but its role to play

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.480
in terms of creating dialogue.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.150
Unlike most of the
other speakers,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.280
I'm actually tweeting this,
so feel free to send me

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.310
a tweet if you want.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.250
I'll try not to tweet
while I'm talking.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.230
So what I want to
start with today

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.340
is actually one of my
favorite photos of the earth.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.130
This was taken in
1968 by the crew

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.040
of one of the Apollo missions.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.610
This was the first image a
human actually saw of the earth.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.890
So this is the first photograph
of the Earth taken by a human.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:17.170
And what's amazing is that
I don't study the universe.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.480
I don't build a satellite.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.000
I study life on Earth.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.690
And so what I would
like to do today

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.310
is tell you a little bit
about life on Earth but also

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.410
what I find absolutely
amazing about life on Earth.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.430
So let me show you one of
the places that we work.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.210
This is the Kosnipata
Valley, this is in Peru.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.650
It's right near
Manu National Park.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.160
It's perhaps the most
biodiverse place on the planet.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.090
We study the diversity
of plants and trees

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.440
along an elevational gradient.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.060
So we go from tree line
at the top of the Andes,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.480
we drop all the way down
to the Amazon basin.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.060
And we want to understand what
not only controls the changes

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.030
in diversity that we see
along these gradients

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.464
but also how tropical
forests, how ecosystems work.

00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:09.880
And we also want
to understand how

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.790
these organisms work,
in particular how

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.400
these trees work.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.890
So when we go out on our various
different collecting missions,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:24.260
we sample leaves, we climb
trees, we bring them down.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.700
And we put them in these
pretty fancy bits of equipment

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.410
here, where we're actually
measuring their metabolism,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.360
their photosynthetic rate.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.140
We then take the
leaves, we process them

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.610
here in a field lab in the
middle of the rainforest.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.214
Take those leaves,
we bundle them up,

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:41.380
and we bring them back to
the University of Arizona,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.919
where we measure other
aspects of their metabolism,

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.755
such as nitrogen
content, phosphorus

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:52.400
content, isotopic various
signatures and so on.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.990
And our ultimate
goal here is that we

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.330
want to understand how these
trees, these organisms, work.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.890
But ultimately, we want to
understand how these ecosystems

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.960
will respond to climate change.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.210
But we don't want
to understand how

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.470
they change over time
or across elevation,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.600
but we want to be
able to predict what's

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.162
going to happen in the future.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.220
Now, to try to bring in
the predictive sense,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.650
we also work quite a bit on
developing mathematical theory.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.640
And a lot of this math
is aimed to ultimately

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.200
boil down and kind of
get at these measurements

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.740
that we're taking
within the field

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.490
and take then, those
measurements in order

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.960
to scale up and
understand and make

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.880
predictions about how
these tropical forests work

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.863
but also how ecosystems work.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.900
So this is really a search.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.570
We're interested in
searching for generalities

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.970
in how life works.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.450
We want to understand something
as vast as the Amazon ring

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:01.530
forest, which also you can think
of as the lung of our planet.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.210
What happens in the Amazon
influences are global climate,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.620
it influences the
rest of the biosphere.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.430
So what can we do in order
then, to search for generalities

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.690
or rules about how organisms
work, how diversity responds

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.530
to changing climates, in
order to ultimately provide

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.260
a more predictive
framework for biology?

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.730
So is Earth the only
planet with life?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.720
I guess the quick
answer is, I don't know.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.380
But as a biologist,
what I want to know

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.910
is what is really unique
about life on Earth?

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.100
Now, based on what we
know about life on Earth,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.840
if we found life
elsewhere, what is

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.060
our best guess or best
prediction in terms

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.010
of what would it be like?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.880
And if we could
then have some sort

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.227
of prediction, what would those
predictions then be for life?

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.240
So what I would like
to do in this talk

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.540
is counter two different views
about biology and arguably

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.480
about life in the universe.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.232
But is life on Earth
really dictated by chance

00:11:09.232 --> 00:11:10.190
or is it deterministic?

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.990
Now, in studying biology
for quite some time, what

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.100
I'm actually impressed
with is that I

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.020
think there's a very big
division within biology.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.770
Well, maybe division
is too harsh of a word.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.840
But it seems that biology really
does struggle with these two

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.580
different worldviews on life.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.920
In particular, is
life due to chance,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.900
or is life deterministic?

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.490
So on the one
hand, life on Earth

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.700
is amazing and
intricate and diverse,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.430
but the thinking goes
that it's actually

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.910
arisen due to
multiple events that

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.580
are essentially unpredictable.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.460
On the other hand, we
could also make arguments

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.510
that life on Earth is
highly deterministic,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.690
and that we can
ultimately boil things

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.770
down to general rules and
principles which have guided

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.238
the diversification of life.

00:12:08.326 --> 00:12:09.200
So what about chance?

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.280
So when we step back and
we look at the world,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.720
and actually this is one
of my favorite paintings

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.240
I should say, by Jan Brueghel.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.440
This is an 1613, Noah's Ark.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.600
When we step back and look
at the diversity of life

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.980
on the planet, it
really is amazing.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.310
There are small organisms.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.520
There's big organisms.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.400
There's organisms
that fly, organisms

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.190
that burrow in the earth.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.470
All the way from
microbes all the way up

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.480
to the macroscopic,
huge organisms

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.567
that we share the planet with.

00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:43.650
And it's actually amazing.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.550
If you study
biological processes,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.340
biological processes operate
at the subcellular scale,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.600
all the way up to the
scale of the biosphere.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.270
So basically, life
operates over 21 orders

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.010
of magnitude in scale.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.460
So that's a number,
take a number

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.920
and move the decimal
point 21 times,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.630
that's a huge range that
biology is operating over.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.435
But is it all really by chance?

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.820
So when I graduated from high
school and went to college,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.410
I decided that I want to
be a biologist, because I

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.200
loved various organisms, I loved
the diversity of the Earth.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.350
I love going out
and understanding

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.270
how living things worked.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.710
When I decided to
be a biology major,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.610
my parents gave me a book,
and it was this book.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.560
This is a book by Stephen
Jay Gould entitled

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.700
Wonderful Life,
The Burgess Shale

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.027
and the Nature of History.

00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:41.610
And what's interesting
about this book

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.750
is that it really struck
a chord in me early on.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.530
And I kind of assumed
that well, this

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.783
is how in general all
biologists really think.

00:13:48.783 --> 00:13:52.940
But it also kind of haunted
me, because it spelled

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:58.660
out a view of the world that,
if true, from my perspective,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.380
can't be correct.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.020
How can it be that all of life
and the diversity that we see

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.470
today is due just to chance?

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.630
So according to
Gould, chance was

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.110
and is one of the decisive
factors in the evolution

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.450
of life on Earth.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.200
And the paths then, that life
has taken since essentially,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.130
life arose at the beginning
and evolved then, continuously

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.760
to today, these
various paths then

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.500
were actually constrained
by various historical events

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.770
well outside of the control
of anything biological.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.930
Effectively, these
random historical events

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:36.555
and accidents.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.399
So that was in 1989.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.940
Now, what's interesting
is that Gould

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.370
takes a very interesting picture
about how the world actually

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.910
works.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.880
And within that
book, he actually

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.090
asked the reader to do
a thought experiment.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:15:02.630
In particular, if we were to
take the long history of life,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.680
all the way from present
day all the way back

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.590
to 3.5 billion years ago,
the estimated origin of life,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.440
if we redid evolution,
that is if we replayed

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.440
the tape of life-- in
putting this together,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.490
I was thinking about
my kids and trying

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.000
to explain to them this thought
experiment about rewinding

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.590
the tape.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.320
And I was like, oh, yes, they
don't have tapes anymore.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.160
So this is a dated analogy.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.880
But anyways, if we rewind the
tape, go back to the beginning

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.470
and play the play
of evolution again,

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.880
would we get the same
thing in the end?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.450
So that was the
thought experiment.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.610
So what if we could
go back in time,

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.760
and what if we could watch
evolution happen again?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.130
What would it be like?

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.300
So Gould in particular
focused on a period

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:06.830
of time in the Cambrian
here, 541 million years ago.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.680
I'm sorry, going
to the Precambrian.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.500
So during this time,
this was essentially

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.500
then, the biological
equivalent of the Big Bang.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.424
During this time,
the diversity of life

00:16:17.424 --> 00:16:19.840
really exploded, and we see
all of these various different

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.808
forms of life.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.610
So Gould focused on one example,
in particular the organisms

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.570
and the animals then found
then within the Burgess Shale.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.170
The Burgess Shale then stems
from the middle Cambrian,

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.100
it's about 505
million years old.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.670
It's perhaps one of the
most famous fossil beds

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.670
in the world.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.810
The Burgess Shale is located
here in Alberta, Canada,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.040
it's in the Canadian Rockies.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.690
And so you can go
here and sample,

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.880
and you get these amazing
well preserved fossils.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.210
These fossils preserved
soft parts then of the body.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.190
And you can go through
and you can really

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.670
get a really good snapshot
of essentially a whole living

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.790
ecosystem, all the various
different organisms then

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.230
that lived during that time.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.880
So during this time, life really
was a bizarre and alien world.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.530
If we were able to time
travel and go back and look

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.190
at these various different
organisms, many of us

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.660
would think that we
were in an alien world.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.960
They look very different to
anything that we have today.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.220
The name of this organism,
this is Hallucinogenia,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:37.640
mainly because it perplexed
people quite a bit.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.200
We're not sure exactly
what it looked like.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.620
But over time, as more and
more fossils were found,

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.650
they're able to get a really
good kind of construction,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.750
kind of an idea, a mental idea
of what this organism actually

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.240
looked like.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.200
And so the first then
drawings then of the organism

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.240
looked something
like this, bizarre.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.710
Well, then that caused quite
a bit of debate and stir.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.640
More fossils were found, and
they decided, well, actually,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.690
they drew this upside down.

00:18:07.392 --> 00:18:08.850
So this interesting
little critter,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.410
instead of having these
little spines as legs actually

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.700
had these spines on the back.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.890
And now the thinking is that
these are actual predator

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.560
avoidance spines, effectively.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.650
So when you see something
like that today,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.970
it basically means, don't
eat me, don't touch me right.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.470
Which is interesting,
because now we

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.350
can start to read into the
ecology of what that world was

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.120
like, going all the way back
about 500 million years ago.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.810
So these organisms were
quite bizarre and alien.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.940
And the more we know, the more
bizarre and alien they look.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.000
But what's interesting is that
they were really only just

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.780
a lucky few of these organisms
during this time that actually

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.680
made it through,
left descendants

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.640
that today partially
helped fill our world.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.590
So over the course of
history, chance alone wiped

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.720
out many of these groups,
they're now extinct,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.910
they're no longer with us.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.363
So chance.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.890
So you don't have to go very
far back in recent biology

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.470
to find some pretty
prominent thinkers in biology

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.320
arguing that chance and
unpredictability is a very

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.930
central component of biology.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.310
So this is Watson and Crick,
co-discoverers of the structure

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.145
and shape of DNA.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.420
In 1981, Crick then wrote
a book, Life Itself,

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.540
Its Origin in Nature.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.120
And so he has this great quote
in terms of the origin of life.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.760
And so he says here,
the origin of life

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.990
appears at the moment
to be almost a miracle.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.240
Effectively, punting the ball.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.880
I don't know.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.748
We've got DNA,
that's enough, right?

00:19:57.465 --> 00:20:00.910
Here's Jacques Monod or Monod.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.170
Life is only the
result of pure chance.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.880
So the biosphere doesn't
contain any kind of set or class

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.190
of predictable objects, chance.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:20.160
So does life really come
down to a roll of the dice?

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.830
Well, like anything in
biology, to make sense

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.620
of not only the organisms
today but also of organisms

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.310
in the past and the
origin of life in general,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.800
we ultimately have to understand
the unique selective pressures

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.670
of different environments
but also how life evolves.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.650
So this is Dobzhansky, he was
one of the main architects

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.710
of modern evolutionary
theory in terms

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.610
of our modern understanding
and our modern underpinning

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.240
of the role of evolution
within biology.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.800
And he has this fantastic quote
that says, nothing in biology,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.390
underscore nothing, makes
sense except in the light

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.410
of evolution.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.623
So what about
evolution and chance?

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.730
So 1859, Charles
Darwin publishes

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.690
The Origin of Species.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.730
And so chance is actually
an important component

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.440
of evolution by
natural selection.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.010
Now, what's interesting is I
have here Darwin's algorithm.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.710
And I do that because, if
you read the last paragraph

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.200
in The Origin of
Species, Darwin actually

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.900
outlines then the
theory of evolution

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.950
by natural selection
as an algorithm.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.780
You can almost think of
this as a computer program.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.960
So if a few truths are
correct, then the end result

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.090
must be true, and that
is natural selection.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.150
Now, there is going to be
a quiz on this later on.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.980
So please take some notes.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.840
And I actually ask my
students, incoming students,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.620
if they can basically
outline Darwin's algorithm.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.110
I do that in the
start of every class.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.800
And none of them have gotten
it right at the start,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.640
but they get it right
at the end of course.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.670
So what's the algorithm?

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.950
Well, Darwin observed that
organisms or any organism

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.210
has the propensity to ultimately
grow in its population size

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.930
exponentially.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.450
So take this very cute example
of a bunch of ducks on a pond.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.430
Given enough time, we're
going to be not only filling

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:39.240
the pond with ducks, but
very quickly, that population

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.900
is going to be
growing exponentially.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.970
Any population, bacteria, ducks,
elephants, given enough time,

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.890
that population
rate of growth is

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.590
going to be growing
exponentially

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:56.230
to the point where it could be
growing at the speed of light.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:01.100
Imagine populations of elephants
growing at the speed of light,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.730
clearly that's impossible.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.230
So this is the
insight of Darwin.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.570
Then he said, OK, if that's
true and all these individuals

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.882
at some point are
going to be competing,

00:23:12.882 --> 00:23:18.780
competing either for
mates, space, resources,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.330
that at some point, because of
this competition for limited

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:29.240
resources, that exponential
growth has to change.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.990
There's a leveling
off, there's a carrying

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.239
capacity or a limit to
the number of individuals

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:34.280
and that you can support.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.620
And this is his other insight.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.630
If you look then within any
population, when organisms

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.140
are than competing then
for limiting resources,

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.280
offspring are going to
differ in their ability then

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.110
to compete and obtain resources.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.190
So some individuals are better
in terms of finding mates,

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.250
competing for resources.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.750
Now we know that that
variation is ultimately

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:07.140
due to genetic
variation, ultimately

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.230
random mutation, chance events
introducing this variation then

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.410
into the population.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:19.920
So according to Darwin, if
and all these things are true

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.240
and that genetic
variation is heritable,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.780
then, given all of
the above, you're

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.910
going to see
differential survivorship

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.520
and/or reproduction.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.130
Some individuals will
survive better as well as

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.490
reproduce better, some
combination of the two,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.180
because of which the population
phenotype of the genotype

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.040
will then change.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.445
But then the last step, go back
to one, and repeat infinitely.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.890
So that was Darwin's insight.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.940
So I want to emphasize here
that chance events enters

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:01.180
in terms of how variation is
entered into the population.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.880
But I also want you to note
that individuals are competing

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.130
for limited resources that
ultimately, then they're using

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.365
to fuel then their bodies.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.590
This is the end result.
This is the tree of life.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:21.130
So what I'm showing you here
at the base then of this plot,

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.240
this is time going out
in either direction.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.400
So this is the birth of
the earth then going out

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.230
all the way into present day.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.670
So present day then is
the tips of the trees

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.140
all the way at the top, ranging
from bacteria, eukaryotes,

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.900
plants, fungi, all these
invertebrates, sharks and fish,

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.610
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals, very impressive sweep.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.270
So what's beautiful about
Darwin's insight is that all

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.560
of the organisms today,
all that we know,

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.330
all can be traced back
to one common ancestor.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.739
That ancestor then
left behind descendants

00:25:57.739 --> 00:25:59.530
who left behind
descendants that ultimately

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:04.060
survived to today, populating
the world that we live in.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.440
Now, I want to point out
several very interesting things

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.920
about this plot.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.890
If you'll notice, it's
kind of like an onion.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.750
There's these different kind
of circles in there, right?

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.350
These onions are actually
marking some very important

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.350
Earth history events.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:23.530
In particular, here is
the Cambrian Explosion,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.910
where all of these different
body plans and body types

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:26.720
come about.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.770
If you follow any one branch,
most of those branches

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.850
actually end.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.710
The ending then the branches
then is an extinction event.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.640
But if you'll notice, there's
some pretty large extinction

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.560
events.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.760
There have been five
mass extinction events

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.020
on the earth, because of
which, on the order of 90%

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.340
to approximately 99% of all
species that have ever lived

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.540
on the planet are now extinct.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.210
So literally, we are the 1%.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.410
So chance events.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.010
Many of these mass
extinctions are now

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.130
pointing back to, just by
chance, a large asteroid hit.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.810
So 65 million years ago,
there was a very large one

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.690
that wiped out quite a
bit of life on Earth.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.160
But also 65 million
years ago, also ushered

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:36.490
in a new group of organisms who
before were relatively rare.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.930
So this extinction event ushered
in the age of the mammals

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.690
and the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.810
And it also ushered in
a very interesting niche

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.450
art of extinction
events on the internet.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.320
And I have to say that these
are all very bad pieces of art.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.730
I wouldn't want to
put these on my wall,

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.441
but somebody spent a lot
of time in designing these.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.200
Maybe you saw this recent study.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.130
So this came out
just a few weeks ago.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.930
This was in the New York
Times, a very large study

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.180
on risk of cancer.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:23.240
What they find is that random
mutations, chance events,

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.510
account for about 2/3 of
the risk of getting cancer,

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.180
which leaves the other
suspects, heredity,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.710
environmental
factors, accounting

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.190
for a very small fraction of
your risk of getting cancer,

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.850
chance events.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.960
So two fundamentally
different views of biology.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.198
Chance, but now let's
talk about determinism.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.350
Is life on Earth organized
by a set of general rules

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.855
and principles?

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:02.480
The thinking here is
that, well, maybe,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.400
the winners and the
losers may change,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.684
but the rules of the game
have stayed the same.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.748
And if true, what are the rules?

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.770
Another book that
I was influenced

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.870
by in graduate school
was actually a book

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.710
by Harold Morowitz
published in 1970.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.210
And so what we can
ask are, what are

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.970
the general aspects of life?

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.280
So if we went back and replayed
the tape of life again,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.180
would we likely see
biological constants,

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.355
things that repeatedly evolve?

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.790
So Morowtiz has a great quote.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.450
The energy that flows
through any sort of system

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.550
ultimately organizes
that system.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.020
So he was think of
physical systems,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.632
but also biology
is no different.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.030
Biology ultimately does work.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.840
Biology consumes resources,
converts then those resources

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.780
into offspring, and does work.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.880
We can think of biology as also
having a very physical work

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.110
component.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.770
So here's the hypothesis.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.290
The hypothesis is
that life on Earth

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.790
has emerged in part
deterministically

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.050
from the laws of
chemistry and physics

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.310
but also evolution
by natural selection

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:24.504
to maximize organismal
power, given the constraints

00:30:24.504 --> 00:30:25.295
of the environment.

00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:34.380
So what I would
like to do is work

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.610
through several
different examples, what

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.390
appear to be very
deterministic, very

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.050
rule-like aspects of biology.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.716
The first is something known
as the citric acid cycle.

00:30:47.716 --> 00:30:49.215
It's a part of your
core metabolism.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.510
So when you take
introductory biology,

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.910
you often start with
a review like this.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.620
So this is a typical cell.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.870
You can see all the different
organelles, the nucleus,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.170
the mitochondria, all the
various different components.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.420
Within the nucleus of course,
that's where the DNA is.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.530
But we can take a
completely different view

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.540
of all the amazing biology
then that's within the cell.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.610
Now, when I was taking
introductory biology as well

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.590
as molecular biology and
biochemistry, when I went in

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.810
and I saw it in his chart,
I was like holy bejesus,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.100
do I have to learn all of that?

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.700
Very daunting, but
this is also one

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.560
of the pinnacles of biology.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.260
This is what happens inside
each of your cell effectively

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.200
constantly, every one
of you is doing this,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.960
and yet you're totally unaware.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.210
So biology has been
so successful and very

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.720
Byzantine in drilling
down and working out

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.930
all then of the connections
of the biochemistry

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:05.038
then of a typical
cell, very complicated.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:13.180
Now, let's zoom in
on one part of this.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.090
If you notice this
circular part right here,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.228
this is something known
as the citric acid cycle.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.780
What's interesting about
the citric acid cycle

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.520
is that it's
ubiquitous, from what we

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.170
can tell, across all of life.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.340
Doesn't matter if you're
bacteria, unicells,

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:38.080
multi-cells, animals, plants,
we have the citric acid cycle.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.360
So here's the argument
maybe the TCA cycle

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.910
is an energetic
inevitability, maybe

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.950
the TCA cycle actually
originated before life that we

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.685
know originated.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.600
Here within the TCA cycle,
what you actually see

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.000
is several different
molecules linked

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.860
to the other in a series
of chemical reactions.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.610
There is some input here,
mainly pyruvate, acetyl CoA.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.610
But don't worry about
all those details,

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.790
but if you know a
little bit of biology,

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.570
you should recognize
this, because this

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.280
is one of the key components
of aerobic respiration.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.000
So if you break down
these sort of sugars

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.520
and these sort of
fats or anything,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.580
ultimately, you're going to
be feeding then molecules

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.720
into the TCA cycle.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.190
Two Nobel prize is were
given for, effectively,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.960
the discovery of this.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.170
Adolf Krebs then
was the one that

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.010
worked out the
full cycle was also

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.140
awarded then the Nobel Prize.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.870
It is also known
as the Krebs cycle.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.220
So the core reactions
of the citric acid cycle

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.450
likely existed before cells,
before RNA, before DNA.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.230
The thinking is that this
is an autocatalytic network,

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.720
an autocatalytic set
then of reactions

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.770
where newly created
molecules, then

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.465
catalyze then the reaction
of the next molecule.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.320
In general, this is an
energetically favored set

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.920
of reactions, effectively,
it gives off then free energy

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.615
by this set then of
autocatalytic reactions.

00:34:13.615 --> 00:34:14.989
So you can think
of this as a way

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:19.000
to start creating
order before a lot

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.320
of these big biological
macromolecules,

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.620
before cells, before
molecular replication,

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.635
effectively at the start
then, the beginning of life.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:33.260
Now, what's interesting is that
the derivatives then of the TCA

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.120
cycle then feed into
that very complicated map

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.020
that I showed you earlier.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.409
Effectively,
sugars, fatty acids,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.060
the production of all of
these different molecules,

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:50.070
nucleic acids, amino acids,
all these various different

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.510
cofactors, critical
things that your body

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.574
needs to complete
all the biochemistry.

00:34:54.574 --> 00:34:56.199
This effectively,
you can think of this

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.030
as kind of like the
fountain of all origination

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.840
of biological biochemistry.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.530
So the question is, this is
really the first engine then

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.530
of biological synthesis.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.240
So I'd like you to think of
this as a spinning wheel.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.460
Every time then this
wheel is cranking around,

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.970
producing not only a bunch
of biological molecules,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:24.950
but we're ultimately
creating stored energy.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.910
Within then the stored
energy ultimately

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:31.810
is used to produce ATP, which is
effectively how we're powering

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.850
then all metabolic reactions.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.710
So we're creating then a
bunch of biological molecules,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:43.140
we're also then creating then
and preserving stored energy.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.220
What's interesting
is that the rate then

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.060
of the spin of the
TCA cycles influences

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:54.700
everything, such as how fast
you age, the rate of senescence,

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.600
the risk of cancer, and the
overall organism's energy

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.630
status.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.910
So how fast the cycle
spins is ultimately related

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.880
to a bunch of other biological
phenomena that we study.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.990
Now, one of the big
surprises is that there

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.940
are bacteria then on
Earth who actually don't

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.140
rely on an oxygen-rich
environment

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:25.230
but actually use the TCA cycle,
but they run it in reverse,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.390
really cool.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.470
So it runs in reverse,
and it does the opposite.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.940
So unlike aerobic respiration,
where you breathe in oxygen

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.980
and you breathe out CO2,
if you run it in reverse,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.370
you can actually suck
in carbon dioxide,

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.960
and you can then create a
bunch of additional organic

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.910
molecules, things like vinegar
and additional molecules

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.557
as well, again, some basic
building blocks of life.

00:36:52.557 --> 00:36:54.390
So very interesting,
you can run it forward,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.590
you can run it backwards.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.250
And depending on the
local environment,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.027
that would then select
for whether or not

00:37:00.027 --> 00:37:01.735
you're running this
forward or backwards.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.380
So here, I'm showing you a
deep sea hydrothermal vent.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.280
So these hydrothermal vents
then are at effectively,

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.360
the bottom of the ocean.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.880
This is where your plates
then are splitting apart.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.900
So we have rising magma pushing
our various continental plates

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.060
apart but here, because
of all of the magma

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.010
underneath in the Earth, we're
getting this really superheated

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:36.400
water in to a bunch of dissolved
minerals and other molecules.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.560
And they're then reacting to
create a very interesting mix

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.670
of chemical reactions.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.940
The thinking is that
in this environment,

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.560
these hydrothermal vents,
when we actually look today,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.051
we see life teeming around
these hydrothermal vents.

00:37:55.051 --> 00:37:57.050
And so what's interesting
is that we can support

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:03.110
an entire ecosystem based on
energy that's actually not

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.170
ultimately from the sun
which is most of what's

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.000
life in the oceans and the
terrestrial environment relies

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.250
on, but ultimately, the source
of energy here is geothermal.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.940
So the thinking is before,
there was life on earth,

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.730
these early reactions
of the TCA cycle

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.280
were likely present in
these hydrothermal vents.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.470
All of the molecules
that you need in order

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.980
to get the TCA cycle
going look to be

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.580
present within these
hydrothermal vents.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.625
Now, what's interesting--
we can go back.

00:38:38.625 --> 00:38:40.650
I forgot to one
mention one thing.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.880
If you spin this
thing in reverse,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.300
in order to spin it
in reverse, you're

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.880
actually not creating
energy, but actually you

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.134
have to input energy.

00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:55.800
And so that's actually
very interesting.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.450
So if we run it forward,
we're creating ATP.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.490
If we run it
backwards, we actually

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.650
have to have energy put in.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.880
So where did this initial
set of molecules to power

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.761
the TCA cycle come from?

00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:11.510
Well, the thinking is
that this ultimately

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.550
came from acetyl phosphate.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.720
And acetyl phosphate is
actually very interesting,

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.600
because if you heard the talk
previous to me, Dante talking

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.960
about the early Earth
chemistry, based

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.610
on the chemistry of
meteorites, if you then

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.110
look at the chemistry
of meteorites,

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.484
you'll find that there's a
very large supply, apparently,

00:39:32.484 --> 00:39:36.300
of phosphorous coming
into early Earth.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.680
Those early phosphorus compounds
in combination with water

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.550
looks to easily give
you acetyl phosphate.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.400
So we have all the ingredients.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.340
We have the basic molecules
to start the TCA cycle,

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.330
but we also have acetyl
phosphate to power the cycle.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.700
So the TCA cycle appears
to have originated

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.290
before the origin of cells,
before RNA, and before DNA.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.870
And it's really this
geothermal energy

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.210
that's effectively
provided the environment

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:19.080
and the initial chemistry to get
these initial reactions going.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.430
So remember, if you get
these reactions going,

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:26.360
all one has to do is simply put
those reactions inside a cell

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.810
in order to contain
it and then control

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.087
the production of these
early biological molecules.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.580
So if this is correct,
our initial view

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.580
of the start of life
has actually changed.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:45.400
What we can actually then see
is that this core metabolism

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:51.130
of the TCA cycle appears to
have been present at the start.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.630
Once we have the
ability to create

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.190
some basic biological
molecules associated

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.640
with these autocatalytic
set of reactions,

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.430
somehow, if we then contain and
harness this core metabolism

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.840
within cells, have a
set of genetic material

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.630
in the form of
either DNA or RNA,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.190
to somehow not only
control those reactions

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:21.040
but also have natural selection
taking over at that point.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.780
So if we go from back
to the origin of life

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.280
3.8 billion years
ago, all the way

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.730
to the Cambrian Explosion,
what we actually see

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:33.050
is this core metabolism
staying put and life

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.720
just building more and
more complexity on top

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.040
of that fundamental core.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.600
Now, within you,
what's interesting

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.840
is that you run your a cycle
within these organelles

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.050
known as mitochondria.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:50.260
What's interesting is that the
mitochondria is essentially

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.420
this long ghost of an
ancient bacterial symbiosis.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.690
Ultimately your mitochondria
were at one time

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.570
free-living bacteria.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.150
Tight living associations
between bacteria

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.850
probably provide
beneficial associations,

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.740
so much so that the
fact that now, you're

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.750
organelles within your
cells appear ultimately

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.910
to be traced back to these
early symbiotic relationships

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.680
between bacteria.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.850
What's interesting, if
we look at the genes that

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.600
are ultimately underlying not
only the production of energy

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.250
within the mitochondria
but ultimately

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:33.010
the TCA cycle, this one
associated with ultimately

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.750
harnessing this energy gradient,
this gene cytochrome oxidase

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:40.080
is another ubiquitous
gene across biology.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.580
Very little genetic
variability in general.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.190
And we find this
gene that ultimately

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:49.370
is responsible for generating
energy ultimately associated

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:53.000
with TCA cycle being
present throughout most

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.920
if not all of life.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.020
So ubiquitous
across all of life.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.940
It's fundamental to
organismal metabolism.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.060
There's even indication that
the TCA cycle itself may

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.707
have evolved multiple times.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.260
So ultimately, we're talking
about core metabolism

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.830
producing, storing
energy to fuel everything

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.016
that an organism does.

00:43:23.171 --> 00:43:23.670
OK.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.770
So what's the second
component of life?

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.130
What we see repeatedly
across the evolution of life

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:34.310
is very strong
selection to get big.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.230
Multicellularity has evolved
multiple times independently.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.310
So going from
unicellular organisms

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.700
to multicellular
organisms again and again

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.910
appears to offer a
selective advantage.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.480
So today, the organisms that
we share our planet with

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.920
are actually the largest that
have ever lived on Earth.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.800
And you may say, well,
gosh, the dinosaurs

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.520
are pretty big, right?

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:04.180
Well, they're easily dwarfed
by this guy, the blue whale.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.340
But the blue whale is actually
dwarfed by the General Sherman

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.250
tree, an order of
magnitude larger.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.270
So why is larger better?

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.760
Throughout time, we
see this increase

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.930
in the size of an organism.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.600
So if you get big,
you can overcome

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.280
various physical
forces like viscosity.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.550
If you're very small
and you're in the water,

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.070
that can provide a really
hard situation for you

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.276
in terms of how you go about
your day to day business.

00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:39.400
So if you get bigger, you
can overcome these forces

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.810
like viscosity.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.500
But also if you're
bigger, you can

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.450
dominate and kind of
maintain larger territories

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.810
and control more
and more resources.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.740
If you're also bigger, you
can avoid the competition

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.210
of smaller individuals.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:00.100
If ' use resources that are
differently available to you,

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:06.720
being larger often offers
quite a few opportunities.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.170
If you're bigger, you can
usually do more tasks.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:13.600
Larger things tend to have
more different cell types,

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.220
larger things tend to respond
to the environment differently.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.140
You can also process more and
different types of information.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.310
But also, if you're
bigger, you live longer.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.220
And because of which, you often
then have access to resources

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.620
that smaller things don't have.

00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:33.900
It's probably not a big
surprise that the biggest

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.040
city that's ever been on earth
is actually alive and well

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.540
today.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.320
This is Tokyo, 37.6 million.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.100
And just for chuckles
and grins here,

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.950
what's the biggest corporation?

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.420
Actually, I had no idea
what the Sinopec group was,

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:57.470
but it makes $486
billion per year.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.500
It's the national
petroleum company

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.130
of China, which I
guess makes sense.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.930
They're making a
bunch of stuff which

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:09.420
then leads to the second
largest company on Earth, which

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.790
sells the stuff.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:18.670
$476 billion per
year, bigger, better,

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.435
can dominate, control
more resources.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:30.690
So another aspect of general
items that we see across life,

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.980
fractals.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.120
Fractals are
interesting because they

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.380
seem to be underlying a lot
of themes within biology.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.500
But unlike the genetic
code, which to our knowledge

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.190
has only evolved once, we see
a lot of fractal structures

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:52.750
that have mathematically
very similar properties

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.550
for many different
functions that

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.930
have evolved multiple
times that are effectively

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.730
identical to each other.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.870
So you're a great example.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.450
If I boiled away your skin
and looked in your body,

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.639
you'd look like this.

00:47:06.639 --> 00:47:07.555
You're a sitting tree.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.710
Leaf veins.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.860
Leaves are nice and green,
but if you take away

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.330
that outer skin,
they're beautiful,

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.830
and this is what
you're left with.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.100
Your lungs.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.890
This could be a root
system, it could

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:29.540
be a branching architecture
of a tropical tree.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:34.170
Within your brain,
information networks,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.130
these transport
electrical signals for

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.470
not only your motor control
but also your learning

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.876
and your sensory perception.

00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:42.250
What's interesting
is that we can

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.390
describe all of these
different networks

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:47.330
and find that they have very
similar mathematical signals

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:50.405
associated with them.

00:47:50.405 --> 00:47:51.970
Here's an aquatic example.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.320
This is a modern filter feeder.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.960
This a gorgonian in a coral
reef, And this is a fun one.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.530
So let's go back to
the Burgess Shale.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:06.830
So they think that this
organism, it's a fossil,

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.890
was some sort of an alga,
some algae of some sort.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.710
It's now extinct.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.540
But what's very interesting
is that if we analyze

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.724
the branching structure
of these organisms,

00:48:20.724 --> 00:48:22.390
you'd be hard pressed
to tell this apart

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:26.470
from a lung or a tree,
oak tree, that you'd

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.660
find growing in your yard.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.490
So why these treelike networks?

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.100
So one of the projects
that I decided

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.570
to focus on when I
was in graduate school

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.820
was essentially
asking this question.

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:45.540
Why is it that we tend to see
these branching morphologies

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.300
throughout most of biology?

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.350
It doesn't matter if
you're a plant or an animal

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.310
or even within a
cell, we tend to see

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.020
these sorts of structures.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.550
So here's the argument.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.320
So evolution by
natural selection

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:04.100
actually favors this sort of
network, because it's optimal.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.680
And we would expect to see these
networks anytime in biology

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.170
where resources are limiting and
where competition or limiting

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.990
resources is keen.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.510
Because these networks, they
tend to be space filling,

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.100
they fill some sort of space.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.930
But what's also interesting
is that-- here's

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.800
a little bit of lingo-- they
tend to be area preserving.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.330
And these are just fancy ways of
saying that, by space filling,

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.040
these networks maximize
resource exchange surfaces.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.790
Organisms are exchanging
resources from the environment

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.820
into their body, and
they're transporting

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.990
within their body
or their cells,

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.400
ultimately to fuel metabolism.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:51.080
These networks are also
designed so that they

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.590
minimize transport costs.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.980
So you can boil this down.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.100
These networks give you the
biggest bang for the buck.

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.200
You can take in a bunch of
resources or information,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.540
transport them within
the body to fuel

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.780
all of your central nervous
system or your metabolism

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.888
at a minimum cost.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.590
So the result then are networks
that maximize energy throughput

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:15.614
at a minimum cost.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.730
We're in the homestretch here.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.970
Last part.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:29.410
Life is characterized by
a set of scaling laws.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.420
And as a result, and this
is really interesting,

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.720
the rate of aging is
actually scaled in a way

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.890
so that all of life
actually fluxes

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:43.530
about the same amount
of energy per unit mass

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.790
across all living things.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:46.900
And they say, my goodness.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.720
That sounds really
quite remarkable.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.960
But I would like you to
consider for a moment

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.050
these wonderful and
amazing organisms.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.770
They do very different things.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.420
They feed on
different resources.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.232
Some of them live a short
time, others live a long time.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.565
So what I'm to do is only
take all those organisms,

00:51:09.565 --> 00:51:13.330
and I'm going to
put them on a graph.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:16.390
So at the bottom, I have
their body size or their mass.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.870
You pick them up, you weigh
them, you put them on a scale.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.390
On the y-axis, I'm going to plot
a measure of how fast they're

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.380
producing biomass, how
fast they're growing.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.590
So remember that growth
is fueled ultimately

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.947
by the TCA cycle.

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:42.930
So let's look at insects,
birds, fish, plants,

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:50.080
unicellular all the way up to
multicellular plants, mammals,

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.680
protists, zooplankton.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.840
And what was really interesting
is that recently, we

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.850
were wondering if we could
put long-extinct organisms

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.860
on this plot.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.770
And what's really interesting,
in the bones of dinosaurs,

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.330
if you cut open their
bones and their fossils

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.230
and you look then
at the bones, what

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:18.684
you'll actually find with things
that look like tree rings.

00:52:18.684 --> 00:52:20.350
So just like a tree
when you cut it down

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:23.290
it has growth rings, a
lot of different organisms

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:25.040
than that leave behind
bone, you can also

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.123
measure their growth rate.

00:52:26.123 --> 00:52:31.060
If some basics of how
to convert that to mass,

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:36.400
we have estimates of where
the dinosaurs would be,

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.375
things long extinct.

00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:41.240
So this is interesting.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.550
All organisms are
described, apparently,

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:48.410
by an approximate
general scaling function.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:53.587
As you go across scales of
size, we know how they grow.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.520
What's interesting
is that plot says

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.300
that the total amount of energy
a very small organism or a very

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:11.930
big organism uses per unit
mass for their entire lifespan

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.000
is approximately the same.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.154
It's actually 8 times 10 to the
fifth kilojoules per kilogram.

00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:23.320
So this is like the Hitchhikers
Guide to the Galaxy.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.040
Why that number?

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.550
I have no idea, but it exists.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:38.210
Within a mouse, the TCA cycle
is spinning very rapidly.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.420
Within an elephant,
it spins very slowly.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:48.050
An interesting outcome
of that, if you calculate

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.340
the total number of
heartbeats in a mammal,

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:55.020
you can do this for birds too or
anything with a heart-- plants

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.150
don't have hearts,
there are actually

00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:00.342
very similar numbers for them
but for different quantities.

00:54:00.342 --> 00:54:02.050
If you actually plot
out the total number

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.920
of heartbeats across
all the mammals,

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.010
there's some variability.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:11.090
But it's about 7.3 plus or minus
5.6 times 10 to the eighth,

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.610
about a billion.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.160
Now, I'm sure some of you,
quantitatively astute,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.810
have probably
calculated your number

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:20.361
and found that you
well exceed a billion.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:28.136
That's all right, there is
some slop in these numbers.

00:54:28.136 --> 00:54:29.510
I'm sure you're
going to be fine.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:36.850
But this is what's interesting.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.940
Why is it about a billion?

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.500
Why isn't it 100?

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.260
Why isn't it a million?

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.320
Why isn't it a trillion?

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.290
Why that number?

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:48.527
Well, probably, it ultimately
has to do with the fact

00:54:48.527 --> 00:54:50.610
that-- you can just think
of any car that you buy.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:55.910
At some point, it's going
to wear out, entropy.

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:58.390
But what's interesting
is that we don't really

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.630
have a really good
biological understanding

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:01.890
for why these numbers.

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.603
Last thing that I'm going
to end on, ecosystems.

00:55:10.782 --> 00:55:12.240
So if you think
about an ecosystem,

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.840
you can have a trophic
network, that is who eats who.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.310
So you can have plants,
herbivores eat the plants,

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.610
larger carnivores
eat the herbivores,

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:26.400
you have secondary carnivores,
tertiary carnivores,

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.590
carnivores eating carnivores.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.760
It gets really messy.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:36.250
Now, if you think about an
ecosystem, that dissipation

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:40.130
of energy, either from
the deep sea vents

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:42.540
or from photosynthesis
from the sun,

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.420
is dissipated then
through the biosphere

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.890
through these trophic
interactions of who eats who.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:52.620
But remember, that energy is
all being paced and scaled

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.400
ultimately by what's happening
not only in your mitochondria

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.780
but also down to the core
metabolism of the TCA cycle.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.137
So we can talk about
ecosystem-scale metabolism.

00:56:04.137 --> 00:56:06.220
We can talk about the
metabolism of the biosphere.

00:56:09.887 --> 00:56:11.470
So what I'm showing
you here actually,

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.340
this is some work led in
part by Neil Martinez.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.950
Neil is one of my
colleagues here

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.854
at the University of Arizona.

00:56:18.854 --> 00:56:20.520
And Neil and his
colleagues went through

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.880
and they did a fantastic study.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.880
So they looked at these
networks of interactions.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.380
So you can kind of think of this
as any other kind of network

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.650
of interactions, like on
Facebook or the internet,

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.500
kind of like who's
connected to who.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.000
But here, what we're
doing is, we're

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.190
looking at a trophic network in
terms of having the plants here

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:44.350
at the bottom, then the
herbivores, who eats who

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.300
in terms of which herbivores
are on which plants but also

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.985
the top carnivores here in
terms of who are they eating.

00:56:51.985 --> 00:56:53.610
So what's actually
very interesting is,

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.690
I'm showing you two of these
different trophic networks

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.600
or food webs.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.400
One of them is from
the Burgess Shale.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.070
The other is from a lake,
probably in Wisconsin.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:14.250
Now, what's interesting
is that statistically,

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.870
you can analyze than the
degree of connectedness

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.260
then of this network.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:23.420
And in general, you can't tell
them apart from each other.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.600
Their network of
interactions are organized

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.679
in a very similar way.

00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:30.720
So when we look at these
networks of interactions

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.880
remember, we're seeing the
dissipation of metabolic energy

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.170
throughout the ecosystem.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:41.040
And those interactions
are organized in a way

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.550
so that metabolism
is then passed

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.231
through all the
way from herbivores

00:57:45.231 --> 00:57:46.105
up to the carnivores.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.970
So what I'm showing
you here is one view

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.540
of the metabolism of the earth.

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.720
This is carbon
assimilation, how much

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:08.010
carbon is coming into
the terrestrial biosphere

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.270
via photosynthesis.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:14.560
And this movie is looping
through at a monthly timestep,

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.836
every month.

00:58:15.836 --> 00:58:17.460
And so if you watch
it, what you'll see

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.310
is you'll see seasonalities
during the year.

00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:24.200
So the Northern Hemisphere
will green up in the summer,

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.860
but when winter comes,
it'll brown down.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.710
You'll also see within the
tropics and South America

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:32.020
and Australia and Asia.

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.820
You'll see, even
within the tropics,

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.970
the pulsing of
terrestrial metabolism

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.545
to flux throughout the year.

00:58:41.072 --> 00:58:42.030
And you can watch this.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:44.330
This goes out actually, for
many, many different years.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:48.540
But this is variation
in ecosystem metabolism.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.890
Now, if you're interested,
we can talk about this later,

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.500
but I don't have the time.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.880
But I will tell you
that you can take

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.880
what we know of
core metabolism, you

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:05.250
can take our knowledge of
how fast the TCA cycle spins,

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.600
you can take the different
sizes of organisms

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:13.040
that we know exist to actually
predict the metabolism

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.400
at the scale of an ecosystem.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.640
And we can trace that
metabolism all the way down

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.910
to the core
metabolism ultimately

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.960
down to the TCA cycle.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.720
So the Earth is literally
a metabolizing entity,

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.160
ultimately fueled by a
set of core reactions

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.190
that are ubiquitous
across all of life.

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:38.910
And that dissipation of
energy, both within organisms

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:42.300
and across ecosystems,
appears to also

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.240
be governed by general rules
with how natural selection has

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.030
maximized not only
distribution networks,

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:52.120
but also control the
interactions of who eats who

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.770
and how energy is dissipated.

00:59:55.770 --> 01:00:00.140
So to summarize,
general aspects of life.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.760
Life does work.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.880
Metabolism maintains
homeostasis.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.350
So right now, your body
is working very hard

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.610
to maintain your core
temperature around a very

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.850
small degree of fluctuation.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:17.450
Any deviation from
that is deadly.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.610
You spend a lot of
energy trying to maintain

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:22.870
your core metabolism temperature
at a very constant level,

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.650
homeostasis.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.280
Life in general evolves,
becoming increasingly larger

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.440
and larger and larger.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.621
This doesn't mean that
small organisms disappear.

01:00:31.621 --> 01:00:33.870
There's plenty of different
places for small organisms

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:34.690
to live.

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:39.880
But larger organisms
effectively by becoming larger,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.250
they avoid the competition
from smaller ones

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.045
but can exploit and dominate
more and more resources.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.377
Life uses fractal networks.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.430
They appear to
optimize transport

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.060
in terms of time and flow.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.390
Again, natural selection appears
to be doing the optimization.

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:06.320
Life itself is scaled
by core metabolism.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.683
This has remained constant
across all scales.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:15.680
But life's interactions in terms
of the struggle for resources

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.740
to fuel metabolism is
ultimately scaled and paced

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.900
by the core rate of
metabolic reactions.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.490
So in general, the
diversity of life

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.586
is shaped by this flow
and dissipation of energy.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.080
So I started with this
dichotomy within biology

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.930
that we have both a
deterministic and also

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:44.340
a chance view on life.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.200
So determinism, there are
regular deterministic processes

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.750
that shape the diversity of
life, the laws of chemistry,

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:55.030
physics, combined with
evolution by natural selection

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:59.060
appears to be very general in
terms of many different aspects

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.760
of life.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.870
Again, these rules appear
to ultimately determine

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.720
not only the pace of life
but also the functioning

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.180
of Earth's ecosystems.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.460
But we also know that there
is a big component of chance

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.680
as well.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.700
Random mutations are a key
component of evolution.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.235
Extinction at many levels
happened constantly.

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.370
Because of these
extinction events,

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.900
ecosystems undergo
rearrangements.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.920
So let's try to
put this together.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:44.470
Well, life in general is both
by chance and deterministic.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:48.230
Even though the players
of the game have changed,

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:51.290
it looks as if there are
some general rules that

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:54.090
have remained the same.

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:58.440
And I've showed you five
general aspects of life

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.520
on Earth which are
tantalizing and suggest

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.270
that if we did find
life elsewhere,

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:07.850
and if resources are limiting,
so there is competition

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.520
for limiting space,
resources, or mates,

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.260
we may expect to see these
aspects of life repeated there.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.540
And so this is
interesting to ponder

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.340
once we do start looking for
life in the next several talks,

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.312
what that life may look like.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:30.040
So I would like to
thank many folks who

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.320
have inspired not only this
research but also this talk,

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.500
in particular Eric Smith and
Geoffrey West at the Santa Fe

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:43.110
Institute, but also
my lab group, Joaquin,

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:46.470
and many folks that underlie
the production staff here

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.490
at the science series.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.740
But with that, I want to
say thank you for your time.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.240
It's been a pleasure.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.090
Thank you.
