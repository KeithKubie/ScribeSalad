DAN ROAM: Thank you.

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:03.850
[? Stephane's ?] right.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.490
So this is exciting for me,
because this is actually

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.570
the third time I've had
a chance to come and do

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.830
an Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.580
So I want to thank all
of you for inviting

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.006
me back a third time.

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.630
Today, what I want
to talk to you about

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.064
is a new book that I wrote.

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.730
It just came out a
couple of months ago.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.444
And it's very exciting,
because I just

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:22.110
got a note from Amazon the other
day that said that they've just

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.890
voted this as one of
the top 20 business

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.980
books of the year,
which is very exciting.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.480
The book is called
"Show and Tell."

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.980
Yes?

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.510
Isn't that awesome?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030
The book is called
"Show and Tell--

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.080
How Everybody Can Make
Extraordinary Presentations."

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.130
And this is a very
meta kind of a talk,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.630
because you're going
to see that I'm

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.900
making a presentation
about making presentations.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.230
And so I just thought
the best way to start

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.490
is to give you a story
about presentations,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.810
or a story about
public speaking.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.210
And in this story, we're
going to have four characters.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.170
So the first character
is this guy right here.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.070
You they recognize his face.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.000
Not many people do.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.810
But you might
recognize his name.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.819
This is Michael Bay.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.640
Now, Michael Bay, of course, is
Hollywood's loudest director.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090
This is the guy who created
all the "Transformers" movies

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.010
and "Pearl Harbor"
and is generally

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.610
acknowledged as the best
director of explosions ever.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.210
So Michael Bay-- here we
have this super-experienced

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.090
entertainment professional.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.750
And the story I wanted to share
about him was, late last year,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.500
he was supposed to give a
presentation at the Consumer

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.430
Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.600
He was supposed to
go on stage and give

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.210
to talk about a Samsung product.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.700
And I don't know how many
of you may have seen this,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.930
but it is disaster.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.630
It's horrible to
watch what happens.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.670
Michael Bay goes on stage,
and within about 15 seconds,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.150
the teleprompter breaks,
and he can't continue.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.040
He just totally freaks out on
stage, panics, stumbles around,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.820
and it's horrible.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.880
It's just cringe-inducing
to watch this on YouTube.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.270
And finally, he says, I'm
story, and leaves the stage

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.790
after about 20 seconds.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.640
It's terrible.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.750
So that's Michael Bay.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.070
So character number two in our
story about public speaking

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.490
is this guy, John Travolta,
clearly also a very experienced

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.050
entertainment professional.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.670
Did anybody watch the
Academy Awards last year?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.740
So John Travolta is supposed to
introduce Idina Menzel, who's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.910
going to go up and
sing to "Let It Go."

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.850
And John Travolta
of all people, who's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.170
had a life in
entertaining, gets on stage

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.970
and totally mumbles
the name, forgets

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.470
what he's supposed
to say, and says,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.210
and now I'm going to introduce
the amazing megastar, Adele

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.090
Dazeem.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.370
Who the hell is Adele Dazeem?

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.260
This person doesn't exist.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.280
OK, and character number
three is the real Adele,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.970
who we all know.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.630
So real Adele, incredible
entertainer, of course,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.601
won six Grammy awards
a year and a half ago.

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:50.600
But here's the question.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.330
Has anybody heard
anything from Adele

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.780
in the last year and a half?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.420
The most amazing breakout
artist of two years ago is gone.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.606
Where is Adele?

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.605
Well, she has gone on
record-- it's interesting,

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:04.188
because there's different rumors
she's working on a new album.

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:04.920
No, she's not.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.780
It's all denied by her agents.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.710
Adele has decided to take
a five-year hiatus off

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.960
of performing because she said
that the act of going on stage

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.130
is too stressful for her.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.441
Performing is too stressful.

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:20.940
Wow.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.979
This is interesting.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.770
And now here's a fourth
guy, doesn't really

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.310
belong with the rest of these.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.931
Anyone know who this is?

00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:30.040
This is Warren Buffett,
probably best known

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.870
as the second
wealthiest man on Earth.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.870
And Warren, interesting, not
an entertainment professional,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.980
not a great entertainer
by any stretch.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.182
But Warren is different from
the rest of these people,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.640
because Warren
Buffett, when he was

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.070
a kid-- this is in his
biography-- decided

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.690
early on that he wanted
to be a business guy.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.750
And he realized that, in order
to be successful in business,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.040
he was going to have to
get over his greatest fear.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.810
And his greatest fear
was public speaking.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.620
He was terrorized.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.470
He hated doing it.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.880
But Warren knew that if he
was going to be successful,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.420
he was going to have to be
able to figure out a way

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.050
to communicate his
ideas to other people.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.410
So he approached public
speaking as a science.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.660
And he said, how do I go
about doing this well?

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.540
How do I get over my
worries and my anxieties?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.630
Took a lot of training,
did a lot of practice.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.290
And here's the thing
that he understood

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.770
that the others do not.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.930
All these entertainment
professionals

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.820
can't handle it when
they get on stage live.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.420
And here we have
Mr. Business Geek,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.910
who's the only one
who can, because he

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.320
understood something.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.520
Presenting is as much
science as it is art.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.300
And above all, it
takes practice.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.190
These other folks all mess up
because they say, oh, I'm cool.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.070
I'm charismatic.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.930
I'll just go up on
stage and I'll wing it.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.566
That is a guarantee for failure
when we're going to present.

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:52.690
So let's talk a little bit.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.090
Why does this matter to us?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.440
Because I know,
I know, at Google

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.600
that it is important for you,
even though your day job may

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.370
involve code or design or
technology or security.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.950
I also know that it is
expected at some point

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.070
that each one of you is going to
have to explain to other people

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.040
what you do.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.670
We all have to get up
on stage at some point.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.750
In fact, I have become
convinced that there

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.200
is nothing that is more
important for our professional

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.070
success-- and in many cases, our
personal success-- than being

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.240
able to get up in front of other
people and share our ideas.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.510
But here are-- OK, Google
folks-- here are the data.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.300
In the most recent study,
74% percent of Americans

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.090
would rather die
than give a speech.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.840
Wow.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.750
That's kind of bad.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.800
That's a global epidemic.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.590
3/4 of all people
would rather die.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.520
We're less afraid of dying than
we are of getting up on stage.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.510
So I want to let you
in on a little secret.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.860
It's actually fun to
present if we follow

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.700
a couple of very,
very simple rules.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.240
The fear is real.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.110
We'll talk about it a
little bit later on.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.880
It's real, but it's
there for a good reason.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.420
The fear becomes
a problem when it

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.330
gets so big that it
gets too crazy for us.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.872
But all the fear is
there to tell us,

00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:17.496
you're going to do
something stressful.

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:18.300
You got to perform.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.210
If what we can do is
take that fear and say,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.660
hey, fear, I've seen you before.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.380
I know where you're coming from.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.600
I know your job to me is just to
make sure that I do a good job.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.730
We let the fear come in
and go right back out,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.530
and we use the energy
of it passing through

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.180
to help us do a good job.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.860
And so what I want
to share with you

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.040
is that when we give
a presentation-- it

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.960
could be anything.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.570
It could be something that we're
just sharing with our team,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.000
or it could be a big
formal presentation

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.090
with a cast of thousands.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.260
It doesn't matter.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.220
The basic idea is
always the same.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.870
And it's kind of like
we are going on a trip.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.340
And here we are.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.480
This is us down here.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.060
And here is our idea,
the thing that we

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.380
want to share in
our presentation.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.780
And usually what happens
is we take that thing

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.910
and we show it to people.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.670
We say, this is my thing, this
is my idea, and here it is.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.260
And usually what happens is it's
not a very exciting engagement.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.390
It usually lies kind
of flat like this.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.442
And there we are sort
of showing our thing,

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:19.900
and some people
are falling asleep,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.691
and some people are
checking their Android,

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.420
and some people are
totally checked out.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.550
Well, you know what?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.870
I don't think we
should do that anymore.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.840
In fact, I think if there's
ever an opportunity for us

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.000
to give a presentation
about anything that

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.660
has the likelihood of just lying
flat, we shouldn't give it.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.785
We should forget all about.

00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:39.750
Because, from now on, I think
it's really critical that we

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.920
make every presentation
we give, no matter

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.600
how low-key or
seemingly unimportant--

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.110
we want to bend that lineup and
make every single presentation

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.840
we give extraordinary.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.600
If it's not, why are
we giving it at all?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.234
And what's the difference
between that flat line

00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:57.400
and that extraordinary line?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.990
It's a very, very simple thing.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.580
What is the difference
between this and this?

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.300
A presentation it is
extraordinary-- it's

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.850
very simple.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.590
It's one that changes people.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.160
And the change doesn't
need to be enormous.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.220
It could be a very small change.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.820
Or it could be
really, really huge.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.460
But what we want
to understand is

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.450
that a presentation's
amazing, both for the audience

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.260
and for us presenting it, when,
at some point during that 20

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.820
minutes, 40 minutes, two
hours, whatever it is,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.362
somebody has a little
bit of a change.

00:08:32.362 --> 00:08:33.820
And that's what we
want to aim for.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.760
And in order to make that
happen, it's really simple.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.450
There are only three rules.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.820
Three really basic
rules for making

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.320
an extraordinary presentation.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.970
And here they are.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.950
Rule number one, tell the truth.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.460
Wow.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.370
If we lead it with
the truth, the hearts

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.520
of the people we're
talking with will follow.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.290
Rule number two, tell
that truth with a story.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.410
If we lead with a story,
understanding will follow.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.800
And rule number three, tell
that story with pictures.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.740
Because if we lead with the
eye, the mind will follow.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.470
Tell the truth, tell
it with a story,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.110
and tell that story
with pictures.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.480
And if we do that,
every presentation

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.001
is going to be pretty amazing.

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.750
We're going to go
through all three rules.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.970
And I want to start weirdly
with rule number three.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.830
I want to start with
the rule that says

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.880
we tell our story with
pictures, because I want

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.930
to share with you
initially some pictures.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.221
And we are actually going
to take a little test.

00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.220
It's a very simple test.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.480
I don't anyone to stress out.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.484
There's no passing or
failing in this test.

00:09:48.484 --> 00:09:49.900
All that's going
to happen is I am

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.527
going to show you
30 random images.

00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:55.360
And I know they're
random, because all I did

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.710
was go on Google Images
and download the first 30

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.560
images that I saw.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.280
They're just 30 random images.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.530
I'm going to show them to you.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.000
We're going to look at them.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.910
The thing is, I
don't want you to try

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.780
to memorize them or maybe
write down what they are.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.860
You won't have time.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.932
I just want you to look
at them, because we're

00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:12.140
going to go through each one.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.730
I'm going to give you about
a quarter of a second.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.313
We're just going to
go through really,

00:10:15.313 --> 00:10:17.140
really fast looking
at these images.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.490
So is everybody ready to
look at some pictures?

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:20.990
All right.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.740
Up at the screen, we take
a breath, and here we go.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.530
OK.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.220
Can anybody tell us all 30
of those pictures in order?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.930
What did we just look at?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.900
Of course we can't.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.860
All right, so I want to
forget about that for moment.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860
Remember there were three rules.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.040
I want to go to rule number one.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.170
Let's talk about rule number
one for a little well.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.370
Let's talk about this
idea of telling the truth.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.470
And my intention here is not
to go all Boy Scout on you

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.550
and say, oh, it's all
about telling the truth.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.290
Here's the truth.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.040
A presentation looks like it's
about information sharing.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.000
That's what we think a
presentation is about,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.790
and that is partially true.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.720
But in order for
information to be shared,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.950
something else has
to happen first.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.660
What a presentation is
really about is about trust.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.590
It is about me trying
to get you to trust me,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.640
and me trying to get me
to be trustworthy to do,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.130
and me trusting you back.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.850
The real idea is this.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.200
In order for there to be
any information exchange--

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.420
if you don't trust me, if you
think I'm not very trustworthy,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.490
nothing good is going to happen.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.280
Here's kind of an interesting
part about this truth aspect.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.040
There is no faster
way to establish

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.960
trust between ourselves than
for me to tell you the truth.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.940
We all have a kind
of a sixth sense.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.580
We know when someone
is BS-ing us.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.760
So the converse of this rule
is also true, that says this.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.910
There is no faster way to lose
our audience than to BS them.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.280
We can do it for a little while.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.630
But after a little bit
longer, people start to say,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.620
I don't think this
is really right.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.070
Now, OK, that's all fine.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.710
Tell the truth.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.880
But the tricky thing is
there is more than one truth.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.540
There are three truths.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.290
They all exist all the time.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.200
One of those truths is
the truth of the data.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.422
This is what the facts tell us.

00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:54.130
These are the things
that we can measure.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.588
These are the pieces
of information

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:56.680
that we can collect.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.710
These are the facts, and
there is truth in them.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.400
They are true.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.240
There's a second truth,
though, isn't there?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.970
Which is the truth of, what do I
think about all of those facts?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.110
The truth that's in my head.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.470
And then there's a
third truth, which

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.130
is the truth that's in my heart.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:19.234
What do I really believe
about all of these things?

00:13:19.234 --> 00:13:20.650
And what's
interesting, of course,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.660
is that very often these three
truths are not in alignment.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.270
They are not the same.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.970
I know we all have something
that we believe we know it

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.890
in our heart to be true that the
data do not support or perhaps

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.630
for which there are no data.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.760
What's interesting
about this, though,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.730
is that these truths are
all true all of the time.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.810
They all exist all of the time.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.590
And I wanted to give you
a little example right

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.990
here about these truths.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.860
So what do we have here?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.030
I have a glass of water.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.307
Now, I can give you some facts
about this glass of water.

00:13:59.307 --> 00:14:01.140
And thank you,
[? Stephane ?], for providing

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.570
this excellent prop.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:09.870
I can tell you that there are
about 4 cubic inches of H2O

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.070
in this glass,
and I can tell you

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.950
that there are 4 cubic
inches of oxygen and hydrogen

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.090
in this glass.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.710
And those are the facts.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.480
That's great data.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.390
I can also say, what
do I think about that?

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.800
Well, I know that metaphorically
a half-full, full-half empty

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.350
glass is a sign of something.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.560
I know that many people think
that a half-full glass is

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.090
a sign of optimism,
but half-empty glass

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.480
is a sign of pessimism.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.950
So those are the things I
think about, those numbers.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.800
And then there's what I believe.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.630
I believe that this
glass is half full,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.590
and nothing anybody ever says
to me is going to change that.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.950
Those three truths are all
real and they all exist.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.650
And guess what's interesting
about those three truths,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.130
is it they are not
always the same.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.860
The way we perceive those
truths is very, very different.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.700
I like to represent it as
this kind of a pyramid.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.900
We have endless amounts
of factual truths.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.760
I mean, you're Google,
for goodness' sake.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.580
You collect more data
truths than anybody.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.550
We have more facts.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.970
The thing about
those data truths,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.020
though, those fact
truths, is that they're

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.500
very easy to change.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.060
All that needs to happen is I
need to get a new data point.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.027
Today this might be a
fact, and tomorrow that

00:15:29.027 --> 00:15:29.860
might be a new fact.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.526
And that's fine.

00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:36.020
It's very easy to change
the truth of fact.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.337
The next truth that
sits on top of that

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.670
that's a little bit harder
to change-- it's not the data

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.240
itself, but what do
I think about it?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.200
What do I actually think
is the way the world is?

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.210
Very difficult to change.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.990
I mean, if I think
things or something,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.070
it's going to take me a long
time to change the way I think.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.650
But the one that sits on the
top, the most difficult one

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.830
of all to change, is the truth
of the heart-- the truths,

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.880
the things that I believe.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.800
I don't care about
the damn data.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.370
I know this to be true.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:11.800
To change someone's beliefs
is extraordinarily difficult.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.870
But that is the truth
that really lasts.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.730
That is the change
that really matters.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.310
Point here, when we want to
change someone-- ourselves

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.770
and our audience through
giving a presentation--

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.120
we want to keep in mind
that we've got these three

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.190
things that we're going
to be working through.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.840
How do we present these in a way
that makes sense to someone so

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.194
that the level of
change takes place?

00:16:37.194 --> 00:16:39.110
Well, that brings us to
rule number two, which

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.995
was telling a story.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.860
Why do we tell stories?

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.470
Stories are the
expression of something

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.740
we're going to call a storyline.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.170
Why are stories important?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.570
Well, because everything in
the world is complicated.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.680
Life is complicated.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.730
Problems are complicated.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.364
The truth is very complicated.

00:17:01.364 --> 00:17:02.780
And when something
is complicated,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.690
when something is complex,
it's almost impossible for us

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.099
to figure out a
way to digest it.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:07.859
We don't want to.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.349
We just reject it.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.940
So what a storyline does is
it takes that complexity,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.069
and it forces it
into a line to make

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:24.240
that complexity tolerable
enough for us to touch into it

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.290
and try to experience
it long enough

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.410
to try to make some
sense out of it.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.720
That's what a story does.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.240
It takes that
complexity and forces it

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.820
into a line long enough for it
to began to make sense to us.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.550
That's all a story does.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.440
Which tells us that any
story, any presentation that's

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.460
based on a story,
any presentation

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.310
is going to be built
on a storyline.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.930
And that storyline
is always clear.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.350
There is a beginning,
there is an end,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.190
and there is
something that happens

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.330
in between the two of them.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.980
The storyline is not endless,
the storyline is not confusing,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.740
and the storyline is not random.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.790
Whenever we're going to present
anything-- it doesn't matter

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.510
whether it's a truth
of fact, it doesn't

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.720
matter if it's a
truth of the head,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.803
or it doesn't matter if
it's a truth of the heart.

00:18:13.803 --> 00:18:15.520
When we're going to
present anything,

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.600
we have to present it
in the form of a story,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.870
because that's the only
way understanding's

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.030
going to come out of it.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.680
Because stories do two things.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:33.090
Certainly, they move us along
from a beginning to an ending.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.220
They have to do that.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.820
Come with me as I tell you about
public speaking or something.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.880
But they have to do a
second thing as well.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.800
It's not enough, as we know,
for the store to just lie there.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.230
The story also has
to me move us up.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.360
It has to change what you know
or what we understand or one

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.890
of those truths.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.870
Otherwise, the story
has been ineffective.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.670
We talk about storylines.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.210
There are only four.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.330
There are only four
storylines in the world.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.140
Anytime give a
presentation, it is

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.540
going to be based on one
of these four storylines.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.290
There are no more.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.620
There are only these four.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.440
And what I want to
do is map them out.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.690
How many people in here have
a piece of paper and a pen,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.690
actually have a piece
of paper and a pen?

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.490
Because here's an
interesting aspect also

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.720
about making a presentation.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.120
On a side note,
I've already been

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.870
talking for about 15 minutes.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.600
And at this point, no
matter how charismatic I am,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.880
no matter how
compelling my story is,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.871
the human brain's going
to begin to check out.

00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:34.620
It doesn't matter.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.720
I could be singing and dancing.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.890
It's just going to happen.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.264
So one of the things that's
advisable at about this point

00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:41.820
in a presentation is give
the audience something to do.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.240
And give them something to
do that parallels what you're

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.900
presenting about is often
a really nice little magic

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.677
trick to re-engage
the brain again.

00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:50.510
So what we're going to
do is, rather than me

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.300
telling you there are four
storylines and here they are,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.026
we are going to
make them together.

00:19:56.026 --> 00:19:57.900
So the way that we're
going to do this is I'd

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.050
like you to take
your sheet of paper.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.830
I'm going to fake
it with this-- I'll

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.180
use a horizontal Post-it note.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.410
I want you to imagine that
this is your sheet of paper.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.860
And hold it
horizontally like this.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.795
And what I want you to
do is fold it in half.

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.770
Stephan, you're not
folding your paper.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.940
All right.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.380
Did everybody do that?

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.570
Anybody need any help?

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.484
OK, now what I want
you to do is we're

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:27.650
going to fold one more time.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:32.090
I want you to fold it down
into quarters like that.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.440
All right.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.470
And now comes the big reveal.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.400
I want you to open it up and
admire this lovely handiwork it

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.900
you've done.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.519
We've just created a perfect
four-quadrant little chart.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:46.060
And now we're going to draw,
for those of you who have a pen.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.101
The rest of you will have
to use your fingernail.

00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:49.310
We're going to draw.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.960
And what we're going to
draw, one in each quadrant,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.940
are the four storylines.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.440
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.500
is we're going to
write some words.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.374
So what I'd like you to
do in quadrant number

00:20:59.374 --> 00:21:04.630
one right here is I'd like
you to write "report."

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.150
In quadrant number
two, I'd like you

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.110
to write "explanation."
"Explanation."

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:16.120
In quadrant number three, I'd
like you to write "pitch."

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:22.210
And in quadrant number four,
I'd like you to write "drama."

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.680
These are the names
of the four storylines

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.490
that define everything.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.620
Let's look at what they
actually look like, though.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.930
Because we know every storyline,
again, it starts at a point,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.990
and it moves along and
takes us somewhere else.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.240
So the report looks like this.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.360
I'd like you to
draw a little dot.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:37.980
We start here.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.760
And then draw flat line, and
make it look a little bit

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.760
like an EEG, just little bursts
of information come along.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.920
But for the most part,
that report just lies flat.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.690
That's what a report does.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.820
I'm giving you some facts.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.330
Here's a fact.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.240
I'm giving you some more facts.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.740
Here's a fact.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.600
I'm giving you another fact.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.360
And then we're done.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:53.860
Thank you.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.600
Goodbye.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.640
All right.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.340
An explanation is a
little bit different.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.850
It starts down here.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.250
And I give you some information.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.380
And then we take a
step up together.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.580
And then we move along,
and we take another step.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.270
And we take another step,
and we take another step

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.295
until we're at the end.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.420
Now, what's different about
this than the report is

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.190
we can see that, rather than
just the line of facts, what

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.690
we're actually doing
is building something.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.450
Each fact or each idea
builds on the previous one,

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.500
so that by the time
we're done, we've

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.180
had a change from this
level of understanding up

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.470
to this new level
of understanding.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.960
We now have a new ability.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.260
We know something new.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.180
The pitch.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.200
We start here.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.060
And we've got a
bit of a problem.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.950
And that problem looks kind of
like a big old nasty mountain

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.470
or a hurdle in front of us.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.080
And so what we're going to do
is we are going to jump over.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080
We're going to throw
ourselves over that hurdle,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.220
and we're going to come
down on the other side.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.597
And what we will find is
that-- if we've done it well--

00:22:53.597 --> 00:22:55.430
we had to jump pretty
high, but we've still,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.890
even at the end after
we've come down,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.181
we're still at a higher
position than we were to start.

00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:00.700
That's a pitch.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.730
And the last one is the big one.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.910
This is called the drama,
where we start here,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.670
and everything is
just going along fine.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.960
And then all of a sudden,
the stuff hits the fan,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.350
and life starts to get bad,
and things get really bad.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.240
And then they get worse
and worse and worse

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.910
until we're down here
in this pit of despair.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.480
It's all over.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.970
But no, we find a
way to come back.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.360
We start to work
our way back up.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.490
We figure out how to do it.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.340
We save ourselves.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.100
And we come back
with so much power

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.060
that we actually burst
way past our starting line

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.870
with this entirely
new lesson that we've

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.280
learned because we
had to struggle.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.540
Every story, every presentation,
whatever we're going to give

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.020
is going to be based on one
of those four storylines.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.570
Now, how would we
pick which storyline

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.730
would be the best one for us
to use for our presentation?

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.650
Well, there they are again.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.610
We might want to think about,
are we delivering information?

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:59.110
If just information is enough,
then perhaps a report's enough.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.075
Do we want to deliver ability?

00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:02.950
Do we want to help people
have a new ability?

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.080
We will use the explanation.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.720
Do we want to help people
get across a hurdle,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.450
solve a problem in a new way?

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.080
Then we'd want to do a pitch.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.720
And do we want to have people
go through some suffering

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.616
so that on the other
side they can increase

00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:18.990
their level of
happiness with us?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.020
Then we're going to
want to give the drama.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.780
A little bit earlier, I said
any extraordinary presentation

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.540
changes people.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.690
Well, there are only four
ways that people change.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.250
We change our information.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.719
We know these things.

00:24:35.719 --> 00:24:38.010
Perhaps tomorrow, we're going
to know these new things.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.720
OK?

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.450
We've changed our information.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.380
We can change our knowledge.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.170
What do we know?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.760
We may think this today.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.610
And tomorrow, perhaps
we'll know some new thing.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.640
We've changed our knowledge.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.460
We may change our action.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.170
Perhaps today, we're
just standing still.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.920
And tomorrow, we will be
running very, very fast.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.670
So we can change our action.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.030
Or the big one, of course, again
is we can change our beliefs.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.060
Perhaps today, we
are cat people.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.440
And maybe tomorrow, we are
going to be dog people.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.490
Ooh, wouldn't that be a change?

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.570
Those are the only four
ways that people change.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.770
There's really not a
whole lot more than that.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.040
So here's the cool thing
about those four storylines.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.350
This is kind of the magic.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.730
If we know what kind of a change
we would like our audience

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.340
to experience through
our presentation,

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.270
we know which storyline to use.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.380
It's as simple as that.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.550
If we know what
kind of change we

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.210
would like to have take place
during the presentation,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.800
we know what storyline to use.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.630
Like this.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.310
If I simply want to
change your information,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:48.000
I want to give you new facts,
I'm going to give you a report.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.669
If I want to change or
knowledge and your ability--

00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:52.210
if you can do this
today, but we want

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.710
you to be able to
do that tomorrow--

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.550
I'm going to give
you an explanation.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.590
If I want you to
change your actions--

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.360
we are moving this
way today, but we

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.760
need to move that way-- I am
going to give you a pitch.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.240
If we are going to
change our beliefs--

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.130
we believe this
to be true, but I

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.990
want you to believe
that to be true--

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:19.530
the only way I can do that
is by giving you a drama.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.890
If I know which change I want
to have the audience experience,

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.770
I know which storyline
I want to pick.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.650
Today, I want to focus on
just one of these storylines.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.770
It's the drama, because
this is really the big one.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.310
This is the one-- because
this changes beliefs,

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.590
this is the one that
has the most power ever.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.510
And so I wanted to
spend time on this one.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.860
Yes, I'm guessing
that most of the time

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.180
when at Google, you need
to give a presentation.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.160
You will be needing
to give reports,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.600
because you have a bunch of
facts you need to deliver.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.000
I would encourage all of you
to never give a report again.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.870
I don't care what your
lead is asking for.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.290
Never give them a report.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.840
Nobody ever got a
raise, nobody ever

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.380
got a promotion for giving
a really great report.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.340
What you will want to do is use
one of the other storylines.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.919
And you will couch
the facts within that,

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:08.460
but that is the
storyline that people

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.668
are going to find compelling.

00:27:09.668 --> 00:27:12.950
So, in a way, I would like
to encourage you from now on,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.406
anytime you need to give
a report, to maybe start

00:27:16.406 --> 00:27:18.530
to think about some of the
elements that take place

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:23.380
in the storyline we're going
to explore now, the drama.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.940
If there was a patron
saint of presenters,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.020
it would be this
guy, Joseph Campbell.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.117
Now, I know many of you
know who Joseph Campbell is.

00:27:34.117 --> 00:27:36.700
Is there anybody in here who is
familiar with Joseph Campbell?

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.320
Has anybody heard
of Joseph Campbell?

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.290
So Joseph Campbell
was a historian.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.999
And he started working
in the late 1920s,

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:44.998
and he worked all the way
up through, I believe,

00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:45.680
the early 1980s.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.930
And what Joseph Campbell did
is he traveled the world.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.990
He was fascinated
by the great myths

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.472
of all of the great cultures
through all of history

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:54.180
around the world.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.400
And he did is he went out
and he traveled around.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.730
And he learned to speak
seven different languages.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.130
He traveled all over the world.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.050
And he would get to
know the great myths

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.300
from each one of the cultures.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.970
And what was really
fascinating is

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.750
he started to realize that there
were a lot of common threads

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.750
that existed between all
of these great myths in all

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.390
of these different
languages from all

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.654
of these different
cultures around the world.

00:28:15.654 --> 00:28:17.570
And one of the things
that Joseph Campbell did

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.370
is he wrote a book called "The
Hero with a Thousand Faces."

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.340
And what it was was
it's a big thick tome.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.890
It's his summary
of the commonality

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.890
that he found between all
of these great world myths.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.400
And one of pieces
that was in that book

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.570
is something that became
known as the hero's journey.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.830
And when Joseph Campbell
introduced this back

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.134
in the 1950s, it didn't
really go anywhere.

00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:39.550
Nobody but a few
academics thought

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.340
this was particularly
interesting.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.210
But since that time, for
reasons we will explore,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.710
this has become a really,
really common thread

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.930
for how do we come up
with an interesting story.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.620
This is Joseph
Campbell's own drawing.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.640
He drew a little circle to
describe the hero's journey.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.890
And he drew the circle
moving in this direction,

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.060
moving counterclockwise,
and it goes like this.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.710
We start at point X, at
which a hero, who's usually

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.150
just a common person, crosses
from the regular world, which

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.870
is above this line, into a
strange supernatural world,

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.450
which is everything
below the line.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.470
In that supernatural
strange world at point Y,

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.890
that hero encounters
fabulous forces.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.920
And the hero has to fight
an incredible battle

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.500
to vanquish the foe to destroy
those forces in that very

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.750
strange world.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.760
And then, having
learned the lessons

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.720
of having fought that battle,
the hero then, at point Z,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.620
comes back into
the regular world

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.060
but now a very changed person.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.150
Because of the heroic acts,
because of the battles

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.840
that that person had to fight
in the strange world, when they

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.150
come back to the
regular world, they now

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.860
have this extra
amazing knowledge

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.750
that allows that person to
share new insights with people

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.790
in the regular world.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.420
Now, that was the way
that he described it.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.290
I think there's a simpler way
that we all know the same idea.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.600
It says this.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.910
Whatever doesn't kill
us makes us stronger.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.394
This is really the
central message

00:30:08.394 --> 00:30:09.560
of the whole hero's journey.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.370
Now, the hero's journey has
become kind of something that's

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.920
entered into pop
psychology, and it's

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.460
getting kind of beaten
to death and all of that.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.950
But a lot of people
say, no, no, no, there's

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:18.940
no such thing as hero's journey.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.280
Well, let's check and see
if Joseph Campbell might

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.964
have been right.

00:30:21.964 --> 00:30:23.880
And the way I thought
that it would make sense

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.050
to check to see if
this story, this drama,

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.530
actually has power
for us is to look

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:35.110
at what's popular to look at--
the three most successful movie

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.370
franchises in history
around the world.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.870
If there's any way
to say, is there

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.270
something that resonates
for people in general

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.170
about this story?

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.910
Well, let's see if this story
carries through the three most

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:52.214
successful popular stories
pretty much of all time.

00:30:52.214 --> 00:30:53.880
So we're going to
look at three of them.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.760
One which takes place in the
past, a mythical past, which

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.640
will be of course "The
Lord of the Rings."

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.630
One of these stories takes
place in a mythical present,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.540
which is "Harry Potter."

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.330
And one of these stories
which takes place

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.570
in a mythical future,
which is "Star Wars."

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.000
And yes, I know.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.530
I know it begins by
saying, "A long time ago,"

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.280
but let's face it.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.488
I mean, it's interstellar
travel and it's spaceships.

00:31:15.488 --> 00:31:17.110
It's the future.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.200
So yes.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.040
So-- well, you bring
up an excellent point.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.120
Let's see if this plays out.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.680
So let's look at
these three stories

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.130
and see if they
all tell something

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.630
that looks like the same story
and some kind of a story that

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.620
might adhere to
this hero's journey.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.460
So all of these stories
involve the hero

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.180
who is always this
unassuming guy who

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.590
is cast into a new world
against his own desire.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.070
He just wants to continue
living this happy life,

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.620
but something gets
in front of them

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.180
and forces him to
go into a new world.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.830
And this story that this
hero is going to experience

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.590
is that he's going
to save the world.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.526
And in the case of
Frodo, he's going

00:31:58.526 --> 00:31:59.900
to start here in
the happy Shire,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.120
and then things are
going to get really bad,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.740
and then he's going to
pop out on the other side.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.860
In the case of Harry,
he's going to start out

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.500
in the regular world, and things
are going to get really bad.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.140
Then he's going to pop
out on the other side.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.350
And in the case of
Luke, he's going

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.530
to start out in this plain
planet that nobody cares,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.154
and things are going
to get really bad,

00:32:13.154 --> 00:32:15.071
and he's going to pop
out on the other side.

00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:15.570
Interesting.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.660
They're all telling
the same story,

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.020
and they're all telling it in
almost exactly the same way.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.330
But one of the
things that's also

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.871
interesting about
this hero's journey

00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:24.460
is that the hero is not alone.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.720
There are other characters that
are helping on this journey.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.940
And what's amazing is these
other characters always

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.710
play the same role.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:34.860
What do I mean?

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.990
There is always the
sidekick, the goofy character

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.820
who's there to enable the
hero in amazing ways, that's

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.550
a kind soul who stays with the
hero through thick and thin.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.020
So it's Sam with Frodo,
and it's Ron with Harry,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.430
and it's Han Solo with Luke.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.920
And then, as we're getting
near the end, they have a fight

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.790
and the sidekick leaves.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.970
But the sidekick
always comes back

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.470
at the very last moment,
at the last moment,

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.350
and is the one who
enables the hero

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.060
to finally win, who does the
amazing thing at the end;

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.120
whether it's Sam carrying Frodo
and throwing the ring in there,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.120
or whether it's Ron saving
Harry in the last battle,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.680
or whether it's Han Solo flying
in with the Millennium Falcon

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.790
at the last second when when
Luke's flying down the death

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.037
trench and blows up
the Darth Vader ship.

00:33:25.037 --> 00:33:26.120
So there's that character.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.328
But are there more parallels?

00:33:27.328 --> 00:33:30.290
Yes, because there always has
to be the mentor, who obviously

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.900
it pays to be someone
with a big beard.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.090
So in the case of "The
Lord of the Rings,"

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.540
we have Gandalf,
who comes along.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.510
And we've got Dumbledore
in "Harry Potter."

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.710
And we've got Obi
Wan in "Star Wars."

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.340
And it's interesting,
because remember

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.798
what happens in
the hero's journey.

00:33:45.798 --> 00:33:48.190
The hero is in a strange
world, a place where

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.060
they don't know what's going on.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.720
The job of the mentor is
to guide them and give them

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.960
rules of how the world
works in this strange place.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.324
So this ancient wizard who knows
the world provides these clues

00:34:00.324 --> 00:34:01.990
and provides information
for how to live

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:08.770
in this strange world and then
dies, leaving the hero alone;

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:14.400
but always, again, comes back
to the hero in spiritual form

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.949
at the last possible moment
just before the final climax

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.679
and gives them the
last bit of support

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.146
that they're going
to need to happen.

00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:25.020
And then there is the
princess, because we'll

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.409
notice that so far it's
just been a bunch of dudes.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:31.630
So there are the women
in this hero's journey?

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.530
Well, in the classic
hero's journey,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.620
as it is represented
by Joseph Campbell

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.810
and clearly by these
three most popular movie

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.510
franchises in history,
the woman's role

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:43.060
is kind of interesting
and kind of weird,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.070
because there's always this
woman who is a princess.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.960
And she has some knowledge.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.020
She kind of has the
keys to what it's really

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.210
going to take to win
this thing, whether it's

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.770
the princess of the elves or
the princess of the muggles

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.700
or the princess of the universe.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.760
And she's always a
potential love interest

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.600
and always turns out to
be the hero's sister.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.380
For those of you that are
interested in, is there

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.960
an aspect of the
hero's journey that

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.810
might be more interesting or
appealing from the woman's

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.670
perspective, Joseph Campbell
didn't write anything about it.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.690
But there are a
lot of people now.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.250
In fact, there's a woman
whose name is slipping my mind

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.380
right now-- I met her
recently-- at Stanford who's

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.630
looking to see, is there are
a parallel hero's journey

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.820
that might apply from
the woman's perspective?

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.334
The theory being as follows.

00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:30.750
These stories, these great
myths that have stayed with us,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.166
tended to be the stories that
stayed with us, because they

00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:34.820
were the stories
that got retold.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.352
So perhaps what
was happening is it

00:35:36.352 --> 00:35:38.060
was the guys who are
retelling the story,

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.890
so their stories
continue to get told.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.598
The stories that the
women were retelling

00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:43.030
were never getting retold.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.629
But is there a woman's
hero's journey?

00:35:44.629 --> 00:35:46.170
And there are people
looking into it.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.710
And it appears
that there may be.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.760
And it's not exactly
the same as the one

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.195
we're going through now.

00:35:51.195 --> 00:35:52.320
But let's look at this one.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.970
So are there any other
characters that are the same?

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.980
And as I was doing
this, I was having fun

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.630
taking these stories I know
and getting my little Lego

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.450
characters and lining
them up and saying,

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:03.640
why are they all the same?

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.265
And it's amazing, because as you
continue through, yes, there's

00:36:06.265 --> 00:36:07.410
always this gentle giant.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.460
So whether it's Gimli
or Hagrid or Chewbacca,

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.810
again, it pays to have a
really, really big beard

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.090
and to be really hairy.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.120
And the idea is you're
always a giant, which

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.400
means that initially this
person is very, very scary.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.030
But then the hero realizes
that really the giant

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.210
just represents someone with
an enormous heart, someone

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.000
with enormous belief who
never wavers in their belief

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.440
and continues to provide the
hero with guidance back to,

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.860
what do you really
believe in your heart?

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.330
And then there's
always the comedy duo.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.120
There are always
these bumbling twins,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.580
and they're always twins
who are screwing everything

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.590
up along the way.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.730
They're comic relief.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.529
But they're there for a
reason, because whether it's

00:36:47.529 --> 00:36:49.070
merry and pippin,
or Fred and George,

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:52.100
or R2-D2 and C-3PO stumbling
along, telling these jokes,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.490
giving us comic
relief, in the end,

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.920
they all we find in
themselves some aspect

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.680
of the heroic journey that
the hero experienced as well.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.560
And they always,
these bumbling fools,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.360
surprise themselves
at the end by what

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.730
they are able to accomplish in
spite of their own goofiness.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:18.020
Now, there would be no story
if there were no bad guy.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.900
So there has to be a bad guy.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.370
And obviously, it pays
if you're a bad guy,

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.412
you wear a black cape.

00:37:24.412 --> 00:37:26.370
That's how people know
that you're the bad guy,

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.430
whether you're Sauron or
whether you're Voldemort

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:29.810
or whether you're Vader.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.950
And also, you are not human.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.650
You do not have a human face.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.250
You are always masked or
you're so horribly disfigured

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.100
that you don't look
like a human anymore.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.550
And that's how we know
that you are the villain.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.690
And you are the person
that the hero must defeat.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.150
But the bad guy, the villain,
is not there on their own,

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.210
because they always
have an army.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.290
And this is an army
that is always there

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.530
in countless number,
unbeatable number,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.672
and, again, is always
masked and always inhuman,

00:37:58.672 --> 00:38:00.630
whether it's the Orcs or
whether it's Dementors

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.500
or whether it's
the stormtroopers.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.870
And when we first
meet this army,

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.050
we know that they
are unbeatable,

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.570
because there are so many of
them and they are in human.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.180
But then an amazing
thing happens.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.000
The moment that you kill the
boss, the entire army-- poof--

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.400
just disappears.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.620
They all just drop dead right
there, all million of them.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.070
And it turns out that that army
had no strength other than what

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.589
came to them from their leader.

00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:28.130
The moment you get
rid of the leader,

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.180
the army's completely gone
and the battle is over.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.740
So why do I take this time
to share this with you?

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.630
Because people pooh-pooh
the hero's journey.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.960
But, oh no, it is
absolutely right.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.600
It's almost as if this is
something that is in us.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.490
This is what a story, this is
what a drama is really about.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.190
And again, if you
just look at movies,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.300
you look at pop culture,
almost all of the big movies

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.260
just tell the same story
over and over again.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.690
We change the characters.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:57.890
We change the time.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.810
Recently, we changed the gender.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.010
But we're always
telling the same story

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.690
of this person who
doesn't want to be

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.970
in this strange
world, who goes in,

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.670
changes, and comes back out.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.170
All right.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.890
So that's kind of cool.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.056
But what about in real life?

00:39:11.056 --> 00:39:14.110
I mean, does anything about this
ever take place in the world

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.940
that we're in?

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.310
Absolutely.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.010
Let's think about
this for a moment.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.440
Do we ever see anything that
happens like this at work?

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.630
So this is, again, our line of
the full hero's journey story.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:27.592
This is really our view
of the whole drama.

00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:30.050
And what happens is we start
today where everything's fine.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.126
Some bad trigger happens.

00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:32.500
We go into this
point of descent.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.760
We reach this pit of doom
where everything is over.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.854
And this is, by the
way, is known as death.

00:39:39.854 --> 00:39:41.520
There is nothing
that's worse than this.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.190
Life is over.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.410
But then we decide, no,
we're not going to die today.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:50.500
We figure out or we remember or
we find something that tells us

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.900
how to begin to get
out of this pit.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.740
And we began to work
our way back up.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.660
And as we work our
way out of that pit,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.680
fighting dragons
along the way, we

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.432
start to get so much energy
that, again, we learn a lesson

00:40:03.432 --> 00:40:04.890
and we come back
on the other side,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.200
having learned this
entirely new thing.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.420
But does this ever
really happen?

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.209
Does it ever happen
that there is someone

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.000
who's having a fine
life, and then the life

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.470
takes a turn for the worst.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.290
And then that someone
becomes very sad,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.201
because that life is really,
really bad and is just about

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:21.200
on the verge to give up.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.210
Has this ever happened?

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.070
And then that person says,
no, I'm not going to give up.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.080
I'm going to find
something that's

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.660
going to help me
turn this around.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.930
I'm not going to die today.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.920
And then that person,
just through the act

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.467
of deciding to try to improve,
finds that things get better,

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.550
and then it comes screaming
out on the other side.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.030
This happens all the time.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.060
And this happens in
business all the time.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.470
This is the way we tell
stories about what we do,

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.430
about business.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.600
Think about some of our great
business or pop culture heroes.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.210
One of the reasons that
we love these stories

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.120
is because they tell
the same story again.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.480
Lady Gaga--
disastrous childhood,

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.210
drug addiction, homeless,
saved by her grandmother,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.690
and becomes Lady Gaga.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.480
We have Howard
Schultz at Starbucks.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.230
So Howard Schultz is CEO of
Starbucks, leaves Starbucks,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.639
Starbucks starts to stumble.

00:41:10.639 --> 00:41:12.180
This is about four
or five years ago.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.513
You remember there was this day?

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.070
Howard Schultz is
reined back in.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.290
They said, we need you, man.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.150
We need you back.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.040
You've got to be CEO.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.077
He steps back in.

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:19.910
First thing he does?

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.820
He looks over the whole thing.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.570
You remember this?

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.330
Four years ago, for one
day, every Starbucks

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.169
around the world was shut down.

00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:26.960
He said, forget it.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.084
You can't your latte today.

00:41:28.084 --> 00:41:29.010
I'm closing them down.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.816
We're doing a
global reset that's

00:41:30.816 --> 00:41:32.440
as bottom as you can
get, and now we're

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.070
coming back up on
the other side.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.710
Or whether it's Richard Parsons,
who managed to weather and save

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.960
Time Warner during this
disastrous AOL merger

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.397
and ended up becoming CEO of
Time Warner, because he was

00:41:44.397 --> 00:41:45.730
the one who was able to save it.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.460
And then the best of all,
back to Harry Potter,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.190
if there's anybody who
has a legitimate right

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:54.890
to write the hero's journey
again, it's JK Rowling.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.420
Her story?

00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:02.790
Single mother on
welfare, disastrous life,

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.170
writing away this
little book in the cafe

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.290
in this little town in the
UK, working on it day in

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.670
and day out and finally
getting that book published

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.900
and going on to become
the most successful author

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.560
of the last three decades.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.770
This is the story that we love.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.550
So what I would
like to encourage

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.310
you to think about-- it
might seem a bit abstract.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.460
You will be asked
by the person who's

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.560
responsible for your
quarterly review

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.059
to come in and give a report
about what you've been doing.

00:42:30.059 --> 00:42:32.100
That would be lovely to
give them just the facts.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.650
But wouldn't it be
amazing if you could also

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:38.160
deliver some of those facts
in the form of a story that

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.830
is this powerfully compelling?

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.976
I guarantee if you do
that, your mentor is

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:43.350
going to look at
you a little bit

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:45.683
differently and perhaps give
you maybe even a little bit

00:42:45.683 --> 00:42:48.162
more support on
what you need to do.

00:42:48.162 --> 00:42:50.620
Just a little bit of magic to
think about for the next time

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.285
you want to give a
presentation on anything.

00:42:53.285 --> 00:42:54.660
Whether you're
giving the report,

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.920
whether you're giving
the explanation,

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.460
whether you're giving
the pitch, if you

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.080
can add in a little
bit of the drama,

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.570
it will be that much more
extraordinary, which brings us

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.690
back to rule number three,
tell the story with pictures.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:13.450
So 35 minutes ago, I shared
with you 30 random pictures.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.465
I'm going to show you
those pictures again now.

00:43:15.465 --> 00:43:18.670
Now, I'm going to
show you two pictures.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.450
I would like you tell
me, right or left,

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.500
which is the one we saw before.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.040
Which when did we see before?

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.884
AUDIENCE: Left.

00:43:27.884 --> 00:43:30.650
Right.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.391
Left.

00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:34.339
Right.

00:43:34.339 --> 00:43:36.287
Left.

00:43:36.287 --> 00:43:37.748
Right.

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:40.183
Left.

00:43:40.183 --> 00:43:42.131
Right.

00:43:42.131 --> 00:43:43.592
Left.

00:43:43.592 --> 00:43:45.540
Left.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.750
Left.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.260
Right.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.100
Left.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.576
Right.

00:43:53.576 --> 00:43:55.052
Right.

00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:57.020
Left.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.988
Left.

00:43:58.988 --> 00:44:00.464
Right.

00:44:00.464 --> 00:44:02.432
Left.

00:44:02.432 --> 00:44:03.908
Left.

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:05.876
Left.

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.844
Right.

00:44:07.844 --> 00:44:09.812
Left.

00:44:09.812 --> 00:44:11.288
Right.

00:44:11.288 --> 00:44:12.764
Left.

00:44:12.764 --> 00:44:14.732
Left.

00:44:14.732 --> 00:44:17.240
Left.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.020
DAN ROAM: That's
why we use pictures.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.970
100%.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.860
Our memories are
stored as images.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.800
They are stored as pictures.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.860
It's very rare that our
memories are stored as words.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.000
When we memorize words,
what we tend to do

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.570
is just remember the words
but not what they mean.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.530
Images are the way that
we really, really remember

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.840
and convey our messages, so I
encourage you to use pictures.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:46.730
So if we just do those things,
truth and story and pictures,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.310
public speaking does not
need to be hard at all.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.570
In fact, it can be a
tremendous amount of fun.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.570
And if you like that,
there's more in that book,

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:54.309
"Show and Tell."

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:55.600
I encourage you to take a look.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.740
And if you like that, I
have something online called

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.364
the Napkin Academy, where a lot
of the things that I talk about

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:03.000
are available as videos,
all stored in YouTube.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.300
So again, I want to thank
you so much for your time,

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.508
for letting me share a little
bit about truth, story,

00:45:07.508 --> 00:45:08.180
and pictures.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.210
It's always my pleasure
to talk at Google.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.120
Thank you so much.
