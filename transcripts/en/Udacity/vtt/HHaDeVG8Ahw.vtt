Okay, I know my cell is doubling every time so I have two and then there's seven

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.200
rounds of doubling. So I have 2 to the 7th. Here are my seven two's. I'm going

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.950
to group them and them and then I'm going to group these. So I have 16 times 8.

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:18.075
I know 8 times 6 is 48, so I put an 8 and carry the 4. 8 times 1 is 8 plus 4 is

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:22.900
12, so 128. So if I start from one cell, after seven rounds of division there

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:23.725
would be 128.
