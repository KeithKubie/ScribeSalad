well I was mostly excited with the

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.160
well I was mostly excited with the
 

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.430

oscillation was not expected therefore I

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.090
oscillation was not expected therefore I
 

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.020

got the excited and this gave me the

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.030

now I mentioned neutrino oscillations so

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:48.830
now I mentioned neutrino oscillations so
 

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.130

neutrinos reactions this was also

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080
neutrinos reactions this was also
 

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.799

mentioned already at the beginning
 

00:20:56.809 --> 00:21:00.340
mentioned already at the beginning
therefore I would not be very precise

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:00.350
therefore I would not be very precise
 

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.340
therefore I would not be very precise
but anyway if neutrinos have masses

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:03.350
but anyway if neutrinos have masses
 

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.460

then if they propagate long distances

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:24.740
then if they propagate long distances
 

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.180
then if they propagate long distances
they disappear and if they propagate

the term neutrinos appear so this is the
 

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.280
the term neutrinos appear so this is the
neutrino oscillation and one important

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:13.350
and also I want to mention that these
 

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.100

other there was other experiment called

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120

the deficit of neo neutrino events so

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:45.510
the deficit of neo neutrino events so
 

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:52.120
the deficit of neo neutrino events so
that is in current II however well I

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:52.130
that is in current II however well I
 

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.630
that is in current II however well I
thought we thought that the simple

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640
thought we thought that the simple
 

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.410
thought we thought that the simple
deficit of muon neutrino event is not

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:00.420
deficit of muon neutrino event is not
 

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.160
deficit of muon neutrino event is not
really enough to conclude to be neutrino

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:04.170
really enough to conclude to be neutrino
 

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.460
really enough to conclude to be neutrino
situations we wanted to have more

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:07.470
situations we wanted to have more
 

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:13.210
situations we wanted to have more
positive evidence for oscillations then

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:13.220
positive evidence for oscillations then
 

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.030
positive evidence for oscillations then
well actually the physics is simple if

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.040
well actually the physics is simple if
 

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.430
well actually the physics is simple if
neutrinos are produced in the odd part

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440
neutrinos are produced in the odd part
 

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.840
neutrinos are produced in the odd part
of year of a detector then the travel

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:26.850
of year of a detector then the travel
 

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.290
of year of a detector then the travel
length for neutrinos are shorter enough

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:29.300
length for neutrinos are shorter enough
 

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.000
length for neutrinos are shorter enough
therefore they have no time to oscillate

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.010
therefore they have no time to oscillate
 

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.810
therefore they have no time to oscillate
however if a neutrino is produced in the

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820
however if a neutrino is produced in the
 

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.010
however if a neutrino is produced in the
other side of the earth then they need

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020
other side of the earth then they need
 

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.920
other side of the earth then they need
to travel long distances before eating

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:45.930
to travel long distances before eating
 

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:50.770
to travel long distances before eating
to the detector so they may oscillate

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:50.780
to the detector so they may oscillate
 

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.740
to the detector so they may oscillate
therefore which we conclude that we

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:54.750
therefore which we conclude that we
 

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.770
therefore which we conclude that we
should observe the deficit up of apart

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780
should observe the deficit up of apart
 

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.160
should observe the deficit up of apart
going muon neutrinos and in fact

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:01.170
going muon neutrinos and in fact
 

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.290
going muon neutrinos and in fact
kamiokande try to see this effect and

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:05.300
kamiokande try to see this effect and
 

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.690
kamiokande try to see this effect and
well we studied but we see some

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:09.700
well we studied but we see some
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.629
well we studied but we see some
however it was clear that Camille Khan

00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:12.639
however it was clear that Camille Khan
 

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:17.219
however it was clear that Camille Khan
was not big enough to to be conclusive

00:24:17.219 --> 00:24:17.229
was not big enough to to be conclusive
 

00:24:17.229 --> 00:24:20.129
was not big enough to to be conclusive
therefore it's Korea that we needed much

00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:20.139
therefore it's Korea that we needed much
 

00:24:20.139 --> 00:24:23.159
therefore it's Korea that we needed much
larger detector and therefore we needed

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:23.169
larger detector and therefore we needed
 

00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:28.589
larger detector and therefore we needed
super-kamiokande now I want to move on

00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:28.599
super-kamiokande now I want to move on
 

00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:33.739
super-kamiokande now I want to move on
to the neutrino oscillation discovery

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:33.749
 

00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:38.279
well of course the discovery was made by

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:38.289
well of course the discovery was made by
 

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:42.089
well of course the discovery was made by
the super-kamiokande experiment it is a

00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:42.099
the super-kamiokande experiment it is a
 

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:45.719
the super-kamiokande experiment it is a
50 cotton water tank of detector and the

00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:45.729
50 cotton water tank of detector and the
 

00:24:45.729 --> 00:24:48.649
50 cotton water tank of detector and the
fiducial mass that is used for the

00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659
fiducial mass that is used for the
 

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:51.719
fiducial mass that is used for the
oscillation studies is twenty two point

00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:51.729
oscillation studies is twenty two point
 

00:24:51.729 --> 00:24:56.249
oscillation studies is twenty two point
five kilo tones which is more than

00:24:56.249 --> 00:24:56.259
five kilo tones which is more than
 

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:58.710
five kilo tones which is more than
twenty times larger than the fiducial

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720
twenty times larger than the fiducial
 

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.049
twenty times larger than the fiducial

gave evidence for neutrino oscillations

00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:05.309
 

00:30:05.309 --> 00:30:08.790
well so far I discussed the result from

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:08.800
well so far I discussed the result from
 

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.400

and confirmed neutrino serrations

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000
and confirmed neutrino serrations
 

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.669
and confirmed neutrino serrations
therefore the neutrino oscillation was

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679
therefore the neutrino oscillation was
 

00:30:32.679 --> 00:30:38.299
therefore the neutrino oscillation was
quickly accepted by the Latino community

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:38.309

now in the remaining time I want to

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:41.260
now in the remaining time I want to
 

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.740
now in the remaining time I want to
discuss a little bit about the results

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:43.750
discuss a little bit about the results
 

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:50.580

of recent results in the future well I
 

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.340
of recent results in the future well I
said essentially based on this

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:53.350
said essentially based on this
 

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.230
said essentially based on this

however we think that we want to really

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:15.940
however we think that we want to really
 

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.720
however we think that we want to really
confirm neutrino oscillations and if we

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:21.730
confirm neutrino oscillations and if we
 

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.890
confirm neutrino oscillations and if we
look at the prediction so

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:25.900
look at the prediction so
 

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.970
look at the prediction so
oscillation probability as a function of

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:29.980
oscillation probability as a function of
 

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.860
oscillation probability as a function of
log of distance should be like this so

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:33.870
log of distance should be like this so
 

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:38.690
log of distance should be like this so
we really wanted to observe this depth

we really wanted to observe this depth
 

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.659

in order to confirm the early neutrinos

consistent with the prediction if we

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.020
consistent with the prediction if we
 

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.340
consistent with the prediction if we
