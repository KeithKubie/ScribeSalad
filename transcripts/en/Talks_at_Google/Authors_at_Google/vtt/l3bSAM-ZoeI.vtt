[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.690
NATASHA ROSS: Thank you
guys all for coming.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm super excited.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.270
Carla is a good friend and
she's in my head a lot,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.090
which is probably
a little dangerous.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
But she was here last year.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.520
She had her first book.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.684
This is her second book.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:24.600
I haven't read it yet.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.530
I know it's going to be amazing.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.450
One of my experiences that
I can share-- my daughter

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.680
just turned two.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.070
And on her second
birthday, literally, she

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.880
woke up from her nap and
screamed for 15 minutes.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.200
I timed it.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.760
No reason.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.942
She woke up crying.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.684
She-- whatever was going on.

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.350
The first thing that
popped into my head

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.000
was Carla's voice
from the first book,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.200
telling me that I needed
to react in a way that's

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480
going to help her.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.070
And it was a total
mindfulness thing

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.220
where I just sat there
and held her, and was

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.750
calm, and as
peaceful as possible,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.030
and waited for it to all pass.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.120
And we keep doing that as she
wakes up from naps screaming.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.320
But the thing that I find
is that she walks away

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
from that in a much
calmer state than had I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
gotten super upset,
super worried,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
reacted with her reaction.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.150
So that's Carla in my head.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.134
She has this awesome new book.

00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:23.550
It's called "Ready,
Set, Breathe."

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.280
And it's practicing
mindfulness with your children

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.360
for fewer meltdowns and
a more peaceful family.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.180
And I'm so excited to read it.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.710
So without further ado, Carla.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.502
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:42.250
CARLA NAUMBURG: Is
the mic turned on?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.160
Fabulous.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.130
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.490
This is, as Tash mentioned,
my second time speaking here

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.990
at Google.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.680
And I had a fabulous
time last year.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.980
So I'm thrilled to be back.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.160
And I want to say
thank you especially

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.868
to Tash Ross, who
helped set this all up.

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:58.074
And she's been super
supportive and great.

00:01:58.074 --> 00:01:59.490
So what we're going
to do today is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.681
I'm going to do some
reading from the book

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:03.680
so you can get a sense
of what the book is like.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.150
I'm going to do a little bit
of talking about the book,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.510
about mindfulness with our kids.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.843
And then we'll have some time
for questions and answers.

00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:11.030
So I hope that sounds good.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.110
All right.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.360
We're going to dive right
in at the very beginning,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.820
the introduction.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.075
"Will you please just calm
down and take a breath,

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.450
I snapped at my five-year-old
daughter the other morning.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.740
We had both gotten up on
the wrong side of the bed.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.950
And things had gone
downhill from there.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.540
She was circling
me in the kitchen,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.430
whining and crying
because we had run out

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.890
of her favorite cereal.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.660
And I had denied her request
to take a tiny and very

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.511
beloved toy to preschool.

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.260
Her four-year-old
sister, who was supposed

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.690
to be sitting at the table
eating her breakfast,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.740
kept getting down to
grab a toy or finish

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.130
a drawing she was working on.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.060
And I had to keep reminding
her to get back in her seat

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.620
and finish eating.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.480
Meanwhile, I was
stressed about everything

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.080
I needed to do that
morning-- make lunches,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.970
get dressed, finish
packing my work bags,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.340
and hustle everyone
out the door on time.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.860
In the back of my
mind I was feeling

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.270
guilty about leaving that
afternoon for a three-day work

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.797
trip.

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.880
Even though I knew the
girls would be fine at home

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880
with their dad, who's
sitting right over there.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.380
Hi, Josh.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.710
I also knew that my
impending absence

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.570
was part of why my daughter
was having such a hard morning.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.600
And I couldn't help
but feel bad about it.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.770
Not unlike my little girl,
I was tired and overwhelmed.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.950
And barking at her to
breathe was the closest

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.540
I could get to my
mindfulness practice

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.030
in that moment, which is to
say, not very close at all.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.330
Not surprisingly, she
responded in kind.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.300
I don't want to breathe, Mommy.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.800
The ridiculousness
of her statement

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.370
may have been lost on her.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.980
But it snapped me out of my own
irritability just long enough

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.662
to give me a little perspective.

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.120
I put down the
peanut butter knife,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.690
put my hands flat
on the counter,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.440
and took a few deep breaths.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.400
When I felt myself
calm down a little bit,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.500
I picked up my daughter,
sat her down on my lap,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.860
and kept breathing.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.020
Eventually, her heaving
chest calmed down

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.600
and her breathing became
more slow and steady.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.300
After a few minutes, she
asked me what I was doing.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.140
I'm just breathing.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.190
That's all.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.610
Oh, she replied with a smile.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.840
Me too.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.520
And so we sat for a few minutes
and just breathed together.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.670
While I know that she
actually was breathing,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.461
I don't know if she
was aware of her breath

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:08.546
in the same way I was.

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:10.490
I had been purposely
paying attention

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.850
to the air moving in
and out of my nose.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.320
And each time a
stressful thought

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.720
entered my mind about
everything I had to get done,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.380
or how I was going to get
her sister to breakfast,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.795
I let the thought go and
came back to my breath.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.170
For all I know,
my daughter could

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.503
have been thinking about baby
dolls, or unicorns, or ice

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:27.800
cream sandwiches, or
anything but her breathing.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.450
The truth is, it
doesn't really matter.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.158
By the time I went
back into the kitchen,

00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:33.800
we were both feeling a lot
calmer, more connected,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.100
and present with each
other and ourselves.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.969
It's not that anything
had really changed.

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.260
My daughter still wasn't
getting her favorite breakfast

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.510
or bringing her toy to school.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.830
And I still had a
million things to do.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.850
The difference was that
once we had calmed down,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.558
rather than freaking
out in our own minds

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.250
or subsequently all
over each other,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.208
we were both able to deal
with these challenges

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.220
a little more effectively.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.250
The moment that set our
morning on a better path

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.370
was the moment when I put
down the knife--" oh, yeah.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.161
Put down the knife.

00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:01.520
Mindful parenting pro
tip-- put down the knife.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.300
"--and took a few deep breaths.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.960
When I did that, I
was intentionally

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.910
trying to get myself into a
more mindful mindset, which

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.180
is simply about paying attention
to whatever is happening right

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.470
here and right now without
judging it or wishing

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.740
it was different.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.440
I had spent most of the morning
doing one thing with my body--

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.830
showering, getting dressed,
or making breakfast--

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.820
and another thing with my mind--
generally stressing, worrying,

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.250
and feeling guilty.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.160
This split attention
characterizes the way

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.090
most of us move through our
daily lives most of the time,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.080
often without even noticing it.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.180
Multi-tasking often fills a
void unavoidable in modern life.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.030
And it can at times help
us be a bit more efficient.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.700
More often than not
however, it leads

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.060
to increased stress,
mistakes, and errors,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.470
and snappy responses
to our children.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.420
When I was in the kitchen
making sandwiches,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.709
I was so wrapped up in
my own unhelpful thoughts

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.250
that I wasn't really
paying attention

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.170
to what was going on
with my daughter, which

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.378
is how we got caught up in
a power struggle over toys

00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:54.595
and cereal.

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.720
But after taking the time
to notice what was really

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.580
happening, I was
able to respond to it

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.912
in a much more skillful
and effective way

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:02.620
by giving my daughter
the attention she'd

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.404
been asking for all along.

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:06.320
The deep breaths I took
were an important step

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.175
in helping me get out of my own
head and back into the present.

00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:10.550
And that's what
mindful parenting

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.560
is all about-- making
a choice to focus

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.860
our attention on the
present moment with kindness

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.500
and curiosity, so we can make
a thoughtful choice about how

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.000
to proceed rather than
reacting out of frustration."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.540
So I chose this passage from
the book for a few reasons.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.050
Number one, as you
noticed, that moment

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.160
of mindfulness with my
daughter started with me.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.660
Right?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.537
I was in a pretty not
helpful headspace.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:34.870
And I kind of had to turn it
around so that I could then

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.040
be present with my daughter.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.080
And in the process, I was
teaching her something.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.580
The second important
point from that

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.957
is that mindful parents are
not mindful all the time.

00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:44.540
There is this
assumption when somebody

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.787
says, I practice mindful
parenting, especially

00:06:46.787 --> 00:06:48.745
if they say it in an
obnoxious voice like that,

00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:51.500
that it sounds like you
assume they sort of walked

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.210
through their parenting life
blissed out and zenned out

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.540
and totally present and
calm no matter what happens.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.610
And I've never met
anyone like that.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.420
And I'm certainly not like
that. and what mindful parenting

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.090
means, or practicing
mindfulness means,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.670
is that we have a set
of skills and tools

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.820
and a specific insight
about our own experience

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.540
that we can use when
we get off track.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.809
And I get off track
many times a day.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.600
And all it means is
that when I can finally

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.367
notice that my mind is a
million miles away, that I'm not

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.700
paying attention, that I'm
wrapped up in my own thoughts

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.940
and worries, I now
have this understanding

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.371
that I don't have to take
the bait of my own brain,

00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:26.870
as it were.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.600
I can make a choice to come
back to the present moment.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.070
And often that means
just taking a few breaths

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.272
until I can figure out what
I actually need to focus on.

00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:36.730
The next reason I
read that passage

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.420
is because when we are teaching
mindfulness to our kids,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.530
it works best if we do it with
them, especially initially,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.979
but in an ongoing way.

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:45.770
And I think we all have
this little fantasy

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.327
that we can kind of hand our
kid a snow globe or glitter wand

00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:48.910
and say, here.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.740
Go look at this and breathe.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.290
And come back when you're calm.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.645
And yes, I wish that too.

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:54.770
But it just doesn't work
that way most of the time.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.867
We need to sit with our kid
and do the practice with them.

00:07:57.867 --> 00:07:59.200
And we're both going to benefit.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.010
And eventually they'll
integrate and be

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.140
able to do it on their own.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.050
And the last reason
I read that is it's

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.140
really important to be
transparent with our kids

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.320
about what we're doing.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.737
And so in that
moment, my daughter

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:10.778
said, what are you doing?

00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:11.920
And I said, I'm breathing.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.420
And I specifically
said that to her

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.710
because I wanted her to know
exactly what I was doing.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.800
I didn't say, I'm
trying to calm down,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.050
because that doesn't help her.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.860
Like, that doesn't
tell her, give her

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.650
any information about what
we do to try to calm down.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.730
So I was very concrete.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.030
I'm breathing.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.380
And being transparent about
our own mindfulness practice

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.450
is actually harder than
it sounds, because it's

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.250
such an internal experience.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.000
It's all about our minds and
how we're perceiving the world

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.900
and what we're
choosing to focus on,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.730
and finding a way
to say to your kids,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.230
I'm having a really hard time.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.679
I'm about to lose
it all over you.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.900
I'm going to go in the
other room and breathe.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.669
It's weird.

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:47.210
It's a weird thing
to do, because you

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.360
have to have the presence of
mind to notice what's going on.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.730
You have to be able to remember
to tell it to your kids.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.780
And then you have to actually go
do it, which is the hard part,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.970
because we say all these
things we're going to do.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.053
And then we don't do them.

00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:59.940
So that's the tricky part.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.315
But I found that
for a long time,

00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:03.606
when I was about to lose it
or when I had just lost it,

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:05.900
when I'd yelled at my kids,
I would go in the kitchen

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.820
and put my hands on the
counter and start breathing.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.930
And then I'd come back and
I'd be a little calmer.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.222
And my daughters had no idea
what I was doing in there.

00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:13.929
For all they knew, I
was sticking my head

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:14.810
in the refrigerator.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.060
So I had to make a point
of starting to say to them,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.895
I'm going in the kitchen to
breathe, so I can calm down.

00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.170
And now they'll say,
oh, mommy must be upset.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.670
She's going.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.710
She's breathing.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.830
Mommy's breathing.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.030
Yes, I'm breathing.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.560
So those are some
important points.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.470
Now modeling and transparency
are just two of the ways

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.240
we can teach mindfulness
to our children.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.380
And I would argue they are two
of the most important ways.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.380
But some other ways
are sharing an activity

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.400
with your kid such as
reading a children's book.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.920
There are some really
great ones out there.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.610
My favorite current
picture book,

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.680
which is probably good up
through second or third grade,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.290
is called "Charlotte and the
Quiet Place," by Debbie Sosa.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.456
And it's a lovely story
about this little girl named

00:09:54.456 --> 00:09:56.520
Charlotte who can't--
she lives in a busy city.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.680
She can't find any quiet.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.388
And she goes out for
a walk with her dog.

00:09:59.388 --> 00:10:00.570
The dog runs away.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.330
She chases him.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.422
And then they're
both kind of panting

00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:04.630
because they've been running.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.050
And in that she finds her
breath and finds a quiet place.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.310
But you can read a
children's book to your kids.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.850
There are some
great apps for kids.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.320
Just to be clear, screen time
is not mindfulness practice.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.670
Right?

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.920
Because even though our
kids look like they're

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.316
being calm and focusing,
they're spacing out.

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:20.190
It's not mindfulness.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.856
So that's not to say
screen time is bad.

00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:24.060
It's just to say, don't
think your kids are

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.590
meditating in front of
"Caillou," because they're not.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.560
And then you can also teach your
kids specific skills and tools

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.180
like breathing activities,
noticing activities.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.527
And I'm going to talk
about some of those today.

00:10:35.527 --> 00:10:37.360
But before we go on, I
want to take a minute

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.526
to define mindfulness,
because this is a word that's

00:10:39.526 --> 00:10:40.910
all over the place these days.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.410
And I think many of us have
misconceptions about what it is

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.930
and what it isn't.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.810
So the traditional sort
of Western definition

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.810
of mindfulness, which
was first put forth

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.200
by Jon Kabat-Zinn,
who worked out

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.730
at UMass Worcester
for a long time.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.000
And he started mindfulness-based
stress reduction.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.390
His traditional definition
is paying attention

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.909
to the present moment
in a nonjudgmental way.

00:11:03.909 --> 00:11:05.450
Now I don't know
about you, but those

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.900
are pretty big words for kids.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.733
And I personally don't
like it when somebody

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:09.990
tells me to pay attention.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.110
I don't think my kids
respond particularly well.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.030
And furthermore, how
many of you have ever

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.430
had someone tell you, or
define for you, or tell you

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.500
how to pay attention?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.000
Anybody?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.140
I don't-- OK.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.900
So what did you hear?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.182
What did somebody tell you?

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:34.880
CARLA NAUMBURG: OK.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.170
So for everybody out
there, what he said was,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.090
he was told to focus on
what they were saying

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.630
and listen the way they
wanted him to listen.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.110
And it didn't feel very helpful.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.660
I agree.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.230
That doesn't sound very fun.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.671
So the definition I like
for kids, which I also

00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:51.170
borrowed components from Amy
Saltzman, who's a physician out

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.370
in the Bay Area who also
teaches mindfulness,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.810
is noticing the present moment
with kindness and curiosity

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.860
so we can choose
our next behavior.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.480
That choosing the next behavior,
that's like the pot of gold

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.020
at the end of the
parenting rainbow.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.210
We all want kids who can
take a moment and say,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.220
I'm actually going to choose
to use my words instead

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.679
of dropping to the floor and
screaming like a crazy person.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:13.511
So that's what we're
going for with our kids

00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.180
and with ourselves,
is the sense that we

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.971
have some choice in
what we're going to do,

00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:18.280
instead of just reacting.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.150
So let's break down this
definition a little bit.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.460
So the first part is noticing.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.560
Kids know how to notice.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:23.900
Right?

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.280
My daughter can notice a baby
doll from like a mile away.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.320
She's got an insane
radar for it.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.970
Little boys often can
notice trucks and tractors.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.122
And I know, gender split.

00:12:33.122 --> 00:12:33.830
Blah, blah, blah.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.380
But what I've seen, this is
like how it seems to break down.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.390
So noticing is super important
because so much happens

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.730
in our life that we
just don't even see it.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.686
I mean, we can walk
through our-- I mean,

00:12:45.686 --> 00:12:47.560
I've driven the same
way to school every day.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.170
And I had no idea that the
giant Santa was up on the corner

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.190
until my daughter's like, look!

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.830
There's Santa there.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.970
And I think he'd been
there for a week.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.470
This thing is like 10 feet tall.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.430
It's enormous.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.941
I was so wrapped up in
my own mind, I missed it.

00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.440
Right?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.920
So, so much of our life
happens without noticing it.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.300
And if we aren't noticing, if
we aren't paying attention,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.350
to use that phrase, it
will go right past us.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.160
And so how do we notice things?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.590
Well, we can notice
them with our eyes.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.410
We can notice them
with our ears.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.510
I mean, all of our senses.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.512
When we touch something.

00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:15.220
When we taste it.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.360
When we smell it.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.280
But the art of noticing is
about-- or paying attention--

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.820
is about choosing to bring
our attention, whatever

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.080
part of our body
we're doing that with,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.330
and focus it on something.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.830
Right?

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.330
To notice it to pay
attention to it.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.377
And then when our mind
wanders, we bring it back.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.960
And that's the part that I think
we lose in this definition is

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.340
that everybody assumes that
when you're paying attention,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.940
you are paying 100% attention,
and your mind never strays.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.190
Well, I don't know how many
of your minds can do that.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.829
But mine certainly can't.

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:44.870
And so the trick to noticing
and paying attention

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.470
is to be OK when your mind
wanders, and then say, oh.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.414
My mind just wandered.

00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:50.830
I'm going to bring it back to
what we we're talking about.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.580
So that's the first part.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.600
The next part is
the present moment.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.260
Now the vast majority of
us spend the vast majority

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.320
of our time in the
past or in the future.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.900
We're worried about something
that may or may not happen.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.170
We're planning for events.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.410
We're sort of fantasizing about
how a conversation may go.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.429
Or we're in the past kind
of regretting, wishing

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.970
things had been different, or
feeling nostalgic for something

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.750
that's already gone.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.940
This is a very useful
skill to have, in fact.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.340
You know, the caveman,
whenever, millions

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.530
of years ago who could
remember that when

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.360
Uncle Joe went into
that cave and got eaten

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.340
by a saber-tooth tiger, and can
plan in the future to not get

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.067
eaten by that saber
tooth tiger, is

00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:27.650
the one who's more
likely to have kids

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.290
and you know, pass
along his genes.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.664
So this brain that can do
this is a very useful thing.

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:35.080
And you know, now
as parents, when

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.530
we can remember the anaphylactic
shock that our kid had

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.000
when she ate a peanut,
and make a plan to send

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.950
a peanut-free cupcake to the
birthday party, not only are

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.590
we had avoiding an allergic
reaction, but potentially

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.760
a major meltdown.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.060
So this is a good thing.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.490
The problem is, our brains
don't know when to turn it off.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.140
Right?

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.824
We're constantly doing it.

00:14:52.824 --> 00:14:54.490
And there's a couple
problems with this.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.900
One is we can't get accurate
data on what's actually

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.990
happening if we're
not paying attention

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.890
to what's actually happening.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.890
If we're too busy filtering
the world around us

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.256
through a lens of what's going
to happen next, or oh, gosh.

00:15:08.256 --> 00:15:09.880
This is reminding me
of this thing that

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.110
happened all these years ago.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.560
And now I'm sort of
thinking about that.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.643
And I'm not really seeing.

00:15:13.643 --> 00:15:14.990
And parenting, man.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.810
That gets us going.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.170
Right?

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.210
Because no matter what's
going on with our kids,

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.440
we're always sort of
balancing between what's

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.020
going to happen next and
what already happened.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.353
So my daughter, when she was
having a hard time learning

00:15:24.353 --> 00:15:25.950
to ride a bike, I
was automatically

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.000
like, she's going to be 40
and she can't ride a bike.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.940
And her husband's going to want
to take her on this bike trip

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.529
to France.

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:32.070
And she's not going
to be able to go.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.030
And all her friends
are going to go.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.230
And it's going to be
like this awkward thing.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.540
And it's going to cause
them marital-- what?

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.669
That's insane.

00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:38.960
But that's where my brain went.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.043
And then, of course, I was
worried about the past.

00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:41.794
Like oh, man.

00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:43.710
Last summer we didn't
work on the bike riding.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.120
And it's my fault.
If I had worked

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.260
on the bike riding
last summer, we

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.300
would totally be all over this.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.925
And she'd be with
all these other kids,

00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:51.930
riding their bike like a little
gang of Hello Kitty sparkled

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.260
gangsters, or something.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.469
But what I needed was to be with
her right there in that moment,

00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:01.260
holding the handlebar
and walking with her.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.840
That's where we can make
a difference, right?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.299
The present is
where the action is.

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:07.589
So it's where we can get the
best information on what's

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:08.470
actually happening.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.261
And it's where we can
actually take action.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.429
That's why the present
moment is so important.

00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:15.470
Let's talk about this
kindness and curiosity bit.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.860
This is also the
non-judgmental thing.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.060
So for most of us,
when we actually

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.820
come to the present moment,
we immediately judge it.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.490
Sometimes we judge
it as pretty good.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.620
And then we whip out
our phones and want

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.930
to take a picture of it,
which immediately takes us out

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.140
of the present moment,
because then you're like,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.370
oh, I got a Facebook message.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.370
I better check that one.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.030
And all of a sudden you're like
buried with some other person

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.840
a million miles
away on Facebook.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.660
Or we judge it as
kind of boring.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.750
We don't like boring.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.250
Human beings are
terrible at boring.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.340
So we really want
that to be different.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.379
Or it's great.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.170
And then we're like,
oh, it's going to end.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.260
This is awful.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.100
Or it's terrible.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.516
And then all we
can think about is

00:16:49.516 --> 00:16:51.080
how soon we can get out of it.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.820
Most of us, most of
the time, are not

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.310
walking around going, huh.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.510
Things are pretty OK right now.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.070
I'm right with this.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.680
Or most the time
we're not curious.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.130
Like, what's going on?

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.736
So if we're in like a
terrible traffic situation,

00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:04.319
it's like, oh.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:04.980
This is miserable.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.619
I'm never going to
get to work on time.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.580
As opposed to, huh.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.150
Why is all this traffic here?

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.250
Which sounds like a really
ridiculous question.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.050
But it gets you out
of this crazy mind.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.150
So when we can be in the
present moment with this kind,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.150
curious stance,
not only is it sort

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.550
of a much more
pleasant way to be,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.670
but we're more likely to
take more effective action.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.840
So there's this whole
field of study now called

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.860
self-compassion.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.390
How many of you like have
that word come into your lives

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.300
on a daily basis?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.652
Even a regular basis?

00:17:34.652 --> 00:17:35.360
Well, my husband.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:35.880
But.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.380
Yeah.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.930
OK.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.490
So what researchers
have found is

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.562
that when you take a
compassionate response

00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:46.770
to anything that's happening
in your life, especially

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.350
difficult things, your
next action is much more

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.990
likely to be more effective.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.997
So let me give you an example
that most women, many men

00:17:56.997 --> 00:17:57.580
can relate to.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.680
You decide you're
going to go on a diet.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.950
And two days later you find
yourself eating an Oreo.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.840
Now what most people think
after they eat the Oreo?

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.650
I suck.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.570
I'm miserable at this.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.500
Everybody else can diet.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.000
And I can't.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.610
This is so hard.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.460
It's never going to happen.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.200
Forget it.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.530
And then what happens?

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.720
You eat the whole sleeve.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.270
It's gone.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.770
Right?

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.310
The Oreos are gone.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.980
But if your response is, huh.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.000
That was interesting.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.360
Why'd I do that?

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.650
Dieting is really hard.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.960
Everyone struggles with it.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.560
It's OK.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.750
I made a mistake.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.930
You are much more likely
to put those Oreos away.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.600
And this is true for almost
every behavior change.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.282
So sometimes when we talk
about self-compassion,

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:36.740
it can sound a
little touchy-feely.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.550
It's actually an
incredibly effective way

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.650
to approach our own experience
and our kids' experience.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.310
And then the last one is sort
of choosing our next behavior.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.250
So we've got noticing
the present moment

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.700
with kindness and
curiosity so we

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.229
can choose our next behavior.

00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:51.270
This whole noticing the
present moment, kindness,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.622
and curiosity bit-- that's all
about creating enough space

00:18:54.622 --> 00:18:56.830
in our awareness so we can
figure out what's actually

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.490
going on, and then make the
best and most skillful choice

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.930
about what to do next.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.650
Because most of the time
it's like, something happens.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.400
We get this input.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.670
And then we immediately react.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.320
Boom.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.750
And that reaction, it could
be from a place of worry.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.250
It could be from a
place of anxiety.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.980
It could be from a place
of remembering something

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.770
that happened two
weeks or 20 years ago.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.630
And we don't even know
that we're remembering it.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.130
Right?

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.410
Our brains work that
amazingly that all of a sudden

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.410
we're triggered.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.110
Our kid spills the milk,
the Cheerios, right?

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.170
And we're flipping
out at our kid.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.740
Not because we actually
care about the spilled milk

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.740
or Cheerios, but because
when we were kids,

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.740
we got yelled at for
spilling milk and Cheerios.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.900
And it triggers that
automatic reaction.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.660
So we can slow
down and say, huh.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.890
That's interesting.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.400
Sounds really cheesy
when I say it.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.316
But when you do it enough
times in your brain,

00:19:40.316 --> 00:19:41.190
you get used to it.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.189
Then we can say, OK.

00:19:42.189 --> 00:19:43.730
My kid spilled the
milk and Cheerios.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.320
What is the most effective
way to respond to this?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.727
And then you figure it out.

00:19:47.727 --> 00:19:49.310
So does that all
make sense right now?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.809
All right.

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:52.010
So if we start with this
mindfulness definition,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.690
let's take a minute
to talk about why

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.140
do we actually want this
for our kids and ourselves?

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.781
Like, we parents have enough
on our plate to figure out.

00:19:58.781 --> 00:19:59.280
Right?

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.410
Why interject this new
practice, this new idea?

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.020
Well, there has been
a shocking amount

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.361
of research on this
with kids, primarily

00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:07.860
in schools and
clinics where they're

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.616
teaching it to children.

00:20:09.616 --> 00:20:10.990
And what they
found is everything

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.080
we want for our child-- right?

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.657
Growing awareness of their
bodies, their thoughts,

00:20:15.657 --> 00:20:17.490
and their emotions, and
an increased ability

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.500
to verbalize it.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.730
And how great would it be
if every time our kids were

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.352
having a hard time, they came
to us and said, gee, Mom.

00:20:23.352 --> 00:20:24.560
I'm having a hard time today.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.601
I think my stomach hurts.

00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:27.630
Can you please help me
find a solution to this?

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.870
As opposed to like, melting
down and flipping out

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.203
in the car on the way to school.

00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:31.790
Right?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.850
So kids do that.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.700
Increased resilience and
ability to soothe themselves,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.430
to calm down, and to
regulate their emotions.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.970
This is something most of us
grownups are still working on.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.810
If we can start to help our
kids do it, that's amazing.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.770
Increased empathy.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.730
A stronger sense of
other people's emotions.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.740
Improved concentration
and ability to focus.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.570
Better sleep.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.250
That's a good one, right?

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.160
Increased confidence.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.950
Decreased anxiety.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.200
Like, all of these things.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.110
And it sounds like this
panacea, like this magic potion.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.190
And it's not.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.560
But if you think of all of
these things, so many of them

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.100
happen, so many of the
challenges we face-- not being

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.059
able to concentrate,
struggling with big feelings,

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.100
not knowing how to manage
them, not sleeping well

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.275
at night, so many of those
come from this awareness

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.150
and this attention that's
all over the place.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.860
It's like that pinball machine
you guys have right here.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.080
The thoughts are like
constantly bouncing around.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.038
And that makes it hard
to do the things we want

00:21:24.038 --> 00:21:25.990
and need to do in life.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.250
So the good news is that
our children are already

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.082
little zen masters.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.790
Now there's two ways
to think about this.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.029
One, the role of a zen
master is to constantly push

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.570
your buttons.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.120
So you have lots
of opportunities

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.420
to practice mindfulness.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.420
And I'm sure that's the one many
of you can relate to, right?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.750
But I would argue
that children are also

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.210
capable of great mindfulness,
of moments of intense awareness,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.789
concentration, and presence.

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:53.455
The problem is they
always want to do it

00:21:53.455 --> 00:21:55.079
when we need them to
put on their shoes

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:56.700
and get out the door.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.720
Having said that,
I would to read

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.980
you a section from the book
about sort of encouraging

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.750
these mindful
moments in our kids,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.680
how we can sort of
recognize and support

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.610
when our kids are already
being mindful inherently.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.570
"I'm sure you've witnessed your
child having a mindful moment.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.210
Perhaps it's when he is intent
on building the tallest LEGO

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.630
tower ever, or spinning
an elaborate fairy

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.700
tale about fairies living
in the bedside table,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.510
or is focused on
hearing every word

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.954
and note of a favorite song.

00:22:24.954 --> 00:22:26.870
Maybe it's when he's in
the zone on the soccer

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.520
field, about to score a goal.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.770
While none of these may seem
like particularly mindful

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.150
moments, they are.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.190
When your child is focused
on just one thing, when

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.060
he's fully engaged, not judging
himself or wishing something

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.231
were different, he is
practicing mindfulness,

00:22:40.231 --> 00:22:42.480
even though he's not sitting
cross-legged on the floor

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.870
with his eyes closed.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.470
When your child is
expressing interest

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.360
in the world around him
by mushing his banana

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.680
between his fingers to
see what it feels like,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.540
or by stopping to
notice a flower growing

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.810
through a crack in the
pavement, or by asking

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.720
questions about what
happens when we die,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.870
why we have to eat vegetables,
or the shape of the human body,

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.230
he is being mindfully curious
about the world around him.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.750
And finally, when your child
is being aware of and concerned

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.020
about someone else's feelings
or health or well-being, when

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.070
he brings a special toy
to a crying sibling,

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.030
or makes a card for
a friend's birthday,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.797
or visits a sick
friend after school,

00:23:13.797 --> 00:23:15.255
he's practicing
mindful compassion.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.470
These moments are important
for several reasons.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.130
Each time our children are
concentrating, being curious,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.395
or creative, or
demonstrating compassion--"

00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:26.270
See what I did there?

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.910
Concentrating, curious,
creative compassion.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:29.550
All the Cs?

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.190
Help you remember,
"They are learning

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.150
to pay attention and
notice what is happening

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.795
within them and around them.

00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.170
They are learning to make
connections, think in new ways,

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.290
and respond skillfully to
difficult, challenging,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.030
or boring situations.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.810
They are practicing
empathy and kindness

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.547
towards themselves or others.

00:23:44.547 --> 00:23:46.630
And they are drawing on
their own inner experience

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.190
for inspiration,
guidance, and soothing,

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.662
rather than counting on
someone else to do it for them.

00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:54.120
The more often they do all of
these things, the more likely

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.280
they will be able to
do them in the future,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.260
because even the seemingly
small behaviors are developing

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.921
and strengthening
habits and skills

00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:02.920
and the neural connections
in the relevant parts

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.245
of their brains.

00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:05.870
These are just a few
of the reasons why

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.203
it's important to practice
mindfulness with our children

00:24:08.203 --> 00:24:09.965
when they're calm,
happy, and doing well.

00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:12.340
The other reason is that those
are the times when they're

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.230
most likely to be
receptive to what

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.710
we're trying to teach them.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.270
The more they
practice these skills

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.200
when they are in a good
space, the more likely

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.950
they'll be able to
access and utilize them

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.314
in difficult moments.

00:24:22.314 --> 00:24:24.230
As one of my mindfulness
teachers once put it,

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.920
you can't practice
crisis meditation.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.970
As our children get better
practicing mindfulness

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.390
in the calm, uneventful moments
of daily life, the more likely

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.890
they'll be able to
access this skill

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.540
when we really
want them to, when

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.410
they're overcome with
anger, anxiety, or sadness.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.010
Actively teaching your children
about the ideas and practices

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.290
of mindfulness is part of
the process, to be sure,

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.124
and will be covered
more in later chapters.

00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:49.290
However, you'll be most
successful in your endeavors

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.990
if you can notice when
your child is already

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.990
being his own little zen
master, and support him

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.940
in that process, or at the very
least, not get in the way."

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.260
So two important points here.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.630
One is that we need
to find and create

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.156
those times in their lives
when our kids can be mindful,

00:25:04.156 --> 00:25:05.530
and we can stay
out of their way.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.590
Because so often we're nudging
and nagging and let's go,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.890
let's go, and we've got
to do this next thing,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:09.770
and you've got to
clean up your room,

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:10.760
and it's time to
do your homework,

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.301
and we've got to
get ready for dinner

00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:14.130
that we don't give
them that space.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.090
And so I was guilty of that too.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:20.487
This year we had our kids in
swimming, guitar, and dance.

00:25:20.487 --> 00:25:22.320
And they're in kindergarten
and first grade.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.695
And somehow when I set this
all up, it seemed reasonable.

00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:26.900
And now that I say it, it
seems totally ridiculous.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.460
But what I realized is
that they had no free time.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.637
And they needed time to
just sit and be and play.

00:25:31.637 --> 00:25:33.220
And I was seeing it
in their behavior.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.660
They were getting
grumpy and irritable.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.230
And basically we'd spend all
day Saturday managing tantrums,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.290
because they were
exhausted after the week.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.777
So swimming and guitar out.

00:25:40.777 --> 00:25:42.360
They're doing dance
on Sunday mornings

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.943
because we need
someplace to take them

00:25:43.943 --> 00:25:45.220
in the winter on the weekends.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:45.812
And that's it.

00:25:45.812 --> 00:25:47.020
And we come home from school.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.320
And I'm like, go play.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.380
I'm making dinner.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.180
And sometimes they need a
little help getting into it.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.030
But once they're into
it, it's their space

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.170
to kind of be
present and creative.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.090
And they really need that.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.390
And this is a big challenge
for us parents, parenting

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.720
in this cohort in this
culture, because it's

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.110
like we have to prepare
our kids for everything.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.860
They have to be able
to play an instrument

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.210
and speak a language, or they
will never work at Google.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.050
And the thing about
that is they also

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.170
need the emotional skills
to deal with boredom

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.424
and frustration, because we can
send them to every math camp,

00:26:17.424 --> 00:26:19.840
but if they get frustrated
when they get one problem wrong

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.506
and they give up on
the test, it doesn't

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:22.810
matter how much they know.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.300
And especially the younger ages.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.129
But at all ages we need to
create the space for our kids.

00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.170
The next thing I would
say that's super important

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.779
is the reason that many
of us come to mindfulness

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.320
for ourselves and
for our children is

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.820
to deal with our own personal
challenges and our children's

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.320
challenges.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:37.960
Like, dear God.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.043
I want this child to stop
melting down in Pan Ear.

00:26:40.043 --> 00:26:41.320
I can't deal with this.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.780
And so then what we do is
we bust out our little trick

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.430
when they're having a hard time.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.460
That doesn't work.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.280
That's like you trying to
teach me to code computer

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.590
languages when I'm like
really sad about something

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.300
or really angry.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.350
It's not going to happen.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.080
Like, we can't integrate
new information

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.295
when we're in a bad space
emotionally, especially

00:26:59.295 --> 00:27:00.420
little ones, but all of us.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.400
Their brains are just
flooded with hormones

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.483
when they're melting down.

00:27:03.483 --> 00:27:05.890
They can't even hear the words
coming out of your mouth,

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.290
much less learn
something new from you.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.630
So we have to find ways
to start integrating this

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.050
into our daily lives when
they're calm and happy

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.310
and feeling connected.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.140
And if we do that often
enough, then they'll

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.020
have it available when
they really need it.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.042
So the other day my
5 and 1/2 year old

00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:23.500
was sitting on the
couch like this.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.852
[PANTING]

00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:26.560
And I was like, Rose,
what are you doing?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.590
And she's like, I'm
very upset, Mommy.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.690
I'm breathing!

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.485
And like, this is
not the breathing

00:27:31.485 --> 00:27:33.610
that I think is really
going to help her calm down.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.159
But for months now
we've been practicing

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:37.450
breathing, and doing breathing.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.324
And finally she was
like trying to breathe

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.490
in the middle of a meltdown.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.380
And I was like, that is
a huge win right there,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.296
even though she was
actually hyperventilating.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:46.030
But we'll get there.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.250
So starting it when your
kids are in a good space,

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.670
and working on this.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.202
And as you'll
notice in the book,

00:27:52.202 --> 00:27:53.660
it doesn't have to
be a huge thing.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.826
It's not like we're going
to pull out the meditation

00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:58.509
cushions and light the incense
and bang the singing bowl

00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:59.550
and sit down and breathe.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.232
Like, if that's your
style, that's fantastic.

00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:04.440
But if it's like, hey, let's
sit down and play Legos.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.090
And I'm going to
work really hard not

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.790
to nag you about how
to make that tower

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.010
the most stable tower ever.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.740
And I'm just going
to let you be.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.344
Or if it's like,
my daughters and I

00:28:12.344 --> 00:28:13.510
will sit on the front porch.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.609
And I'll say, let's
just listen for sounds.

00:28:16.609 --> 00:28:17.650
I'll give you one minute.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.020
And I want you to report
back to me two sounds.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.904
And the minute is
actually like 25 seconds,

00:28:21.904 --> 00:28:23.820
because that's what they
can handle right now.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.550
But they get quiet.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.760
And they listen for two sounds.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.510
And then I'll say,
let's just sit together

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.080
and breathe for 10 seconds.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.292
Can we notice our breathing?

00:28:33.292 --> 00:28:35.250
My seven-year-old can
definitely do 10 seconds.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.600
My five-year-old is
like, four seconds.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.960
My brain is like two seconds.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.590
But you know,
practicing these things

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.510
and finding ways to work
them into your daily life.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.426
If you have a religious
or spiritual practice,

00:28:45.426 --> 00:28:47.400
you can say your prayers
together and recognize

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.410
that as a mindfulness practice.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.410
And many of these things
when you read the book,

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.222
you'll be like, oh.

00:28:52.222 --> 00:28:53.180
I'm already doing that.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.110
We play Jenga.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.700
I didn't know that was
a mindfulness practice.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.240
The trick is deciding it is.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.699
So making a point
to pay attention,

00:28:59.699 --> 00:29:01.739
and then notice when your
attention has wandered.

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:02.880
And then bring it back.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.990
And so all of these
things, when we really

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.979
make a point to insert
them into our day,

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.603
are going to end up
being quite useful.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.630
So I want to give you a
couple of tricks and tips

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.080
before I leave.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.710
My favorite mindfulness
trick is that you

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.070
can't be curious and
angry at the same time.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.420
This is extremely cool.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.720
And I never noticed it until
someone told me recently.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.952
But curiosity comes from
our prefrontal cortex,

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:31.910
which is right up here.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.790
And it requires that
this part of our brain

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.040
that can plan and think and
process and manage emotions,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.650
that this part is online.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.690
And anger comes from
back here, right?

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.530
This is like the reptilian
fight, flight, freak out,

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.990
freeze part of our brain that's
like, I can't even think.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.050
And even though you just offered
me a snack and ice cream,

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.590
I'm still screaming at you,
because I'm losing my mind.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.190
So those can't function
at the same time.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.350
They just can't.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.990
So when this part's
turned on, our kids

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.130
can't think or do anything.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.940
But if we can get this
part to come online,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.335
the back calms
down a little bit.

00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:03.210
So one of the tricks
I'll do with my daughter

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.160
when she's really losing it--
and I have to wait until she's

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.920
calm enough to at
least hear my voice--

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.330
is I'll try to get her curious
about the world around us.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.746
So if we were in this room
together and she was losing it,

00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:14.650
I would say, hey.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.980
Can you find a
screen in this room?

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.504
Like, make it really
easy to start.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.420
So I'm not going to say,
can you find somebody

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.670
who's wearing brown boots?

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.740
That's too much.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.459
And then, can you
find me like, a chair?

00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:27.000
And sometimes if
she's so lost, like,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.790
she couldn't find a
chair in this room.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.470
But make it really easy and see
if you can get them curious.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.440
Now my older daughter
will say to me,

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.760
don't do that trick on me!

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.400
I don't want that trick!

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.191
I want to be angry!

00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:38.367
And I'm like, OK.

00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:39.450
Then you let her be angry.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.340
And your job in that
moment is to stay calm

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.020
so she can get
through the anger.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.710
So that's a nifty trick also in
life when you're getting like,

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.210
pissed off.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.710
Like when I'm pissed
off in traffic,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.530
I try to get curious
about tail lights.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.100
Tail lights come in a lot of
different shapes and sizes.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:55.910
It's amazing.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.570
I had no idea.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.550
And I'm like, hm,
there's a round one.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.710
So can you get curious
about something?

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.390
It really helps you calm down.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.390
And then I want to read you
a little bit about something

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:10.050
called a cool down corner,
which is a very helpful space

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.897
to set up for a kid.

00:31:10.897 --> 00:31:12.980
And I also thought it'd
be appropriate for Google,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.440
because you guys have
a million of them here.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.674
And they're shaped like
airplanes and jails

00:31:17.674 --> 00:31:19.090
and really cool--
well, not jails.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.256
That's not the best example.

00:31:20.256 --> 00:31:21.790
But.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.180
So creating a calm down corner.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.200
In addition to making a
more mindful environment

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.950
throughout your house, which
is something I talk about

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.080
in the book, you may
want to consider creating

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.760
a special calm down corner.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.180
This can be a
small room, or even

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.430
a corner of a room, a
small comfortable chair,

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.160
or an indoor child's tent.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.940
The idea is to
create a space that

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.500
is conducive to a calm,
mindful experience,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.150
and that specifically cues your
child to get quiet and focused.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.250
It's a good idea to involve
your child as much as

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.920
possible in the
design of the space

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.397
and in choosing
what to put in it.

00:31:50.397 --> 00:31:52.230
You'll want it to be
decorated in a way that

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.620
appeals to him or her,
keeps her interested,

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.460
and helps her get and stay calm.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.696
Here are a few ideas
to keep in mind.

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:00.570
You can choose a calming
theme for the space.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.570
But you don't have to.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.600
I have one friend who named her
kid space the cool down corner,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.370
and filled it with
books about Antarctica,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.050
as well as a few stuffed
polar bears and penguins.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.120
Another friend created
a seat in space.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.230
She and her son cut out
some stars and planets

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.090
to hang from the
sky, and included

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.270
a favorite stuffed
alien doll, and

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.900
a few different
space-themed toys and books.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.160
Choose a few toys that your
child would like to have,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.250
or activities she can do
completely unsupervised.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.980
So like if Play-Doh
freaks you out,

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.530
don't put the Play-Doh in there.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.050
Like, put stuff that you can
leave the kid alone with.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.466
You'll want to work with her
to choose things that are age

00:32:33.466 --> 00:32:35.310
or developmentally appropriate.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.364
Don't put too much stuff
in the calm down corner.

00:32:37.364 --> 00:32:39.780
Regardless of how cluttered
the rest of your house may be,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.042
this is an area that you
have just a few items.

00:32:42.042 --> 00:32:44.000
Too much stuff will make
it hard for your child

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.831
to focus and choose what to do.

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:47.580
You'll want to include
items and toys that

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.413
are known and comforting
to your little one,

00:32:49.413 --> 00:32:51.180
not items to
challenge her to try

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.814
new or different activities.

00:32:52.814 --> 00:32:53.980
No need to spend much money.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.438
You likely already
have or can make

00:32:55.438 --> 00:32:57.340
anything you want to include.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.530
No screens, tablets,
or electronic toys

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.800
in the calm down corner, with
the exception of an MP3 or CD

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.540
player loaded with
guided meditations.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.940
And you can get them on
like eBay really cheap that

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.140
don't have a screen on them.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.240
Like the old school iPod ones.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.750
This is not a time-out spot.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.700
And your child should
not be forced into it.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.250
It may be a spot she chooses
instead of time-outs if you

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.586
use time-outs in your house.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.710
But it should always be a
place she goes willingly.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.650
You want your child to
have positive associations

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.900
with the calm down corner,
which won't feel easy if it

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.590
feels like a jail cell to her.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.420
The calm down corner
is a sacred space

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.420
where shouting, nagging,
arguing, discussing,

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.850
questioning, and
negotiating are not allowed.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.350
This space isn't
for figuring things

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.790
out or rehashing problems.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.570
It's just for being,
breathing, and doing

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.310
quiet, soothing activities.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.830
That's all.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.300
Once you're there, you're safe.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.350
And that last bit is
the hardest part for me,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.780
because I want to
go after my kid.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.363
Be like, wait.

00:33:45.363 --> 00:33:46.960
We're not done
talking about this!

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.252
Not the time to do that.

00:33:48.252 --> 00:33:50.460
If you don't have the space
in your house to do that,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.430
you can also create like a calm
down box or a little cloth bag.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.880
And you can put-- my kids
love Silly Putty is always

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.510
a good choice.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.093
And it doesn't-- I mean, it can
sort of get mashed into a rug,

00:34:00.093 --> 00:34:01.430
but not as bad as Play-Doh.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.230
Like they sell
little glitter ones

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.660
that are nice things to look at.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.080
A small notepad and some pens.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.531
If your kid is
into Rubik's cubes

00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:11.030
and that's not going to stress
her out, something like that.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.279
Anything they can sort of
manipulate with their bodies

00:34:13.279 --> 00:34:15.889
is really useful.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.723
I mean, some kids really
like strong scents.

00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:20.055
So you can find a little
scented pillow to put in there.

00:34:20.055 --> 00:34:21.480
Whatever works for your kid.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.605
And you really have to pay
attention to your child,

00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:26.000
because everybody's got
different things that work.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.710
And then the last
trick I really have

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.270
is get your kids outside
as much as possible.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.596
And I know we all hear this.

00:34:31.596 --> 00:34:34.179
And when somebody tells me that,
and I'm in a stressed moment,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.530
I'm like, I can't even deal.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.870
And have you met Boston winter?

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.280
Like, don't talk to me.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.690
But it makes a huge difference.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.380
There's not as much
clutter around,

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.000
and kids can move
their bodies more.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.059
All of this helps us get
into a more mindful space.

00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:49.600
And so in the winter we bundle
our kids up and we go outside.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.641
And sometimes we spend 10
minutes getting dressed

00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:53.380
and five minutes outside.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.120
And that's OK.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.699
But it's much more easy for
kids to get in a mindful space

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.150
when they're outside.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.760
So those are some ideas.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.997
There's a lot more in the book.

00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:04.080
And at the risk of sounding
like a TV salesperson,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.900
there are over 100
activities in this book.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.430
And I interviewed 30
different parents for this,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.132
because there are
many, many great books

00:35:12.132 --> 00:35:14.340
on the market about teaching
mindfulness to children.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.910
And I can recommend some to
folks who are interested.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.210
Most of them are based on
the author's experiences

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.360
in schools and clinics, which
is really useful and important.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.280
But anyone who has ever tried to
teach their own child anything

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.930
knows it's really different
from how kids learn at school.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.180
And there's all sorts of
dynamics that happen at home.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.096
And we also have lots
of opportunities at home

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.959
that don't happen at school.

00:35:33.959 --> 00:35:35.750
But I wanted this book
to be representative

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.470
of a lot of different
families' experiences.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.750
Because my family is quirky.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.791
And we have our own
preferences and a certain way

00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:41.582
of doing things.

00:35:41.582 --> 00:35:43.040
So I talked to 30
different parents

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.530
about how they do this at home.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:47.380
So there's a whole lot of
activities and ideas in here.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.189
And choose the ones that work
for you and make up your own.

00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:51.980
And don't worry if some
don't work for you.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.730
It's not your gig.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.780
That's fine.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.110
But that's the book.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.400
That's the talk.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.150
Hopefully we have some
time for questions.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.290
Oh.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.010
Here's somebody.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.620
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
one picture book to share

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.050
with kids in the course of it.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.800
I wonder if you had any
suggestions for even moving

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.950
older, the 10 and
11-year-old who is old enough

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.349
to recognize, wow, I
regularly screw things up

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:17.640
when I get really stressed out.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.800
And you know, I say things
that I don't want to say.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.590
So a little older
than picture book,

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.950
but maybe not ready to just
take an adult self-help book

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.574
off the shelf and
plow through it.

00:36:28.574 --> 00:36:29.990
CARLA NAUMBURG:
This is a question

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.140
I frequently get at talks.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.639
And I've been looking
for something.

00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:35.040
And I haven't found anything
I love for that age.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.500
There is-- and again, I don't
like pushing the screen time

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.785
for this particular issue,
because it's not really

00:36:41.785 --> 00:36:42.660
what we're going for.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.742
But there's a website.

00:36:44.742 --> 00:36:45.450
I could be wrong.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.730
I think it's called GoZen.com.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:52.730
But if you look up like,
zen anxiety, kids, YouTube,

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:53.370
it will pop up.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.447
And whether or not
anxiety is the issue,

00:36:55.447 --> 00:36:57.530
I know that that's one of
the things they address.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.620
And they have some pretty good
animations that are helpful.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.286
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:37:00.286 --> 00:37:01.060
Thanks very much.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:01.300
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yeah.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:01.680
Please.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:04.879 --> 00:37:05.920
CARLA NAUMBURG: Oh, yeah.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.380
So the question was, does it
not work for kids under three?

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:08.880
No.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.220
It definitely works
for kids under three.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.020
I mean, my publisher was
like, pick an age range.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.970
And I was like, OK.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.670
But I mean the reality is
it's all about figuring out

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.790
what works for your kids.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.070
Like, under three
you can totally

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.904
start doing these
activities with your kids.

00:37:20.904 --> 00:37:22.736
The ones that are going
to be most effective

00:37:22.736 --> 00:37:23.840
is the ones you practice.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.240
And then it sort of leaks out,
for lack of a better term,

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:27.950
to your children.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.033
So when we can stay calm
when our children wake up

00:37:30.033 --> 00:37:33.940
from the nap screaming,
that's a great one.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.590
When we can let our
toddlers and little ones

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.910
have the space and the time
to just play and explore

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.330
the environment, and we're not
like getting in their space.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.830
And I never thought
this would be

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.430
a thing I did until I had kids.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.100
But then, I'm like,
oh, you're playing.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.284
Let's make your play better.

00:37:48.284 --> 00:37:50.700
Like, let me get your space
and help you make that better.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.910
And Josh and I
stopped doing this

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.780
when we read a quote by
Jack Black, the actor.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.689
He said in "USA Today," "never
give a happy child ice cream."

00:37:59.689 --> 00:38:00.480
And I was like, oh.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.430
That's right.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.290
I'll save the ice cream for
when maybe they're not so happy.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.570
Bribe them with ice cream.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.070
No.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.910
But like, if they're doing
well, leave them alone.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.640
And that's surprisingly hard
to do when it's especially me.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.950
I want to get like in it.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.390
And then Josh is
like, ice cream!

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.130
And then I can like step away.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.100
So with the little
ones, and also food

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.980
is a great time to let them
sort of mindfully be curious,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.050
if you can tolerate it.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.550
Right?

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.280
Because then you end up with
food all over the place.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.730
And it's like, I
just gave you a bath

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.271
and now you have
hummus in your hair.

00:38:29.271 --> 00:38:31.960
But if you can let them really
explore food and kind of sit

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.376
with it and mush
it around, that's

00:38:33.376 --> 00:38:37.069
a great practice for
little ones, too.

00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:40.063
AUDIENCE: Do you have any tips
for parents in the moment?

00:38:40.063 --> 00:38:42.769
So when kids are freaking
out, the parents then

00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:44.060
are freaking out because of it.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.760
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.870
Tips for parents who are
freaking out in the moment.

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.520
So that's what the
first book is about.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.550
It's called "Parenting
in the Present Moment."

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.480
But briefly, yes.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.330
When you are freaking
out, my tips are,

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.772
see if you can breathe.

00:38:55.772 --> 00:38:57.230
Like, pay attention
to your breath.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.510
And a lot of times people
think breathing meditation

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.010
is this like whole big thing.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.676
Like, you have to breathe in for
four and breathe out for seven,

00:39:03.676 --> 00:39:06.250
and then stand on your head,
and then like chant a mantra.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.250
It's not.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.020
Just notice your breath,
however it is, wherever it is.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.521
Some people notice
it in their nose.

00:39:11.521 --> 00:39:13.061
Some people notice
it in their chest.

00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:14.660
Some people notice
it in their belly.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.980
Just notice.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.150
And that will like
calm you down.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.622
Another one is like, for some
people putting their hands

00:39:21.622 --> 00:39:22.330
on a counter top.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.550
That works for me kind
of to get grounded.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.180
For some people
just sitting down,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.460
like feeling your body in
contact with something firm

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.624
can help you feel grounded.

00:39:31.624 --> 00:39:33.040
And then remembering
a few things.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.340
One is, unless your
child is in danger,

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.430
you don't have to
react right away, which

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.870
can be such a hard thing
when they're screaming.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.328
Like, they can
scream for a minute.

00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:43.860
They can tolerate it, especially
if they know that you're around

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.759
and they're safe.

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:46.300
And if they ask you
something and you

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.550
don't know what to
do, like, you don't

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.860
have to have an answer, right?

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.400
You can say, I need some
time to think about that.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.020
And the other thing
is that you can always

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.060
start a mindfulness practice
again and again and again.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.020
So there's a saying in
the mindfulness world,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.420
which is that it's really
easy to be mindful.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.280
It's really hard to
remember to be mindful.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.114
And so some of us will get to
this place where it's like, ah.

00:40:09.114 --> 00:40:11.280
It's the end of the day,
and I forgot to do laundry,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.190
and I forgot to be mindful.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.360
I totally screwed that up.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.720
And then we beat
ourselves up, because we

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.969
want to be these calm parents.

00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:17.510
And instead we
yelled at our kids.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.786
So that moment when you
notice that you're ramped up,

00:40:20.786 --> 00:40:22.160
that you're a
million miles away,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.080
that you're yelling
whatever it is,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.590
that's what Sharon
Salzberg-- who

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.830
is a very well-regarded and
one of the leading meditation

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.600
teachers in this country--
she calls it the Magic Moment.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.650
Any moment you notice
and become aware,

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.470
I am losing it with
my kid, is the moment

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.220
you can choose to make
a different choice.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.261
And every once in a while
I have enough awareness

00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:44.050
that I will actually stop
yelling at my kids mid-yell.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.520
And it's surprisingly
effective, because they're

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.440
expecting this rant.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.800
And then all of a
sudden, you just stop.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.780
And they're like, whoa.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.810
What happened?

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.260
And so whenever you can catch
it, you can always stop.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.740
And we also have this
thing with parenting

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.486
that we have to be
consistent, right?

00:40:58.486 --> 00:41:00.110
So once you've laid
the law down, like,

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.970
you cannot change
your mind ever.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.800
It's actually not true.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.660
We make mistakes.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.710
We say the wrong thing.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.040
We set a limit that's
not the right one.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.456
Or we don't set
enough of a limit.

00:41:08.456 --> 00:41:10.860
You can go back and say,
actually, I changed my mind.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.610
Right?

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.450
But it's important
that we when it can,

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.684
it comes from a mindful
place, as opposed to,

00:41:16.684 --> 00:41:17.850
I'm going to set this limit.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:18.960
But now you're being
a jerk about it.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.850
And I don't really
want to fight with you.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:20.330
I'm tired.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.960
I just want you to go to bed
so I can watch my TV show,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.251
so I'm going to change my mind.

00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:24.970
Like, that's not
really so effective.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.390
But when you can say, huh.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.120
Now that I'm calm, I realize
I didn't actually mean that.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.020
That's a better way.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.640
But check out the first book.
"Parenting in the Present

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.870
Moment."

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.870
It's got some good tips.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.730
And also, last tip.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.396
And then I see there's
another question.

00:41:35.396 --> 00:41:37.819
Start practicing this
when you're calm.

00:41:37.819 --> 00:41:39.860
Because just like we talked
about with your kids,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.150
you can't teach them a new
skill when they're freaking out.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.390
We can't teach ourselves a new
skill when we're freaking out.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.450
So if we expect ourselves
to be able to start

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.810
a mindfulness practice
when our kids are

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.560
like really pushing our buttons,
it's not going to happen.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.900
So either try meditation,
which is a great one.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.900
Or if you're like, I am
not sitting on a cushion

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.594
right now, that's
not happening, lady,

00:41:57.594 --> 00:41:59.010
then the other
thing you can do is

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.800
pick one or two activities
you know you do every day,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.326
and pay attention to them.

00:42:03.326 --> 00:42:04.700
And when your mind
wanders, as it

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.630
will after about two
seconds, come back.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.154
So for me it's taking a shower.

00:42:08.154 --> 00:42:09.570
I can get to the
end of my shower.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.380
My hair is wet.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.700
I have no idea if I washed it.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.620
Not a clue.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.830
And so can you pick one or
two things you enjoy doing.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:17.660
Don't make it harder
than it has to be.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.956
Drinking your coffee.

00:42:18.956 --> 00:42:19.830
Reading to your kids.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.500
Whatever it is.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.840
And just pay attention.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.650
So those are things
that will help.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.050
And the more you do that, the
more your brain gets better

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.540
at noticing, the more likely
you will be to notice.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.040
Yeah.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.140
Please.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.892
AUDIENCE: This book looks great.

00:42:32.892 --> 00:42:34.600
I'm really looking
forward to reading it.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:34.950
CARLA NAUMBURG: Thanks.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.930
AUDIENCE: One
place that where we

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.030
found the good ideas
tend to break down

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.370
is when you have multiple kids.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.860
And I'm curious to know whether
the book addresses it or not.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.220
I'm thinking of the
calm down space.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.505
In my house that would turn
into the thunderdome, basically.

00:42:52.505 --> 00:42:54.340
One kid we could maybe do that.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.600
But then, especially if there's
just one parent at home,

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.540
you got to go make dinner.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.770
And usually we try good ideas.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:04.527
And then it's either
yelling or TV.

00:43:04.527 --> 00:43:06.610
You know, it's like, those
become our two options.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.040
So I'm just curious.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.750
When you're outnumbered,
anything in the book

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.667
or otherwise that--

00:43:11.667 --> 00:43:13.416
CARLA NAUMBURG: How
many kids do you have?

00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:14.677
AUDIENCE: Three so far.

00:43:14.677 --> 00:43:15.510
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.890
So you are well outnumbered.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:17.880
You know, this is
a huge problem.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.421
So the calm down
space, you're right.

00:43:19.421 --> 00:43:22.100
This is a big issue
that comes up.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.360
But you can still do it
with the calm down space,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.400
even with multiple kids.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.485
And like in my daughters'
classrooms-- in every classroom

00:43:27.485 --> 00:43:29.284
at my daughter's school
from K through 8,

00:43:29.284 --> 00:43:30.450
they have a calm down space.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.000
That's one space
for like 24 kids.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.970
So they have to take turns.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:34.550
And my daughter will come
home frustrated sometimes

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:35.758
that she didn't get her turn.

00:43:35.758 --> 00:43:36.510
That's fine.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.180
So having a space in the
house is a good idea.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:39.860
But yes.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.250
When all three kids
are melting down,

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.969
that's when you have to put down
the knife-- which I'm making

00:43:45.969 --> 00:43:47.260
reference to my own experience.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.968
I'm not implying you
carry knives around.

00:43:48.968 --> 00:43:50.580
Although--

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.810
And go be with them.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.260
And that's a moment.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.640
So one of the words that comes
up a lot in mindfulness world

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.251
is acceptance.

00:43:57.251 --> 00:43:58.750
I don't love that
word, because it's

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.291
like we have to accept and just
be OK that our kids are going

00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:02.220
to like, cry forever.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.130
I like the word
acknowledgement better.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.030
You have to just
acknowledge in that moment

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.305
that everyone is melting down.

00:44:07.305 --> 00:44:09.180
And you have to make
the best choice you can.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.510
And sometimes the
best choice is TV.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.350
Like, practicing
mindfulness does not

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:17.370
mean we do the number one
best parenting intervention

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:17.929
at all times.

00:44:17.929 --> 00:44:19.470
And in fact, I would
argue that's not

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.902
helpful for your kids,
because then your kids learn

00:44:21.902 --> 00:44:23.360
that all of their
needs will be met

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.401
in the most effective way
at every moment-- which

00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:27.350
guess what-- is not
how the world works.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.740
So sometimes you yell.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.430
Sometimes you turn on the TV.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.856
But when your kids
are old enough

00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:33.230
that you can start
to strategize,

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.729
like can one of them go to their
rooms if they need a break,

00:44:35.729 --> 00:44:36.380
by choice.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.700
Can you use the
calm down corner?

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.610
Maybe a kid needs to
plug-in some headphones

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.026
and listen to a
guided meditation.

00:44:44.405 --> 00:44:46.972
I mean, it really involves
a lot of creativity.

00:44:46.972 --> 00:44:48.680
But you can do it with
more than one kid.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.970
You just can't expect to do
it perfectly all the time.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.060
And that's when the
self-compassion and kindness

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.490
and curiosity is
really important,

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.060
because it's like, oh.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.350
I just lost it.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.010
And so can I be nice to
myself and forgive myself.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.670
Because most of us when we
do an unskilful parenting

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.264
intervention, we tend to
beat ourselves up about it.

00:45:07.264 --> 00:45:08.180
I'm a terrible parent.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.263
I can't believe I lost it.

00:45:09.263 --> 00:45:11.710
Everybody else is
doing it better.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:12.782
And then we get stuck.

00:45:12.782 --> 00:45:14.240
And then our kids
come in the room.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.948
And we bite their
heads off because we're

00:45:15.948 --> 00:45:16.960
in a bad head space.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.200
So when you can be like, OK.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.060
Well, that was a rough moment.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.030
Glad that's over.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.250
And thank God for TV, because
it's really useful sometimes.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.270
Then you're much more likely
to have a batterer intervention

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.770
next time.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:27.960
But it's tricky.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.682
Multiple kids is tricky.

00:45:29.682 --> 00:45:31.640
You can also do little
group meditation things.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.737
Like I'll get my girls together
and we do practices together.

00:45:35.737 --> 00:45:37.445
And again, this comes
back to starting it

00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:38.810
when everybody's
in a good space,

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.240
because the more you
try to just start it

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.540
when they're in a bad space,
you're setting everyone

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.000
up for failure.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.870
And then maybe boarding school.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:46.600
I don't know.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.820
That could help.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.570
Was somebody over here
who had a question?

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.349
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about siblings arguing.

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.140
CARLA NAUMBURG: It was
the sibling arguing.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:54.430
OK.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.179
So here's the thing
about sibling arguing.

00:45:56.179 --> 00:45:57.810
I am not an expert
in sibling arguing.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.435
And I did a lot of
it when I was a kid.

00:45:59.435 --> 00:46:02.330
And my girls do it now.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.720
Laura Markham has a
book-- M-A-R-K-H-A-M--

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.130
about sibling rivalry that
I've heard good stuff about.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.160
But I think that remembering
that it's normal,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.667
like some amount
of it is normal.

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:16.750
I mean, I saw some statistic
that kids get into it

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.458
with their siblings
like once every seven

00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:20.680
seconds or something.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.629
Yikes.

00:46:21.629 --> 00:46:23.920
But that it's an important
part of their socialization.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.010
Like, that's how they
learn to figure things out.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.440
And what I would say--
and this isn't necessarily

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.887
a mindfulness bit-- is
depending on how old they are

00:46:30.887 --> 00:46:33.220
and if everybody's safe, can
you just get out of the way

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.510
and encourage them
to figure it out.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.720
And one of my friends, what
she'll do is she'll say,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.928
either you guys figure it
out, or I take away the toy

00:46:38.928 --> 00:46:40.090
and you go to your room.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.810
And you give them a choice.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.360
But again, different families
have so much different stuff

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.524
going on that the sibling
stuff is really tricky.

00:46:46.524 --> 00:46:48.440
I find the other really
good trick for sibling

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.747
is make sure everybody is
fed and well-slept, which

00:46:51.747 --> 00:46:52.830
is like a good life thing.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.246
Our worst sibling fights are
in the afternoon when they're

00:46:55.246 --> 00:46:56.490
tired and they're worn out.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.692
And then I just have to
like work really hard

00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:00.150
to get them set up
in some activity

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.100
that involves relatively
little interaction,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.350
because they can't handle it.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.510
Other questions?

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.211
Thoughts?

00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:06.710
Yeah.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.230
Jessie.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.922
AUDIENCE: So thinking
about being mindful

00:47:09.922 --> 00:47:11.380
and how I would do
that in my life.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.770
I worry that time pressure
is the enemy of mindfulness,

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.270
and that a lot of times
the intense moments all

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.830
have a time pressure aspect.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.080
Like, I need to get
this done by this time,

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.960
or get over to this place.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.257
And taking a step back and
slowing down feels very hard.

00:47:28.257 --> 00:47:29.090
CARLA NAUMBURG: Yes.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:29.589
I agree.

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:31.340
And I think we can
all relate to you.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.560
And certainly you can
move fast and be mindful.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.440
There's no question.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.500
Mindfulness does not
require us to be slow,

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.880
but it's just easier.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.770
Right?

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.902
And so what I would argue
is that there are always

00:47:43.902 --> 00:47:46.360
going to be days and moments
when you just feel like you're

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.550
moving at 100 miles an hour.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.280
I think the trick is
to convince yourself

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.696
that you don't actually have
to move at 100 miles an hour.

00:47:52.696 --> 00:47:54.720
And you'll be more
effective if you don't.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.770
And my best example
is I'll get really

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.190
stressed when I'm trying to get
out the door in the morning.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:59.550
And I'm trying to make
the lunches or whatever.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.110
Although, in all fairness, Josh
make lunches most mornings.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.109
I have to give him that.

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:05.030
But when I'm trying to
get everything together

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.238
and what inevitably happens
is I drop the blueberries

00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:08.140
all over the floor.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.682
Or I've have got
everyone in the car.

00:48:09.682 --> 00:48:11.515
And I realize that I've
forgotten something.

00:48:11.515 --> 00:48:12.500
And we have to go back.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.910
And so when we can start to
convince ourselves that when

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.529
we can practice a little
bit of mindfulness,

00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:20.820
it'll actually make things
go faster and more smoothly.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.778
And when I say a little
bit, I mean, literally.

00:48:22.778 --> 00:48:25.180
Can you stop and stand and
take three deep breaths.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.279
And then ask yourself,
what do I need to do now?

00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:30.320
Or if you're staring down
the barrel of an insane

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.050
day with a ton of meetings
and all these projects,

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.716
can you stop and take
some deep breaths.

00:48:33.716 --> 00:48:36.520
And if you're a person who
likes to write things down,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.170
can you sort of make yourself
a quick list and say,

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.810
what are the things
I need to focus on?

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.750
Because when our
brains get going,

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.546
it's that forward
thinking, we get so

00:48:44.546 --> 00:48:45.920
wrapped up in
everything that has

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.211
to happen in the future, and
all the worries about what

00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:50.800
if I don't get this done,
that we end up just reacting.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.680
Like, oh, now this thing
popped in my brain,

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.680
so I'm going to do this.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.850
And then this thing
popped in my brain.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.810
So I'm going to do this.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.390
And that may not be
the most skillful way

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:58.250
to approach the day.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.780
It may be better to take
a few-- it could literally

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.550
be five minutes, which I would
argue that since most of us

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.299
aren't the President
of the United States,

00:49:05.299 --> 00:49:06.570
we actually have five minutes.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.370
We can sit down
and say, what are

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.620
the things I need to do today?

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.250
What are the most effective
ways to plan my day?

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.790
And then when stuff pops up, we
have this map in our mind of,

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:17.290
OK.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.740
But this is what I
was going to do today.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.323
And is that thing
that just popped up,

00:49:20.323 --> 00:49:23.036
is that worthy of intruding
on this space and time?

00:49:23.036 --> 00:49:24.660
And it's the same
thing with parenting.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.980
If I can go into the
afternoon with a plan,

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.430
I'm gonna give my girls a snack.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:29.580
And then we're going
to have some play time.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.920
And then I'm gonna make dinner.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.130
And then something pops up, I
can sort of make this choice.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.980
Is this the most skillful place
to put my attention right now?

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.836
And sometimes it is.

00:49:37.836 --> 00:49:40.210
Sometimes we just have to
react, especially in parenting.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.680
Like, when your kid's about
to fall down the stairs,

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.810
you've got to drop whatever
you're doing, go grab them.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.393
But more often than
not, I would argue

00:49:45.393 --> 00:49:46.890
we react when we don't need to.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:52.130
So I think small amounts
of time on a busy day

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:55.350
can make you actually be more
effective during the day.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.410
This book is on Amazon
and local bookstores.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:58.740
And then "Parenting
in the Present Moment"

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.000
is my first book,
which is really

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.370
meant more for parents who
want to practice mindfulness.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:03.850
And I just really
appreciate you all coming.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.350
Thank you.

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:08.300
[APPLAUSE]
