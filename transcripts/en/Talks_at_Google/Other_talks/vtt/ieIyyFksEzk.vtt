00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt;presenter: Lester Wunderman is a true living
legend of the advertising world.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.310
The founder of Wunderman and widely credited
as the father of modern day direct marketing.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.590
Mr. Wunderman's career began before World
War II and continues to this day.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.619
At 92 years old he still comes to the office
every day.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.880
Mr. Wunderman is the originator of the first
customer rewards card, the first toll free

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.710
800 number, amongst other innovations.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.440
The life and career of Wunderman's Chairman
Emeritus spans the most formative years of

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.059
advertising, but also bridges to this modern
era of customer engagement in a way that is

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.629
impossible to ignore.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.760
Lester was elected to the Direct Marketing
Hall of Fame in 1983.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.430
The Advertising Hall of Fame in 1998, and
was named on the twenty Advertising Legends

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.100
and Leaders by AdWeek in 1998.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.550
In addition to his many achievements in the
advertising industry, Mr. Wunderman is also

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.230
a consultant, professor, author, and accomplished
photographer.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.590
Pieces of Lester's collection can be found
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.100
So please join me in welcoming Lester Wunderman.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.590
[Applause]

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:35.930
&gt;&gt;presenter: So Lester, we are in the year
2012, obviously, but take us back to early

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.900
1950's, the world that you saw at that point,
and the opportunity that you uncovered around

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.820
this notion of direct marketing.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.810
What was going on that gave you the idea that
there was this market need that you could

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.810
fulfill?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.970
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Well, I think the first
thing I noticed as we begin to get into advertising

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.610
was that it was all about the product and
it had nothing to do with the consumer.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:22.350
There was little research, but consumers and
everything, all the media whether it be print

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.770
or radio or television there were jingles
about products and they might have been silly

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.900
little jingles, but they wanted you to remember
the name of the product.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.550
They were not trying to fit into your life;
they were trying to fit it into your memory.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.950
So I thought it was kind of a shallow practice.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:59.620
We didn't have it that easy, my brother and
I. I had a brother who is three years older;

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.900
what happened was my mother who had been widowed
for quite a long time; my father died, I told

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.510
you when I was nine and she was widowed and
he had left her; he had run a successful business

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.900
so she was left with some assets and among
them was the jewelry that he had bought her

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:33.390
during their romantic years and she says to
my brother I had a lousy job I was making

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.350
ten dollars I got raised I think ten dollars
a week as an office boy in a collection agency

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.580
and the boss called me in and said I want
to give you a raise of twenty percent, I would

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.690
make twelve dollars a week.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.380
I said to him, “Sir I understand that the
President passed that law of Minimum Wage

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.400
Act last week, but I thank you very much.”

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400
[Laughter]

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.740
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: It was no great benefit.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.599
In any event, world the was under the influence
of certain radio stars people like you may

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:20.780
or may not heard of, people like Eddie Cantor
and others who were comedians of those days.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.590
There was a newsman by the name of [inaudible]
who started his program with “Uh-huh, there's

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.520
good news tonight”, whether there was or
not.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520
[Laughter]

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.680
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: I remember he invited
down to his house in Florida to show me how

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.100
he prepared his broadcast.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.730
It was one of the more embarrassing periods
of my life because I had clients listening

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:59.600
in and I had been at the poolside before this
interview.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.790
At the poolside was this gorgeous blonde who
was drinking martinis

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.120
&gt;&gt;presenter: Uh oh.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.120
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: As nothing would have
it but then I would drink martinis with her.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.680
By the time I got to the radio station and
began to broadcast, I dropped the script.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680
[Laughter]

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.870
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: And they could here, I
mean transmitted with the sound of this script;

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.310
this paper dropping, and my scrambling to
get back up.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.870
[laughing] You know, we someone got through
that.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.220
I called the client and said how'd you like
to broadcast?

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.580
He says fine, but what was all that noise?

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.540
I said I don't know, must have been your set.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.540
[Laughter]

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.479
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: So in any event, life
back in those days was if you read the book

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:05.890
The Hucksters, which came out many years ago
it was a different world we were not organized

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:15.500
as we are now into advertising agencies now
is serious businesses and to the best of my

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.490
knowledge, I don't know anybody in our company
who drinks martinis at lunch or would or any

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.680
of our clients that would suggest it.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:35.610
I mean we're serious people going about doing
serious work and you know those days the wildness

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.850
of those days.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:53.401
I'll tell you a story, school I just won't
mention names, but I had a client in the entertainment

00:06:53.401 --> 00:07:01.360
business and their stores their people kept
going out to California and registering in

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.000
a boarding house that turned out to be a brothel.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.280
[audience laughing] So when I went out there
we had in those days we used to have planning

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.050
sessions in exotic places so we had a planning
session in Palm Springs.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.740
And I'm sitting there with our clients in
Palm Springs and a car drives up and this

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.570
kind of burly looking woman gets out and she
says I want my money and I'll give you the

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.570
book.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:44.350
So, they got terrified and they asked me would
you negotiate with this woman please.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:53.740
So it turned out she had the registration
book since she passed herself off as a rooming

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.850
house people have to register as if they were
having rooms.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:05.240
They were having women, but seems as if they
were having rooms.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:15.350
So she said for a hundred thousand dollars,
I will sell you this book.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.460
That stunned me.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.039
And at that time our treasurer was our art
director.

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:29.320
[laughing] Don't ask me why it went together,
but it did and I called him on the phone and

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.519
I said is there any way you can scrabble up
a hundred thousand dollars [audience laughing]

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:43.380
in cash and fly out here to California and
give me the cash and go home and don't ask

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.510
me any questions?

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.510
[Laughter]

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.240
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: So that's what happened.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.630
He came out, gave me a hundred thousand dollars
and flew back.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.300
And then I was to negotiate with this woman.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:07.149
So I paid her the hundred thousand dollars
and suddenly I had the book.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:13.509
I was determined not to look in that book
because I didn't want to have any information

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:19.629
that would prejudice my relationships with
my clients.

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:25.019
So I put the book in a bank vault and I told
them that this book was in a bank vault and

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:30.730
nobody was going to see it and I had not looked
at it.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.580
About three years later they called me and
said let's have a book burning.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.699
We have a celebration.

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.050
We had a party they burned the book.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.050
I never saw it.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.980
[laughing] All I saw was the binding, but
in advertising that wouldn't happen today

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.140
I mean it's just not
[Laughter]

00:09:52.140 --> 00:10:00.420
&gt;&gt;presenter: So how did you introduce the
kind of discipline this whole notion of accountability

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.339
return on investment I mean these were all
very, very new concepts at the time.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.370
How did you wrangle that?

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:15.050
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Because we were not part
of the world of advertising.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:22.489
I mean we didn't engage in the activities
that the agency world was kind of famous for

00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:29.550
in those days and written about in this book
The Hucksters, which was written back then.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:37.290
So we were serious men trying to make a living
and we had a little office down in Union Square

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:43.939
and we did everything.

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:53.579
I would go to the roof of a building and walk
down and stop at every office and try to sell

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:58.949
them whatever I could, printing, writing,
advertising, and whatever.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:03.170
And one day I got down to the eighth floor
of a building and there was a man hanging

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:11.329
out the window trying to kill himself so I
ran over grabbed him and pulled him out of

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:17.689
the window and sat on him on the floor.

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:22.850
He was kicking and screaming and yelling in
a foreign language and I didn't know what

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.100
the foreign language was.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:36.199
Finally, he calmed down and he took me into
his office and offered me a drink.

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:47.690
It turned out that he was a Russian who had
been in the Czar's court quite famously.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.459
One of the women of the court-- the nature
of the Russian Court, was that women gave

00:11:53.459 --> 00:12:02.779
men presents of unique items--and somebody
had given him, a woman had given him a bottle

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:09.620
of a skin lotion that had never been on the
market; she invented it, and she gave him

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.629
the formula for it.

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:20.509
When the revolution came in Russia, he moved
to Paris and began making this stuff, which

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:22.790
was quite popular.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:29.360
He came to New York and he couldn't sell it.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:37.069
He had this psoriasis situation where at the
time was incurable and just itched the scratch.

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:44.399
So between the fact that he couldn't sell
his skin lotion and it didn't work on him,

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:48.290
he was going to kill himself.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.029
So when I save him he said: “What can I
do for you?

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:53.610
What can I do, you saved my life?”

00:12:53.610 --> 00:13:00.170
I said to him “Give me your advertising
account.”

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.540
[Audience laughing]

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.579
&gt;&gt;presenter: True entrepreneur.

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:04.579
[Laughter]

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:11.829
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: But the world you know
getting clients we got; we got another client

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:25.639
who is a woman from the old west and she had
gone to France and married a French Nobleman,

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.690
a Count.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:33.499
This was during World War II so the Count
was busy fighting and she came back to New

00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:47.009
York and decided to start a business and she
had a patent on a turntable that was put in

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:53.649
store windows with props on top and the store
demonstrator.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:14:03.449
So she had an extraordinary advertising budget
to sell these things and of course when it

00:14:03.449 --> 00:14:09.119
came time to pay her bill there was no payment.

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:19.509
After two months of that [inaudible] we owed
media as much capital as we had.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:25.889
So I went to her apartment—she lived in
the East sixties--and I begged her I said

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:32.009
“You know we're not talking business we're
talking about food for family.

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:36.029
We're going to starve if you don't pay this
bill.”

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:41.999
I really turned it on as hard as I could so
she gave me a check.

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:42.999
Delighted.

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:48.029
I mean I was skipping like Charlie Chaplin.

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:55.430
The next day I went to the bank the teller
looked at me and says “You have another

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.430
one.”

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.980
I said “Another one of what?”

00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.999
“Bad check.”

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.019
says she.

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:08.199
That was the end of that.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.199
[Laughter]

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:15.299
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: From there we decided
that we'd better find employment-- that our

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:22.490
business ability-- business executive acumen
was not ready.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:29.720
So we went to work for another advertising
agency and from there on I pogoed from one

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:39.019
agency to another until we finally started
our own which was quite successful and then

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:42.619
merged it with Young &amp; Rubicam.

00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:44.619
Everybody wanted it.

00:15:44.619 --> 00:15:52.609
What happened is the four A's which was American
Association of Advertising Agencies rates

00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:58.170
agencies by their profitability.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.569
They sent a special inspection team over to
our office and said we don't believe that

00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:07.009
can make the kind of profit you make and provide
service as well.

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:14.819
So I said “Fine here's the list of our clients
go talk to them see if they get any service.”

00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:20.300
Well after about two weeks he came back and
he said “I want to make a special case.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.389
At the next Advertising Agency Convention
down at the Greenbrier I want to introduce

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:33.910
you as somebody who knows more about making
a profit than anybody I have yet met.”

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:44.769
So what happens up on the stage for a couple
of kids it was

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:53.379
&gt;&gt;presenter: So you manage to go from the
Russian immigrant with the skin lotion [uh

00:16:53.379 --> 00:17:01.299
huh] to one of the most profitable agencies
at the time and one of your big clients was

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:10.680
American Express [yeah] and we actually got
a copy of the original business plan that

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.310
Lester wrote actually launching the American
Express Card.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.700
It's about fifty pages.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:25.260
It is the type of work that would probably
be done by Bain or McKinsey today in terms

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:31.280
of the level of analysis the case that was
built for introducing this card.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.600
Give us the back story there.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.620
How did that all happen?

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.050
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Well the back story was
that they really didn't know what they wanted.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:46.540
They had a very strange Chief Executive Officer.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:54.520
He was not quite as sharp as the people--
there are wonderful executives under him but

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.010
he himself
[Laughter]

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:02.800
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Yeah he was the founder.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.230
So he came to us and he said I'll give you
five thousand dollars for an idea.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.200
I said what idea?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.740
He said the one you'll think of.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.020
[Audience laughter]

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:23.480
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: So he gave us five thousand
dollars and for that I made that report as

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.020
to how and why they should have a credit card
and what it should offer how they should go

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.520
about it how we would market it.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.880
The whole report as you saw and that was the
five thousand dollars.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:47.170
In addition they were—Ogilvy and Mather
was their agency and still is.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:53.910
With very close ties in there and no other
agency could get in.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:02.550
But finally as a result of what we had done
they made us their second agency and we began

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:09.510
to get to share with Ogilvy and Mather projects.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:16.260
As a result I got to know David pretty well
because David took care of American Express

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.260
himself.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:25.660
By and large he had a woman named Shelly Lazarus
who worked under him, but he was really in

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.330
charge of that account.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.020
He was a charmer, he really was.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.350
&gt;&gt;presenter: So the charge card for American
Express and then there was another invention

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.690
of yours which is the 800 number.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:53.970
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Well we wanted what happened
was we were missing—The most lively media

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.570
of that period was radio and television.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.930
And the greater audiences that had supported
the magazines such as The Saturday Evening

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:16.110
Post or [inaudible] or Life Magazine which
had seven million circulation were being distressed

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:22.144
by the fact that radio and television were
becoming so important to the American family

00:20:22.144 --> 00:20:29.610
and to the American advertiser.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:44.530
So we began to look into how we could get
clients who would use that media and those

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:54.970
media and clients never been-- I mean all
the clients we had suddenly ended up I invented

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.150
something that became classic.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:10.310
The 800 number was a way of responding to
an advertisement at the cost to the advertiser.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:19.600
So that if they asked you on the commercial
to buy the product or to get some information

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:30.100
the charge was made against the advertisers
cost, not the consumer's cost.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:36.580
So from that-- but there was no telephone
access.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:42.970
What happened you know radio commercial and
television were just so snappy so fast thirty

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:49.170
seconds some of them even twenty or ten seconds.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:55.910
It was over in a minute and you want to answer
it because that's offered you something that

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.650
you'd like to have.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:07.190
Well, to drag out a piece of paper or envelope
and see if you have a postage stamp as do--

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.300
most people got lost in that process.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:29.250
So we thought why not you have a form of mail
that would be charged to the average us and

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:39.870
so we developed what's called 800-number and
when people could freely call a telephone

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:54.940
representative or a company's telephone room
and charge what they want to get.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:04.140
And the 800 number that became like free phone
what they called in Europe “free phone”

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:13.860
and we invented it and we used it and suddenly
budgets were do so much larger because we

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.800
could now use through the major media that
we couldn't use before.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.320
So that was the 800 number.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:31.840
Also we invented-- nobody had ever done this
we invented an operator who we put on television.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:40.810
She came into the commercial when the urge
to call was made and she introduced herself

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:49.260
my name is Peggy [mumbling] whatever her name
was and I'm here and when you call this number

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.320
it’s likely I who will answer the phone
and I look forward to your call.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.470
That had never happened before.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:04.340
The 800 number kind of a mystery you know
didn't know who you were going to get.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.870
Suddenly, this friendly young woman she wouldn't
do anything bad to me.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.870
[Laughter]

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:14.000
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Anyway, I want to talk
to her…Oh I know her name was Judy.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.650
&gt;&gt;presenter: Judy, Peggy.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.490
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: It was Judy.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.130
I mean we named her Judy.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.130
[Laughter]

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.920
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: “Call Judy”.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:35.650
And Judy was a Connecticut housewife who had
had some experience in broadcast and she became

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:41.381
famous because there she was at the end of
the commercials saying: “This is Judy and

00:24:41.381 --> 00:24:49.240
here's my number and if you call me I'll make
sure that you get what you're ordering.”

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.380
That had never happened before there was never
a phone number that had a live person; it

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.170
was always just, 800-number.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.170
&gt;&gt;presenter: Right.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.390
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: So that's changed things.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.390
Very successful.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:06.000
&gt;&gt;presenter: And even with just coming up
with that kind of innovation what was the

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.310
process internally?

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:14.870
Was it just troubleshooting, looking at things
that were working, weren't working, research?

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.080
How did you get to those?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.760
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: I studied and taught creative
thinking.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.050
I studied at Columbia.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.900
They had courses in creative thinking and
it was a new school they had a course in creative

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900
thinking.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:41.080
I also studied at NYU where they had courses
in marketing pretty good courses at the downtown

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:52.840
school, but I learned--oh and also I became
a member of the American Theater wing practicing

00:25:52.840 --> 00:26:01.980
to be an actor, but what I learned American
Theatre wing was stage craft and how you get

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.950
an audience involved.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:13.800
So I educated myself and you know I was a
kid born in the Bronx whose father died at

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.610
nine and I was a very bright student.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.120
I was two years ahead of my age group.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.120
&gt;&gt;presenter: Skipping.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.180
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Skipping yeah.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:34.480
So, so you know I always had I always realized
that imagination could solve problems that

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.200
the systemic ideas might not.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.910
There were new ways and better ways to do
things.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:53.400
And since I was not part of the establishment
in any way I had to find ways of doing things

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.780
that were better, more impressive.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:07.250
So we can get clients because of the unique
ideas we had because we couldn't compete with

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.970
the big agencies.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.120
&gt;&gt;presenter: Fantastic.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.810
So in your talk at MIT you said advertising
must not only sell the consumer on the idea

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:22.000
of trying the product but it must cause him
to continue buying it as well.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.740
So by this standard how would you rate today's
advertising?

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.140
What are people doing well?

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.320
What could they be doing better?

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.920
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Bad.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920
[Laughter]

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.740
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: There is no and this is
something I wish in my lifetime I could get

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.740
done.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.950
Nobody thinks of lifetime values.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:53.330
Nobody thinks that a customer has a lifetime
value and therefore you can invest against

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.970
that lifetime value not invest against or
bank that they’ll try your products.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:04.640
So the budgets can be multiplied for that
purpose if you're good enough to get people

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.950
to try and continue to use your product.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.080
Now, it’s a mess today.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.120
The advertisers only want you to go to the
supermarket that they get instead of the competition.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:26.240
They have-- I never heard anybody extending
forward the idea that this product and your

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.070
use of it would do some good.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:40.770
For example your own business, Google, supposing
I have a wallet… and supposing they have

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.800
a wallet until retiring at the age of 65.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:53.210
If they have spent a lot of money on their
wallets should they be rewarded when they

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.180
no longer have income?

00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:01.420
Could you set aside a portion of their revenue
to do so.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.670
I don’t know if it’s practical.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:12.310
But that's the system of thinking that, that
if you want people to use your product continuously

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:17.210
you have to make investments and give advantages
for that happening.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:24.260
And American marketers do not do any anything
of that kind.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:33.190
Ford Motor Company, our client, for example,
doesn't incent you to buy five cars in your

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.690
lifetime or six and maybe they give you the
seventh one.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:42.480
I mean there's just no conversation of that
kind and there ought to be.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:55.460
And I think what ought to come next in advertising,
consumer benefit is that you have a period

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:04.480
in life which is gainful for your earning
and during that period you're as comfortable

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.050
as that earning makes you.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:14.910
Then you come to a point where you get Social
Security which is far less than your wage

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.760
was.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.600
You may have a pension which will be far less
than your wage was.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:29.890
So your center of living dips.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:37.870
Something has to be done to recognize the
fact that for thirty or forty or fifty years

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:46.550
I have contributed to this economy and the
companies, and if I was loyal to certain of

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:53.850
them and I made great profits for them, at
a point that I become needy, they should find

00:30:53.850 --> 00:31:03.120
some way of repaying me with something.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:10.770
And I think that's just a step that may happen
because loyalty, I mean repurchase is all

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.400
that makes a profit.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.040
What makes a profit is if somebody buys a
brand and continues to buy it they're profitable.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:26.270
I don't see money spent against loyalty and
there should be.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:34.840
&gt;&gt;presenter: So staying on that theme of advertising
today and the problems that you've outlined

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:42.860
there've obviously been lots of innovations
still and we have Google and all of the innovation

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:48.410
that this organization has made in the advertising
and technology media world.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:52.570
You have the Facebooks of the world, Twitter,
all of these new things.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:32:00.010
Give us your take on how you see them impacting
marketing, advertising, consumer value, all

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.000
of the things you've just talked about.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.470
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Well, in creating all
these companies you mentioned they're creating

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.830
groups.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:29.429
It's kind of a loyalty program creating groups
that have in common the use of a product or

00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:34.900
service and people like to know people who
do what they do.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:43.290
And I think with media such as the internet
and what will happen beyond the currents state

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:53.490
of such a digital communication which things
will happen I mean, it’s not over, that

00:32:53.490 --> 00:33:00.670
they would get into these companies will realize
that they are investing against a lifetime

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:07.440
value of the customer and not investing against
the trial sale.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:15.070
And when that happens the budgets will increase,
the language will change, the offerings and

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:20.870
methods of sale change, and it's also true
of a retailer.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:30.720
If a retailer signs up somebody who will continue
some product, the retailer should benefit.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:38.470
In other words, you should have a subscription
idea that penetrates the whole distribution

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:46.980
marketplace and communications so that people
incented to stay with the brand, stay with

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.790
the product, and are advantaged by doing so.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.559
It will happen.

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:59.860
I mean, I’m gonna try to make it happen.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.860
[Laughter]

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.710
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: You know, but Google I
think could also have a point in that kind

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.480
of a world.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.300
I mean you know you're set up for it.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.440
That's all.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440
[Laughter]

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:21.929
&gt;&gt;presenter: So I do want to open up the mics
and invite questions from the audience and

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:32.849
while you guys are getting your questions
in line just a bit of a shift in terms of

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:35.099
your other interests.

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:40.999
Because not only are you a pioneer in the
advertising space but you're also an accomplished

00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:45.710
photographer, your work is shown in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.059
What holds the most important place in your
heart these days?

00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:51.940
Do you focus on photography?

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.929
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: I studied photography
at several institutions.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:04.819
There was a thing known as the Photo League
in the old days we'd go study.

00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:11.630
I studied at NYU, I studied at Columbia, and
then I studied with a couple of very important

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.630
photographers.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:23.390
It's a serious aesthetic and I find it a very
satisfying activity not just what you take

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:29.869
but what you make of what you take is that
one image that you showed what you can do

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:38.920
today digitally that you can modify images
so that you are much like a Picasso.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:46.160
Picasso has a model, uh, you don’t end up,
he doesn’t end up painting that model realistically

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.680
as the older more ancient painters did.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.210
He's not trying to show that he can be photographic.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:36:01.329
He's trying to show all the ins and outs of
that person's personality and features and

00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:07.829
I think we're beginning to be able to do that
digitally with images.

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:14.359
So if you look, would look at my images you'll
see all the photographs that I've taken in

00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:15.769
many parts of the world.

00:36:15.769 --> 00:36:21.329
I traveled a lot because our company is so
widespread.

00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:28.220
And I have them on my computer and there are
so many software systems now that you can

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:35.089
use either alone or in combination to make
a photo that is yours.

00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:42.940
It's not the object you photographed it's
the object in your mind, which a lot of painters

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.940
do.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.161
So that's what I'm doing.

00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:52.809
The other think I'm doing is I'm writing two
books at the moment.

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:56.910
As you can imagine I'm always restless.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.950
[Laughter]

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.039
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:01.089
[Laughter]

00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:08.400
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Age so far…who was it?

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:17.099
Blake who wrote rage, rage, rage at the passing
of the sun?

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:22.069
But I don't rage, rage, rage.

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:23.069
I create, create, create.

00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:38.380
I think one way to offset your physical decay
as you age is to have mental and imaginative

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.380
growth.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.380
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:49.329
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: And I think this opportunity
should be opened up so all senior citizens

00:37:49.329 --> 00:37:53.970
that they have something to say, they have
things they saw, they have things they know

00:37:53.970 --> 00:38:06.140
and society is made up of a kind of folklore
created by the common action and do I'm doing

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:16.640
it myself and it's being distributed and I
have worked in thirteen museums.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:22.799
You know, I've got one book published and
now I'm going to have two more.

00:38:22.799 --> 00:38:26.799
So I like where I am.

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:31.069
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's obviously sage wisdom
and advice.

00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:35.319
I think that another thing that the group
would probably be interested in hearing from

00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:45.759
your around is we are challenged every day
by clients and agencies to help them reinvent

00:38:45.759 --> 00:38:49.650
transform in the context of this new world.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:56.710
They're looking to us for advice similar to
the advice that your clients have been soliciting

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.970
from you for some time.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:07.200
What advice would you give us in terms of
being better partners, better thinkers, better

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.380
collaborators with our clients?

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.749
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Listen, you are amazing.

00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:25.240
You're a relatively new company and you're
well known, well established I think considering

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.489
the period of time that you've been doing
this.

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:32.880
You've made great strides.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.400
And ideas come from ideas.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.519
I think you'll find within your organization
you don't even have to go outside that will

00:39:42.519 --> 00:39:44.489
help in any way.

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:52.650
You can if you want, but I think within your
group there are probably enough imaginations

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:56.130
if they’re encouraged to be creative.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:05.599
I used to run when brainstorming became the
word.

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:09.670
That's among the things I've learned-- went
to Columbia to learn--was brainstorming.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:19.529
You take the thought and convert it into an
idea and then the group keeps marinating until

00:40:19.529 --> 00:40:23.930
something shows up.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:30.539
And you can do that with I did it our company
did it I had a round table and I won't do

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:40.119
it anymore because we have creative assets
and I'm not that's not my job anymore, but

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:53.640
I think that you can get a lot of excitement
and innovation out of your own people if you

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.339
listen to them.

00:40:57.339 --> 00:41:07.769
Everybody has ideas and I think that that's
the thing that should be known.

00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:15.619
It isn’t just people like myself who are
creative people.

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:19.569
Everybody is capable of having an idea.

00:41:19.569 --> 00:41:20.569
We tested it.

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:27.070
We used to do brainstorming, for example one
of things at Columbia they had us do.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:32.239
They'd say how many uses could you find for
a brick?

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:42.200
Suddenly, the class would get involved, maybe
with a hundred uses for a brick.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:56.819
You know a brick could keep a car from rolling
downhill or also a brick could become an obstacle.

00:41:56.819 --> 00:42:06.540
Also some other things bricks could do I think
in your own group you form circles of ideas.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.250
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.250
Great.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.250
So we have a question, yes.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.250
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.630
Can you hear me?

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.630
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.960
Female #1: So you said before for that when
you all started you were kind of outside of

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.539
the establishment and that helped you be more
imaginative, more creative with your ideas

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:28.259
and I was wondering as you all got you know
more established and you got more clients

00:42:28.259 --> 00:42:33.549
how did you bring that kind of discomfort
back in that sense of being outside of the

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:35.450
establishment back to your team?

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.069
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: I didn't get it.

00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:42.710
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, do you just want to repeat
it maybe a little louder?

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:49.089
female #1: So when you started you said that
being outside of the establishment kind of

00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:54.839
gave you a sense of urgency to think imaginatively
and kind of come up with ideas that were outside

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:56.910
of what was currently being thought of.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:02.999
How did you kind of recreate that urgency
and that sense of outside of the mainstream

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:08.400
when you started getting more clients and
kind of became part of the establishment?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:18.339
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: It becomes a tradition
in a company you know you can't let a company

00:43:18.339 --> 00:43:30.750
grow stale and you try to if you're an executive
group and the company has a certain dynamic

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:35.559
you try to keep feeding it and encouraging
it.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:43.609
And I think it's not just up to the people
who are creating the ideas it's up to those

00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:52.720
who are responsible for them to encourage
everybody and the company not to make jobs

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.359
and “You’re a clerk and you’re a thinker
and you’re a…whatever” you know.

00:43:58.359 --> 00:44:05.599
I think everybody, everybody-- I'm sure if
we took another half hour that and ask this

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:08.750
group to create some ideas on a subject you’d
get a hundred of them.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:18.069
So if you don't ask for it you don't get it,
but if you don't encourage if you don't get

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:19.069
it.

00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:22.579
You know that's the way it goes.

00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:24.099
Good companies do that.

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:28.400
They become idea, idea companies.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.119
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes.

00:44:30.119 --> 00:44:31.119
Yes.

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:32.700
&gt;&gt;presenter: Carley…

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.479
&gt;&gt;female#2: Mr. Wunderman, I'm curious to
know your opinions on political advertising

00:44:37.479 --> 00:44:42.849
and how political advertising has evolved
from what you've seen throughout your career

00:44:42.849 --> 00:44:48.670
and now today with so many different candidates
using digital to raise money and spread their

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.990
message and their brand.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:59.499
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Well you know it's simply
a soapbox [laugh], an electronic soapbox.

00:44:59.499 --> 00:45:06.729
I mean the tradition of a candidate standing
on a street corner and talking to his constituents

00:45:06.729 --> 00:45:13.910
or other constituents goes back as long as
we know politics.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:21.970
The fact that we have, uh, mass methods of
communication… they've taken that up and

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.339
I think it's a good idea.

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:29.690
I think we learn more about these candidates.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:40.710
I remember the first one who did it was Franklin
Roosevelt who was President in my time—1932--and

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:52.010
he had his Fireside Chats and he had nothing
he had no political objective with his Fireside

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.010
Chats.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:46:02.180
He just wanted people to feel that this was
a nation that acted together and could have

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.819
richer and better lives if they thought about
it in a certain way.

00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:08.279
&gt;&gt;presenter: Great.

00:46:08.279 --> 00:46:10.470
&gt;&gt;female#2: Thank you.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.660
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:18.739
Any other questions from the audience?

00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:26.259
Well Lester, on behalf of Google everyone
here thank you so much for taking the time

00:46:26.259 --> 00:46:27.259
to spend with us.

00:46:27.259 --> 00:46:28.259
This has been fantastic.

00:46:28.259 --> 00:46:29.259
&gt;&gt;Lester Wunderman: Not at all.

00:46:29.259 --> 00:46:29.260
[Applause]
