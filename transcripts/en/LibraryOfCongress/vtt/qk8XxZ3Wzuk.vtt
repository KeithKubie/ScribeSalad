00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.246
&gt;&gt; So I'm here to introduce a man
who has the unusual distinction

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.706
of having made a career of failure

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.760
and a very successful
career at that.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.623
Professor Henry Petroski's
academic expertise is

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.583
in what's called failure
analysis, the process of collecting

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.163
and analyzing data to determine
what caused something to go wrong,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420
which is one of the things
that first drew me to his work.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.586
Nine years ago this month
after two planes flew

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.220
into the World Trade Center
and a third into the Pentagon,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.740
I telephoned professor Petroski
from the post offices and asked him

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.023
about what had just happened.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.326
What about those structures
had worked

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.326
and what had failed,
I wanted to know.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.816
And what could we learn from that.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.063
The following week in the Sunday
Outlook section of the Post he wrote

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.230
from an engineer's perspective about
the impact at two different sites

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.500
in two different cities, one with
its buildings arranged vertically

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.906
in celebration of America's
towering supremacy,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.056
the other horizontally crouched
symbolically in defense.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.616
And he wrote about the effect
those disasters might have

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.790
on the future of building design.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.513
With characteristic
for-site, he wrote,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.980
the Pentagon will likely be restored

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.306
to it's full geometry long before
any decision is made about what

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.320
to do with the land on which
the World Trade Center stood.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.796
The ability to breathe interest
into the objects that surround us

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.453
from great engineering feats
of our age like the Twin Towers

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.680
to the most mundane of
objects, memorably the pencil

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.186
and the toothpick, has
characterized Petroski's work.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.306
He's a prolific writer, the
author of 15 popular books as well

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.820
as numerous articles and reviews,
some of which we've run in the Post.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.666
Last year a particularly provocative
article ran under the headline,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.680
want engineer real change,
don't ask a scientist.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.230
Most people who aren't scientists or
engineers seem to think that science

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.753
and engineering are the
same thing, he wrote.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
They're not.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.906
Science seeks to understand
the world as it is.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.066
Only engineering can change it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.266
And that's what his new book The
Essential Engineer is all about,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.540
the role that engineering and not
science can play in responding

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.100
to the great global threats
we face from climate change

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230
to producing clean
and renewable energy.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.326
He even suggests that
science can sometimes get

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.113
in the way of technological change.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.776
I'm going to invite him
to tell us how and why.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.560
Henry Petroski has been widely
recognized for his academic

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.070
and literary accomplishments,
not only in his own field

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.106
of civil engineering, but
also through fellowships

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.793
in several gust bodies as
the American Academy of Arts

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.420
and Sciences and the American
Philosophical Society.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.123
He's the Aleksander Vesic professor
of civil engineering and a professor

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.550
of history at Duke University and
the author most recently, as I said,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.163
of The Essential Engineer.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.603
And here is the essential
engineer professor Henry Petroski.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.510
[ Clapping ]

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.596
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Francis.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.396
That was a very nice introduction.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.730
It's a pleasure and
an honor to be here.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.500
And I've been enjoying the day even
though it is a little warm for me.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.416
Francis made a very
good summary of my book.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.766
And I'd like to elaborate on
some of the things that she said.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.390
There is, I think, an incomplete
understanding of the difference

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.053
between science and engineering,
between scientists and engineers.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.073
It's sometimes reflected
in the mass media

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.210
where engineers are just
grouped with scientists.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.823
This is not absolutely speaking
incorrect, but it loses some

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.596
of the fine distinctions
between the two professions.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.490
During the space race
back in the late '50s

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.453
and early '60s there was a
great need to develop a lot

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.326
of different rockets to achieve
what we wanted to achieve then

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.613
in our battle or competition
with the Soviet Union.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.550
So it was news on a regular basis
to report on whether test firings

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.916
of rockets were successes
or failures.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.763
When they were successes,
the headlines often read,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.193
science achieves new record
of thrust or some such thing,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.006
attributing the success to science
and by implication to scientists.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.126
When there was a failure,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.533
when a rocket failed to
ignite, it was a dud.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.920
Or when a rocket did begin to
take off, but then went astray,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.866
the headlines more often than
not read something to the effect

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.383
that latest rocket test,
great engineering failure.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.480
And engineers, obviously
me included,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.000
really tell that story
over and over again.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.686
And they think it summarizes the
difference in the way scientists

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.643
and engineers are treated.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.910
It has a lot of implications
not only for how they're treated

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.313
or how they're perceived
to be treated,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.626
but also the status
that they're held in.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.226
And this book that has just
been published is largely

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.953
about issues like that.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.553
The fact of the matter
is, as Francis indicated,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.456
there are distinctions between
scientists and engineers.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.056
And the general way these
distinctions are framed is to say

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.783
that scientists study what is
originally the given universe.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.190
Scientists are interested
in the planets, the stars,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.706
the origins of the universe,
how old is the universe.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.986
Questions like that are truly
scientific questions, but,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.436
of course, scientists have also
been interested in what are the laws

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.310
of physics, what are
the laws of nature.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.330
They look not only to the cosmos,
but also down into the atomic level.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.463
And, generally speaking,
the principle objective

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.753
of science is knowledge,
understanding, facts, measurements.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.336
Engineering, on the other hand,
as again Francis indicated,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.243
seeks to change the world.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.810
Engineers, the profession
of engineering would

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.640
like to develop better systems of
air conditioning tents in hot summer

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.590
or I guess we're in the Fall now.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.780
And I guess they get
a lot of support

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.960
from that judging from
that response.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.560
But historically there has been a
lot of engineering that was done,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.593
believe it or not, without much
of a contribution from science.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.516
It's a fallacy and it's a
very significant fallacy

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.640
that you take the results of science
and you just do something to them

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.023
and then you get engineering.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.706
In realty it doesn't
work quite that easily.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.333
This is sometimes called
the linear model,

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.716
that you make scientific discoveries
and then by some process,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.343
which is seldom really
elaborated upon,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.193
there comes an engineering outcome.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.173
And, again, it's like the
attribution of the successes

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.760
to the science and the
failures to the engineers.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.160
In the history of science, history
of technology there are a lot

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.440
of very, I think, convincing
examples

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.653
that it just isn't so simple.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.063
The steam engine, for example, was
developed in the late 17th century

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.493
for a very practical purpose.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.293
And this is characteristic
of engineering.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.693
There's a purpose to what engineers
do, not just to understand,

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.510
but to produce something,
to accomplish an invention

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.183
or a new development in technology.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.893
And in the late 17
century the purpose was

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.080
to pump water out of mines.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.213
It was hard to mine coal if the
coal mine was full of water.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.316
So the steam engine had that and
only that purpose originally.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.836
Throughout the 18th
century it was developed

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.630
to be a much more versatile machine.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.593
And, of course, when we
get to the 19th century,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.626
the steam engine was put on
wheels and the wheels put

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.053
on tracks, and we had the railroad.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:15.813
So this steam engine,
which is symbolic

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.073
of the whole industrial revolution,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.873
really revolutionized the way we
not only experienced transportation,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.423
but also by extension how we
experience society and culture.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.563
It was only after really the
railroads had gotten started

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.313
that scientists seriously began
to look at the steam engine,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.923
because now it was
something that existed.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.383
It could be an object of
study in its own right.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.350
And it was out of that
came a science

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.576
that we call thermodynamics
or the notion of heat.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.840
The fact of the matter is that
the steam engine was developed

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.953
with virtually no science.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:00.643
Another, I think, very persuasive
example is what the Wright Brothers

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.650
tried to achieve, mainly
powered flight.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.126
The Wright Brothers recognized
when they were trying to design

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.656
and build their flying
machine that they had

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.540
to know somehow what shape
to make the propeller.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.103
What would be the actual
curve of the propeller?

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.370
And, also, the wings were important,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.183
but the propeller particularly
vexed them.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.500
They even wrote to the Smithsonian
Institution here in the mall asking

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.800
for scientific results that would
help them develop an airplane.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.166
Well, the answer they got back was

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.966
that there was a piosity
of really information.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.260
And what did the Wright Brothers do?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.270
Well, they didn't say, well we
can't go on and do engineering

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.483
because we haven't done
the scientific foundations.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.763
They proceeded to do it themselves.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.033
The Wright Brothers experimented
with different shapes and came

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.320
up with the shape of the
propeller that they use.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.083
In engineering you don't have
to have the perfect answer.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.626
You have to have an
answer that works.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.460
And when they achieved
that, they were satisfied,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.446
because they had a lot of
other things to do, too.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:16.880
So the airplane, which again
revolutionized transportation

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.800
in the 20th century this time, was a
truly -- an engineering achievement.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.273
The engineers welcomed all
the science they could get,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:29.916
but there just wasn't
much in the beginning.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.893
It was only after the airplane
was demonstrated to be effective

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.686
that true aerodynamics,
the science was developed.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.373
Now, so what this suggests, this
little story, is that engineering

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.070
and science may be separate,
but there are overlaps.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.833
And, furthermore, engineers
could actually do science.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.840
And they often have to
in order to proceed,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.390
in order to achieve their objective.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.693
Because when you're trying
to develop something,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.190
whether it be a steam
engine or a flying machine,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.130
you evidently reach a
point in your pursuit

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.250
where you just don't know enough.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.043
So you do have to get
some more knowledge.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:15.573
But, generally speaking,
it's of such a practical kind

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.293
that it hasn't interested
science, and the engineers have

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.333
to do the science themselves.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.563
Scientists also can
and do engineering.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.376
Some people argue that a lot

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.730
of modern science especially
really wouldn't be getting very far

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.663
if it weren't for the engineering
that produces the machines

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.956
and the devices that
accelerate particles

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.816
to unheard of speeds and energies.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.526
But let me tell a little
story about Albert Einstein.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.746
Nobody will deny that he was
a scientist of the first rank.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.193
It's generally known that
Albert Einstein worked

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.113
in the patent office
when he was young.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.173
It's less generally known
that the reason he did

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.980
that is he couldn't get an
academic job as a scientist.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.360
But he eventually, of course,
did publish significant papers.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.713
He published them while he was
working in the patent office.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.746
And those brought him
all sorts of recognition.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.610
But publishing papers in science is
reporting on, you know, the facts,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.013
the knowledge that has been
learned by the experiments

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.543
or the program that was pursued.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.676
But what's less widely known
about Albert Einstein is

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.546
that he was also interested
in invention.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.100
He was not only interested
in it through his work

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.466
at the patent office, but he was
interested in inventing himself.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.026
And he was interested
not only in inventing,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.866
but also patenting his inventions
and patenting his inventions

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.096
because he was interested in
profiting from his inventions.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.650
And this is also a
characteristic of engineering.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.263
Sometimes it's very difficult to
separate invention from engineering.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:10.943
Back in the 1920s after Albert
Einstein had earned his Nobel Prize

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.763
or won his Nobel Prize, one
of the big practical problems

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:19.806
that the world faced was
with electric refrigerators.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.506
They were new at the time,
but they had one big fault

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.660
or flaw -- well, actually two.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.736
They had motors and they had
compressors, but they were noisy.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.936
So refrigerators were noisy.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:37.286
That was one thing, but that's
something you can live with.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.513
There was a more deadly
problem with refrigerators.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And that was that all the noise,
all the vibration associated

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.313
with the motor and the
compressor shook up the system,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.433
and it developed cracks,
and it developed leaks.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.460
And that meant that the refrigerant
was being used could escape.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.106
At the time the refrigerant that
was being used was poisonous.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.040
So if a refrigerator sprung a
leak in the middle of the night

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.140
and a family was sleeping
and it wasn't detected,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.893
then there would be a real tragedy.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.413
And there were many newspaper
stories reporting on such tragedies.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.810
Einstein read one of
these, so the story goes.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.616
And he and his colleague
Leo Szilard, who had a pact,

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.190
a formal pact about inventing,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.466
and that anything they
invented together,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.010
they would have an
understanding of how the proceeds

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.756
of licensing the patent
would be divided.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.356
They invented and patented in
several countries a refrigerator

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:53.960
that didn't have a motor,
didn't need a motor.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.813
They used the principles of
thermodynamics to figure out how

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.900
to get this refrigerant, of course,
through the system and condense

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.626
and do whatever it had to do to
exchange heat without a motor.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.906
And we would probably
have those kinds

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.593
of refrigerators today had
it not been for the fact

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.420
that at the same time the
refrigerator manufacturers

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:19.883
like say General Electric
figured out another alternative

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.743
to this deadly refrigerant problem.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.743
And that was develop a new
refrigerant that isn't poisonous.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.950
And that ended up being freon.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.403
So the refrigerator companies were
introducing freon at the same time

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.443
that Einstein and Szilard were
trying to promote their machine.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.750
And by simply changing the
refrigerant, that was a lot better

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.810
and more profitable for the
companies than Einstein's invention.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.160
And so that was sort
of lost in history.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.876
There is a serious scientist
doing serious science

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.610
who could also do engineering.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.810
And that shows to me that there's
plenty of room for cooperation

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.640
between and among scientists
and engineers.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.163
In fact, we hear the term
research and development a lot.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:15.496
Research and development
roughly to a lot

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.650
of people means science
and engineering.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.756
Too often it means that the research
is done and then it's handed

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.373
over to the development people
and there isn't the interaction.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.156
So a lot of research and
development programs are not

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.750
as efficient as they might be.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:37.960
These things are very
important in the present time,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.973
because we hear a lot
about innovation.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.083
The country needs a lot of
innovation, which is equated roughly

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.793
with invention, but it's
going beyond invention.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.836
It's going not just getting the
patent, but also commercializing it,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.763
something that Einstein and
Szilard were not able to achieve

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.363
because of the circumstances of the
times in which they were working.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.396
But innovation brings new
industries, brings new ways

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.076
of life literally and also
enables things to be achieved

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.046
that might not otherwise.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:17.486
But how do you achieve innovation?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.120
Well, if you listen to
some of the politicians

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.666
in Washington here these
days, you achieve innovation

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.116
by throwing a lot of
money at science.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.660
And just call up on Google, you
know, these stories reporting

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.783
on strategies to improve the
innovation in our country

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.056
so that we can improve the
economy and, therefore,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.983
have a greater employment and
so forth in new industries.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.810
It's not associated
with engineering.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.423
It's associated with science.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.090
I think this is a short-sighted
view.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.566
And I think it really fails to
appreciate the lessons of history.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.433
And I think unless there is a
more widespread understanding,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.146
especially among those who write
the laws and vote on the laws

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.076
and are involved with public policy,
we're not going to see the kind

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.036
of innovation that we all really
want, including the politicians.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.636
So coming around to where
I started, it shows I think

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.380
that if we really want to get
engineers and scientists together,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.643
we have to stop separating
them in newspaper headlines

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.776
or in political speeches
or in political policies.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.493
We have to be serious
that we recognize

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.516
that engineering is a very
important contributor to innovation

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.323
and to the way things are
done and will be done.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.026
Let me just say one more
thing, one more anecdote,

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.756
and that has to do
with the steamship.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.466
A lot of these stories have to do
with transportation and, you know,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.276
consumer stuff, because
that's so important.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.066
That's where innovation
is really going to happen.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.566
In the early 19th century
steamboats were popular.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.643
And they were mostly
on rivers, though.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.813
And one of the reasons was it was
generally the case that these boats

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.326
that ran on steam that had steam
engines had to refuel regularly.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.676
So they had to be close
to a source of fuel,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.783
coal or wood or whatever they burn.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.400
And, of course, if you're
near the coast or on a river,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.900
that generally is not
too hard to do.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.606
But the question was, what
about transatlantic shipping?

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.333
What about the sailing ships that
would come over from say England

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.820
over to Boston or New York?

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.216
Could you build a steamship that
could carry enough coal, let's say,

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.036
to make that voyage without
depending on sail at all?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.030
That was a key question.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.813
Now, that was very important,
because without considering that,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.780
we would not have today what
we call scheduled shipping

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.263
or scheduled crossings.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.383
Because before the steam engine was
applied to ships, relying totally

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.893
on the wind meant that you
relied totally on the weather.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.500
And sometimes the wind blew
and sometimes it didn't.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.573
That meant that if a ship left
say Liverpool and was heading

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.166
for Boston, you didn't know
when it was going to get there.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.453
It could be two weeks or
it could be two months.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.466
So you couldn't promise people
in Boston that there's going

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.600
to be a return trip to Liverpool.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.133
You just didn't know when.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.953
But with the steam engine, if you
were driving the ship regardless

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.320
of the weather, then you
could have scheduled shipping.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.493
So it was truly a revolution.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.663
Well, the scientists of the time --

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.810
I won't say "the," but some
scientists of the time said

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:01.856
that it was physically impossible,
it was against the laws of nature

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.090
that a ship large enough to carry
its own coal could be designed

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.130
and built.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.033
They believed and they maintained
and they lectured on the fact

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:14.626
that the larger you make the ship,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.760
the more coal you needed
to drive it.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.060
And therefore, you know, you
just have endless growth of ship

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.446
without achieving your goal.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.256
Well, engineers in the
1830s thought otherwise.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.273
And they reasoned differently
from the laws of nature,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.000
but the bottom line is that they
built steamships that did cross

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.053
under steam and carried
enough coal to do it.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.783
And, in fact, later
they expanded that,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:48.966
but that would be another story for
another time, because I did want

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.620
to allow some time for questions.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.716
But just a few closing remarks,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.226
and that is that this is what
the essential engineer is about.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.266
And the subtitle is why
science alone will not solve our

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.606
global problems.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.806
We need not only science,
but we need engineering.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.820
We need a true partnership
between them.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.686
And we need a recognition that there
is an equal status of engineers

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.333
and scientists in that they
contribute differently,

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.380
but they both contribute
to the objective end,

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.163
which is to effectively
innovate and change the world.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.833
Well, thanks very much
for your attention.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.600
And I would be very happy
to answer questions.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600
[ Clapping ]

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.106
&gt;&gt; Start over here on the left.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.850
&gt;&gt; Yes. I'd like your response to
the conundrum and the controversy

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.723
about the collapse of three,
not two, but three towers

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.806
at the eastern end of Manhattan
eleven years ago this month

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.573
as if they were the products
of planned demolition.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.860
Not only were these two towers --

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.066
two of these towers struck
by airplanes, in addition,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.720
at least one other, another building
as tall as either of the twin towers

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.636
in this planet and
damaged as much as either

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.450
of the twin towers withstood
the shock and remained standing.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.180
What are civil engineers
saying about this controversy?

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.806
&gt;&gt; You're talking about
I believe what is known

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:31.590
as World Trade Center Seven, a
building that was hit by some debris

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.796
and caught on fire and burned
essentially almost overnight,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.016
as I recall, and eventually
did collapse.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.203
The fact of the matter is that there
was so much attention being paid

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.613
to the World Trade Center towers
proper, World Trade Center Tower one

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.560
and two, which were much taller
than that World Trade Center seven,

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.950
by a factor of roughly two,
that that was not a big issue,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.966
because people had been
evacuated from that.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.640
And there was just
not the same concern.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.333
But there are conspiracy
theories about the fall --

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.496
about the -- what did you call it?

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.586
Controlled demolition.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.340
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.750
&gt;&gt; I think generally civil
engineers, structural engineers

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.596
in particular don't subscribe
to those conspiracy theories.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.030
They believe, generally speaking,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.656
that all three towers collapsed
largely due to two factors.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.653
One was that by the planes striking

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.750
or the debris striking
these structures,

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.563
certain key structural
elements were damaged, columns.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.226
If you take one of these poles
out from under this tent,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.086
you don't expect the
tent to be as strong

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.086
as it is with all of its poles.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.380
And that, secondly,
as the fires burned,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.470
they naturally generated heat.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.313
And the heat, if you heat
up these columns here,

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.093
they appear to be metal,
they're going to get soft.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.236
And they're just not
going to have the strength

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.050
that they were intended to.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.946
So as a result, eventually
this structure will collapse.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.806
There are reasonable structural
engineering explanations

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.543
for those collapses.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200
Yes, sir?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.896
&gt;&gt; As somebody who had his education
and career in engineering physics,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.970
I'd be very interested in your
comments on the convergence

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.386
as we get into the nano region
of both theoretical physics,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.173
theoretical -- let's
say theoretical science,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.780
experimental science
and engineering.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.883
They seem to be coming
together in this ring.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.376
&gt;&gt; Well, that's right.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:50.270
In order to produce especially
some of the electronic devices

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.150
and components that
are being projected,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.636
you have to know a lot of physics.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:00.156
And as I think it's a gosh example

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.240
of what I was saying is there
has to be close interaction.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.406
I will say that it's hard to predict
what's going to happen or going

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.520
to be the limitations,
because almost

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:15.670
by definition we don't know what
they are, because we don't know

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.210
as much about the science
as we really should.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.493
There's still open questions.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680
Yes, sir?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.546
&gt;&gt; Yes. The previous two
speakers in this tent were dealing

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.880
with different issues, be it farm
produced poultry and products.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.600
Edmund O. Wilson was here before.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.633
I think the key to bridging science

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.813
and solutions is human factors
engineering and the expansion

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.073
of human factors engineering.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.273
I haven't heard you speak on it.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:51.406
Would you have an opinion on that?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.473
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't mention it today.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.140
I have talked about human
factors engineering,

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.593
but human factors engineering
has various definitions.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:27:59.330
To some people it means
simply making machines

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.710
that people can interact
with, that humans can interact

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.873
with without ambiguity
and with safety.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.583
I think there are some
attempts to broaden the idea

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:13.900
of what human factors
engineering means.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.566
And I think that's
a good development.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:19.986
It's hard to be against
something like that.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.733
And, well, I think it bodes well
for the objectives that we all have.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.030
Yes, sir?

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:35.563
&gt;&gt; Given the failures of this decade
ending in 2010, what do you feel

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.630
about universities'
professors teaching engineers

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.253
for the global warming changes,
things that have come up?

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.596
Any challenges for the next decade

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.930
so that we maybe don't
have Katrina two,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.900
gulf spill two, those
type of things?

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.210
Do you think we're prepared
enough going forward?

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:55.666
&gt;&gt; Well, you know,
Katrina sensitized people

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.233
to the weakness of levies.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.080
And not only to the weakness of
levies, but also to the weakness

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.733
to the entire system that was
supposed to help New Orleans respond

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.216
to something of that nature.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.416
The gulf spill, the recent gulf
spill has sensitized people

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.630
to deep water drilling and so forth.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:22.050
So these failures will have an
immediate effect of making engineers

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.733
and people that commission
engineers a little more cautious,

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.860
a little more conservative.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.043
So I would predict, if you're asking
me to predict, over the next decade

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.956
that we're not going to see
another Katrina in New Orleans.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.076
We may see another Katrina
elsewhere, because so many

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.450
of the resources that it would
take to bring levies elsewhere

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.256
up to speed are really
going to New Orleans.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:48.716
And there's just a
limit to, you know,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:50.316
how many resources we can have.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.306
The Netherlands, which has had
historically a levy problem,

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.060
if you will, is thinking
in terms of 200 years

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.846
and in some cases a millennium.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.126
They are very long range thinking
and action on a national scale.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.060
We haven't gotten to that point yet.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.646
So I think we really have to look
elsewhere for some further lessons

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.783
about what we can do
to prevent disasters.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720
Yes?

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.116
&gt;&gt; Professor, you wrote a
book 11 or 12 years ago,

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.323
The Book on the Bookshelf.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.590
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.990
&gt;&gt; And in that you discuss many of
the things you brought up today,

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.256
invention, innovation,
the profit motive.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.476
And in that context I wonder if you
would just address the evolution

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:46.196
in publishing today of E-Books
and P-Books [assumed spelling].

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.393
&gt;&gt; I wish I knew.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.033
There is so much being reported
and written on that topic

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:58.050
that I will admit to being
bewildered about what's happening.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.573
I think E-Books are a
natural development.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.100
Whether they will actually
displace the physical book or not,

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.330
I think remains an open question.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.843
And I think the publishers play more
of a role in this than they seem

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.610
to have admitted or
seem to be acting upon.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.126
I think the publishers in a
certain way are silent partners

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.586
to the E-Book revolution.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.673
It's a lot easier to produce and
more profitable to produce an E-Book

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:30.976
than it is a regular printed book.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.550
I wish we would see more innovation,
innovated thinking on the part

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:39.380
of publishers with
regard to E-Books.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.400
And I simply haven't seen it yet.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.430
So I think that's going
to be the next wave

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.730
if the publishers are going

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.396
to really fight what they
claim they'd like to fight.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.620
They're largely fighting it on
the basis of money and profit,

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.143
but not in terms of
technology in my opinion.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520
Yes, sir?

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.353
&gt;&gt; Yes. Professor, a lot of people
here don't realize that you're one

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.620
of the experts on failure analysis
and that you teach that at Duke.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.060
And my question is,
the current modes

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.460
of failure analysis we see now, that
is, the software failures that is

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.336
like the 1990 national telephone
failure, I would say that is not

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.410
so much between science
and engineering,

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.020
but a failure between high level
engineering or systems engineering

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.446
and detailed engineering.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.053
Essentially that failure was
because they wanted to save money,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.440
they took the system engineering
specs and they brought it

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.706
into code instead of letting the
software engineer develop the

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:48.850
code himself.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.983
My question is, I know your book
merge science and engineering.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.170
What about in terms
of failure analysis,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.996
what about systems engineering
and detailed engineering?

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.033
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm getting
the overtime sign.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.966
So I'll be very brief.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.093
And basically I'm working
on a book right now

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.773
that deals with those issues.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.683
I'm interested in systems failures.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.993
Well, thank you very much.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.060
I'm sorry, but I've been told
we have to keep on schedule.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.630
[clapping].

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.496
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.963
