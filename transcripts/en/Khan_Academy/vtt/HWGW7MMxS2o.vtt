00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.900
- [Instructor] Now we're
gonna talk about an important

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.320
Supreme Court case that
reinforced the idea

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.760
that states have to
provide the same rights

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.530
when people are arrested
and accused of a crime,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.350
as are guaranteed in the
United States Constitution.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.820
And that case is Gideon versus Wainwright.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.900
So in 1961, you have a
gentleman by the name of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.570
Clarence Earl Gideon, who's in a pool hall

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.990
and he's accused of stealing some beer

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.660
and soda and about $50.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.170
And there's one witness
who said that they saw

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.530
Clarence Gideon walking
away with some soda and beer

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.560
in his pockets and some
change in his pockets.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.580
Now when he gets arrested
and he goes to court,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.660
he wants to have access to counsel,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.120
he can't afford a lawyer by himself.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.530
But Florida, at the time,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.020
did not give everyone access to a lawyer.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.180
That was only in capital offenses
or in certain other cases.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.050
So Clarence Earl Gideon
had to defend himself

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.350
and he loses the case and he gets

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.840
the maximum sentence of five years.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.770
Now while he is in prison,
he begins to study the law

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.850
and the Constitution in particular.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.670
And he reads things like
the Sixth Amendment,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.400
which say in all criminal prosecutions,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.060
the accused shall enjoy the right to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.880
a speedy and public trial, by
an impartial jury of the state

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.590
and district wherein the crime
shall have been committed,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.060
which district shall have been

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
previously ascertained by law,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.410
and to be informed of the nature

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.120
and cause of the accusation,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.180
to be confronted with
the witness against him,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.070
to have compulsory process for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.520
obtaining witnesses in his favor,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.900
and to have the assistance
of counsel for his defense.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.850
So he's saying hey, this is
here in the Constitution.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.870
It's the Sixth Amendment
saying that I need to have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.630
assistance of counsel for my defense.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.030
And he studies section
one of the 14th Amendment.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.550
All persons born or naturalized
in the United States

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.300
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.880
are citizens of the United States

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.300
and of the state wherein they reside.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.720
No state shall make or
enforce any law which shall

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.450
abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.190
of the United States, nor
shall any state deprive any

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.420
person of life, liberty, or property,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.560
without due process of law,
nor deny to any person within

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.640
its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.970
We'll he's saying here, look,
the Sixth Amendment says

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.470
that I have a right to
assistance of counsel,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.620
essentially to have a lawyer

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.260
that the state needs to provide.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.190
And the Constitution makes
it very clear that no state

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.440
can make or enforce a law
which abridges my privileges

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.930
that they can't deprive
me of life, liberty,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.300
or property without
the due process of law.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.270
And part of that due process is to have

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.180
access to counsel for defense.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.330
And so he petitions
first the Florida courts

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.680
and they keep rejecting him.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.700
But eventually he writes to the
United States Supreme Court.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.870
And in 1962 the United
States Supreme Court

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.250
decides to take Clarence
Earl Gideon's case.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.030
And not only do they take his case,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.640
they provide a lawyer for him.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.550
And the lawyer is able to get

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.710
a nine zero verdict in
Clarence Gideon's favor.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.040
And so that did not
acquit him of the crime,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.720
but it says that he
has a right to counsel.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.570
So back in Florida, he gets a retrial.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.500
And in that retrial, he has a lawyer

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.170
and that lawyer is able to
question that one witness

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.070
in depth that says that
Clarence was walking away

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.020
with soda and beer and
change in his pockets

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.670
and create a substantial amount of doubt.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.700
And then the jury, after
only an hour of deliberation,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.650
says no, it hasn't been
proven that Clarence Gideon

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.020
is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.590
And he is free.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.300
So this is an amazing case.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.360
One it's amazing that an
individual sitting in jail

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.030
could learn about the Constitution

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.090
and petition the US Supreme Court

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.790
and win that case that
ensures that all 50 states

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.263
have to provide legal
counsel for the accused.
