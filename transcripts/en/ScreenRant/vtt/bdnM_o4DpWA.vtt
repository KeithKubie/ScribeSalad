00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.730
There aren't all that many good movies based
on video games, but maybe that's just because

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.870
the right adaptation hasn't come along yet.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.630
Video games are more cinematic and visually
impressive now than ever before, and their

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.460
popularity means that Hollywood is continuing
to try and find ways of turning major video

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.949
game franchises into major movie franchises.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.100
Let us know which ones you want to see in
the comments below!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.780
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Video Games We Want
To See On Film.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.780
Fallout

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.190
We've all seen action movies where the hero
shows up just in time to prevent nuclear bombs

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.790
being dropped on the United States.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.050
Well, the Fallout series is set in a world
where that hero never showed up.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.579
What makes the Fallout games particularly
good source material for a movie adaptation

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.790
isn't so much the story, but the setting.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.219
When the dust clears, America is a blasted
wasteland occupied by small pockets of life

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.500
including bandits, monsters, slavers, weird
cults, military factions like the Enclave

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.920
and the Brotherhood of Steel, and a whole
lot of regular people just trying to scratch

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
a living.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.530
For the right filmmaker, this world could
be the perfect backdrop for an original story

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.530
set in the Fallout universe.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.530
BioShock

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280
Atmospheric 2007 shooter BioShock sends the
player to the ocean floor, where a group of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.340
scientists, industrialists and artists have
built their own vision of utopia, only to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.369
have their new civilization collapse into
chaos and horror.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.380
With its Art Deco aesthetic and watery surroundings,
Rapture is a production designer's dream,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.209
and the city's rich backstory and horrifying
denizens are perfect for the big screen.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.099
In fact, several years ago a movie adaptation
was in development at Universal with Gore

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.010
Verbinski set to direct.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.810
Unfortunately, Verbinski's insistence on an
R rating and Universal's concerns about the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.869
budget meant that BioShock was put on the
back burner, where it's remained ever since.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:44.869
Silent Hill 2

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.710
There have already been two movies based on
the Silent Hill games - one of them pretty

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.520
good, the other pretty terrible.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.960
These movies were based on the first Silent
Hill game and Silent Hill 3, which deal with

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.630
the town's strange cult and the little girl
who becomes a vessel for their god.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.569
Silent Hill 2, however, is about a man called
James Sunderland who comes to Silent Hill

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.899
after his wife sends a letter inviting him
to the town.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.539
He finds this pretty disturbing, since his
wife has been dead for three years.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.700
It's a great set-up for a game full of mystery,
psychological horror and creepy monsters - all

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.710
of which could transfer very well to the big
screen.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.710
Borderlands

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.319
Anyone who's seen a Mad Max movie will easily
be able to spot the direct influence of those

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.950
films in Borderlands, Gearbox Software's colorful,
cel shaded open world role-playing shooter.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.489
The alien planet of Pandora is a dangerous
wasteland and pretty much everyone who lives

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.700
there is insane, but that's all part of its
charm.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.740
The plot of the games is follows groups of
fortune seekers who are trying to track down

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.810
mysterious Vaults full of immensely powerful
alien technology, and we'd love to see a filmmaker

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.530
tackle both the offbeat humor and the treasure-hunting
quest at the heart of the Borderlands series.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.530
Deus Ex

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.310
With prosthetic limbs becoming ever more advanced,
the world of cyberpunk shooter series Deus

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.750
Ex is starting to seem like a realistic vision
of the future.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.060
As human beings start to use technology to
evolve their own biology, the player is faced

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.690
with some hard choices regarding what the
future of the human race should look like,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.800
and how it should be governed.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.760
The original Deus Ex is still the pinnacle
of the series, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.499
was the title that really demonstrated just
how great a movie adaptation could look.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:08.969
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.160
Peter Jackson's take on The Hobbit didn't
quite live up to the standards set by the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.099
Lord of the Rings trilogy, but an adaptation
of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor could be

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.819
a great addition to the movie canon.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.470
The game takes place after the events of The
Hobbit but before The Lord of the Rings, and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.930
focuses on a Ranger called Talion, who is
killed by Sauron's forces but is saved when

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.030
a wraith merges with his body, turning Talion
into an undead warrior with some very unique

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.030
abilities.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.610
Enraged by the slaughter of his family, Talion
proceeds to single-handedly wreak havoc on

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.549
Sauron's army of Orcs, playing an unsung role
in preventing the fall of Middle-earth.

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.549
inFAMOUS

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.110
Given the current Hollywood craze for comic
book movies, now is the perfect time for a

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.730
movie version of inFAMOUS.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.200
This open world game casts players as Cole
McGrath, a bike courier who gains electricity-based

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.150
superpowers when he's caught at the center
of a devastating explosion.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.390
After the smoke clears, Cole is faced with
the choice to either become a superhero and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.370
save the citizens of Empire City, or use his
powers to become a supervillain and make people

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.430
fear and despise him.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.060
No matter which path you pick, this is one
comic book style video game that we definitely

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.819
want to see on film.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:07.969
The Wolf Among Us

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.450
Based on the Fables comic books by Bill Willingham,
The Wolf Among Us is a cool, noir detective

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420
story with a fantasy twist.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.109
When characters from fairy tales are exiled
to live in the human world, the Big Bad Wolf

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.390
changes his ways and becomes Sheriff Bigby
Wolf, the lawkeeper of Fabletown.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.050
After discovering the horrible murder of a
young woman, Bigby embarks on a desperate

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.720
hunt for a serial killer and along the way
finds himself digging deeper into the corruption

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.080
and organized crime at the heart of the Fable
community.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.590
It's a tense story with plenty of interesting
characters, and it has the potential to be

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.840
a great crime thriller movie - with a talking
pig as a bonus.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840
Mass Effect

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.590
The stakes don't get much higher than trying
to prevent a race of synthetic beings from

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.960
wiping out every last trace of intelligent
life in the galaxy.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.900
That's the task that falls to Commander Shepherd
in Bioware's Mass Effect trilogy, which is

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.120
set a long way into the future after humanity
has managed to tentatively establish itself

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.349
in the hierarchy of the Milky Way's alien
races.

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.639
This beautiful and expansive science fiction
epic captured the hearts of gamers, and with

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.870
the right director on board could capture
the hearts of moviegoers as well.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.870
Grand Theft Auto

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.210
As we mentioned in our previous video, "Movies
You Didn't Know Were Influenced By Video Games",

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.740
Crank is modelled after the insanity of games
like Grand Theft Auto.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.050
In turn, Grand Theft Auto was heavily influenced
by classic crime movies like Heat, Scarface

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.240
and Goodfellas.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.639
So why not keep the cycle going by making
a Grand Theft Auto movie, complete with all

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.669
of the violence, satire and gleeful immorality
that made the video game series such a hit.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.780
With a dream director like Michael Mann, Martin
Scorsese or Robert Rodriguez behind the wheel,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.080
Grand Theft Auto could take over movie theaters
as successfully as it took over games consoles.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.770
These are the video games that we would most
like to see on film, but are there any that

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.539
you think deserved to be on the list?

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.770
