00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
What’s 1000 times thinner than a piece of
paper, more numerous in you than grains of

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:08.240
sand on a beach, and proof that the smallest
things can sometimes be the most powerful?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.830
I’m talking about the synapse -- the meeting
point between two neurons.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.910
If your neurons form the structure of your
nervous system, then your synapses -- the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.980
tiny communication links between them -- are
what turn that structure into an actual system.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.260
Because, as great and powerful as your neurons
are, when it comes down to it, their strength

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.760
and their purpose lies in their connections.
A single neuron in isolation might as well

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.689
not exist if it doesn’t have someone to
listen or talk to.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.249
The word “synapse” comes from the Greek
for “to clasp or join.” It’s basically

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.060
a junction or a crossroads.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.999
When an action potential -- and if you don’t
know what an action potential is, watch the

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.469
last episode -- sends an electrical message
to the end of an axon, that message hits a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.129
synapse that then translates, or converts
it, into a different type of signal and flings

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.499
it over to another neuron.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.280
These connections are rather amazing feats
of bio-electrical engineering, and they are

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510
also ridiculously, mind-bogglingly numerous.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.450
Consider that the human brain alone has 100
billion neurons, and each of those has 1000

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.180
to 10,000 synapses.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.360
So you’ve got somewhere between 100 to 1,000
trillion synapses in your brain.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.390
Each one of these hundreds of trillions of
synapses is like a tiny computer, all of its

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.670
own, not only capable of running loads of
different programs simultaneously, but also

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.060
able to change and adapt in response to neuron
firing patterns, and either strengthen or

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.420
weaken over time, depending on how much they’re
used.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660
Synapses are what allow you to learn and remember.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.980
They’re also the root of many psychiatric
disorders.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.280
And they’re basically why illicit drugs
-- and addictions to them -- exist.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
Pretty much everything in your experience
-- from euphoria to hunger to desire to fuzziness

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.960
to to confusion to boredom -- is communicated
by way of these signals sent by your body’s

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.440
own electrochemical messaging system.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.760
Hopefully, you know enough about email and
texting etiquette to know that if you’re

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.869
gonna communicate effectively, you have to
respect the sanctity of the group list.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.580
It’s not a great idea to send a mass text
to all of your friends first thing in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.160
morning to give them the urgent news that you
just ate a really delicious maple-bacon donut.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.660
Seriously, people. If you happen to have a friend who
truly adores bacon, then an email would suffice.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.110
But! If you’re out clubbing and suddenly
Bill Murray shows up and starts doing karaoke...

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
then that would be a totally appropriate time
to notify all of your friends at once that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.960
something awesome is happening and they better
be a part of it.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.900
And in much the same way -- OK, in kind of
the same way -- your nerve cells have two

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.480
main settings for communicating with each other,
depending on how fast the news needs to travel.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.340
Some of your synapses are electrical -- that
would be like an immediate group text.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.660
Others are chemical synapses -- they take
more time to be received and read, but they’re

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.330
used more often and are much easier to control,
sending signals to only certain recipients.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.040
Fortunately, your nervous system has better
text etiquette than your mom, and knows when

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.780
each kind is appropriate to use, and how to
do it.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.720
Your super fast electrical synapses send an
ion current flowing directly from the cytoplasm

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.340
of one nerve cell to another, through small
windows called gap junctions.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.430
They’re super fast because the signal is
never converted from its pure electrical state

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.370
to any other kind of signal, the way it is
in a chemical synapse.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.730
Instead, one cell and one synapse can trigger
thousands of other cells that can all act

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.980
in synchrony. Something similar happens in
the muscle cells of your heart, where speed

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.400
and team effort between cells is crucial.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.980
This seems like a good system, so why aren’t
all of our synapses electrical?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.440
It’s largely a matter of control. With such
a direct connection between cells, an action

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.810
potential in one neuron will generate an action
potential in the other cells across the synapse.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.120
That’s great in places like your heart, because
you definitely don’t want a half a heartbeat.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.400
But if every synapse in your body activated
all of the neurons around it, your nervous

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.940
system would basically always be in “group
text” mode, with every muscle fiber and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.450
bit of organ tissue always being stimulated
and then replying-all to the whole group which

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.390
would stimulate them even more until everyone
just got maxed out and exhausted and turned

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.430
off their phones for good...which would be
death.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.970
So that would be bad, which is partly why
we have chemical synapses. They are much more

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.470
abundant, but also slower, and they’re more precise
and selective in what messages they send where.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.200
Rather than raw electricity, these synapses
use neurotransmitters, or chemical signals,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.230
that diffuse across a synaptic gap to deliver
their message.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.170
The main advantage chemical synapses have
over electrical ones is that they can effectively

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.260
convert the signal in steps -- from electrical
to chemical back to electrical -- which allows

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.310
for different ways to control that impulse.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.870
At the synapse, that signal can be modified,
amplified, inhibited, or split, either immediately

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.900
or over longer periods of time.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.930
This set-up has two principal parts:

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.880
The cell that’s sending the signal is the
presynaptic neuron, and it transmits through

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.750
a knoblike structure called the presynaptic
terminal, usually the axon terminal.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.900
This terminal holds a whole bunch of tiny
synaptic vesicle sacs, each loaded with thousands

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.090
of molecules of a given neurotransmitter.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.130
The receiving cell, meanwhile, is, yes, thankfully
the postsynaptic neuron, and it accepts the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.960
neurotransmitters in its receptor region, which is
usually on the dendrite or just on the cell body itself.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.330
And these two neurons communicate even though
they never actually touch. Instead, there’s

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.980
a tiny gap called a synaptic cleft between them --
less than five millionths of a centimeter apart.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.800
One thing to remember is that messages that
travel via chemical synapses are technically

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.030
not transmitted directly between neurons,
like they are in electrical synapses.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.060
Instead, there’s a whole chemical event
that involves the release, diffusion, and

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.330
reception of neurotransmitters in order to
transmit signals.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.270
And this all happens in a specific and important
chain of events.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
When an action potential races along the axon
of a neuron, activating sodium and potassium

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.380
channels in a wave, it eventually comes down
to the presynaptic terminal, and activates

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.060
the voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels
there to open and release the calcium into

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.250
the neuron’s cytoplasm.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.520
This flow of positively-charged calcium ions
causes all those tiny synaptic vesicles to

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.460
fuse with the cell membrane and purge their
chemical messengers. And it’s these neurotransmitters

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.150
that act like couriers diffusing across the
synaptic gap, and binding to receptor sites

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.650
on the postsynaptic neuron.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.790
So, the first neuron has managed to convert
the electrical signal into a chemical one.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.110
But in order for it to become an action potential
again in the receiving neuron, it has to be

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.540
converted back to electrical.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.680
And that happens once a neurotransmitter binds
to a receptor. Because, that’s what causes

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.100
the ion channels to open.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.760
And depending on which particular neurotransmitter
binds to which receptor, the neuron might

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.980
either get excited or inhibited. The neurotransmitter
tells it what to do.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.500
Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarize the
postsynaptic neuron by making the inside of

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.430
it more positive and bringing it closer to
its action potential threshold, making it

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.310
more likely to fire that message on to the
next neuron.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.240
But an inhibitory neurotransmitter hyperpolarizes
the postsynaptic neuron by making the inside

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.760
more negative, driving its charge down -- away
from its threshold. So, not only does the

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.540
message not get passed along, it’s now even
harder to excite that portion of the neuron.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.340
Keep in mind here: Any region of a single
neuron may have hundreds of synapses, each

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.139
with different inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters.
So the likelihood of that post-synaptic neuron

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:09.119
developing an action potential depends on the sum
of all of the excitations and inhibitions in that area.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.320
Now, we have over a hundred different kinds
of naturally-occurring neurotransmitters in

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.449
our bodies that serve different functions.
They help us move around, and keep our vital

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.709
organs humming along, amp us up, calm us down,
make us hungry, sleepy, or more alert, or

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:22.989
simply just make us feel good.

00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:27.169
But neurotransmitters don’t stay bonded
to their receptors for more than a few milliseconds.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.840
After they deliver their message, they just sort of pop
back out, and then either degrade or get recycled.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.380
Some kinds diffuse back across the synapse
and are immediately re-absorbed by the sending

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.180
neuron, in a process called reuptake.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.720
Others are broken down by enzymes in the synaptic
cleft, or sent away from the synapse by diffusion.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.110
And this mechanism is what many drugs -- both
legal and illegal -- so successfully exploit,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.970
in order to create their desired effects.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.310
These drugs can either excite or inhibit the production,
release, and reuptake of neurotransmitters. And

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.700
sometimes they can simply mimic neurotransmitters,
tricking a neuron into thinking it’s getting

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.710
a natural chemical signal, when really it’s
anything but.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.570
Take cocaine, for example. Don’t take cocaine.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.870
Once it hits your bloodstream, it targets
three major neurotransmitters --

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.110
serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.980
Serotonin is mainly inhibitory and plays an
important role in regulating mood, appetite,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.200
circadian rhythm, and sleep. Some antidepressants can
help stabilize moods by stabilizing serotonin levels.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.200
And when you engage in pleasurable activities
-- like hugging a loved one, or having sex,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.800
or eating a really, really great donut -- your
brain releases dopamine, which influences

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.180
emotion and attention, but mostly just makes
you feel awesome.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.319
Finally, norepinephrine amps you up by triggering
your fight or flight response, increasing

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:42.039
your heart rate, and priming muscles to engage, while
an undersupply of the chemical can depress a mood.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.470
So in a normal, sober state, you’ve got
all these neurotransmitters doing their thing

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.269
in your body. But once they’ve delivered
their chemical payloads, they’re usually

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:53.559
diffused right back out across the synapse
to be absorbed by the neuron that sent them.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:58.610
But cocaine blocks that reuptake, especially
of dopamine, allowing these powerful chemicals

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.180
to float around and accumulate -- making the user feel
euphoric for a time, but also paranoid and jittery.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.129
And because you have a limited supply of these
neurotransmitters, and your body needs time

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:12.730
to brew more, flooding your synapses like
this eventually depletes your supply, making

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.850
you feel terrible in a number of ways.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.059
Cocaine and other drugs that target neurotransmitters
trick the brain, and after prolonged use may

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:25.379
eventually cause it to adapt, as all those synapses
remember how great those extra chemicals feel.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.600
As a result, you actually start to lose receptors,
so it takes even more dopamine, and finally

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.180
cocaine, to function normally.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.100
Sometimes the best way to understand how your
body works is to look at how things can go

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.699
wrong. And when it comes to your synapses,
that, my friends, is what wrong looks like.

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:44.209
In their natural, healthy state, your synapses
know when to excite, when to inhibit, when

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.680
to use electricity and when to dispatch the
chemical messengers.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.120
Basically, a healthy nervous system has the
etiquette of electrical messaging down to,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.760
well, a science.

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:57.430
Today you learned how electrical synapses
use ion currents over gap junctions to transmit

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.259
neurological signals, and how chemical synapses
turn electrical signals into chemical ones,

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:05.819
using neurotransmitters, before converting
them to back electrical signals again. And

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:10.740
you learned how cocaine is a sterling example
of how artificial imbalances in this electrochemical

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.660
system can lead to dysfunctions of all kinds.
