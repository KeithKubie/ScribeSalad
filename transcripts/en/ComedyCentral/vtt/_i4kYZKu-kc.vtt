00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.572
THAT MEANS NO PLACE
TO PUT OUR BONERS,

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.741
EXCEPT IN OUR HANDS...
AGAIN.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.843
- IT'S NOT AS FUN--I'VE GOT
CALLOUSES FROM WORKING OUT.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.813
- I DON'T KNOW--MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GET OUR SNACKS AT 7-ELEVEN.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.748
THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS DO.
- WHAT?

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.751
- 7-ELEVEN DOESN'T HAVE PARTY
TINS FULL OF POPCORN, OKAY?

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.453
THAT'S WHAT KARL ASKED FOR.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.588
ALL I'M SAYING IS WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.790
THAT CRAZY COSTCO LIFE.
- I KNOW.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.959
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER
TOLD YOU GUYS THIS STORY,

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:29.997
BUT I SNUCK INTO A COSTCO
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.999
- YEAH, WE'VE HEARD THAT STORY.
- YEAH.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.401
- IT WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.404
THERE WAS GIANT TRAMPOLINES
HANGING FROM THE CEILING.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.039
LIKE, SHAMPOO BOTTLES
THAT ARE, LIKE...

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.575
all: THE SIZE
OF MY MASSIVE THIGHS.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.043
- I ONLY GOT, LIKE,
15 FEET IN,

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.645
THEN I WAS TACKLED
BY SECURITY.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.780
- [laughs]
BUT IT WAS--

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.516
IT WAS, HONESTLY, THE BEST
40 SECONDS OF MY LIFE.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.785
- YEAH.
- WE'VE HEARD THIS STORY.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.387
- WELL, THEN
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.489
- I DIDN'T STOP YOU
BECAUSE I LIKE THE STORY,

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.491
AND IT GOT ME JACKED UP
ABOUT SOME KIRKLAND JEANS

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.559
THAT I WANT, MAN.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:00:59.660
- THAT'S PART OF THE STORY!

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.428
- THE WIDE LEGS,
THE THICK DENIM.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.230
- THE ELASTIC WAISTBANDS.
- MM-HMM.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.965
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO HAVE A FEW SNACKS

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.400
WHILE YOU'RE THERE.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.068
- AND IF YOU GET 'EM
WITHOUT THE POCKETS

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.636
ON THE BACK, NO SNAGGIN'.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.672
- THAT'S--
THOSE ARE WOMEN'S JEANS. YEAH.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.073
- WELL, THEY JUST SIT BETTER
ON MY HIPS.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.675
- YOU DO HAVE
A VERY WOMANLY FIGURE.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.743
- I HAVE WHAT I HAVE.
- YOU ALSO HAVE TITS.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:20.080
- NICE SKIN.
- YOU KNOW, QUITE FRANKLY...

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.516
I'M WILLING TO MARCH
INTO ALICE'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.684
AND SAY...

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.452
[deep voice] "I QUIT."
- RIGHT?

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.488
- "I'M GONNA GO BE
A COSTCO SECURITY GUARD."

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.791
[normal voice] I MIGHT JUST USE
MY REGULAR VOICE, THOUGH.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.360
I DON'T KNOW.
- OR...

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.396
WE STEAL THE SNACKS
FROM THE BREAK ROOM.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.233
<i>OCEAN'S ELEVEN</i> AND <i>THIRTEEN</i>
THIS BITCH.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.300
- [bleep] <i>OCEAN'S TWELVE!</i>

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.835
- YEAH.
- TOTAL MISFIRE.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.104
- ALL RIGHT, LAST ONE, WAYMOND.
PUT YOUR HAND OUT.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.940
NO ONE LIKES A GUMMI SLUT.
GET OUT OF HERE.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.976
- HEY, JILLIAN.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.713
COULD I PLEASE GET FOUR
LOW-SODIUM STRING CHEESES?

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.115
- WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY HIT
YOUR SNACK LIMIT FOR THE DAY.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.216
NOW HIT THE ROAD.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.118
- [chuckles]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.554
JILLIAN, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.623
I'M, LIKE, THE BIGGEST DUDE
IN THIS OFFICE.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.592
- OKAY, WELL, MY BEST OFFER
IS SEVEN GRAPES.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.761
- HEY, JILLIAN.
- HMM?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.163
- [bleep] YO' GRAPES!

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.532
- I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.400
WE'VE GOT
ALL OUR DUCKS IN A ROW HERE,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.436
UH, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE BASICALLY,
THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT IT--

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.738
YEAH. NO, I KNOW.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.874
BUT TRUST ME,
THE DEAL IS ALMOST DONE.

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:24.344
- HEY, JILLIAN, UM,
DO YOU HAVE THE KEYS

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.146
TO THE STORAGE CLOSET?

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.347
- WHAT FOR?

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.750
- I JUST NEED TO VACUUM
SOMETHING.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.486
- UH, WHAT SOMETHING?
- [laughs]

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.088
UM, WELL,
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.192
[whispers]
I WANTED TO SHAVE MY NIPPLES.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.760
BUT THEY'RE, LIKE,
KIND OF HAIRY,

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.429
SO I DON'T WANT
TO GET HAIR EVERYWHERE.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.398
- [moaning]
[knock on stall door]

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.933
A LITTLE PRIVACY, BUDDY!

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:49.336
I'M OBVIOUSLY MASTURBATING
RIGHT NOW--IT HURTS.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.772
FEELS LIKE RAZOR BLADES
ARE COMING OUT THE TIP.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.941
JUST KIDDING.
I'M POOPING HERE!

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:57.377
OH! WHOO!
WHAT DID I EAT--ROCKS?

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.279
ALICE.

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:02.883
OH, I'VE GOT SOME...
PRETTY GROSS NEWS.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:07.588
I, ON ACCIDENT, DROPPED
AN ATOM BOMB IN THE BATHROOM,

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.557
AND THE TOILET WAS DESTROYED,
SO THAT IS ON ME.

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.860
AND I KNOW A PLUMBER
WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.862
AND YOU LOOK AWESOME TODAY,
BY THE WAY.
