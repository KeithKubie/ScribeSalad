but let's look at a transparent sphere
that is one micron in diameter so it's

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.670
that is one micron in diameter so it's
 

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.650
that is one micron in diameter so it's
very small so if we shine light on it

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:10.660

it deflected upward and the sphere goes

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480
it deflected upward and the sphere goes
 

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.519
it deflected upward and the sphere goes
downwards so this is the basic mechanism

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:37.529

if a photon arrive and the upper part of

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.190
if a photon arrive and the upper part of
 

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.620
if a photon arrive and the upper part of
the sphere it's good it will be

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.630
the sphere it's good it will be
 

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.410
the sphere it's good it will be
deflected and it will be a force for on

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:01.420
deflected and it will be a force for on
 

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.079
deflected and it will be a force for on
the sphere if the photon arrived at the

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:04.089
the sphere if the photon arrived at the
 

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:05.610
the sphere if the photon arrived at the
lower part the force in the other

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:05.620
lower part the force in the other
 

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.069
lower part the force in the other
direction on the sphere so that the sum

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079
direction on the sphere so that the sum
 

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.710
direction on the sphere so that the sum
of the force can be decomposed into two

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720
of the force can be decomposed into two
 

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.680
of the force can be decomposed into two
forces the scattering Force which make

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:13.690
forces the scattering Force which make
 

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.720
forces the scattering Force which make
the sphere move in the direction of the

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:15.730
the sphere move in the direction of the
 

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.780
the sphere move in the direction of the
beam a gradient force that makes the

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:18.790
beam a gradient force that makes the
 

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.850
beam a gradient force that makes the
sphere goes toward the center of the

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:20.860
sphere goes toward the center of the
 

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.250
sphere goes toward the center of the
beam so what is very interesting here is

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:23.260
beam so what is very interesting here is
 

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.670
beam so what is very interesting here is
that the sphere will be attracted to the

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680
that the sphere will be attracted to the
 

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.189
that the sphere will be attracted to the
high power region of the laser which

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:29.199
high power region of the laser which
 

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.259
high power region of the laser which
seems a little bit counterintuitive but

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:31.269
seems a little bit counterintuitive but
 

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:33.809
seems a little bit counterintuitive but
it actually happens so the sphere goes

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:33.819
it actually happens so the sphere goes
 

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:36.780
it actually happens so the sphere goes
towards the center of the beam so let's

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:36.790
towards the center of the beam so let's
 

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.730
towards the center of the beam so let's
look at a little animation

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:39.740
look at a little animation
 

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.250
look at a little animation
so the photons arriving here more photon

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260
so the photons arriving here more photon
 

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.900
so the photons arriving here more photon
at the top because it's near the center

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:44.910
at the top because it's near the center
 

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.820
at the top because it's near the center
look more or less photon here and the

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:46.830
look more or less photon here and the
 

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.980
look more or less photon here and the
ball was thought to move toward the

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:48.990
ball was thought to move toward the
 

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.900
ball was thought to move toward the
center of the beam when it's at the

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:50.910
center of the beam when it's at the
 

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.850
center of the beam when it's at the
center it just moved forward to the

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860
center it just moved forward to the
 

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.950
center it just moved forward to the
scattering force and here it's going to

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:54.960
scattering force and here it's going to
 

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.610
scattering force and here it's going to
hit a slide but microscope slide let's

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620
hit a slide but microscope slide let's
 

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.530
hit a slide but microscope slide let's
stop the sphere so the sphere is trapped

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540
stop the sphere so the sphere is trapped
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.290
stop the sphere so the sphere is trapped
like the beam on the left and by the

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300
like the beam on the left and by the
 

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:12.380
like the beam on the left and by the
microscope slide on the right so art got

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:12.390
microscope slide on the right so art got
 

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.870
microscope slide on the right so art got
the idea that because he saw this

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880
the idea that because he saw this
 

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.060
the idea that because he saw this
phenomenon that he could actually put

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.070
phenomenon that he could actually put
 

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.790
phenomenon that he could actually put
two beams counter-propagating and put a

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800
two beams counter-propagating and put a
 

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.770
two beams counter-propagating and put a
sphere in the middle the transparent

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:21.780
sphere in the middle the transparent
 

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.440
sphere in the middle the transparent
sphere and this fear would be trapped

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:24.450
sphere and this fear would be trapped
 

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.000
sphere and this fear would be trapped
because the scattering force of this

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.010
because the scattering force of this
 

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.100
because the scattering force of this
beam and this gaseous form of this beam

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.110
beam and this gaseous form of this beam
 

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.410
beam and this gaseous form of this beam
would be a comfortable composite each

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420
would be a comfortable composite each
 

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.690
would be a comfortable composite each
other and the particle will be in

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700
other and the particle will be in
 

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.570
other and the particle will be in
equilibrium there so that's part of his

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:35.580
equilibrium there so that's part of his
 

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:42.620
equilibrium there so that's part of his
notebook in 1969 and this notebook was

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.630
notebook in 1969 and this notebook was
 

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.120
notebook in 1969 and this notebook was
signed by Arequipa and Peter wolf two

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.130
signed by Arequipa and Peter wolf two
 

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.250
signed by Arequipa and Peter wolf two
famous scientists on their own and the

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260
famous scientists on their own and the
 

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.320
famous scientists on their own and the

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:53.330
 
 

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.900
 
so here's a little animation on this two

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:56.910
so here's a little animation on this two
 

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.540
so here's a little animation on this two
beam trap so all the photon arrives

00:12:59.540 --> 00:12:59.550
beam trap so all the photon arrives
 

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.060
beam trap so all the photon arrives
symmetrically so the net force on the

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.070
symmetrically so the net force on the
 

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.840
symmetrically so the net force on the
sphere is zero and doesn't move so this

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:05.850
sphere is zero and doesn't move so this
 

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.760
sphere is zero and doesn't move so this
is the first all optical trap so art

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:12.770
is the first all optical trap so art
 

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:18.710
is the first all optical trap so art
decided in the next year and 71 to look

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720
decided in the next year and 71 to look
 

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.390
decided in the next year and 71 to look
at what will happen if it takes the

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.400
at what will happen if it takes the
 

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.450
at what will happen if it takes the
laser and turn it upwards and use

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:23.460
laser and turn it upwards and use
 

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:29.420
laser and turn it upwards and use
gravity as a force to to to produce the

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:29.430
gravity as a force to to to produce the
 

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:37.070
gravity as a force to to to produce the
trapping so here's the laser so

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.080
trapping so here's the laser so
 

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.630
trapping so here's the laser so
initially the sphere is sitting on

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:41.640
initially the sphere is sitting on
 

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.450
initially the sphere is sitting on
microscope slide then we turn on the

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:44.460
microscope slide then we turn on the
 

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.940
microscope slide then we turn on the
laser but it's too low power the sphere

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:46.950
laser but it's too low power the sphere
 

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.760
laser but it's too low power the sphere
is not levitating we increase the power

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:49.770
is not levitating we increase the power
 

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.580
is not levitating we increase the power
more photons and the sphere will start

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:52.590
more photons and the sphere will start
 

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.579
more photons and the sphere will start
to levy

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:54.589
to levy
 

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:59.720
to levy
and eventually this at the height that

00:13:59.720 --> 00:13:59.730
and eventually this at the height that
 

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.879
and eventually this at the height that
it is determined by the laser power and

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:01.889
it is determined by the laser power and
 

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:11.810
it is determined by the laser power and
the beam divergence so I decided that he

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820
the beam divergence so I decided that he
 

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.400
the beam divergence so I decided that he
will try to measure the charge of the

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.410
will try to measure the charge of the
 

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.000
will try to measure the charge of the
electron using an optical Liberator so

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.010
electron using an optical Liberator so
 

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.650
electron using an optical Liberator so
here's the setup that was in 1980 so

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660
here's the setup that was in 1980 so
 

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.150
here's the setup that was in 1980 so
there is a sphere that is liberating and

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160
there is a sphere that is liberating and
 

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.650
there is a sphere that is liberating and
there is a feedback control where he's

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660
there is a feedback control where he's
 

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.819
there is a feedback control where he's
monitoring the height of that sphere and

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:30.829
monitoring the height of that sphere and
 

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.590
monitoring the height of that sphere and
it changes the power of the laser to

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600
it changes the power of the laser to
 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.560
it changes the power of the laser to
keep the height the same so then he

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:36.570
keep the height the same so then he
 

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.650
keep the height the same so then he
shined UV light in the chamber that

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
shined UV light in the chamber that
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.170
shined UV light in the chamber that
created electrons and he applied

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180
created electrons and he applied
 

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.259
created electrons and he applied
difference of voltage something similar

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:45.269
difference of voltage something similar
 

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:49.430
difference of voltage something similar
to the Milliken experiment so the chart

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440
to the Milliken experiment so the chart
 

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.980
to the Milliken experiment so the chart
did the sphere started to acquire

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:51.990
did the sphere started to acquire
 

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:58.430
did the sphere started to acquire
charges and the power of the laser is

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440
charges and the power of the laser is
 

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.670
charges and the power of the laser is
adjusted automatically to compensate the

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680
adjusted automatically to compensate the
 

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.280
adjusted automatically to compensate the
electric force that the sphere will

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:04.290
electric force that the sphere will
 

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.750
electric force that the sphere will
under go under this difference of

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760
under go under this difference of
 

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.879
under go under this difference of
potential so here are the measurements

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:09.889
potential so here are the measurements
 

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:13.819
potential so here are the measurements
so you can see that this is the charging

00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:13.829
so you can see that this is the charging
 

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.790
so you can see that this is the charging
time so how long the UV light is on and

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800
time so how long the UV light is on and
 

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.910
time so how long the UV light is on and
this is the power of the laser needed to

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920
this is the power of the laser needed to
 

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.370
this is the power of the laser needed to
levitate and you can see as the UV light

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380
levitate and you can see as the UV light
 

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.790
levitate and you can see as the UV light
shines and charges are created on the

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800
shines and charges are created on the
 

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.340
shines and charges are created on the
sphere the power to levitate changes and

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:28.350
sphere the power to levitate changes and
 

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.449
sphere the power to levitate changes and
of course it's actually step exactly by

00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459
of course it's actually step exactly by
 

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:35.689
of course it's actually step exactly by
the power by the charge of the electron

00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699
the power by the charge of the electron
 

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:38.300
the power by the charge of the electron
is a discrete power change that

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.310
is a discrete power change that
 

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.400
is a discrete power change that
correspond to the charge of the electron

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.410
correspond to the charge of the electron
 

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.189
correspond to the charge of the electron
and this is a very high accuracy

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199
and this is a very high accuracy
 

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:45.350
and this is a very high accuracy

so a laser here that goes to high

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079
so a laser here that goes to high
 

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:12.300
so a laser here that goes to high
numerical aperture microscope objective

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:12.310
numerical aperture microscope objective
 

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:17.050
numerical aperture microscope objective
focus the light very tightly just not

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.060
focus the light very tightly just not
 

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.079
focus the light very tightly just not
too far from the objective and what

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:20.089
too far from the objective and what
 

00:16:20.089 --> 00:16:24.309
too far from the objective and what
happened is that if we look here at the

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319
happened is that if we look here at the
 

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:27.790
happened is that if we look here at the
zoom in this location at the center here

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800
zoom in this location at the center here
 

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.100
zoom in this location at the center here
the minimum size of the beam the waste

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.110
the minimum size of the beam the waste
 

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.769
the minimum size of the beam the waste
of the beam the highest power is in the

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:32.779
of the beam the highest power is in the
 

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:36.009
of the beam the highest power is in the
middle here then there is a gradient in

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:36.019
middle here then there is a gradient in
 

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:37.870
middle here then there is a gradient in
the transverse direction that any laser

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880
the transverse direction that any laser
 

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.970
the transverse direction that any laser
have it has more power near the center

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:39.980
have it has more power near the center
 

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.370
have it has more power near the center
of the beam than on the edges but now

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:42.380
of the beam than on the edges but now
 

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.420
of the beam than on the edges but now
because of this very tight focusing the

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:46.430
because of this very tight focusing the
 

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.470
because of this very tight focusing the
there is a gradient of power along the

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480
there is a gradient of power along the
 

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.590
there is a gradient of power along the
axis of the beam so now from the center

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600
axis of the beam so now from the center
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.550
axis of the beam so now from the center
here to going forward there is a very

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560
here to going forward there is a very
 

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.160
here to going forward there is a very
big gradient of power and what is the

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.170
big gradient of power and what is the
 

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.650
big gradient of power and what is the
impact of that so we have learned from

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:02.660
impact of that so we have learned from
 

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.669
impact of that so we have learned from
previous slides that a sphere is

00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679
previous slides that a sphere is
 

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:08.409
previous slides that a sphere is
attracted towards the region of high

00:17:08.409 --> 00:17:08.419
attracted towards the region of high
 

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:11.140
attracted towards the region of high
power so the sphere will experience a

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.150
power so the sphere will experience a
 

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.179
power so the sphere will experience a
force that's called a gradient force

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:13.189
force that's called a gradient force
 

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:17.590
force that's called a gradient force
that is not forward but is backward so

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600
that is not forward but is backward so
 

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.840
that is not forward but is backward so
it's the sphere wants to go back to the

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:19.850
it's the sphere wants to go back to the
 

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.179
it's the sphere wants to go back to the
center of the laser and if you have a

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:22.189
center of the laser and if you have a
 

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:25.059
center of the laser and if you have a
sufficient focusing then this gradient

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:25.069
sufficient focusing then this gradient
 

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.980
sufficient focusing then this gradient
force will exceed a scattering force

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:26.990
force will exceed a scattering force
 

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.460
force will exceed a scattering force
that is always there and produce a and

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:30.470
that is always there and produce a and
 

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.279
that is always there and produce a and
attract a small sphere towards the

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:33.289
attract a small sphere towards the
 

00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:36.430
attract a small sphere towards the
center of the beam but not exactly at

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440
center of the beam but not exactly at
 

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.320
center of the beam but not exactly at
the center there is a bit offset where

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.330
the center there is a bit offset where
 

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.750
the center there is a bit offset where
there is a maximum gradient of light so

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760
there is a maximum gradient of light so
 

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.169
there is a maximum gradient of light so
the sphere will settle just before the

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:44.179
the sphere will settle just before the
 

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:47.169
the sphere will settle just before the
focus so in the single beam you can

00:17:47.169 --> 00:17:47.179
focus so in the single beam you can
 

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:51.700
focus so in the single beam you can
track at you can trap a small very cold

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:51.710
track at you can trap a small very cold
 

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.370
track at you can trap a small very cold
transparent particle so let's see it in

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:57.380
transparent particle so let's see it in
 

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.230
transparent particle so let's see it in
operation so here we have an optical

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240
operation so here we have an optical
 

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.419
operation so here we have an optical
imitator which will be used just to

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:04.429
imitator which will be used just to
 

00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:06.250
imitator which will be used just to
bring the spheres next to the tweezers

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:06.260
bring the spheres next to the tweezers
 

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.840
bring the spheres next to the tweezers
on top you have the optical tweezers so

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:10.850
on top you have the optical tweezers so
 

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.180
on top you have the optical tweezers so
the sphere is at the bottom of the tank

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.190
the sphere is at the bottom of the tank
 

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.510
the sphere is at the bottom of the tank
you turn the laser on so the tweezer

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520
you turn the laser on so the tweezer
 

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.450
you turn the laser on so the tweezer
here as it's a fixed power

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:19.460
here as it's a fixed power
 

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.970
here as it's a fixed power
very high intensity need the focus point

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:21.980
very high intensity need the focus point
 

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.160
very high intensity need the focus point
then there is low intensity levitator

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.170
then there is low intensity levitator
 

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.710
then there is low intensity levitator
it's not sufficient to levitate then we

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720
it's not sufficient to levitate then we
 

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.080
it's not sufficient to levitate then we
increase the power of the levitator the

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.090
increase the power of the levitator the
 

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.260
increase the power of the levitator the
particle goes up and then is trapped so

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:32.270
particle goes up and then is trapped so
 

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.900
particle goes up and then is trapped so
a particle let's do it again so that

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:34.910
a particle let's do it again so that
 

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.170
a particle let's do it again so that
when the particle lift is become trapped

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:38.180
when the particle lift is become trapped
 

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.000
when the particle lift is become trapped
all of a sudden at this location just

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.010
all of a sudden at this location just
 

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.860
all of a sudden at this location just
after the focus so that's the way an

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:41.870
after the focus so that's the way an
 

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:51.370
after the focus so that's the way an
optical tweezers works so let's now talk

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:51.380
optical tweezers works so let's now talk
 

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.850
optical tweezers works so let's now talk
about some of the biological application

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:54.860
about some of the biological application
 

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:03.010
about some of the biological application
that art himself measure so in 1987 art

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.020

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.520
that art himself measure so in 1987 art
and Joe digits is a technical assistant

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:06.530
and Joe digits is a technical assistant
 

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.240
and Joe digits is a technical assistant
set up a microscope to trap bacteria

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.250
set up a microscope to trap bacteria
 

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:16.740
set up a microscope to trap bacteria
using 11.06 micron neodymium YAG laser

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:16.750
 
 

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.860
 
so he started with non living organisms

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:20.870
so he started with non living organisms
 

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.780
so he started with non living organisms
and something that doesn't have the

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:22.790
and something that doesn't have the
 

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.880
and something that doesn't have the
shape of a sphere so here I'm going to

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:27.890
shape of a sphere so here I'm going to
 

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.370
shape of a sphere so here I'm going to
show a video where they took himself

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:30.380
show a video where they took himself
 

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.490
show a video where they took himself
where you can see this irregular

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:33.500
where you can see this irregular
 

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.540
where you can see this irregular
particle being moved by an optical

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.550
particle being moved by an optical
 

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.400
particle being moved by an optical
tweezer and you can see obviously that

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.410
tweezer and you can see obviously that
 

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.930
tweezer and you can see obviously that
is not circular but it's going to be

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:43.940
is not circular but it's going to be
 

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.850
is not circular but it's going to be
manipulated by the optical tweezers so

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:45.860
manipulated by the optical tweezers so
 

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.580
manipulated by the optical tweezers so
the laser is that's one micron so we

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:48.590
the laser is that's one micron so we
 

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.700
the laser is that's one micron so we
cannot see it's not visible but the one

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:51.710
cannot see it's not visible but the one
 

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:56.380
cannot see it's not visible but the one
is turned on it moves this small object

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.390
is turned on it moves this small object
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.470
is turned on it moves this small object
here so it shows that you don't need a

00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480
here so it shows that you don't need a
 

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.280
here so it shows that you don't need a
sphere to use optical tweezers to exert

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.290
sphere to use optical tweezers to exert
 

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:10.780
sphere to use optical tweezers to exert
force on objects then he it turns its

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:10.790
force on objects then he it turns its
 

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.210
force on objects then he it turns its
attention to living organisms so here's

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:13.220
attention to living organisms so here's
 

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.490

to trap them and trap the organelle

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:45.570
to trap them and trap the organelle
 

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.700
to trap them and trap the organelle
twice so let's look at the video so this

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:49.710
twice so let's look at the video so this
 

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.460
twice so let's look at the video so this
organelle is trapped and a Paramecium

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.470
organelle is trapped and a Paramecium
 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.840
organelle is trapped and a Paramecium
will move and then when it is a the

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:56.850
will move and then when it is a the
 

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.899
will move and then when it is a the
organelle is the wall its exit the trap

00:20:59.899 --> 00:20:59.909
organelle is the wall its exit the trap
 

00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:02.389
organelle is the wall its exit the trap
and we're trapped again and when it eats

00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:02.399
and we're trapped again and when it eats
 

00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:09.590
and we're trapped again and when it eats
the wall its leave the trap again and

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600
the wall its leave the trap again and
 

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.019
the wall its leave the trap again and
now let's look at what happens with

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:12.029
now let's look at what happens with
 

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:15.139
now let's look at what happens with
tobacco mosaic virus a tobacco mosaic

00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:15.149
tobacco mosaic virus a tobacco mosaic
 

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:17.450
tobacco mosaic virus a tobacco mosaic
virus it's very long so it's very

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460
virus it's very long so it's very
 

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.600
virus it's very long so it's very
different from a sphere so I want to

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:20.610
different from a sphere so I want to
 

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.850
different from a sphere so I want to
attract your attention here this

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860
attract your attention here this
 

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.249
attract your attention here this
rectangle so the tobacco mosaic virus is

00:21:28.249 --> 00:21:28.259
rectangle so the tobacco mosaic virus is
 

00:21:28.259 --> 00:21:30.409
rectangle so the tobacco mosaic virus is
freeze moving around there's going to be

00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419
freeze moving around there's going to be
 

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:32.060
freeze moving around there's going to be
trapped so now it's trap doesn't move

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:32.070
trapped so now it's trap doesn't move
 

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.879
trapped so now it's trap doesn't move
and then it's turn in the inwards and

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:36.889
and then it's turn in the inwards and
 

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:41.480
and then it's turn in the inwards and
because it's trapped using by the end of

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:41.490
because it's trapped using by the end of
 

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.970
because it's trapped using by the end of
the virus because the end of the virus

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980
the virus because the end of the virus
 

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.730
the virus because the end of the virus
refract light more and the optical

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740
refract light more and the optical
 

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:54.230
refract light more and the optical
tweezers is stronger and now I decided

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240
tweezers is stronger and now I decided
 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.970
tweezers is stronger and now I decided
to trap spermatozoon and we can listen

00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.980
to trap spermatozoon and we can listen
 

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.009
to trap spermatozoon and we can listen
to him describing what is doing this is

00:22:04.009 --> 00:22:04.019
to him describing what is doing this is
 

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:10.580
to him describing what is doing this is
1988 may not well I don't know the power

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.590
1988 may not well I don't know the power
 

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.259
1988 may not well I don't know the power
might not be high enough or he's too

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:12.269
might not be high enough or he's too
 

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:13.520

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720
let me put up I'll give you well this is
 

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.570
let me put up I'll give you well this is
about the maximum power let me say here

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580
about the maximum power let me say here
 

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.190
about the maximum power let me say here
I'm moving him now I got a reference to

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200
I'm moving him now I got a reference to
 

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.210
I'm moving him now I got a reference to
moving right here you can see our movie

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.220
moving right here you can see our movie
 

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:35.120
moving right here you can see our movie
nice work so now let's talk about a few

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:35.130
nice work so now let's talk about a few
 

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:41.540
nice work so now let's talk about a few
different applications so molecular

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:41.550
different applications so molecular
 

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.720
different applications so molecular
motors are biological molecules

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:43.730
motors are biological molecules
 

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.040
motors are biological molecules
molecular machines that are the

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.050
molecular machines that are the
 

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.410
molecular machines that are the
essential agent of movement in living

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:48.420
essential agent of movement in living
 

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.260
essential agent of movement in living
organism so here's example of the

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:51.270
organism so here's example of the
 

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:56.660
organism so here's example of the
keynesian the keynesian is a molecular

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:56.670
keynesian the keynesian is a molecular
 

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.890
keynesian the keynesian is a molecular
motor that can carry a load here a bead

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900
motor that can carry a load here a bead
 

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.350
motor that can carry a load here a bead
has been attached to a Kinnison and the

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360
has been attached to a Kinnison and the
 

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.800
has been attached to a Kinnison and the
keynesian is on a microtubule so the

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:06.810
keynesian is on a microtubule so the
 

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.690
keynesian is on a microtubule so the
keynesian want to transport that bead

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700
keynesian want to transport that bead
 

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.210
keynesian want to transport that bead
and that bead is being trapped and an

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220
and that bead is being trapped and an
 

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.480
and that bead is being trapped and an
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:14.490
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer
 

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.520
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer
is soft in a sense that it traps the

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:16.530
is soft in a sense that it traps the
 

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.280
is soft in a sense that it traps the
bead but not too strongly so the bead is

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.290
bead but not too strongly so the bead is
 

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.290
bead but not too strongly so the bead is
kind of free to move a little bit and as

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:21.300
kind of free to move a little bit and as
 

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.460
kind of free to move a little bit and as
it moves the it change it deflects the B

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:25.470
it moves the it change it deflects the B
 

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.730
it moves the it change it deflects the B
is a beam of the tweezer so it can be

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740
is a beam of the tweezer so it can be
 

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.190
is a beam of the tweezer so it can be
detected where the bead is in the

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200
detected where the bead is in the
 

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.460
detected where the bead is in the
tweezer and if we look now at

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.470
tweezer and if we look now at
 

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.860
tweezer and if we look now at
measurements those are three different

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:36.870
measurements those are three different
 

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.310
measurements those are three different
measurements the step size here is this

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320
measurements the step size here is this
 

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.930
measurements the step size here is this
is a function of time of the position of

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940
is a function of time of the position of
 

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.610
is a function of time of the position of
the other bead and you can see the bead

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620
the other bead and you can see the bead
 

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.220
the other bead and you can see the bead
move and by step size of eight

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.230
move and by step size of eight
 

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:51.530
move and by step size of eight
nanometers so the bead is kind of the

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:51.540
nanometers so the bead is kind of the
 

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.560
nanometers so the bead is kind of the
keynesian it's kind of walking along the

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:54.570
keynesian it's kind of walking along the
 

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.120
keynesian it's kind of walking along the
microtubule so it's making eight

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.130
microtubule so it's making eight
 

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.030
microtubule so it's making eight
nanometer step stop for a while and I

00:23:59.030 --> 00:23:59.040
nanometer step stop for a while and I
 

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.920
nanometer step stop for a while and I
don't know let me just step and and so

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:00.930
don't know let me just step and and so
 

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.720
don't know let me just step and and so
on so now let's look now something a

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:05.730
on so now let's look now something a
 

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.290
on so now let's look now something a
little bit more advanced which is the

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:09.300
little bit more advanced which is the
 

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.670
little bit more advanced which is the
measurement of the DNA on DNA templates

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:13.680
measurement of the DNA on DNA templates
 

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.420
measurement of the DNA on DNA templates
so a DNA template is attached to one

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:17.430
so a DNA template is attached to one
 

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.990
so a DNA template is attached to one
bead which is in a trap then the RNA

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000
bead which is in a trap then the RNA
 

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.770
bead which is in a trap then the RNA
polymerase is attached to another beat

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:23.780
polymerase is attached to another beat
 

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.370
polymerase is attached to another beat
also in the trap one of the trap is soft

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:27.380
also in the trap one of the trap is soft
 

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.960
also in the trap one of the trap is soft
it's let the bead move the other one is

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:28.970
it's let the bead move the other one is
 

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.480
it's let the bead move the other one is
strong the biddies doesn't move much or

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:31.490
strong the biddies doesn't move much or
 

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.299
strong the biddies doesn't move much or
at all and in the what we're going to

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:34.309
at all and in the what we're going to
 

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:37.450
at all and in the what we're going to
observe here is that the NRA polymerase

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:37.460
observe here is that the NRA polymerase
 

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.950
observe here is that the NRA polymerase
is transcribing the DNA and we're going

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960
is transcribing the DNA and we're going
 

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.900
is transcribing the DNA and we're going
to see a video that is at 30 times the

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:43.910
to see a video that is at 30 times the
 

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.650
to see a video that is at 30 times the
speed of the tube it's moving from a

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:47.660
speed of the tube it's moving from a
 

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.360
speed of the tube it's moving from a
single DNA and single RNA polymerase in

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:52.370
single DNA and single RNA polymerase in
 

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.060
single DNA and single RNA polymerase in
action so the bead is moving as you can

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.070
action so the bead is moving as you can
 

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.230
action so the bead is moving as you can
see and what bring them together is the

00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240
see and what bring them together is the
 

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:06.250
see and what bring them together is the
RNA polymerase transcription so now if

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:06.260
RNA polymerase transcription so now if
 

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.010
RNA polymerase transcription so now if
we look at the measurements of this

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.020
we look at the measurements of this
 

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.659
we look at the measurements of this
distance between the beads this is a

00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:12.669
distance between the beads this is a
 

00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:16.860
distance between the beads this is a
measurement that is about 1,200 second

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:16.870
measurement that is about 1,200 second
 

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.390
measurement that is about 1,200 second
so we can zoom on it because there's a

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:19.400
so we can zoom on it because there's a
 

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.190
so we can zoom on it because there's a
very high resolution by a factor of 10

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200
very high resolution by a factor of 10
 

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.549
very high resolution by a factor of 10
so we see yeah sometimes there's no

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559
so we see yeah sometimes there's no
 

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:27.010
so we see yeah sometimes there's no
motion sometimes there's motion and if

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.020
motion sometimes there's motion and if
 

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.690
motion sometimes there's motion and if
we zoom even further we can see that now

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:31.700
we zoom even further we can see that now
 

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.710
we zoom even further we can see that now
they have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720
they have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to
 

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.419
they have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms

00:25:37.419 --> 00:25:37.429
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms
 

00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:41.080
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms
while and this 3.1 instrum corresponds

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.090
while and this 3.1 instrum corresponds
 

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.000
while and this 3.1 instrum corresponds
to the distance between the nucleotides

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.010
to the distance between the nucleotides
 

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:50.080
