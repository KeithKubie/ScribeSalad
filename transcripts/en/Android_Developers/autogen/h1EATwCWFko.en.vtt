little bit deeper and talk about some of

one of the ways that always like to look

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
one of the ways that always like to look
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.830
one of the ways that always like to look
and think about the whole notion of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
and think about the whole notion of
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.010
and think about the whole notion of
revenue and how it all interrelates is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
revenue and how it all interrelates is
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.510
revenue and how it all interrelates is
something that we call the revenue tree

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
something that we call the revenue tree
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
something that we call the revenue tree
or some people call the revenue funnel

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
or some people call the revenue funnel
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040
or some people call the revenue funnel
this is kind of a very important view

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
this is kind of a very important view
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200
this is kind of a very important view
because it shows how all the core

monetization metrics generally speaking
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.280
monetization metrics generally speaking
I like to divide them into two different

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
I like to divide them into two different
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.490
I like to divide them into two different
categories the first the daily buyer

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

percentage I always like to think of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
percentage I always like to think of
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630
percentage I always like to think of
that as the primary monetization metric

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
that as the primary monetization metric
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429
that as the primary monetization metric
since you for thinking about the

since you for thinking about the
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870
since you for thinking about the
effectiveness and your ability to

better to go for breath it's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
better to go for breath it's
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440
better to go for breath it's
significantly safer to try and get a

significantly safer to try and get a
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539
significantly safer to try and get a
buck out of everybody versus being

overly reliant on your whales in
contrast I'd like to think of average

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
contrast I'd like to think of average
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679

measures because while they're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
measures because while they're
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.260
measures because while they're
critically important what they really

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
critically important what they really
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.660
critically important what they really
measure is your ability to extract value

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
measure is your ability to extract value
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580
measure is your ability to extract value
from users who have already chosen to

of make when I was on the developers

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
of make when I was on the developers
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399

side and still kind of make it a Google

double average revenue per paying user I

could easily do that and tank the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
could easily do that and tank the
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670
could easily do that and tank the
business at the same time because it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
business at the same time because it's
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709
business at the same time because it's
always so easy to squeeze players and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
always so easy to squeeze players and
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600
always so easy to squeeze players and
squeeze players and you're lifting up

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

and so in terms of topics today I'm

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340
and so in terms of topics today I'm
 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.259
and so in terms of topics today I'm
going to kind of walk through the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269
going to kind of walk through the
 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.449
going to kind of walk through the
revenue tree and the first thing I want

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459
revenue tree and the first thing I want
 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.670
revenue tree and the first thing I want
to do is take a look at top-line revenue

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
to do is take a look at top-line revenue
 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.949

that I like to monitor revenue

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.530
a game is doing the next we're going to
take a look at buyer percentage and in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
take a look at buyer percentage and in
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690
take a look at buyer percentage and in
particular talk about some ways to think

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700
particular talk about some ways to think
 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.640
particular talk about some ways to think
about increasing the returning buyers

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
about increasing the returning buyers
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.620
about increasing the returning buyers
and especially the frequency at which

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
and especially the frequency at which
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.110
and especially the frequency at which
users are paying within a month and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
users are paying within a month and
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.780
users are paying within a month and
finally we move on to talking about the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
finally we move on to talking about the
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.320
finally we move on to talking about the
secondary metrics and there I'm going to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330
secondary metrics and there I'm going to
 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.910
secondary metrics and there I'm going to
primarily try to give you some food for

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
primarily try to give you some food for
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.250
primarily try to give you some food for
thought about some ways that you can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260
thought about some ways that you can
 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.220
thought about some ways that you can
potentially change your games that could

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
potentially change your games that could
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.309
potentially change your games that could
help improve the metrics in that space

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319
help improve the metrics in that space
 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.520
help improve the metrics in that space
so to kick off with top-line revenue one

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
so to kick off with top-line revenue one
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.660
so to kick off with top-line revenue one
of the major ways that we're always

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
of the major ways that we're always

of the major ways that we're always
driving it one of the major ways that

driving it one of the major ways that
we're maximizing your performance

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
we're maximizing your performance

demand but LiveOps isn't this one

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769
demand but LiveOps isn't this one
 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.039
demand but LiveOps isn't this one
monolithic thing and the way that I like

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049
monolithic thing and the way that I like
 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.780
monolithic thing and the way that I like
to think of it is breaking it out into

to think of it is breaking it out into
 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.690
to think of it is breaking it out into
supply-side sales or demand side events

supply-side sales or demand side events
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.240
supply-side sales or demand side events
and I like this notion because it helps

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250
and I like this notion because it helps
 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.710

they actually ran a massive sale but

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920
they actually ran a massive sale but
 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.880
they actually ran a massive sale but
what that sale resulted in was a pretty

what that sale resulted in was a pretty
 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.220
what that sale resulted in was a pretty
significant hangover and so you can see

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230
significant hangover and so you can see
 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.680
significant hangover and so you can see
the spike but then the min fell off and

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690
the spike but then the min fell off and
 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.240
the spike but then the min fell off and
it actually resulted in a drop in the

it actually resulted in a drop in the
 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.520
it actually resulted in a drop in the
average so while sales are inherently

so what you can largely see is that a
 

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.450
so what you can largely see is that a
majority of the games had a coefficient

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:08.460
majority of the games had a coefficient
 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.360
majority of the games had a coefficient
of variation below 39% so there was some

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.370
of variation below 39% so there was some
 

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.610
of variation below 39% so there was some
volatility but there wasn't an extreme

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620
volatility but there wasn't an extreme
 

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.610

amount where it gets really interesting
is we take coefficient of variation and

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:18.780
is we take coefficient of variation and
 

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.570
is we take coefficient of variation and
we look at which of these games had

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580
we look at which of these games had
 

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.140
we look at which of these games had
month over month growth that's what we

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:24.150
month over month growth that's what we
 

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.230
month over month growth that's what we
see here the games with the lowest

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240
see here the games with the lowest
 

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.510
see here the games with the lowest
coefficient of variations were much more

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:29.520
coefficient of variations were much more
 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.570
coefficient of variations were much more
likely to see month over month growth

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.580
likely to see month over month growth
 

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.560

games with a coefficient of variation

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:33.570
games with a coefficient of variation
 

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.680
games with a coefficient of variation
between 10% and 19% so a month over

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.690
between 10% and 19% so a month over
 

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.010
between 10% and 19% so a month over
month growth about 56% of the time

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.020
month growth about 56% of the time
 

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.310
month growth about 56% of the time
in contrast games with a very high

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320
in contrast games with a very high
 

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.010
in contrast games with a very high
volatility they saw month over month

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.020
volatility they saw month over month
 

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.980
volatility they saw month over month
growth less than half of the time so

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
growth less than half of the time so
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.970
growth less than half of the time so
it's kind of an important thing to

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980
it's kind of an important thing to
 

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.490
it's kind of an important thing to
consider how volatile is the revenue in

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500
consider how volatile is the revenue in
 

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.210
consider how volatile is the revenue in
your game how volatile the sales and is

the most distributed revenue and so how
can you take that as inspiration and

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.150
can you take that as inspiration and
 

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.030
can you take that as inspiration and
figure out opportunities for improving

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040
figure out opportunities for improving
 

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.600
figure out opportunities for improving

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:22.610
and optimizing your games one of the
 

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.830
and optimizing your games one of the
ways that actually I'd like to look at

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:23.840
ways that actually I'd like to look at
 

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.610
ways that actually I'd like to look at

familiar what a decile is effectively we

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:38.900
familiar what a decile is effectively we

familiar what a decile is effectively we
take all the payers in a month we put

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:40.700
take all the payers in a month we put
 

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.460
take all the payers in a month we put
them into 10 buckets people who pay at

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.170
bucket and so on and what I'm going to
 

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.780
bucket and so on and what I'm going to
talk through in these slides this is an

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:49.790
talk through in these slides this is an
 

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.930
talk through in these slides this is an
example of a fairly typical action RPG

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:52.940
example of a fairly typical action RPG
 

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.520
example of a fairly typical action RPG
and what you can see is the top decile

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:57.530
and what you can see is the top decile
 

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.360
and what you can see is the top decile

dollars a month and so this is kind of

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:08.990
dollars a month and so this is kind of
 

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.510
dollars a month and so this is kind of
falling into that 80/20 role this

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:10.520
falling into that 80/20 role this

just one extra day out of the month
doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:00.709
doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to
 

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:02.319
doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to
me to provide them with the right

incentivizes them to open up their

we've seen when we look across at
 

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.620
we've seen when we look across at
virtually every game and I'd really

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:11.630
virtually every game and I'd really
 

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.120

encourage you guys to check this

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.130
encourage you guys to check this
 

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.060
encourage you guys to check this
yourselves for most of the game mostly

percent of your monthly buyers are only
 

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:23.740
percent of your monthly buyers are only
going to pay on one day and so what's

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:23.750
going to pay on one day and so what's
 

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.019
going to pay on one day and so what's
kind of the real opportunity here what

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:26.029
kind of the real opportunity here what
 

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:28.240
kind of the real opportunity here what
should we be focusing on and where can

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.250
should we be focusing on and where can
 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.319
should we be focusing on and where can
we extract potentially the most value in

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:31.329
we extract potentially the most value in
 

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:34.990
we extract potentially the most value in
my mind it's taking a really focus on

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000
my mind it's taking a really focus on
 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.689
my mind it's taking a really focus on
those users who are only paying on one

00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:37.699
those users who are only paying on one
 

00:16:37.699 --> 00:16:40.240

day and again with this example game

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.250
day and again with this example game
 

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.850
day and again with this example game
what we see is 80% of these buyers who

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:42.860
what we see is 80% of these buyers who
 

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.699
what we see is 80% of these buyers who
only paid on one day they paid less than

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:45.709
only paid on one day they paid less than
 

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:49.000
only paid on one day they paid less than
$10 so this to me is just this huge

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.010
$10 so this to me is just this huge
 

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.550
$10 so this to me is just this huge
upside in this huge opportunity to go

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560
upside in this huge opportunity to go
 

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.439
upside in this huge opportunity to go
after these users with very targeted

less than $10 think about if you can
 

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.610
less than $10 think about if you can
convert half of them to paying another

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:12.620
convert half of them to paying another
 

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.299

like a huge upside to me and it's one of
 

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.960
like a huge upside to me and it's one of
the great things because it's really

encourage you to do in terms of
improving performance is think about

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600
improving performance is think about

improving performance is think about
that value proposition think about how

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:27.889
the x-axis and average revenue per

00:21:27.899 --> 00:21:30.320
paying user on the y-axis it's kind of
just noise we actually spent a decent

you to encourage you to do is go back to
 

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:30.810
you to encourage you to do is go back to
your development teams and ask questions

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:30.820
your development teams and ask questions
 

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.440
