to some point on the earth but it has to

to some point on the earth but it has to
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460
to some point on the earth but it has to
be flexible again because what happens

when a hurricane rips right through your

when a hurricane rips right through your
territory and perhaps rips the space

elevator so there are a lot of technical

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
elevator so there are a lot of technical
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.219

questions that still have to be

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
questions that still have to be
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.950
questions that still have to be
addressed but in principle a space

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
