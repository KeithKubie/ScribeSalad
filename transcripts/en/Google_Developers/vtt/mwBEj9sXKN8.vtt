MARTIN KRCEK: I'm Martin Krcek.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.560
And I'm Marketing Director
of Madfinger Games.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.360
Today I will teach
you how I created

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
a huge community of
68 million players.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.480
One is you can go and buy
new users, new players,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.260
but it's quite very expensive.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.170
The second one is to
create your own community.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.770
It takes some time,
but you will have

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.120
your fans who will
love your game.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.000
At the beginning, we
started with zero actually.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.110
But we created the first game.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.520
We created activities on
Facebook and other social

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.950
media, like Twitter,
like Google+.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.620
Also, we started a
web page to bring

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.730
and to show what
is this game about.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.400
And we started slowly increasing
the number of players,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.290
then we sent them newsletters.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.080
We sent them push
notifications and, again,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.840
created interesting
topics, events for them

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.170
to bring them back to the
game and to share these games

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.740
or events with their friends.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.660
So the community was
increasing during that time.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.940
We used two types of content.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.120
One is saying what's
new in the game.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.980
And the second one we are acting
on real-life activities which

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.410
is going on around us.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.780
For example, we did
European elections

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.970
for zombies, which are
going to the Parliament.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.970
And it was focused on the
European Parliament campaign.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.270
During the world
championship in football,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.850
we created really
funny videos, which

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.730
showed that our
characters are also

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.940
playing football,
[? enjoying ?] this game.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.590
Every week, all players
can go back to our game

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.150
and play our tournaments.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.900
And for this, we use
[INAUDIBLE] channels,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.360
like push notifications.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960
To all of our users,
we send them messages.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.710
We use Facebook to post and
promote these events and also

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.270
other activities.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.330
During the week,
all of the community

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.070
is talking that
this weekend there

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.660
will be really
amazing tournaments.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.670
And they can win some
in-game currency,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.140
gold, or iPad, for
example, this week.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.620
So they are looking
forward to the weekend.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.060
And during the weekend, they
are going to the tournaments

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.040
and they play.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.990
A few weeks ago,
in Europe, there

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.510
were huge European elections
to the European Parliament.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.630
So we decided to bring something
interesting also for our users,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.860
for our players.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.690
So we created that
our zombies are

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.060
going to the European
Parliament, too.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580
So we created a campaign.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.210
And our users could
go to our website

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.830
and vote which zombie will be
the best one in the European

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.490
Parliament.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.960
And we also created the trailer
commercial for this election.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.600
So everyone went to the website.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.360
They voted for his favorite
zombie and watched the movie

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.460
and shared it with
their friends.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.570
So during the
elections, I can say,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.820
it was a nice
topic for everyone,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.350
because everyone was talking
about the European elections.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.800
And we bring something
interesting to them,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.420
which is very closely
connected with our game.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.460
So our community loves it.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.190
And we were really fascinated
from their feedback

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.790
on our Facebook page
or from our support.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.380
The football World Cup was a
very interesting topic for us,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.420
because it took one month.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.210
And we had lots of
time to think about it

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.540
and to bring something
funny for our players.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.020
So every day, we
posted some activities

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.230
from the football
match that some zombies

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.300
are fans of this football.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.050
One zombie posted his
selfie from the stadium.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.240
All the stuff is interesting
for us, not only because

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.709
of the fans, but because
we are increasing

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.670
in number of users,
in number of players.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.500
Right now we have more
than 68 million players

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.520
around the world and something
like 1.1 million fans

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.560
on Facebook.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.140
And also this huge
number of players

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.320
can earn us interesting
money, so we

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.290
can continue to develop this
game and bring to our players

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.330
interesting stuff.
