00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.470
In the last video I introduced
you to the idea of the chain

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.520
rule with partial derivatives.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
And we said, well, if I have a
function, psi, Greek letter,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.020
psi, it's a function
of x and y.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.770
And if I wanted to take the
partial of this, with respect

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.360
to-- no, I want to take the
derivative, not the partial--

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.430
the derivative of this, with
respect to x, this is equal to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.540
the partial of psi, with respect
to x, plus the partial

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.400
of psi, with respect
to y, times dy, dx.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.630
And in the last video I didn't
prove it to you, but I

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.260
hopefully gave you a little bit
of intuition that you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.740
believe me.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.030
But maybe one day I'll prove
it a little bit more

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.120
rigorously, but you can find
proofs on the web if you are

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.960
interested, for the chain rule
with partial derivatives.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.760
So let's put that aside and
let's explore another property

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.600
of partial derivatives, and then
we're ready to get the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.080
intuition behind exact
equations.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.070
Because you're going to find,
it's fairly straightforward to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.210
solve exact equations, but the
intuition is a little bit

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.140
more-- well, I don't want to say
it's difficult, because if

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.890
you have the intuition,
you have it.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.490
So what if I had, say, this
function, psi, and I were to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.580
take the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, first.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.510
I'll just write psi.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.640
I don't have to write
x and y every time.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.890
And then I were to take the
partial derivative with

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.485
respect to y.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.730
So just as a notation, this you
could write as, you could

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.620
kind of view it as you're
multiplying the operators, so

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.050
it could be written like this.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.400
The partial del squared times
psi, or del squared psi, over

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.540
del y del, or curly d x.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.330
And that can also be written
as-- and this is my preferred

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.040
notation, because it doesn't
have all this extra junk

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.800
everywhere.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.350
You could just say, well, the
partial, we took the partial,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.050
with respect to x, first. So
this just means the partial of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.240
psi, with respect to x.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.060
And then we took the partial,
with respect to y.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.870
So that's one situation
to consider.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.970
What happens when we take the
partial, with respect to x,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.650
and then y?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.100
So with respect to x, you hold
y constant to get just the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.190
partial, with respect to x.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.000
Ignore the y there.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.060
And then you hold the x
constant, and you take the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.670
partial, with respect to y.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.480
So what's the difference between
that and if we were to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.370
switch the order?

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.970
So what happens if we were to--
I'll do it in a different

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.400
color-- if we had psi, and we
were to take the partial, with

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.480
respect to y, first, and then
we were to take the partial,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.510
with respect to x?

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.640
So just the notation, just so
you're comfortable with it,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.660
that would be-- so partial
x, partial y.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360
And this is the operator.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750
And it might be a little
confusing that here, between

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.060
these two notations, even though
they're the same thing,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.740
the order is mixed.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.250
That's just because it's
just a different way of

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.910
thinking about it.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.990
This says, OK, partial first,
with respect to x, then y.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.160
This views it more as the
operator, so we took the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.000
partial of x first, and then
we took y, like you're

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.950
multiplying the operators.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.840
But anyway, so this can also be
written as the partial of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.070
y, with respect to x-- sorry,
the partial of y, and then we

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.910
took the partial of that
with respect to x.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.980
Now, I'm going to tell you right
now, that if each of the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.840
first partials are continuous--
and most of the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.510
functions we've dealt with in
a normal domain, as long as

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780
there aren't any
discontinuities, or holes, or

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.070
something strange in the
function definition, they

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.290
usually are continuous.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.990
And especially in a first-year
calculus or differential

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.810
course, we're probably going to
be dealing with continuous

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.620
functions in soon. our domain.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.480
If both of these functions are
continuous, if both of the

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.410
first partials are continuous,
then these two are going to be

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.170
equal to each other.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.950
So psi of xy is going to
be equal to psi of yx.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.220
Now, we can use this knowledge,
which is the chain

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.870
rule using partial derivatives,
and this

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.060
knowledge to now solve a certain
class of differential

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.060
equations, first order
differential equations, called

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.270
exact equations.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.860
And what does an exact
equation look like?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.990
An exact equation
looks like this.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.710
The color picking's
the hard part.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.290
So let's say this is my
differential equation.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.550
I have some function
of x and y.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.830
So I don't know, it could
be x squared times

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.920
cosine of y or something.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.650
I don't know, it could be
any function of x and y.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.350
Plus some function of x and y,
we'll call that n, times dy,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.900
dx is equal to 0.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.520
This is-- well, I don't know if
it's an exact equation yet,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.880
but if you saw something of this
form, your first impulse

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.990
should be, oh-- well, actually,
your very first

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.500
impulse is, is this separable?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.180
And you should try to play
around with the algebra a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.620
little bit to see if it's
separable, because that's

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.210
always the most straightforward
way.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.770
If it's not separable, but you
can still put it in this form,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.460
you say, hey, is it
an exact equation?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.340
And what's an exact equation?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.270
Well, look immediately.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.600
This pattern right here
looks an awful

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.000
lot like this pattern.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.210
What if M was the partial of
psi, with respect to x?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.920
What if psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.710
What if this was psi,
with respect to x?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.570
And what if this was psi,
with respect to y?

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.500
So psi, with respect to
y, is equal to N.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.950
What if?

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.670
I'm just saying, we don't
know for sure, right?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.500
If you just see this someplace
randomly, you won't know for

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.200
sure that this is the partial
of, with respect to x of some

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.060
function, and this is the
partial, with respect to y of

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.830
some function.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.810
But we're just saying,
what if?

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.650
If this were true, then we
could rewrite this as the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.870
partial of psi, with respect to
x, plus the partial of psi,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.680
with respect to y, times
dy, dx, equal to 0.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.050
And this right here, the left
side right there, that's the

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.790
same thing as this, right?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.040
This is just the derivative of
psi, with respect to x, using

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.940
the partial derivative
chain rule.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.710
So you could rewrite it.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.130
You could rewrite, this is just
the derivative of psi,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.480
with respect to x, inside
the function of x,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.410
y, is equal to 0.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.730
So if you see a differential
equation, and it has this

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.070
form, and you say, boy, I can't
separate it, but maybe

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.030
it's an exact equation.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.940
And frankly, if that was what
was recently covered before

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.800
the current exam, it probably
is an exact equation.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.940
But if you see this form,
you say, boy, maybe

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.070
it's an exact equation.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.580
If it is an exact equation-- and
I'll show you how to test

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.350
it in a second using this
information-- then this can be

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.550
written as the derivative of
some function, psi, where this

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.840
is the partial of psi,
with respect to x.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.720
This is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.655
And then if you could write it
like this, and you take the

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:01.370
derivative of both sides--
sorry, you take the

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.890
antiderivative of both sides--
and you would get psi of x, y

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.070
is equal to c as a solution.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.770
So there are two things that we
should be caring you about.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.470
Then you might be saying, OK,
Sal, you've walked through

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.550
psi's, and partials,
and all this.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.020
One, how do I know that it's
an exact equation?

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.590
And then, if it is an exact
equation, which tells us that

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.290
there is some psi, then how
do I solve for the psi?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.380
So the way to figure out is it
an exact equation, is to use

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.690
this information right here.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.150
We know that if psi and its
derivatives are continuous

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.100
over some domain, that when
you take the partial, with

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.760
respect to x and then y, that's
the same thing as doing

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.980
it in the other order.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.930
So we said, this is
the partial, with

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.180
respect to x, right?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.920
And this is the partial,
with respect to y.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.880
So if this is an exact equation,
if this is the exact

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.250
equation, if we were take the
partial of this, with respect

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.330
to y, right?

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.600
If we were to take the partial
of M, with respect to y-- so

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.560
the partial of psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.490
If we were to take the partial
of those, with respect to y--

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.450
so we could just rewrite that as
that-- then that should be

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:28.090
equal to the partial of N,
with respect to x, right?

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.976
The partial of psi, with respect
to y, is equal to N.

00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:34.760
So if we take the partial, with
respect to x, of both of

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.964
these, we know from this that
these should be equal, if psi

00:08:40.964 --> 00:08:44.400
and its partials are continuous
over that domain.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.320
So then this will
also be equal.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.990
So that is actually the
test to test if

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.930
this is an exact equation.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.300
So let me rewrite all of that
again and summarize it a

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.690
little bit.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:04.870
So if you see something of the
form, M of x, y plus N of x,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.580
y, times dy, dx is equal to 0.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.110
And then you take the partial
derivative of M, with respect

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:18.280
to y, and then you take the
partial derivative of N, with

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.030
respect to x, and they are equal
to each other, then--

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.410
and it's actually if and only
if, so it goes both ways--

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.930
this is an exact equation, an
exact differential equation.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.410
This is an exact equation.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.510
And if it's an exact equation,
that tells us that there

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:47.140
exists a psi, such that the
derivative of psi of x, y is

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.200
equal to 0, or psi of x, y is
equal to c, is a solution of

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.050
this equation.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:58.480
And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, is

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.740
equal to M.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.760
And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.340
equal to N.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.550
And I'll show you in the next
video how to actually use this

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.810
information to solve for psi.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.640
So here are some things
I want to point out.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.720
This is going to be the partial
derivative of psi,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.620
with respect to x, but when we
take the kind of exact test,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.590
we take it with respect to y,
because we want to get that

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.080
mixed derivative.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.410
Similarly, this is going to be
the partial derivative of psi,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.030
with respect to y, but when we
do the test, we take the

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.500
partial of it with respect
to x so we get that mixed

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.730
derivative.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.570
This is with respect to y,
and then with respect to

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.920
x, so you get this.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.300
Anyway, I know that might be a
little bit involved, but if

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.360
you understood everything I did,
I think you'll have the

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.390
intuition behind why
the methodology of

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.470
exact equations works.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.950
I will see you in the next
video, where we will actually

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.400
solve some exact equations See
