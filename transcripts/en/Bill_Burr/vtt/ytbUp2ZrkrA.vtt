1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.550
like a boss

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.870
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.590
<v 0>it's like halfway through this season,</v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.580
six of a 77 sunset strip.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Um,
and evidently see,
as I said,
season six,
you gotta watch it.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.670
It's on at 4:00 AM on Btby.
Just take the fucking thing.

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
I want to get more people to watch it because I'm worried because I found out

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.080
that they started broadcasting all the episodes back in November and I missed

9
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:38.040
the first five seasons and we're getting towards the end here of season six

10
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.990
because they didn't do a full season.

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.350
They got canceled like three quarters of the way through.
Um,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.060
and I'd like to see the original ones because I'd like to see what La look back

13
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.500
then.
You know,
hopefully they do some exterior's,

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.900
although I know most of it was formed on the backlot filmed on the backlog in

15
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.000
Warner brothers.
Um,

16
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.810
but uh,
I'm loving this season,

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.360
so I'm worried that the other one's going to be a little hokey cause I guess a

18
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.760
lot of people didn't like seasoned six.
First of all,

19
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:12.440
they fired the whole fucking cast as I butchered.
Sorry.

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.600
Um,

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.060
but I also didn't realize that they made Efram Zimbalist juniors character a lot

22
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.480
more surly and uh,
but I'm loving them.

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.870
So now I'm worried that I saw season six first.

24
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:24.980
And if I go back and look at the others,

25
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:28.520
I'm not going to like the show the same with the other people cause I get you

26
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.940
just get used to how the guy behaves,
you know.
But some of the lines,
man,

27
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.440
some of the shit that people say on that

28
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.610
<v 1>blessing in disguise.
This is a big hotel in Facebook.
Know what's wrong.</v>

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.900
I don't lie.
I thought maybe you'd know the truth when you heard it.

30
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.010
Man Once told me he didn't have a gun.
It was the truth.

31
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.440
I think I should've asked him if he had a knife.

32
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.700
[inaudible] was so happy.
Yes sir.

33
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.450
Seven 85

34
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.890
<v 0>here's some things in like,
you know,
women are,
are,
are,</v>

35
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.940
are talking about how guys behave around them.
You know,

36
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.870
like in some of the shit that they say,
it's like Jesus Christ.
I mean,

37
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.660
I'm sure that guy is out there,
but what the fuck,
you know,

38
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.390
since season six of psalm 77 sunset strip,

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.740
they sounds like what some of these women and describing in some of the shit I

40
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:31.790
heard them say,
guys saying to women on that show pipe down,

41
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.560
shut up.

42
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.690
Not to mention F F from tries to bang his fucking secretary.

43
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.133
<v 1>Sure.</v>

44
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.140
After we finished,
we here

45
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.960
<v 0>tried to look up her dress one ups.</v>

46
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.710
I'm just sitting there on this guy would get me Tude so fucking fast and have

47
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:59.260
his full head of hair spinning.
Right.

48
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.620
And then my favorite one ever faber one ever is that mentioned on another

49
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.100
podcast is when he sat down in um,

50
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.460
this episode with the actor that ended up playing the professor or Gilligan's

51
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.290
island.
Sorry,
I'm talking through yawns right now.

52
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.310
<v 2>Why don't you to see you let them out of that cage that at least we'll keep the</v>

53
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.250
vampires.
I mean the bats from becoming a nuisance.
It's a good idea,
professor.

54
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.710
Come on,
let's go shouting it.
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.950
You better get the girls to put a dressing on that moon right now.
Hey,

56
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.290
I better do it right now because I try to come up with empire.

57
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.960
They don't even look at me.
Oh,

58
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.530
I don't want you with the skipper ever mentioning this vampire business again.

59
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.430
There's no sense that upsetting togethers over anything so preposterous.
Agreed.

60
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.460
<v 0>The accident played the professor in Gilligan's island and need,</v>

61
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:47.150
the guy was three drinks in
and firms meeting them.

62
00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:50.720
It's the middle of the day and the guy orders his fourth drink

63
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.060
and a informal goes.
You've got a pretty active eligible for lunchtime.

64
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.440
You on the sauce.

65
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.973
<v 1>Oh.
What do you think</v>

66
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.590
before you got to slow down and go to the store from here,

67
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.020
you wind up trying to sell toy elephants at Democrats.

68
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.280
Is that all you got to say?

69
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.620
Take a deep breath and let's come out of the starting gate together.

70
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.130
I've already told you,
is there anything you want to change?

71
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.330
I don't know what you mean by that.

72
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.540
I mean you've got a pretty active elbow for lunchtime.
Are you on the juice?

73
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.770
No alcohol.
He had a headache.
I saw her,

74
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.650
at least I was sure that I did know.
I don't know.
I don't know what to think.

75
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.440
<v 0>That is the one thing also that I love about that show.</v>

76
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.970
It makes you feel better about drinking and smoking cause uh,

77
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.810
that from Zimbalist almost made 90.

78
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.960
<v 0>And there's barely a scene.</v>

80
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.840
He's not smoking a cigarette and he's really smoking it too.

81
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:56.440
And that's just on the tape that they use.
So who knows?
Um,

82
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.473
<v 1>all right.</v>

83
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.470
<v 0>With that,
should I read a little bit of advertising?
Yeah.
Why don't I do that?</v>

84
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.390
<v 3>No pressure yet.
We can lift the egg
and the bandaid.</v>

85
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.890
Plastic Strip never comes loop.
Maybe you don't want to boil eggs this way,

86
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.420
that you do want the extra protection of bandaid plastic strip.

87
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.560
They take better care of little customs scratching.
They stay put.
