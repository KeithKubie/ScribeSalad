00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.230
The best part of waking up is no caffeine
in your cup.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.460
Wait.. what?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.809
that’s no fun.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.610
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.820
I need my caffeine in the morning.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.200
i’m a total zombie without it.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.020
And so are millions of other Americans.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.250
Nearly 83% of the population drinks coffee,
according to the National Coffee Association.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.390
Another survey by Zagat found that most people
drink 2.1 cups a day.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.680
And that’s not a bad thing.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.710
Some studies show that coffee can boost your
focus and even help prevent diabetes and lower

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.030
the risk of liver disease.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.790
But for some the caffeine leaves them anxious
and jittery.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.090
But maybe those people still like the taste
but not the perks, so for them, decaf is the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.090
way to go.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.870
But how do you decaffeinate coffee?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.860
Big shout out to our viewer Jasper Lithgow
for asking this very good question.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.239
Caffeine occurs naturally in some plants,
like the cocoa tree, Coffea plants, and Camellia

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.999
sinensis from which tea is made.

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.190
Like I said, naturally, so any decaffeinating
process is pretty unnatural.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.449
The first decaffeination process was really
unnatural.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.710
it was even a little dangerous.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.280
German merchant Ludwig Roselius accidently
discovered that salt water soaked the caffeine

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.110
out of his coffee beans while they shipped
across the ocean.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.970
And for some reason he thought this was a
totally good idea.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.910
So he tried to recreate it by steaming the
beans and using a solvent to remove the caffeine.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.930
Unfortunately he picked benzene which according
to the Center for Disease Control is a known

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.960
carcinogen and can cause some serious discomfort
like, stomach pain, dizziness and even death.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.100
So yeah that’s not good.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.090
While benzene is no longer used, other chemicals
are still used to remove caffeine.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.340
The process is a little complicated.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.100
Beans are first soaked in water, which opens
the pores in the bean so the caffeine dissolves.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.180
But so does some of the flavor.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.770
This water then gets treated with a solvent,
typically dichloromethane and ethyl acetate,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.310
for about ten hours.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.480
This separates the caffeine from the flavors.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.080
Finally the mix gets heated to evaporate the
solvents and the caffeine.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.740
This treated water gets returned to the bean
so they can re-soak up the flavor.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.990
Typically this is what that “natural”
is talking about when a package says it’s

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.990
“naturally decaffeinated”.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.740
I know, i know, it doesn’t sound completely
naturally.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.590
But one of the solvents, ethyl acetate pretty
natural, it’s found in a lot of fruits.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.230
Unfortunately it’s difficult to extract,
so most manufacturers use a synthetic version.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260
Another process gets a little fancier.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.980
The Swiss Water Process relies on simple concepts
like osmosis and solubility to remove the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.060
caffeine.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
Using water from mountains in british columbia,
the beans are bathed in really hot water to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.560
draw out the caffeine.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.210
which is then drawn through a charcoal filter
which catches the large caffeine molecules

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.030
but not the other good things you’d want
to stay in the bean like the flavor.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.130
So then that water is then returned to the
beans to put the flavor back.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.290
But these are “indirect” ways of removing
caffeine, the solvents never touch the beans!

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110
A more direct way uses CO2.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.950
After the beans are soaked in water, they’re
placed in a stainless steel container called

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.180
an extraction vessel.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.880
Liquid CO2 is then forced into the beans at
enormous pressure.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.600
At 1,000 pounds per square inch!

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.260
The CO2 draws out the caffeine but leaves
flavors behind.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.260
That’s so weird and science fiction-y.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
While decaf might seem weird, and kind of
pointless… some studies show it still retains

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.430
some of the health benefits!

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.700
I mean decaf still has caffeine.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.910
One study published in the Journal of Analytical
Toxicology found that most major brands have

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.160
around 8.6 milligrams to 13.9 milligrams of
caffeine.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.819
Compared to a normal cup which has around
85 milligrams.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.819
One study published in the journal Nutritional
Neuroscience found that a cup of decaf might

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.690
help the way the brain metabolizes energy.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.370
It could also prove useful for helping prevent
and treat decline from diabetes or aging.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
No matter your coffee style, there’s no
doubt caffeine can pack a punch.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.660
Trace explains exactly what caffeine does
you in this video here.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:49.620
How much coffee do you drink?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.620
Would you do decaf?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.090

science of food, leave those too!

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.999
