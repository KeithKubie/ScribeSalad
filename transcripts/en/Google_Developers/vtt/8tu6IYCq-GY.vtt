DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.790
I'm Daniel Sieberg with
Google Developers

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.930
Live here at I/O 2013.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.350
And I am joined right now by a
couple of gentlemen from the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.280
Google Play Games team, I want
to say, if that's accurate.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.110
Lead PM, Greg Hartrell and PM,
Duncan Curtis, thank you both

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.250
for joining us here.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.280
GREG HARTRELL: Thanks
for having us, Dan.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.570
Happy to be here.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.750
DANIEL SIEBERG: So let's start
by talking about what Hugo

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.830
announced today, Hugo Barra,
when he was up on stage,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.350
talking about Google
Play Games service.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.480
What is it exactly?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.350
What does it mean
to developers?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.130
Give me the nuts
and bolts here.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.990
GREG HARTRELL: What we learned
today in the keynote is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.370
there's incredible momentum
around Android in terms of the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.040
sheer number of installs, and
particularly around--

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.048
it's shown itself to be this
tremendous gaming platform for

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:53.302
game developers.

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:56.060
And so what we've announced
today is a set of services, a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.360
part of Google Play services,
that allow us to effectively

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.910
bring games to the next level
on Android and a number of

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.080
cross-platform scenarios.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.770
It's really around
four pivots.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.140
The first is achievements.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.730
So you can have badges that--
virtual trophies--

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.770
that increase engagement in your
game, social and public

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.250
leaderboards and leverage
G+ circles.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.070
So you could be number one
amongst your friends and maybe

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.850
not necessarily number
one in the world.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.640
We have a set of APIs that we
just affectionately refer to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240
as "Cloud Save" that effectively
squirrel away

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.950
state for your game, save game
progress, settings, a number

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.000
of other virtual progress
that's in games.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.340
And the last part on Android, we
have Real Time Multiplayer,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560
which allows up to four player
simultaneous play with support

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260
for more players coming soon.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.030
And the theme around this is
really, we're bringing the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.570
best of Google to gamers now.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.280
The things that we're good at,
which is mobile and cloud, and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.900
allowing game developers to do
what they do very well, which

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.220
is make fantastic entertainment
and fantastic

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.640
gaming experiences.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just to be
clear, you mentioned this

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.050
cross-platform idea, but
Android, iOS, these are

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.250
services that are going to work
across all these devices.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.760
And we saw today in some of
the demos where they were

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280
actually working with
each other.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.720
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah,
that's right.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.000
Part of the services is actually
providing native SDKs

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.440
for both Android and iOS.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.000
And then our REST APIs
effectively allow any

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.450
developer to integrate across
any interconnected device.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.180
And what's fantastic about
this is just giving game

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.110
developers the ability to
build a community around

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.240
games, across any number
of screens.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.210
So it's also demonstrative of
our commitment to being a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.090
cross-platform play for
game services as well.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now I heard
reference to the-- you were

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.010
talking about the leaderboard
idea.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.320
Far be it from gamers
to be competitive.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.250
I'm sure we all know that that's
a big appeal to any

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.510
gamer to be listed in
the leaderboard.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.630
You mentioned between your
friends, but between the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.620
all-time list as well.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.570
Tell me about the fact that when
somebody beats someone's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.530
score, or you get higher up on
the leaderboard, this gets

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.960
posted on Google+?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.410
I could actually brag about
my score, essentially?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.755
DUNCAN CURTIS: Look, of course
you can always brag about it

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:13.170
on Google+.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.440
But what we're really doing is
we're using it as a set of

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.510
social discovery mechanisms,
social play mechanisms around

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.410
your Google+ circles.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.410
So just how you're going to find
your friends to play with

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.490
and who you're going to game
with, and who you're going to

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.710
compare yourself against.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.230
You can also compare yourself
against anyone who wants to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.250
put their score out
there publicly.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.960
As I said, you can definitely
still brag on G+.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.720
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
good to know.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.700
And then what about the idea
that as you use different

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.870
devices, if you achieve or get
to a certain level on one

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750
device, you go to another one
and sometimes you end up

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.730
having to play that level again,
which can obviously be

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.480
a little frustrating.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.840
As much as you may love
the game, you want to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.700
kind of move on.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.980
But now that will not
be the case, right?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.480
I mean you can actually have
that, move from one device and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.530
pick it up where you left off.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.190
GREG HARTRELL: Absolutely.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.580
And this goes into those
Cloud Save APIs we

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.930
were talking about.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.620
Because they're cross-platform,
game

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.900
developers now can basically
squirrel away the game save

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.290
data, such that that way if you
have won level 14 on your

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.950
game on your phone, and then
decide to go home and pick up

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.240
a tablet, or if you lost your
device or have a new device,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.630
you can effectively pop open
that game and pick up where

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.240
you left off.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.580
And we think that's a really
powerful scenario.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.100
Specifically to that service is
that game developers will

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.590
get basically four keys that
they'll be able to squirrel

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.500
away 128k of data.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.980
And that's a pretty good simple
surgical tool for game

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.570
developers to maintain
that state.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.120
And then because again it's
available on Android, iOS, and

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.300
effectively any interconnected
device, we think that game

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.780
developers will be able to use
that in really creative ways

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.510
to solve this problem that you
just described and probably

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.850
quite a few others.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: Let's step
back just a little bit.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.060
If you could talk to me about
the game developers community

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.200
on Play, where is this going?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.400
What are some exciting
innovations that you've seen

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400
in mobile gaming?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.450
Are there some examples you can
point to that are really

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.580
cool these days?

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.060
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.540
We've seen a number
of partners.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.510
We have over 30 launch titles
currently that have started

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.610
using Google Play Service.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.930
I think Duncan and I have
seen some incredible

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.920
implementations of the
game services that

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.640
we've launched today.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.690
One of my favorites is a title
called Frozen Front, where

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.800
they've taken our Realtime
Multiplayer and they've

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.210
effectively created a turn-based
atmosphere.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.520
So this is my definition
of it.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.420
It's a bit of a real time
strategy game, where you move

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.510
around pieces on a board.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.410
And then similar to the way a
tabletop game would work, I

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.570
would send my moves to you and
then you see my moves play out

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.950
on your screen.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.470
So I think that's a really
clever implementation and a

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.670
really engaging experience
that comes from that.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.820
DUNCAN CURTIS: I would
say the same.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.840
For me, I really do like Frozen
Front's implementation.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.550
But I really like World
of Goo's leader board.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.510
So as you play through World
of Goo, it's sort of a

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.310
building mechanic game.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.690
And as you proceed through the
levels you get more building

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.750
materials for your
leader board.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.960
So the way you compare yourself
against the other

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.740
people in your circles
is you actually get

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.050
to build your tower.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.250
So the more skillful you are
with just a few pieces of

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.050
building material you have,
you can actually build a

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.120
better tower.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.750
Or you can try again, maybe a
slightly different structure

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.670
will actually get you
further along.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.940
And since they actually get
your friends to show up in

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.610
that level with you, that your
friends' pictures appear on

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.350
little clouds.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.790
For the taller your
building goes.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.190
The little friends' faces are
on clouds so you can see who

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.360
you're actually beating.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.740
And it really drove me,
personally, to want to just

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.080
those extra few meters or feet
so that I could beat

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.070
Greg, in this case.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.420
DANIEL SIEBERG: Not that you
guys are competitive.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.230
GREG HARTRELL: No, no.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.600
Duncan hands down beat
me at that game.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: And what about
that multiplayer component?

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.440
How much is that becoming a part
of the gaming experience

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.140
within what we're talking about
today and going forward?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.160
DUNCAN CURTIS: It's really
becoming an important element.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.160
I mean one of the really key
things that we're launching is

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.630
atuomatching.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.640
So you'll be able to not just
play with your current group

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.980
of friends on G+ and in your
circles, you'll actually be

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.680
able to play with other people
within the world.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.970
So you can jump in and be like,
wow I'd really like to

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.600
play a game of "Riptide II." But
I know my friends aren't

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.830
around at the moment.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.040
So I'm just going to jump in and
choose an automatch player

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.870
and I'll get matched
up with someone

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.110
elsewhere around the world.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: And how
does that work?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.190
If I'm that other person
somewhere in the world, do I

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.160
get a notification that
someone wants to play?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.770
DUNCAN CURTIS: We'll be matching
people up who, at a

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.470
very similar moment, have
pressed, hey, I would like to

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.190
play a game with another
automatch person.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.460
And it'll be really nice for
players to be able to jump to

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.460
those gaming experiences
whenever they want.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.280
Sometimes it's hard to get
your friends to play at

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.950
exactly that right moment.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.530
So when it is one of
your friends, we--

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.840
let's say I invited you to come
play a game and you're in

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.230
my circles.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.970
I said, let's play a game of
"Riptide II." You'd get a

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.420
notification.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.400
It would be like, bing, Duncan
Curtis would like to play

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.680
"Riptide II" with you.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520
Click.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.490
Assuming you've got the game
installed, you press Play and

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.830
straight into the game.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.240
And our game will begin.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.360
So this is going to be a really
powerful tool for

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.740
developers to reengage audiences
with the game that

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.390
they may have lapsed
from playing.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.840
Or as a really great discovery
mechanism for me at inviting

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.850
friends who haven't played
the game yet.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.810
Because if you haven't had the
game installed when I send you

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.100
the notification, you'll be able
to go check it out in the

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.400
Play Store.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:35.750
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.299
Let's go back.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:40.179
I want to go back to that
cross-platform or cross-device

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:40.590
engagement.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.510
I'm forgetting the name, forgive
me, the name of the

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.320
game that was demoed with the
cars racing on the track.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.260
And it was going across
the different screens.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.520
That was fascinating to
see how that works.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.570
DUNCAN CURTIS: I feel
nostalgic about it.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.810
And it was meant to recreate the
idea of the race cars with

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.350
the [? trigger car ?].

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.220
Anyway, talk me through
what that--

00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.860
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.630
We have a sample app that's
called Nostalgic Racer that

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.290
allows you to have a little
bit of a retro

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.650
feel to it that way.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.360
In what's great about that is
just having the ability to use

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.860
those services across a variety
of platforms, right?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.050
And so achievements,
leaderboards, and Cloud Saver

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.700
APIs that any game developer can
take and, with our samples

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.400
or in some of the demonstrations
that you've

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.660
seen, integrate those
into the title.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.130
And basically have it work on
an Android device, an iOS

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.300
device, or any other
interconnected

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.150
device as it were.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.430
And we think that that
cross-platform play creates

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.070
demonstrations like those.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.770
And adds a little bit of
a wow factor that way.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.830
But plus what Duncan was saying
earlier is that-- it's

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.960
really about developers creating
a really strong

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.640
community of gamers that they
have across whatever device

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.460
they happen to have access to.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.790
And we know that developers
have told us that that's a

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.760
really important
thing for them.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.620
And that's kind of been the
guiding principle for us

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.380
designing what we've designed.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.250
DUNCAN CURTIS: I think a good
way to put it is , well would

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.315
be to say that, not only will
we enable developers to

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:04.650
actually connect people across
devices where they want to

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.120
play, but for the first time you
will really be able to add

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.170
your G+ friends on your iOS
device or on your Android

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.560
device, or on the web.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.640
And all of those communities
will be able to

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.550
feed into each other.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.940
So people will be around
when you want to game.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.620
I think that's really
important.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.890
DANIEL SIEBERG: And tell me,
if you could look into your

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.520
crystal ball, where
is this headed?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.120
What are the coming
developments here.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.560
For any developers thinking,
this is awesome stuff today,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.820
but even beyond this is
there anything you can

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.710
kind of point to?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.510
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.530
I think today what we focused
on is building this really

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.320
strong foundation for
game developers.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.790
And we think of it as kind of
a first step in many things.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.340
And so what we've heard from
our developers is that

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.490
integrating with our
game services

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.880
have been really fantastic.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.500
One developer specifically
turned to us and said, wow

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.890
with multiplayer it would have
taken me weeks if not months

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.880
to be able to integrate
something that complex.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.590
And frankly deal with the server
configuration, setting

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.310
up peer to peer sessions, all of
the really hard networking

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.070
problems that come with that.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.950
And that developer specifically
was able

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.970
to do it in a day.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.080
And we were pretty impressed
when we had heard that.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.910
And they were really
obviously relieved

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.850
that it was that easy.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.230
So I think that, looking ahead,
what we plan on doing

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.840
is listening to our developers
who put together the service

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.260
[INAUDIBLE] in their
titles, and launch

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.390
it, learn from that.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.590
And a frame of reference here is
to think about Google Play

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.870
as really only, it's just
over a year old now.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.030
And the momentum that Google
Play has created is indicative

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.730
of the way that Google executes
and the way that we

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.920
deliver on a lot of
our services.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.800
We want to maintain that
momentum with games, listen to

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.480
our developers, and improve the
services as we go forward.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.960
DUNCAN CURTIS: I can't wait til
we look back in a year and

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.830
be like, look how fast
we've come forward.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.760
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.680
DUNCAN CURTIS: And we'll be
developing features based on

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.540
our developer feedback and our
community feedback as well.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.150
Those are really important to
us to choose what those next

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.010
features and wins for
us are going to be.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.100
And tell me a little bit about
the experience of working with

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.060
these 30 partners.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.770
And how they've been
to work with.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.580
I'm imagining that this has been
an exciting opportunity

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580
for them, but also for us.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.290
GREG HARTRELL: Absolutely.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.760
We have a fantastic roster
of partners.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.930
They come from actually very
different types of studios.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:25.290
Game developers are very large
outfits or a guy literally in

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:25.900
his basement.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.320
DUNCAN CURTIS: Small, scrappy
developer, yeah.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.580
DANIEL SIEBERG: Are most of
them from a sort of a

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.765
traditional game development
background?

00:12:30.765 --> 00:12:32.910
Or were some of them almost
starting up in a way looking

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.220
at this opportunity?

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.650
GREG HARTRELL: The truth is it's
actually been a really

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.450
healthy mix.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.730
We've been working with
developers like Glue and

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.450
Gameloft who have some
fantastic, really rich

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.980
experiences that you really feel
when you play them on a

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.980
tablet or some high definition
experience.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.800
But then Duncan brought up
titles like "World of Goo."

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.030
And we have titles like "Mega
Jump" that launched today.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.840
I think the other one that we
were playing around the office

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.690
was "Plague Inc."

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.910
DUNCAN CURTIS: Plague Inc.
was really good.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.120
We've been playing "Virtual
Families" too as well.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.460
We've been playing a
lot of these games.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: Be honest,
that's all you guys do all day

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.850
long is just to play games.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.990
DUNCAN CURTIS: It's hard.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.890
GREG HARTRELL: I don't
know how we

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.960
survive on a normal day.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.230
DANIEL SIEBERG: Somebody
has to do it.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.250
GREG HARTRELL: Right, somebody's
got to do it.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.200
DANIEL SIEBERG: Anything else
you guys wanted to mention

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.230
while we've got you here?

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.220
GREG HARTRELL: I think it really
just comes down to,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.590
we're really excited to see
our partners launch their

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.570
games today and create some
of the fantastic gaming

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.420
experience they have, hearing
their feedback around what

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.430
Game Services has provided
them, giving them

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.910
opportunities to engage players,
retain them build

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.090
discovery mechanisms for them
to get their games known.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.250
And frankly just having
fantastic experiences that

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.720
players are going to
know and love for

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.070
many months and years.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.120
DUNCAN CURTIS: This
is just the start.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.890
DANIEL SIEBERG: So if this is
a race-- we're going back to

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.057
the car race them-- we've just
gone off the start line?

00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:55.400
DUNCAN CURTIS: We've literally
just gone off the start line.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.410
We're excited.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: I'm excited to
see what's going to come out

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.170
of all this.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.160
GREG HARTRELL: As are we

00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.730
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.700
Well Greg, Duncan, thank you
both for joining us here.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.740
We really appreciate it.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.090
That's going to do it for
us here at Google

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.420
Developers Live for now.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.430
Hang tight because we are going
to be right back to talk

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.890
about cloud.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.350
Guys, thanks again for us.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.600
Appreciate it.
