00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.870
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.750
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Colombo, Sri Lanka

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.070
which is an amazing city for food lovers.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.950
The spices, the curries, the techniques.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.100
Today we are gonna go on an ultimate

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.810
Sri Lankan food tour of Colombo.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.360
We're gonna start on the
outskirts of the city,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.050
and then work our way into the center,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.930
into the busy market area.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.340
Eating street food along the way.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm gonna share all the food with you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.958
in this video right now!

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.208
(upbeat electro music)

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:40.215
- [Mark] Good morning, Ruzaina!

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.048
- [Ruzaina] Good morning!

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:41.881
- [Mark] How are you?

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:42.714
- [Ruzaina] Fine, thank you!

00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:43.580
- Were are we going first?

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.500
- Okay, first we're going to the outskirts

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470
of Colombo City Limits.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.303
- [Mark] Okay.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:50.136
- [Ruzaina] So we're gonna start from

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:53.490
breakfast street food, and
work our way into Colombo.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.810
- So we're on our way for breakfast first,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.710
we're starting in the morning,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.820
it's a beautiful morning.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.885
It's gonna be an amazing day.

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:01.385
(chill music)

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.590
We drove for about 30 minutes

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950
outside of the center of the city.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.250
We're near to the parliament.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.380
It's kinda like a park:
breezy, tree-lined area.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.090
There's lakes around here,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.360
and there's a row of street food stalls

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.440
that sell a variety of different curries,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.750
as well as a variety of different rotis.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.890
So this is where we're gonna begin,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.030
this is where we're gonna have breakfast.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.613
(food sizzles)

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.899
Dal?

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.816
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.893
Okay, thank you!

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.640
We got the godamba roti, which is the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.597
stuffed roti with the egg,

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.410
and with that onion mixture inside.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.420
And then he chops it up,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.150
he added on both a scoop
of the chicken curry sauce,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.920
and dal on top, and then some pol sambol

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.460
which is the coconut, shredded coconut,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.770
which is one of my favorite
Sri Lankan condiments,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.320
that's what it is, it's a condiment.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.080
It's just like oozy, it's
hot, it's freshly cooked.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.420
Everything is fresh.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120
You can see the egg just
sprouting out of there.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.460
You can feel how that
dough, from the roti,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.820
is kind of like gooey,
and kinda like saturated

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.280
with that curry sauce already.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.113
- Ready?

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:47.946
- [Both] Cheers!

00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:52.114
- Mmm!

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.213
Ohhh!

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.240
Oh that is delicious!

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.684
The chicken curry sauce,
the dal is like starchy.

00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:00.517
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:02.400
- [Mark] And then the Roti is like swollen

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.547
with the curry sauce, it's like--

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:04.750
- [Ruzaina] Yeah because it's absorbed,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.730
it's absorbed all that curry,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.990
so it's like full of flavor.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.823
- Uh huh?

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.304
- [Ruzaina] Awesome, awesome!

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:12.137
- Oh yeah!

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:16.820
That's like very warming, pretty filling

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.553
because it's dough like
soaked up with sauce,

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:22.720
and like it's exactly
what you wanna be eating

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.070
for breakfast in Sri Lanka.

00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:27.211
Mmm.

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:31.230
And the onions in there, the eggs stuffed

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.723
within that roti, that's
what makes it good too.

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:43.035
- [Ruzaina] We don't really
make tea like this anymore

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.726
- [Mark] Ah, okay, whoa.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.560
- [Ruzaina] This is like the proper,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.263
like you know artisan tea.

00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.544
Yeah, real tea.

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:52.545
- [Mark] Proper ginger, too!

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:53.707
- [Ruzaina] Yeah, it's proper ginger.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:55.457
- Ah, that's awesome!

00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:11.903
Oh, the ginger, the ginger!

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.410
Oh that's wonderful, that's wonderful.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.770
The black tea, you taste the ginger

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.900
going down your throat a little bit.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.530
But what's awesome is
it's not powered ginger,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.130
it's not dried ginger,
that's fresh ginger.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.453
That's like ginger juice in there!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.110
You even chew on little chunks of ginger.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.296
That is wonderful.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:34.250
- [Ruzaina] It really
does help your digest

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.485
- In one bite, I wanna-

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:36.470
- Yeah, it'll help your digest as well.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.640
- I wanna get all that ginger.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.993
Okay, swirl it around.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.763
Mmm,

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:43.858
mmm hmm,

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:46.960
that's a mouthful of ginger.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.810
That was wonderful, delicious breakfast.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.920
Great way to start this
Sri Lankan food tour.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.278
We're moving on to the next place.

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:56.861
(upbeat music)

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.380
- [Shop Keeper] Hello, hello!

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.650
- Good thank you, how are you?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.483
Oh yeah!

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.600
So actually the day that
we made this food tour,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.280
the street food, the
Colombo street food tour,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.220
this restaurant was closed.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.170
So we had to come back the next day.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.408
But this is a spot that Ruzaina said

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:37.320
we could not miss, right?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.110
- No, no, not in this area.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.550
- [Mark] In this area this is
one of your favorite spots?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.800
And what are we gonna eat here?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.301
- [Ruzaina] Uh, what do you want?

00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.210
There's an array of stuff

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.883
- Definitely everything.

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.666
- You want the beef as well?

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:54.499
- Sure.

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.332
How are you?

00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:56.360
- Hi, I'm good, fine.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.594
- Good good, you like the food here?

00:05:58.594 --> 00:05:59.610
- Yes.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.900
- Great, we got here at the right time.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.720
The food is fresh, it smells so good.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.010
You walk inside and you smell the aroma,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.963
like filling the humidity of the air.

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:18.020
- [Ruzaina] Okay, it's pumpkin.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.250
- So this is one of those restaurants

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.500
where they have everything
in the cabinet display,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.250
and it's such an incredibly
hard chose what to order.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.480
So we just decided not
to make that choice,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.620
and just to get everything
they have available.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.120
So they dished us out, they were nice to

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.970
dish us out little portions of everything.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.540
We put chili all over it.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.270
There's coconut, is that a sambol?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.800
- Yeah, that is a coconut sambol.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.720
And there's the onions sambol.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.931
- [Mark] Oh nice!

00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:44.980
- [Ruzaina] This is the salted fish

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.690
- [Mark] Oh that's salted fish with--

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.820
- [Ruzaina] With capsicum
and onions and tomatoes,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.233
it's like a caramel, a
caramel ala thel dala.

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:52.371
- [Mark] The salted fish.

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.820
Scoop some of that salted
fish with that chili capsicum.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.970
Oh that looks good.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.823
Some pumpkin.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.070
It's a pumpkin curry?

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.470
- [Ruzaina] Yes, it's pumpkin.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.620
- [Mark] Have a little bit of that.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.687
Nice, yes the coconut sambol.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.600
Alright, I think that's
good to begin with.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.634
He just brought us over some fried--

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.877
- [Ruzaina] Poppadoms and chilies.

00:07:14.877 --> 00:07:15.942
- [Mark] Poppadoms and chilies.

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:19.610
that is a necessary addition.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.443
- [Ruzaina] It is a must.

00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:21.276
- Alright, I think I'm gonna begin

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.160
with that salted fish.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.653
Mix it in with the rice.

00:07:27.703 --> 00:07:28.536
Mmm mmm.

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:33.240
Oh yeah.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.140
Oh wow that's good!

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.940
Okay, the salted fish,
such a depth of like

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.773
salty flavor.

00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:40.610
And the chilies, kinda crisp,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.120
kinda like just flavorful,
like almost citrusy tasting.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.620
This one is the pumpkin curry.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.630
Oh and you can see just how the sauce

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.750
is like made up of pumpkin,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.180
it's kinda like disintegrated into it.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.920
I'm gonna re-pumpkin.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.370
Actually the entire sauce
is just liquid pumpkin.

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:59.456
(laughter)

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:02.270
- Good right?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.910
- There's coconut milk in it too, right?

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.881
Oh wow, oh that's insane!

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:06.714
- Yeah.

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:11.050
- That's like liquid pumpkin
with liquid coconut milk.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.010
The richness of it, the
like creaminess of it.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.035
- So much flavor and it's so good!

00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:16.868
Cheers!

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:17.701
- Cheers!

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:21.802
Oh, just completely crispy.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.560
Not really spicy, but really fragrant.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.090
Sri Lankan fired chicken.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.960
And what's the batter, is
there spices in it, it there--?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.720
- [Ruzaina] Yeah, they cook
it in like a gravy sauce.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.553
- Okay.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.420
Get my first time, my first time for

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.656
Sri Lankan fried chicken.

00:08:34.656 --> 00:08:35.489
- Yep!

00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:39.882
- Mmm, yeah.

00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:42.477
It is good.

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:46.170
It's got a light spice, but really crispy.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.120
And then this fried
chicken is always good.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.707
- [Ruzaina] Aha, yeah.

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:50.540
- [Mark] It's kinda like dehydrated,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.140
you see the chilies on there, you see the

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.603
curry leaves again, you see
the onions and the tomato.

00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.760
Oh it's good.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.160
Kinda gotta like chew with the grain.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.620
It is a little bit tough.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.050
But because it's such a huge chunk,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.250
you've kinda gotta like,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.826
you wanna like nibble off
little bites at a time.

00:09:17.826 --> 00:09:18.755
- [Ruzaina] Sorry.

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:20.005
- No it's okay.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.830
And then dal just to like wrap it all up.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.733
Onions sambol.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.220
It's like a creamy dressing.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.310
Oh it's amazing, yeah.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.170
It's wonderful.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.540
- They make it sometimes
with coconut milk,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.850
and sometimes with curd.

00:09:51.944 --> 00:09:52.777
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:09:52.777 --> 00:09:53.610
- Thank you very much.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.510
The restaurant is called Milano Hotel.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.370
Amazing food, the mix of dishes.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.020
That salted fish, what else was,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.400
yeah, everything was just good.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.790
That's just a classic
rice throw down meal.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.670
Yeah, and those are some
like, yeah, hearty portions

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.283
of delicious Sri Lankan food.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.521
Alright.

00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:18.104
(upbeat music)

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.760
It would not be a complete Sri Lankan

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.710
street food tour of Colombo
without eating egg hoppers.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.020
And egg hoppers, it's
one of my favorite, like,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.820
snacks in Sri Lanka.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.720
It all begins with a
batter that's made from

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.807
rice flour and coconut milk.

00:10:48.807 --> 00:10:50.990
And it has this like runny texture.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.740
As soon as the rounded pans are hot,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.830
he scoops in a ladle of the batter

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.210
into the rounded pans,
and it's all about that

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.330
flick of the wrist.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.160
Because the key of
hoppers is to have it be,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.640
the batter be thin around the edges,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.510
but be thicker on the bottom.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.430
You can either order plain
hoppers or an egg hopper.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.090
If you order the egg he
drops in an egg immediately,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.730
he waits 'til it's cooked and then

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.470
one version he makes, he like whips up

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.350
the yolks, so that pops the yolks

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.770
so that it's like a
scrambled egg in the middle.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.960
And then one version he
makes with the entire

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.833
yolk still in place, so you
get to pop it on your own.

00:11:33.123 --> 00:11:34.920
I got the two different
versions of the egg hoppers,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.410
one with the yolk still in.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.830
It's just like an entire
fried egg in the middle

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.430
of a circular

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.590
concave,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.950
it's like an edible bowl.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.950
It's like a contact lens,
of an edible contact lens.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.280
Roll it up, the sauce
is all on the inside.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.160
It's already starting to
drip and that's before

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.360
the yolk is even popped.

00:11:58.963 --> 00:11:59.796
- Mmm.

00:12:04.976 --> 00:12:06.630
- Mmm.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.463
Oh yeah!

00:12:08.515 --> 00:12:09.482
Oh that's awesome.

00:12:09.482 --> 00:12:10.315
- Yeah.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.370
- The sauce is incredible.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.890
Really what I love so much about hoppers

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.070
is the dual textures,

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.737
the crispy edges, the like
spongy soft bottom center.

00:12:20.737 --> 00:12:22.513
And I don't even think
I've hit that yolk yet.

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:24.150
- [Ruzaina] No, you haven't, you haven't.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.650
- I need to take another bite.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:28.336
- Mmm, mmm.

00:12:29.345 --> 00:12:30.262
- Mmm, mmm.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.915
Oh yeah.

00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:34.610
I think I got that
entire yolk in one bite.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.070
It's actually dripping down my arm.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.350
(laughter)

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.070
- One more re-saucing and I think I can

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.370
finish it all in one bite.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.800
I think that's a one-biter now.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.400
This could be a messy bite.

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:54.379
Mmm hmm.

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:55.212
And that right there

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.370
is one of the best Sri Lankan snacks

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.280
you could ever have.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.910
That is exactly what
you want to be eating.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.760
Nice to meet you.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.620
When you have an afternoon
snack in Sri Lanka.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.643
Yeah, it's so tasty, it's
so good, it's so like.

00:13:11.643 --> 00:13:13.977
It's so simple but all
about that experience,

00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:18.810
that flick of the wrist to
swirl the batter perfectly

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.572
so that the textures are correct.

00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:23.155
(upbeat music)

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.030
We drove over to an area, a big section

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.760
of Colombo called Pettah.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.973
This is a market area,
it's one of the busiest,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.250
business districts of Colombo.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.140
The railroad station is here.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.410
It's really like the
heart, the beating center

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.243
of Colombo.

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:43.076
And so we're gonna walk around here,

00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:44.240
we're gonna eat a lot of food,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.533
and just explore.

00:13:47.016 --> 00:13:49.320
(trucks beep)

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.810
- It's called achcharu and it's a mix,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.410
he has a mixture of different fruits

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.250
which are all marinated in chilies.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.300
You can see the black pepper,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.120
you can see the sugar sprinkled on it.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.610
I'm sure there's salt.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.500
But it's a mix of different marinades.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.620
Typically he would dish you a container

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.170
and you would just kinda
take it away as a snack.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.480
But he's so nice and
friendly, he's just gonna

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.210
dish us some from the spoon

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.770
just to get some taste tests.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.710
And this is like pineapple,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.560
you can see the black
peppers, is that black pepper?

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.791
- Yeah, this is black crushed pepper.

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:15.624
- Black crushed pepper.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:18.054
- And chili and salt and sugar

00:14:18.054 --> 00:14:20.304
(laughter)

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.123
- Oh yeah.

00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:28.253
It's salty, it's sweet from the pineapple.

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:30.074
I'm getting some black pepper.

00:14:30.074 --> 00:14:31.639
- [Ruzaina] Some amberalla.

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:32.931
- [Mark] Amberalla, okay.

00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:33.764
Cheers!

00:14:33.764 --> 00:14:35.710
- [Ruzaina] Cheers!

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.350
- Mmm.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.060
To me it sort tastes like a green mango.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.920
It has that crispness to
it, it has that sourness.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.320
The black pepper's awesome,

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.800
you've gotta try black
pepper on your fruit.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.330
This one is Sri Lankan olive,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.660
and this on has a totally
different sauce on it,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.240
it's more of like a paste on it,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.190
rather than just that black pepper rub.

00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:57.630
Mmm.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.020
In a way it's more sweet,
like the olive you can taste

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.390
is kinda like creamy, a little bit tart.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.190
It more like has like a sugary sweet

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.796
and sour taste to it.

00:15:07.796 --> 00:15:08.629
That's good too.

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:10.520
But the one that I really wanna try

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.353
is the wood apple.

00:15:11.353 --> 00:15:12.225
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:13.058
- Wood apple is like one of the

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:14.110
national fruits of Sri Lanka.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.760
You said it's a green wood apple?

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.560
- [Ruzina] No it's a raw wood apple.

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:20.270
- Mmm.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.313
Oh wow!

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.283
Oh that's awesome.

00:15:24.283 --> 00:15:27.340
It's sour, it's kinda like chalky,

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.936
like it makes your mouth dry a little bit.

00:15:28.936 --> 00:15:30.780
But at the same time it
makes your mouth like juicy.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.613
It is addictive.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.503
Is this apple?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.610
I think our of all the achcharu marinade,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.060
I like the black pepper marinade.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.670
Somehow, like, the black
pepper really goes well with

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.880
the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.713
Thank you.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.800
This place is called
Bombay Sweetmeat Mart.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.803
Uh, and, oh yeah, check this out.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.470
And they specialize, well they have

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.330
a number of different things

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.960
but especially their faluda.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.673
And faluda is of Persian origin

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:07.120
but you'll find it across Asia.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.640
It's in different formations,
in different variations.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.660
We're gonna try the Sri
Lankan version of faluda.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.560
You've gotta stir it up?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.393
- Yeah.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.800
It's rose syrup.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.672
- [Mark] Rose syrup, okay

00:16:18.672 --> 00:16:20.290
- [Ruzaina] Milk, vermicelli,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.013
sometimes they put jelly
in it and basil seeds.

00:16:23.013 --> 00:16:24.790
- And you can see those little basil seed,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.340
the vermicelli floating around.

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:32.840
Oh yeah, you really taste that floral

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.010
rose flavor to it.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.003
It's sweet, it's kinda like candy tasting.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.850
But then you've got a
lot of textures going on,

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.710
you've got that liquid,

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.530
you've got the noodles
which are sort of gummy,

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.830
and you've got the basil seeds which have

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.790
a little bit like a, they're
kinda like chia seeds,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.390
they have that little snap to them

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.140
in your teeth as you're kinda
like grinding your teeth.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.860
You just kinda slurp up
those vermicelli noodles,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.220
they just kinda slide right down.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.123
Okay and then we've also
got some chicken samosas.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.270
Oh yeah, oh chicken samosas are nice.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.400
There's chicken, there's
lots of onions in there,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.233
lots of onions.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.500
We're getting to one
of the market sections,

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.700
you can smell the dried
fish, there's dried shrimp.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.510
There's all sorts of
spices, there's turmeric,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.250
there's coriander seed and cumin.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.570
The aromas are wonderful.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.650
Immediately step under the
cover and your nostrils

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.140
just fill with the aroma of dried fish.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.700
Dried fish being a very
essential ingredient

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.310
and flavor in Sri Lankan cuisine.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.580
But there's vegetables, there's chilies,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.850
there's tomatoes, there's cucumbers,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.340
there's brinjal eggplant.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.900
There are fruits like mangosteen,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.130
you see pumpkin, you see cabbage.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.040
And then all the dry spices.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.610
This is where just in a few seconds

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.460
you can just get a slight sense

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.260
of the different ingredients
used in Sri Lankan cooking.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.477
Oh yeah!

00:18:02.477 --> 00:18:03.770
- Not yet but I'm ready to.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.603
What's up, my man?

00:18:04.603 --> 00:18:05.436
- [Mark] What's up, my man?

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:06.269
How are you?

00:18:06.269 --> 00:18:07.720
- He's been eating

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.750
- I've already got some peanuts.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.540
- [Mark] Ramen beast!

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.385
- Let's get it!

00:18:11.385 --> 00:18:12.220
(laughter)

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.263
- And we're gonna go
eat some more food now.

00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:16.651
- [Abram] We good?

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.140
- Yeah, we good, yeah?

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.547
Okay, we decided to jump into a--

00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:23.234
How are you guys back there?

00:18:23.234 --> 00:18:24.560
- [All] Wooo!

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.013
- Ready to get aggressive.

00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:27.030
(laughter)

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.520
- We're on our way to go eat.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.770
Is it fried baba?

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.603
- Fried intestines.

00:18:30.603 --> 00:18:32.113
- Oh, okay, fried intestines.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.766
- [Abram] The good stuff.

00:18:34.766 --> 00:18:37.349
(upbeat music)

00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:43.314
(rickshaw beeps)

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.900
- Yeah, everyone knows it,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.700
it's like the deep street food, you know.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.790
- Oh right.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.010
- [Ruzaina] If you wanna
have something unique

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.843
you've gotta come here.

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.913
- The streets are just
lined with rickshaws.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.463
You can smell the deep
friedness in the air.

00:19:04.218 --> 00:19:07.221
(speak in a foreign language)

00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:08.692
It's self-service?

00:19:08.692 --> 00:19:10.679
[Ruzaina] No, you can ask them, see?

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:11.565
- [Mark] I wanna get one
that's like honeycomb tripe.

00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:12.398
- [Ruzaina] Do you want it cut or

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:13.260
do you want it with chunks in it?

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.103
- How do they eat it?

00:19:14.103 --> 00:19:14.936
- They cut it.

00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.770
- Yeah let's cut it, yeah
sure, cut it thank you.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.540
So we found, we found the
shop with the intestines,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.940
were they also have mixed tripe in there.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.240
And they have a whole can of chicken necks

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.100
which looks like they're
cooked in a chili paste.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.523
So we're gonna get a
few samplers plattered.

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:33.692
(speak in foreign language)

00:19:33.692 --> 00:19:38.359
- [Abram] Listen, I'm gonna
get a bottle of water, okay?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.340
- [Mark] That looks awesome.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.173
- [Abram] That's intestine.

00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:05.006
- [Mark] That's intestine, yeah

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:06.310
- [Abram] There we go.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.600
- [Mark] Oh, he's got a scooper.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.085
- [Abram] That definitely
looks like intestine,

00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:09.918
what I have.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:10.751
- [Mark] Yeah, this is intestine.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:11.584
- [Ruzaina] It's opened up.

00:20:11.584 --> 00:20:13.174
- [Mark] Yeah, it's like,
this one is an intestine.

00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:14.017
- [Abram] Alright guys.

00:20:14.017 --> 00:20:15.184
Woooo, cheers!

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.643
- [Mark] Cheers!

00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:21.769
Oh yeah!

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.083
Oh that's flavorful!

00:20:26.432 --> 00:20:28.029
- Good, yeah?

00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.970
- It's really good.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.860
I like that it's not like, it's not sweet,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.210
it's just chili flavor.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.043
- Mika likes it!

00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:35.570
- And salty.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.683
- It's like bubblegum.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.670
- This is just so new to you, right?

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.300
- It's like meat bubblegum.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.679
(laughter)

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.940
It's good, it's good.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.565
- [Mark] Maybe mine
wasn't as chewy as yours.

00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:47.590
- [Ruzaina] No yeah,
yours was a bit stickier.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.790
- [Mark] Alright, next.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.740
I'm ready for the next one.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.517
So this is the stomach of a cow.

00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:52.930
- [Ruzaina] Yes.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.180
- [All] Cheers!

00:20:56.094 --> 00:20:57.490
- Mmm.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.910
- Oh yeah.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.780
- Ooh, I like this one,
I like this one better.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.997
As you chew down like that,

00:21:01.997 --> 00:21:04.530
the like chili oil jucies out of it.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.080
- [Mark] It's also the
tripe but it might even be

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.860
a different part of the stomach.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.020
- Here we go!

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.853
- Next bite.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.380
Oh yeah.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.620
It's a totally different flavor,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.803
it's almost like milky.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.493
Milky, chewy, fatty, yeah definitely.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.433
I think Mika was already
sucking on one of the necks.

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:25.810
- [Abram] That might be Mika's.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.643
- [Mark] Okay I'll take Mika's.

00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:29.220
Next piece is the chicken
necks which are just,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.930
he just kinda chopped them in half.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.746
- Just a regular Sunday afternoon.

00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:33.579
(laughter)

00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:34.412
- Chicken necks.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.460
Oh yeah.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.490
You can eat the bone.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.710
- Oh yeah!

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.860
That's good meat, that's like good meat.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.010
- The calcium in the
bones, you've kinda gotta

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.760
kinda gotta crunch them
and chew them up well,

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.840
but you can eat the whole bone and all.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.240
- First time I've done this.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.312
- Eat the full neck and all.

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:55.800
It has a lot of texture to it.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.944
A lot of boney texture to it.

00:21:58.944 --> 00:22:00.643
- It's like nankotsu,

00:22:00.643 --> 00:22:02.801
like you know nankotsu,
like the cartilage.

00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:03.634
- Oh!

00:22:03.634 --> 00:22:04.467
- Like fried chicken cartilage.

00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:06.507
- Yeah yeah yeah, they
do it in Thailand too.

00:22:06.507 --> 00:22:08.300
The chicken necks are
actually on of the best pieces

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.890
because they're not quite as salty,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.260
and it has more of like a
well-balanced chili paste on it.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.060
The intestines though, and
the tripe are also excellent.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.810
I just got two of them.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.023
- [Abram] Sweet! Desert?

00:22:22.023 --> 00:22:23.943
- Desert, guys! Cookies, cookies!

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.260
I wanted to try dal vada which is a,

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.623
it's like a dal/lentil fritter.

00:22:31.577 --> 00:22:32.970
A dal/lentil patty.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.350
Oh wow, that is like
fried to a complete crisp.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.497
You taste the onions, you taste the

00:22:37.497 --> 00:22:40.164
like starchiness of the lentils.

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:42.023
- Mmm

00:22:42.023 --> 00:22:43.320
- [Mark] That is crispy.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.153
- Oh yeah.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.730
Super crunchy, and it has like that crust.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.660
- Yeah.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.710
Thank you very much, very
good very good, thank you.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.680
So much texture, so much flavor, amazing.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.200
We're gonna try to find one more dish here

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.773
before we proceed on.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.963
Hey how are you?

00:23:02.963 --> 00:23:04.090
- I am one of your followers.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.190
- Thank you very much!

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.850
Ooh, that looks incredible.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.420
Wow, they're double staking.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.580
We're stopping at the next restaurant

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.940
just up the street to
eat some more curries,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.460
but just one dish in particular.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.960
We came here to specifically
eat the brain curry,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.810
which they are known for.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.060
But they have a bunch of different dishes.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.350
And immediately what you
notice the difference is,

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.360
it's like a green curry sauce, in color,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.740
and there's lemongrass on it.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.140
They look like cauliflower almost.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.440
But I can guarantee you they are

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.540
way creamier than cauliflower.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.576
Are we doing fingers?

00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:38.306
- [Ruzaina] The whole
thing, no, the whole thing.

00:23:38.306 --> 00:23:39.139
- [Mark] The whole thing?

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:40.673
- [Ruzaina] The whole thing, yeah!

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.500
- [Mark] Oh you're gonna
roll it around, yeah?

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.910
Yeah, yeah, roll it around!

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.147
- [Ruzaina] Okay I'm gonna break it,

00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:51.786
I can't eat, I don't think
I can open my mouth so big.

00:23:51.786 --> 00:23:52.778
(laughter)

00:23:52.778 --> 00:23:54.938
- I hope I can fit this, I'm gonna try.

00:23:54.938 --> 00:23:55.840
Cheers!

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.673
- Cheers!

00:23:56.673 --> 00:23:57.506
- Brains up!

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.083
Wow.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.833
- That is a lot of cream
in my mouth at one time.

00:24:14.833 --> 00:24:17.570
It's definitely way too
much brain in one bite,

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.093
like the creaminess just
almost overwhelmed me.

00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:25.410
It's like, it really is like
the texture of panna cotta.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.660
It's so creamy, it's so, almost fluffy.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.760
The flavor of that curry
is actually very mild,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.970
you don't really taste a lot of spice

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.320
other than the brain itself.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.603
People should not normally
try that all in one bite,

00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:38.940
but it was a lot of fun.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.660
- It was a good dessert after the necks,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.163
and the tripe to end on
some creamy brain dessert.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.151
I feel pretty good.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.280
- [Abram] That's a lot of cream, baby!

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.520
- That's a lot of cream
in your mouth at one time.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.820
Yeah!

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.958
Nice to meet you!

00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:56.070
- Yeah, nice to meet you!

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.903
Bye!

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.530
- We are on our way to Galle Face

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.190
to eat some of the most iconic

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.160
street food in Sri Lanka in Colombo.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.550
And we'll be right along the beach,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.930
it's getting to be sunset.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.970
It's gonna be a beautiful setting to

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.140
breeze the ocean for street food.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.450
Welcome to Galle Face, this is probably

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.320
the most iconic area, gathering place,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.360
just like part of Colombo.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.330
It's right along the ocean,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.173
there's tons of development in this area.

00:25:26.173 --> 00:25:28.250
It's a huge open space
where people gather,

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.310
where people fly kites,
there's street food.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.470
It has just like a, it's like a park,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.610
it's like a gathering space.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.420
It's a, just a positive
all-round fun place to be.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.930
We're gonna try some
of the street food here

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.960
which is gonna end this
ultimate street food tour

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.200
of Colombo, and then just yeah.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.350
The water is beautiful
here too, I love it.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.368
Crab and shrimp.

00:25:51.368 --> 00:25:53.300
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.401
Oh you eat the shell too?

00:25:54.401 --> 00:25:55.234
- [Ruzaina] Yes.

00:25:55.234 --> 00:25:56.067
- [Mark] Oh it's all deep-fried so--

00:25:56.067 --> 00:25:59.984
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.956
- [Ruzaina] The soft-shell crabs are.

00:26:03.956 --> 00:26:05.456
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:26:07.418 --> 00:26:08.270
And then the shrimp too?

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.046
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:26:11.046 --> 00:26:11.879
- [Ruzaina] You wanna try this one?

00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:13.010
- [Mark] Especially in the evening, right?

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.280
Set up along the ocean front you will find

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.690
a number of street food stalls,

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.800
all serving these like
orange, crunchy looking snacks

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.560
with shrimp embedded into them,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.750
as well as crabs.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.583
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:27.866
- [Mark] What is this?

00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:28.699
- [Ruzaina] Isso verde

00:26:28.699 --> 00:26:31.110
it's the most iconic thing
that you'll ever have

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.110
in Sri Lanka, it's unique to Sri Lanka,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.180
and if you come to Sri
Lanka and Colombo especially

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.780
and you don't have isso vade,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.560
you haven't completed a Sri Lankan tour,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.700
or Sri Lankan visit, trust me on that.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.533
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:26:43.533 --> 00:26:45.730
And so Galle Face is the place to eat it.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.320
Or can you eat it all
over Colombo or anywhere--

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.542
- [Ruzaina] No, Galle Face
is the place to have it.

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.375
The one and only.

00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:52.710
- So this is the place you have to come,

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.800
it's called isso vade and yeah.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.490
I came when I visited
Colombo back in 2010.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.720
I remember coming to Galle
Face, I remember trying this.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.900
I had no idea exactly what I was doing,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.050
but I remember it was
good, it was crunchy.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.338
I'm happy to be back again,
now to try some more.

00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:12.500
- I remember watching you back in 2010

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.800
eating this and putting this in the map,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.850
so thank you and thanks for coming back.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.870
- Awesome, I'm happy to be here.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.934
And we just, we're gonna
order some right now.

00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:21.140
Galle Face sauce.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.000
- I call it the Galle Face sauce.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.900
- The Galle Face sauce,
you only find it at again

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.990
at Galle Face, you've gotta
come to Galle Face to eat it

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.440
and then top it with a handful of onions,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.800
and like cabbage mixture.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.240
What type of batter is on the bottom?

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.990
- [Ruzaina] This is chickpea flour.

00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:40.511
- Mmm, mmm.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.413
Oh wow, oh it's awesome.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.260
Yes! I remember that flavor.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.960
It's really crispy, slightly
like gooey on the inside.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.290
- [Ruzaina] Soft center, crispy prawn.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.240
- And what's good about
the prawn is that you,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.520
the shell is on so that gives it even more

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.623
of like a vibrant prawn flavor.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.170
The sauce is slightly
acidic, the lime juice,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.460
and then just with those onions.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.460
It's just like the perfect
beach-side, ocean-front snack.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.450
You taste a little bit of
spice in the back base too,

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.580
a little bit of a cumin-y flavor.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.633
- [Ruzaina] Same base but with crab.

00:28:23.633 --> 00:28:25.840
- It's the crab version, and it's like a,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.480
it's an entire crab, it looks
like a Blue Swimmer crab,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.290
an ocean crab, yeah?

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.820
And again when you order
it, he adds on the sauce,

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.670
the Galle Face sauce and tops it with

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.413
a handful of onions, garnishing it.

00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:42.448
Yum!

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.770
Oh be careful of the crows
or they'll come to attack.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.351
Ohh they got it.

00:28:51.351 --> 00:28:52.184
- [Ruzaina] They got it!

00:28:52.184 --> 00:28:53.844
- Oh well.

00:28:53.844 --> 00:28:55.260
(laughter)

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.850
Oh wow, we were vlogging
and not paying attention.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.780
The crow has got our snack.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.613
- [Ruzaina] Last patty.

00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:05.550
- You've got again that
crunchy chickpea layer

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.200
batter on the bottom.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.790
But then you like bite
into the body of that crab,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.490
it's like juicy, you get like this,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.690
and you get like this again the like

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.460
extra pungent crab flavor because
you eat the shell and all.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.910
The shell has so much flavor.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.939
Wow.

00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:23.772
Oh yeah.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.040
You can chew through the entire claw,

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.233
but it is like bone-crispy almost.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.060
- Mixed kottu and seafood
kottu, beef kottu, chicken kottu

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.860
- [Mark] What do you recommend?

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.943
- Uh, mixed kottu.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.730
- Here is one more thing we need to eat

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.792
to complete this Sri Lankan food tour.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.375
(food sizzles)

00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:46.910
Okay, so kottu roti, it
is one of the most iconic

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.230
foods to eat in Sri Lanka.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.230
And then he takes the
iconic double hand spatulas

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.220
and kind a like works that
up in a rhythmic fashion,

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.120
kinda chopping and mixing and
stirring all at the same time.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.760
The seafood is then mixed and combined,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.870
everything goes together.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.570
You can smell the aroma, the curry leaves

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.310
are just vibrant in there, it's just like

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.310
an all-in-one fried bread, meat and sauce

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.670
and chili and pepper and spices

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.750
all just soaked up into the roti.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.730
And it's yeah, it's something
you don't wanna miss

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.980
when you're in Sri Lanka.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.040
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.350
It's salty, you taste the curry sauce,

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.540
you taste the curry leaves.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.600
But to be honest, it's a
little too salty for me.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.850
The great thing about kottu roti

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.913
is how they chop and stir everything.

00:31:39.913 --> 00:31:42.603
It's just like soaked
into that roti bread.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.080
That's pretty salty,

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.590
but pretty addictive.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.440
I think this is an entire liver here.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.520
An entire chicken liver
in that bite, oh yeah.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.290
Okay so we have come to the end of this

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.270
Sri Lankan street food tour of Colombo.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.640
It's been an amazing day, we've
eaten some incredible food.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.820
Normally I do a street
food tour all in one day,

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.310
everything is in one day,
from place to place to place.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.480
Today we did it in two days in this video

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.980
because a lot of things were shut,

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.810
it was a holiday when we started.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.414
So we spread it out between two days,

00:32:26.414 --> 00:32:29.080
but the food we've eaten
has been delicious.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.100
Met incredibly friendly people,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.880
and it was an amazing time
to hang out with Ruzaina.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.810
She is The Minority Taste,
she loves Sri Lanka,

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:37.890
she loves Sri Lankan foods,

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.660
she's knowledgeable about Sri Lankan food.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.290
And I will have all her
links in the description box,

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.123

00:32:43.123 --> 00:32:44.790
And just look at that sunset right now,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.803
it's beautiful.

00:32:46.709 --> 00:32:49.209
(waves crash)

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.110
Also I'll have all the information

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.310
