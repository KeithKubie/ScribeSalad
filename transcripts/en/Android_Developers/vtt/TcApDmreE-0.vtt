00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good afternoon, everyone, and
welcome to the Friday App Review.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.390
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.490
I'm joined by Fred Chung.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.500
&gt;&gt;Meier: We're going to take a look at some
apps today.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.719
We asked you guys for some suggestions for
recipe apps, and you did not give us any.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.860
Which means one of two things: either you
guys don't like recipe apps, or there aren't

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.860
any recipe apps.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt;Chung: There was such an overwhelming crowd.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yes.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.290
[laughs] You just couldn't pick from amongst
the very many good ones.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.370
&gt;&gt;Chung: There are just too many.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.370
&gt;&gt;Meier: Apparently so.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.920
So what we're going to do this week instead
is have a look at some of our favorites.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.589
Fred's got a couple of food related apps.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.879
Which ones are you going to take a look at
today?

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:35.879
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.379
We're going to have a look at My Food and
BigOven.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.379
&gt;&gt;Meier: Excellent.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.910
The reason I was asking you guys for recipe
apps was because I didn't know of any goods

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.910
ones.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.140
So rather than spend time looking at apps
I've never looked at before, I'm going to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
take a look at some of my favorite apps, in
terms of apps that I use a lot of.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.469
And that's Series Guide, IMDb, and, if we
get time, I'm going to take a look at TripIt

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.469
as well.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.710
Now, before we get started, I just want to
clarify a little bit about what we're trying

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.850
to achieve here at the Friday App Review.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.250
Unlike a lot of the review shows that you
may have seen, we're not really focused on

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.890
giving a fair and balanced evaluation of what
are some great apps that we think you guys

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.400
should be installing.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.710
We're part of a developer relations team here
at Android.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.410
Our focus is really on trying to help developers
build better apps.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.790
So to do that, whenever we look at these apps,
we're really trying to dissect them, take

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.140
them apart, see what they're doing right,
see what they're doing wrong, and really try

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.000
and create a learning experience so that other
app developers can learn from the mistakes

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780
and successes of these other apps.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.820
Really, the app review doesn't make a lot
of sense as a title, so we're actually going

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.480
to change the name of our show live on air.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.540
So from this point on, we're going to become
the Friday App Clinic.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.270
Now, in order to maintain that new branding,
I have some props.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.910
I'm going to just get off camera and get my
props.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.230
[shuffling noises]

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.850
&gt;&gt;Chung: Reto's going to come back soon.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.850
[laughs]

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.870
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] Don't panic.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.280
[more shuffling] And Daniel, if our producer
off camera can also switch our title, so that

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
we can become the Friday App Clinic, that
would be fantastic.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.780
&gt;&gt;Chung: We have double to size of our production
team.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.170
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] That's right.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.560
Twice as many producers.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.050
&gt;&gt;Off-camera engineer: Oh, did you remember
to tell your off-camera engineer to include

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.230
your new title in his title set?

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.830
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yes.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.230
[laughs] One moment.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.180
That's all right, we have all the time in
the world.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.180
I have my--

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.180
&gt;&gt;Off-camera engineer: You have an hour.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180
&gt;&gt;Meier: I have an hour.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.180
&gt;&gt;Off-camera engineer: Actually, more like
45 minutes.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180
&gt;&gt;Chung: We have 45 minutes.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.180
That's close to an hour.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180
&gt;&gt;Meier: 45 minutes?!

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180
Oh, then we should get this shit sorted out.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.180
All right.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.070
We have our doctor Droids.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.640
I have my lab coat.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460
&gt;&gt;Chung: You have a lab coat.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.460
Where's mine?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.460
&gt;&gt;Meier: You have to bring your own coat.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.460
&gt;&gt;Chung: I have to order it.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.460
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460
I mean, come on, man!

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.800
&gt;&gt;Chung: That's what that box was for.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
&gt;&gt;Meier: Absolutely.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.680
You need to order your own equipment.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.480
&gt;&gt;Chung: Just pretend this is a white--

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.310
&gt;&gt;Meier: This is a white coat.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.310
Absolutely.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.310
&gt;&gt;Chung: Can you color correct it?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.310
&gt;&gt;Meier: Color correct it.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.360
Yeah, you should have worn at least a green
shirt, so we can make due.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360
&gt;&gt;Chung: Next time, maybe.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.360
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's right.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360
That's right.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.940
I snuck this up on Fred here, as well.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.180
This is his first clinic too.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.310
So I can be the official clinician.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.020
[laughs] And Fred can continue to be a reviewer.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.020
So let's get started.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.140
Let's have a look at one of your apps.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's start with--.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.590
Where would you like to start?

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.590
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.930
I'm excited to stick to something that is
related to recipes.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.160
Both of these apps, as I mentioned earlier,
my Food and BigOven-- if we could switch to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.090
the tablet, please.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.819
Both of these apps try to tackle the problem
where you're trying to figure out what's for

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.819
dinner.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.069
Then you have to figure out what kind of dishes
you would like to get.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.270
After the preparation stage, you can translate
the types of ingredients into some sort of

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.270
shopping list.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.680
These two apps try to solve this problem.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.250
They try to do it a little bit differently.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.170
Why don't we have a look at my Food?

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.190
As soon as this app is launched, it's pretty
self-explanatory.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.580
It's got three high level menu items that
you can pick from: shopping list, recipes,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.790
and meal planner.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.160
All of these, very prominently displayed,
which is nice, which makes it very easy for

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160
users to comprehend.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.630
You would go into recipe first, but before
diving into the content of recipe, I like

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.910
to highlight that when I tap on any of these
targets, there's no touch feedback.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.780
I would, like what we've been asking developers
to do.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.580
When you come up with graphics icons, be sure
to have different, have them represented in

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.430
different states to represent the natural
state, focus state, and pressed state.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.940
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's really important, particularly
for accessibility.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.970
If you want blind users to be able to use
your app, or even just people who are using

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.490
accessibility type features to make it more
easy, then having those touch target selectors

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.200
is really important.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.870
&gt;&gt;Chung: Before going to any of these, let's
have a quick look at the menu.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.310
There's help, settings, the items that, the
usual suspects, basically, things that you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.900
would expect to see under the overflow menu.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.900
&gt;&gt;Meier: Absolutely.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.570
I want to point out, as well here, that looking
at this main screen here as well, you can

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.730
see that we've actually got an action bar,
which is good.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.770
But in this case, I think actually it would
make a lot of sense to have an action bar

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.710
which was perhaps translucent, because you've
got this whole screen effect here where it's

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.100
this immersive thing, completely custom controls.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.370
The action bar almost looks a little bit plunked
on top.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.690
Perhaps changing the color of your action
bar to match the background or have a translucent

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.070
action bar would be an interesting design
choice.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.979
&gt;&gt;Chung: I actually like the suggestion on
translucent.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.860
Let's have a look at the recipe screens.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.259
As you can see, in this drop down box, there
are different types of occasions like starter,

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.490
sides, dinner, whatever.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.680
There are different categories that you can
choose from.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.650
It prepopulates it with a bunch of delicious
dishes.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.910
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] Absolutely.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.389
&gt;&gt;Chung: You can swipe food, the selection
of dishes.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.490
These are the top level recipe items.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:35.020
What you can do is look at the various ingredients
and the steps involved in the preparation

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.020
of the dish.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.139
What I would suggest is that when you have
a tablet, the most probable use case is someone

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.000
using your app in a kitchen.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.930
I might be sitting three to four feet away
from the tablet.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.400
The font size as it stands is a little bit
too small.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.520
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah, it is, it's a little small.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.820
&gt;&gt;Chung: I'm having a hard time in reading
the text.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.820
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.400
What you want to really have is so that you
can set up the tablet on your kitchen bench,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.919
probably a little further away from the food--
&gt;&gt;Chung: Definitely.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.389
&gt;&gt;Meier: --and sources of heat [laughs] than
you would want otherwise.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.800
You really want to be able to see this text
from a good five to ten feet away, assuming

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.259
you have a bigger kitchen than me.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.570
&gt;&gt;Chung: Have a look at the overflow menu.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.350
I wish they had an option where you can increase
the font size, but it, at least, I can't find

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.630
it from here.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.380
What's interesting is that for each step,
you can go in and edit it.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.340
Sometimes people like to deviate.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.340
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's nice.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.340
Absolutely.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.850
There's not a recipe that I use that I haven't
modified slightly.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.850
&gt;&gt;Chung: Exactly.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.180
&gt;&gt;Meier: You know what else would be really
nice here, I don't know if there's any support

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.210
for it, but to have the ability to add pictures
for each step.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.710
I find that's really useful if I know if it
looks the way it's supposed to, if I've done

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.889
things the right way.

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.460
Like when they say "brown it", how brown is
it supposed to be?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.500
Those sorts of things would be really nice.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.340
A picture of the finished product and also
a picture of each step.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.490
&gt;&gt;Chung: Great suggestion.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.979
You can capture it for motivation.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:07:59.979
&gt;&gt;Meier: Absolutely.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:04.039
This is what I would do: I would do the recipe
and I would take a photo of each step so I

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:06.259
was able to see the process of going through.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:10.069
And potentially, even the ability to add a
video.

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:12.250
If I record the whole thing of how it all
went.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.400
I see we've got Roman on screen.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.940
What do you think, Roman?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.100
If you've had a chance to look at this app,
what are your thoughts from the UI perspective?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.699
&gt;&gt;Roman Nurik: I haven't had a chance to take
a full look, but just from looking at what

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:31.270
you guys are showing now, the same common
problems that we see everywhere are showing

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.270
up in this app.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.840
And they're not really problems, it's just
I think probably the lack of a tablet-optimized

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.190
UI inside a tablet.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.580
One thing I wanted to mention was just on
the very home screen, I guess the top level

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:51.930
screen, that has that massive dashboard, I
just wanted to make a shout out for, I guess,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.821
against dashboards and using dashboards, especially
on tablets.

00:08:55.821 --> 00:09:03.580
There are lots and lots of different ways
you can show a top level screen.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.620
Some of those ways are actually listed in
our design guidelines under the app structure

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.620
pattern.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.620
I definitely recommend taking a look there
to see how you can get away from a dashboard.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.570
You don't necessarily have to completely remove
the dashboard, but one thing you could do

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:24.040
is potentially include content break there,
so when you're showing the big icons, the

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.820
big buttons, to get into the section, show
the preview of the content that you're about

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.600
to see when you tap into that section.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.790
It's just one of the things that--

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.790
&gt;&gt;Chung: Some pictures, right.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.190
Some pictures of the dishes that you're trying
to prepare.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.850
That's great.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.690
Let's go back to recipes.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.740
As I was testing this application, I tried
to add a new dish.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.900
At first, I thought, this "Add" button represented
it, but instead--

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.930
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's a step within the existing
recipe.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.930
&gt;&gt;Chung: Right, right.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.520
But instead, what I was looking for is hidden
in the overflow menu.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.530
&gt;&gt;Meier: Oh, I see.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.530
&gt;&gt;Chung: "New recipes."

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:05.240
So I think it would be great to expose this
feature on the action bar if there's space.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah, definitely.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.630
I think there is plenty of space in the action
bar for that.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:14.030
"Add recipes" seems like it would be one of
the main features of what you want to do within

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.300
an app like this.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.300
Absolutely.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.530
&gt;&gt;Chung: Let's have a quick look at "shopping
list."

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.100
You can have various shopping lists associated
with the recipes that we looked at.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.270
Let's say you've decided on what to cook for
dinner.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.570
Then you can quickly transfer the list of
items into your shopping list.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.779
I think it's a good use case where at home,
the user might be using a tablet to come up

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:45.570
with the list of recipes, and then, based
on the list of recipes, you come up with a

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.570
shopping list.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.920
Then if you support something like syncing
with the Cloud, when you take your Android

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:57.190
device out, you can have the shopping list
with you at the grocery store, where it can

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.870
mark off various items.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.300
&gt;&gt;Meier: Do you know if this has the ability
to sync?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.970
Like, are you signing in at any point?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.640
If I have my tablet, which lives in my kitchen,
or at least in my living room and kitchen,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.491
to be able to do recipes, can I sync that
up with my phone so I have my shopping list

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:12.540
with me?

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.839
&gt;&gt;Chung: I think there was, but I can't recall.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:20.630
But assuming it does, I think it would be
a good use case.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.630
&gt;&gt;Meier: Definitely.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.630
Nice.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.630
That would be my wish list.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:29.160
I think, for me, to just go ahead and start
using this would be pictures, lots of pictures.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.420
Food, eating, and preparing food: a big part
of that is visual.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.990
Being able to see what the cauliflower cheese
soup looks like is going to make it much more

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.850
likely for me to actually create it.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.670
Certainly, whenever I'm using cookbooks and
recipes, seeing that picture of what it's

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.970
going to end up like is a big thing for me.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:47.970
&gt;&gt;Chung: Definitely.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.529
I will also say that for this kind of app,
where initially, there's a bunch of data entry

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:58.779
involved, you might want to think of ways
to make it easier for users, because I imagine

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:03.960
if it becomes too cumbersome to enter a lot
of text, you will experience a lot of drop

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960
offs.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.360
You may think of ways to maybe support upscanning
for barcodes and stuff like that that would

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.450
make it a lot easier for users to use it.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.300
Or, alternatively, you can have a lot more
prepopulated items for people to just pick

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.790
and choose from an existing list.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.839
That would make the user experience better.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:24.839
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:27.610
In fact, thinking this through, that's probably
the way I would start to use this.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.399
Right now at home, I have this big folder
with recipes which I've pulled out of newspapers

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.810
and photocopied from people and printed out
emails.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.620
I'm probably not going to want to enter all
of that in straight away.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.060
My first step would just be to photograph
each one.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.050
Just give it a title and then scan in the
picture.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.709
Then I can always go through and actually
populate the fields separately, later.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:49.829
&gt;&gt;Chung: We're getting the app.

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:50.950
&gt;&gt;Meier: We're getting the app.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.950
&gt;&gt;Chung: There's the sign.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.820
&gt;&gt;Meier: We have 35 seconds left to go.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.149
&gt;&gt;Chung: We have a new prop here.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.149
&gt;&gt;Meier: We have a gong, too.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:58.550
We want to run out the time just so we can
have the gong go.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.430
It's very important.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.260
[laughs] I think we should actually just wait
22 seconds--

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.329
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah, let's do it.

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:08.030
&gt;&gt;Meier: --until it goes off, but let's see.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.769
We've got the categories here.

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:12.990
We've got everything else.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.990
It's actually looking pretty good.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.520
Why don't you gong us out, Ian?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.800
&gt;&gt;Chung: Awesome.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.070
All right.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.990
That's our signal.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.430
&gt;&gt;Meier: I really hope that that was audible.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Look, it just came off.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.400
&gt;&gt;Chung: Wow, how did that happen?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs]

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400
&gt;&gt;Chung: Oh, great.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
All in all, it's a great start.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.899
It looks like the development team is a pretty
small team.

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:32.899
&gt;&gt;Meier: Absolutely.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:36.769
If guys are watching, if you hear about this,
then do reach out to us, and we'll try and

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:41.700
help to give you that extra feedback to help
really make this into our go-to recipe app.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.700
&gt;&gt;Chung: Definitely.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.570
&gt;&gt;Meier: Now, I don't want to cut Fred off
here, but I didn't really think this through,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.730
because I haven't had lunch, and looking at
recipes is making me hungry.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.450
So let's switch across and have a look at
one of these other apps.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.450
&gt;&gt;Chung: Sure.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.450
&gt;&gt;Meier: That work for you?

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.450
All right.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.450
Let's restart our time.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.450
I will try to be a little more conscious of
time.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.450
&gt;&gt;Chung: Which one do we want to look at?

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.320
&gt;&gt;Meier: I want to have a look at Series Guide.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.740
This is an app I use quite a lot of.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.600
I think it was actually Roman who put me on
to this.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.950
You a Series Guide user as well, Roman?

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.480
&gt;&gt;Nurik: I am, I absolutely am.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.560
I think this app is one of my favorites for
tracking episodes and TV shows.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.560
&gt;&gt;Chung: Awesome.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560
Let's switch to the tablet.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560
&gt;&gt;Meier: Cool.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.560
Yeah, let's have a look at the tablet view.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560
One--.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560
These are some of my favorite apps.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.070
I'm going to be particularly, not harsh, but
I'm going to have a pretty high bar for some

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.029
of the comments that I have here for them.

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:32.180
One of the big kicks that I'm on at the moment
is trying to create apps that present a magical

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.180
experience.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.800
Apps that you're not really thinking about
them running on a phone, you're not thinking

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.000
about the internet connection, you're not
thinking about anything other than the functionality

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.399
that they provide.

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:44.529
That's the basis around which I'm going to
be providing some of this feedback.

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:49.540
If you look on the getting started guide right
here, we're asked to choose our primary content

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.540
language.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.160
We have the ability to connect to a social
network associated with it, and an option

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.630
to send developer usage statistics.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.709
This is all fair enough, but the problem with
it is it's straight away.

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:05.890
I open the app and I'm presented with all
of this text, all of these choices.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.820
Generally speaking, I find it much better
if you just load up the app and it straightaway

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.089
dumps you into whatever it is that the app
is supposed to do.

00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:17.980
So I would suggest to the developers here
to actually see if you can remove all of this

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:24.160
on startup so that you're just able to get
straight into the gear.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.500
I'm a little concerned about what I'm hearing
over my shoulder, but we'll continue.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.500
[laughs]

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:33.420
&gt;&gt;Nurik: The other thing I want to mention
is when you just get into an app, usually,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.420
you're presented--.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.420
Or, in apps that are just list views or just
where the primary content pane is basically

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.720
empty because you haven't done anything in
the app yet, there's no need to present a

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
dialog.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.699
Just present any sort of introductory material
like "stuff that you do happens here" right

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:51.740
in line.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.360
There's a big opportunity to use the empty
view.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:02.170
When your list view has no items in it, use
the empty view to be more visual.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.620
Do so right in line in the content [indistinct]
dialog if you're going to do it at all.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.620
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah, I totally agree.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.949
In fact, if we dismiss this here, we get exactly
that.

00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:14.420
We get this massive pane of emptiness, which
just says, "No shows here."

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.680
Now, what we're supposed to do is start adding
in the shows that we are interested in watching.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.529
You do that by hitting the "plus" button,
which makes total sense.

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:24.390
And then we can start searching for shows.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.980
Now, what you'll also notice, that here you've
got this "trending" tab, which shows you a

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.440
bunch of shows which other people have been
looking for.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.490
Now, there's a bunch of these that I actually
do want to track.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.490
Now, I don't know, what do you think, Roman?

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.089
For me, I would love to see basically that
intro screen being all of the trending shows,

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:43.860
which I can then just go in and add right
off the bat.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.532
That's the way you get started, is by seeing
a whole bunch of suggestions based on what

00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:51.269
other people have been adding, and have that
ability to just go, "Yeah, Breaking Bad, plus.

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:52.269
Game of Thrones, plus.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:53.269
Dexter, plus."

00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:54.269
&gt;&gt;Chung: Make it easier to add--

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:55.269
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Absolutely.

00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:59.430
&gt;&gt;Meier: And then straight away, you understand
what it is that the show is offering.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:05.889
So again, here we have this big dialog explaining
what the show is, giving us the synopsis and

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:06.970
the ability to add.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:12.449
Now, that's useful, and I would certainly
like to have that as a plus, but in the instance

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:17.779
here, I'd even more so prefer just a bunch
of "plus" buttons along this outer edge so

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:19.689
that I can just say, "Well, I know what Breaking
Bad is.

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:22.489
I've been watching it for the past five years.

00:17:22.489 --> 00:17:24.600
I just want to add it without having to read
about it."

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.459
&gt;&gt;Chung: The pop up [indistinct]

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:27.470
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.479
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Interesting.

00:17:28.479 --> 00:17:35.609
The other thing is that the way this is listed,
the way shows are listed it this app, is they're

00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:37.289
basically listed as a list.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.289
Vertical list of things.

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:46.129
Whereas with really media-friendly stuff like
content, or, I guess, media-rich content presenting,

00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:49.450
the grid is generally just better.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.139
Leaves you more space to show nice big photos.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:59.340
If you even overlay the titles over the photos
so that everything, almost every pixel in

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.840
the screen is covered by content, that's generally
better than presenting just a list of thumbnail

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.519
on the left and text on the right.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.519
&gt;&gt;Chung: Small thumbnail.

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:12.509
There are one day of defeat that they're getting
from if they have bigger assets.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.509
&gt;&gt;Meier: They do, they absolutely do.

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:16.390
In fact, it's one of the strengths of this
app.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.239
&gt;&gt;Chung: If you do, take advantage of it.

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:20.350
&gt;&gt;Meier: Let's go back to the main menu.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.190
I've added a bunch of shows, and you can see
straight away that they're already presenting

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.710
something better here.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.830
Once you go to the shows that you've already
included, you get the back route view which

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.919
Roman was talking about.

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:35.999
But even here, I'd say there's an opportunity
here to use that space more, to use bigger

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:39.159
assets, so this becomes a really visual experience.

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:44.539
Having the images associated with the shows
is, I think, a really powerful thing.

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:50.320
I would consider making that a much bigger
part of each grid item.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.450
Very much along the lines of what Roman was
suggesting.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.340
The point here is that it's telling us when
our next episode of all of these shows are

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.340
coming up.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.419
We have a bunch of options that we can choose
too.

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:07.729
If you go into settings, we have this wall
of settings which allow us to do things like--.

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:13.830
And they show episodes which have already
been on before, which reduces my list, which

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.149
makes me sad.

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:17.679
[laughs] But you can see exactly what's coming.

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:22.210
And then you can go into each of the shows,
Game of Thrones, and then you get all the

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.889
details, the director's guest stars, what
episodes are on or coming.

00:19:26.889 --> 00:19:30.549
You can see here, in the background, you've
got the big graphic, right?

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:31.549
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah.

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:32.549
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Yeah.

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:33.549
&gt;&gt;Meier: Not coming across as well as that
one.

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:34.610
&gt;&gt;Chung: What does "check in" do?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.610
Just real quick.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.720
&gt;&gt;Meier: "Check in", I think, if you're logged
into Trakt, or possibly not, it lets you basically

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.750
have that social aspect, where you're checking
into the show.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.750
&gt;&gt;Chung: Oh, interesting.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.750
I was looking at this feature right here--

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.750
&gt;&gt;Meier: If you're watching it, you check
in as part of that.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.320
Have you actually used that at all, Roman?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.909
&gt;&gt;Nurik: No, I don't use the check in as much.

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:56.309
I know this is a growing, more popular interaction,
to actually check into shows as they come

00:19:56.309 --> 00:19:57.799
on, but I haven't used them myself.

00:19:57.799 --> 00:20:03.019
It is a very popular thing with services like
GetGlue and I believe Trakt as well, but I

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:04.019
haven't used it.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.019
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:08.289
I guess it's around that whole second screen
experience idea, where you're socializing

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:09.590
while you're watching TV.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.679
I struggle with it because I very seldom watch
TV live.

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.169
I'm always time shifting it and watching it
at least an hour or so later.

00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:17.919
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah, like the Olympics.

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.389
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] Well, the Olympics is not
by choice.

00:20:20.389 --> 00:20:23.979
But this is not the forum for me to rant,
because I don't have enough time to explain

00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:26.299
exactly how I feel about the NBC cover job
of the Olympics.

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:29.429
&gt;&gt;Chung: I was just pointing out that similarity.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.399
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] Absolutely.

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:32.399
Yeah.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.960
The other thing which I have to say about
this app--.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.970
Like I say, Roman suggested this to me.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.399
I use it a lot now.

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:42.450
But one of the things I struggled with when
I first started the app is that it wasn't

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.559
immediately obvious to me how everything worked.

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:50.799
The plus icon being "add show," it wasn't
immediately obvious to me that that's what

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.899
it was going to do.

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:55.419
I didn't necessarily understand the work flow.

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:59.549
So I think that's something which would be
really great to be simplified and better explained.

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:03.460
I think giving me that list of suggestions
right off the bat is going to help.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.730
But help me through the work flow, make it
more obvious what I need to do at each point,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.200
and that will make it easier for me to use
all the features.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:16.239
&gt;&gt;Chung: In the action bar, they have a mix
of text and icons for the action items.

00:21:16.239 --> 00:21:17.570
Maybe they can--.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:22.309
This is actually combined, activity with a
clock icon and a search icon.

00:21:22.309 --> 00:21:23.309
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:25.799
It does have the tiny little vertical separators.

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:28.269
Actually, no.

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:33.099
There's a missing vertical separator between
"plus" and "activity", which is really confusing.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:34.940
It looks like it's the same thing.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.850
&gt;&gt;Chung: It wasn't apparent to me that the
clock icon actually represents it's tied to

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.070
the activity text.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.029
&gt;&gt;Meier: Search-- Okay, so it's the right
search icon.

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:46.340
I mean, generally speaking, they've done things
well.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.629
But I'd also be really cautious about things
like your settings menu where there are a

00:21:50.629 --> 00:21:52.989
lot of things here.

00:21:52.989 --> 00:21:53.989
Advanced and everything else.

00:21:53.989 --> 00:21:54.989
You may consider--.

00:21:54.989 --> 00:21:58.119
This is actually using the old preference
activities rather than the new preference

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.119
fragments.

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:03.429
There are a few options that you have here
to actually separate things into categories,

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:05.030
make it a little bit easier to dissect.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.259
I'd want to have things like advanced and
more almost off in a separate category so

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:12.239
it's not confusing the rest of it.

00:22:12.239 --> 00:22:14.499
Because this is a little bit intimidating.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.870
You've been using it longer than I have, Roman.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.139
Do you have any particular suggestions that
you'd like to point out about what they do

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:23.220
well or what they could do a little bit better?

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.019
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Yeah.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:28.429
I think when this app just came out, it was
using the default demon.

00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:32.429
A lot of my comments are visual, so this would
be visual feedback.

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:38.809
But before, I guess a couple months ago, this
app was using the default stock hollow theme.

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:41.330
Everything was hollow, blue and everything.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.090
That was good.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:49.169
I think that, obviously, you do want to modify,
you do want to brand it a little bit.

00:22:49.169 --> 00:22:54.879
In this case, I feel like the branding is--
that neon purple-- it doesn't really mesh

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:59.340
all that well with the rest of the hollow
UI, the hollow style.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:06.539
For example, all the window backgrounds are
using the default hollow gradient from black

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:12.769
to a dark gray Then the neon purple on top
of that doesn't seem to really mesh well.

00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:16.659
What I would do is I would probably go through
and clean up some of the UI.

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:22.120
I feel like there are some parts that are
really remnants of the default hollow style.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:28.929
Just make sure to either customize more, dark
and branded, custom UI isn't as great as it

00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:29.929
could be.

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:33.340
It's definitely better than a lot of the other
apps that we've seen, but that could be improved.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.690
Another thing is--.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:40.090
This is very specific, but when you get into
an episode of a show, there's actions at the

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.679
top right, like "search" and "favorite" and
"share", and then there's actions right in

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.899
the middle of the screen.

00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:46.039
One of the--

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:47.039
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.039
"Check in", etc.

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:49.039
[buzzing sound]

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.039
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Yeah.

00:23:50.039 --> 00:23:51.039
I find that little strange.

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:56.139
I think it violates one of the core rules
of putting things near the corners, near the

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:57.139
edges.

00:23:57.139 --> 00:24:03.450
It's a little easier to find, a little easier
to discover, unless the in line actions are

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.450
really obvious.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.679
In this case, I feel like they're buried under
the content.

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.679
One thing that I do really often is mark a
show as watched.

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:14.049
I feel like it's buried in a sea of text.

00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:15.720
That's one thing that I would try to do.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.250
If you do have actions that are in line, make
sure that they're more visible, that they're

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:25.520
more prominent, that they stand out apart
from the content that surrounds it, because

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.869
otherwise, it may not be obvious, it may be
difficult to locate.

00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:28.869
&gt;&gt;Meier: Cool.

00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:30.739
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:24:30.739 --> 00:24:33.609
I think for a lot of those, it would make
sense to just have them in the action bar.

00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:36.929
Because as you said, they're primary actions.

00:24:36.929 --> 00:24:37.929
Having watched a show.

00:24:37.929 --> 00:24:40.389
Our gong has gone off, so we're going to have
to move on.

00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:42.240
But I think that's some interesting advice.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.250
I think the key things here is that visually,
I think they could do a lot more with what

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.250
they've got.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.969
More images, more grids, more density of color
and imagery.

00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:56.729
And similarly, as well, I think, just to give
a couple of examples from what Roman was saying,

00:24:56.729 --> 00:25:00.719
and hopefully he'll agree, I think in terms
of customized branding, if you have a look

00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:03.259
at an app like-- GeekBeat does a really good
job of that.

00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:09.749
They have their own custom color schemes,
which is throughout the entire app, and it's

00:25:09.749 --> 00:25:10.749
consistent.

00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:18.880
Tasks and Tasks Free are a good example of
an app which you're actually using very much

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.619
the standard paradigms.

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.590
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Hey guys.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.559
Producer Ian here.

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:37.399
We just wanted to mention that one of our
viewers took a look at the page for my Food,

00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:42.070
and it turns out that they have-- Actually,
you know what?

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.450
You guys should be looking at the camera.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.450
There we go.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.389
Now we can talk directly to each other.

00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:50.269
Hi, Reto and Fred!

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:51.679
&gt;&gt;Meier: Hi, Ian.

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:55.909
&gt;&gt;Chung: Hey, we haven't seen you for a while.

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.669
Where are you calling from?

00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:58.669
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:59.669
Yeah.

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:01.340
I'm calling from right over here.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.340
Whoo!

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.909
Anyway, I suppose that's a really neat comment,
which was that actually, you guys mentioned

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:14.489
something about it was a little bit sparse,
not too many graphics, stuff like that.

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:19.239
It turns out there was a user request for
a sparse interface and the dev responded really

00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:20.700
quickly to that and made that.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.409
It sounds like maybe it should have been an
option rather than a default, though.

00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:25.879
&gt;&gt;Meier: It sounds like some of that--.

00:26:25.879 --> 00:26:29.029
It actually brings up a really interesting
point, particularly if you're creating an

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:30.500
app which is quite popular.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.259
It's going to be impossible to satisfy all
of your users.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:38.379
Me and Fred can sit here and have exactly
the opposite opinions about the same app.

00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:41.500
And certainly, once you get more than a couple
of thousand downloads, you're going to have

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.269
the same problem.

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:47.289
One thing you can do there is use analytics
a lot to figure out how people are actually

00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:48.289
using your app.

00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:53.229
You can do things like institute options where
you have "show images, don't show images"

00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:55.929
and find out which people are using more.

00:26:55.929 --> 00:26:59.120
Try and build your user interface around that.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.869
Definitely something you want to consider
is, before doing those radical changes, is

00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:06.731
to think about how people are using the app,
and give them the option to pick one or the

00:27:06.731 --> 00:27:09.369
other before deciding which is the best approach.

00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:10.369
&gt;&gt;Chung: Right.

00:27:10.369 --> 00:27:14.269
Or, if you have resources, think about doing
things like AB testing to see which one--

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:15.269
&gt;&gt;Meier: Absolutely.

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:17.559
&gt;&gt;Chung: --users react to better.

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:18.559
That's great.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:22.210
And also, it's good to see that you're reacting
to user comments as well.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.210
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.210
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.210
Cool.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.210
All right.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:27.210
Let's have a look at your next app.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.309
&gt;&gt;Chung: The next app is called BigOven.

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:35.860
It's, like I said before, it's another app
that consists of a lot of recipes where it

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:42.210
tries to give you some ideas on what's for
dinner, what's for lunch, and stuff like that.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:48.859
You're able to identify the items and create
shopping lists based on the recipes.

00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:49.859
&gt;&gt;Meier: Nice.

00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:52.619
I like the fact that they've got a tablet
layout right off the bat.

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:53.969
This is making me happy.

00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:58.909
&gt;&gt;Chung: They have a tablet layout, two pane
layouts with a big logo here.

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:03.499
What stands out initially is that I see two
search functions here.

00:28:03.499 --> 00:28:07.719
You have a duplication of features on the
very same screen, so you can think of maybe

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:09.619
eliminating one.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:15.539
Maybe there's a specific reason why you decided
to include both.

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:16.539
It's not--.

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:18.070
But it feels duplicate.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.070
Duplicated feature.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.269
Let's do a search on something.

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:23.619
&gt;&gt;Meier: What's your favorite recipe?

00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:27.649
&gt;&gt;Chung: Something that has to do with beef.

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:28.830
&gt;&gt;Meier: Beef?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.499
[laughs] You're not a real developer.

00:28:31.499 --> 00:28:34.190
If you were a real Android developer, it would
have been bacon.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.190
&gt;&gt;Chung: Test.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.190
There you go.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.190
So it shows you, whoa.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.190
A bunch of pictures.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.339
These are user generated contents with star
ratings.

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:43.339
You can--.

00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:44.779
Let's say go.

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:48.190
Pick one, beef and chili with beans.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.509
Loading recipes to the latency.

00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:53.849
&gt;&gt;Meier: I was going to say, if we just drop
back once, this is a really good example of

00:28:53.849 --> 00:28:57.279
an app which is using that visualness to really
draw you in.

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:01.099
You've just got this wall of beef, which could
be quite intimidating.

00:29:01.099 --> 00:29:03.549
But in this case, it's just making me really
hungry.

00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:09.091
I do notice that it tends to be a little bit
slow in terms of, particularly this loading

00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:10.091
the recipe.

00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:14.870
Bringing the images in here slowly, that's
reasonable, although it feels like, based

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.679
on the speed here, it feels like we're pulling
down images much bigger than the thumbnail

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:19.679
being displayed.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:23.759
If you're pulling them down from a server
and then shrinking them, try and have those

00:29:23.759 --> 00:29:27.889
shrunken assets on the server so you're just
pulling down as little as possible.

00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:28.889
And things like this.

00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:31.849
The loading more recipes: try and pre-cache
a little more aggressively.

00:29:31.849 --> 00:29:36.350
You should have at least a scroll's worth
of data queued up so that you don't feel that

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.350
lag.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.350
&gt;&gt;Chung: All right.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.350
When you go back--

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.350
&gt;&gt;Meier: This is unacceptable.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.070
You really need to find ways to cache your
images.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:49.509
You will, for memory reasons, likely still
have to dump them out of your cache in terms

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:53.070
of your memory cache and display them, but
it shouldn't take this long to put them back

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.070
in.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.070
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.119
If you want to know specific technical tips
on how to do it, we have a training class

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:05.000
on Android training that specifically talks
about loading bitmaps and caching and stuff

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
like that.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Check it out.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.379
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Actually, I think Adam Kash from
Martina's clinic adds some updates to that.

00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:14.299
And another thing I wanted to point out is
that in the Google IO application, which is

00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:19.839
now open-sourced, a bunch of new stuff related
to image caching is there as well.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:22.019
You can rip stuff right out of there.

00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:25.950
I believe we're updating the Android training
article on that as well.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:26.950
&gt;&gt;Meier: Awesome.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.019
All right, let's get back into the beef and
chili with beans.

00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:30.019
&gt;&gt;Chung: Beef and chili.

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:31.019
See the loading latency.

00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:32.590
I think there's--

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.969
&gt;&gt;Meier: It's a little slow, right?

00:30:34.969 --> 00:30:35.969
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah, it's pretty slow.

00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:38.330
&gt;&gt;Meier: When I was talking beforehand about
creating a magical app, that's a big part

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.330
of it for me.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:43.009
Every time you see the loading dialog or a
blank thing which needs to be populated or

00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:45.330
fill up, it breaks the magic.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.589
It ruins that suspension to disbelief.

00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:51.700
You remember that, "Oh, this app needs to
connect to an internet source and pull down

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.639
this data and populate this view."

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:57.129
I don't want to be made aware of any of that,
I just want it to magically happen as though

00:30:57.129 --> 00:31:01.470
this were some crazy magic box of the future
which had every recipe in the world somehow

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.519
contained within it.

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:05.519
This looks nice.

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:06.649
The UI here is definitely--

00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:08.679
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah, it's pretty clean.

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:11.649
Well, I like to repeat the feedback that we
gave.

00:31:11.649 --> 00:31:12.649
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:13.649
Bigger text.

00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:14.649
&gt;&gt;Chung: Bigger text.

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:17.179
But I think this particular app, there's an
option where you can increase the font size,

00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.879
which is great.

00:31:18.879 --> 00:31:24.389
There are different tabs, like "recipe", "reviews",
and "photos"--

00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:25.389
&gt;&gt;Meier: Excellent.

00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:26.389
Of photos.

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:29.749
&gt;&gt;Chung: --of various-- And again, latency,
I don't know what's going on here.

00:31:29.749 --> 00:31:31.200
We have a pretty fast network here.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.200
[laughs]

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.919
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] You definitely want to be
downloading those photos.

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:36.909
I rather suspect that the photos are bigger
than they need to be.

00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:37.909
You're pulling--.

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:40.190
And I noticed, also, they all came in at once
here.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:45.799
Again, it's the same sort of ideas of making
sure you download more than you, download

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:49.659
progressively and make sure that you're optimizing
those downloads to pull down as little as

00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:50.659
you need.

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:53.509
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Actually, can I make a comment here
on the UI?

00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:54.509
&gt;&gt;Chung: Certainly.

00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:55.509
&gt;&gt;Meier: Of course.

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:57.220
&gt;&gt;Nurik: There is one thing I wanted to mention.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.029
This is just happening over and over again.

00:31:59.029 --> 00:32:02.899
I feel like every app we look at on the tablet
has this issue.

00:32:02.899 --> 00:32:04.029
White space.

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:05.029
There's just--.

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:09.840
It's a much better use of white space than
lots of the other apps we've seen, but still.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.269
It could be improved.

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:15.979
Like you guys mentioned, increase in font
sizes, things like that, will help.

00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:21.609
One trick that I find useful when trying to
optimize my white space is to take a screenshot

00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:24.769
of my app as is and start shrinking it down
gradually.

00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:31.039
Shrink it down to about 25%, to even 10% of
its original size and look at that.

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:36.989
If you can still pick out your white space
from the text, and if it doesn't look even,

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:42.890
if it doesn't seem like there's a natural
balance in the negative space and the actual

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.989
text and content, then you probably have a
white space problem.

00:32:46.989 --> 00:32:51.639
Try to think of how you can better fill out
the white space, but don't pack in text into

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:52.639
the white space.

00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:53.799
White space is still important.

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:55.850
But make sure that it's balanced.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.320
That's just one trick.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.200
Shrink it down and see if there's something
that seems wrong in that shrunken version.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.169
&gt;&gt;Meier: I had a question, actually, related
to that.

00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:09.299
If you have a look at this main search results
page, where you have all of these things.

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:12.009
I like that there's lots of images there.

00:33:12.009 --> 00:33:13.820
We do still have those gaps between.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:19.259
I know that one of the UI trends that I've
seen a lot of lately is basically removing

00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:23.429
all of those borders and having basically
zero margins between images.

00:33:23.429 --> 00:33:24.659
&gt;&gt;Chung: Wall of pictures.

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:25.659
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:27.609
Is that something you think would work well
here?

00:33:27.609 --> 00:33:31.969
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Yeah, I think that can definitely
work well in a lot of cases.

00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:38.190
In this case, since the background is white,
I personally find that having this zero pixel

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:44.000
border, text overlaid on top of images, works
really well if the rest of the background--.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.340
I guess the theme of the app is hollow dark,
or just a darker theme.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.220
Otherwise, the white will really stand out.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.700
Actually, one thing that this app may want
to consider doing is trying that.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.419
Trying that wall of images with very little
space in between and having the text overlaid

00:33:59.419 --> 00:34:01.379
on top of the images.

00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:04.859
But then try to switch the theme so that the
left pane is not so bright.

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:09.090
The contrast will be way too high if you have
that kind of wall of images and don't change

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.090
the background.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.090
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's a good point.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.090
That's the other thing I was going to suggest
as well.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.369
As Fred pointed out, I'm not sure if we can
empty the screen.

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:18.730
This is how we get to when we open up the
app.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.899
Again, the whole point of a recipe app is
to make me hungry, make me want to cook stuff.

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:26.889
It seems to me like this would be a great
opportunity to put something here in this

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.240
big empty space, right from the beginning.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.369
The most popular apps--.

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:37.119
Or, sorry, the most popular recipes, or your
favorite recipes, or featured recipes, random

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.510
recipes, basically anything.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.849
Because you have a random recipe button, right?

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:40.950
&gt;&gt;Chung: Why don't you just default it?

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:41.950
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:42.950
Well, no, it's an actual--

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:43.950
&gt;&gt;Chung: Or maybe a big picture--

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:44.950
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:47.960
Or have a recipe or have a bunch of random
recipes.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.429
But something which is going to inspire you,
so that as soon as you open this up, you're

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:55.240
like, "Oh, yeah, actually, that looks like
something I might like to create."

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.020
&gt;&gt;Nurik: It's almost like within zero clicks--.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:03.170
Assume you get featured on Google Play, you
installed the app, and you press the open

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.170
button.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:08.119
Without doing anything else, the user should
think, "Wow, I'm definitely keeping this app."

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:09.160
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.420
Exactly right.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.329
Maybe "recent raters" is perfect.

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:14.329
Yes.

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.549
This is what I would start with.

00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:18.430
These are the recipes that most people have
been raving about.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.150
If I open the app straight--.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.539
It was featured on Google Play, I hit install,
open, boom, and this is what I saw?

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:28.510
Suddenly, I have much more incentive than
just from seeing this big logo.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.430
I can be like, "Oh, those Oreo bowls look
phenomenal."

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.559
[laughs] Straight away, it's like, "I don't
need much for that.

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:37.970
I've got cream cheese and Oreos.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.789
I'm pretty much already sold."

00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:43.280
Straight away, you're scrolling through things.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.109
And again, getting really hungry.

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:48.980
Which is, again, why we want to make sure
that you don't have this long load time of

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.099
each recipe clicking in.

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:53.780
I just want to be able to scroll through this
list and see anything which looks awesome,

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.619
and be like, "Oh wow, I totally need to make
skewered honey balsamic vinegar kebabs."

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:01.560
Wow, I need to stop.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560
[laughs]

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.339
&gt;&gt;Nurik: A commenter on HBC 2000 also mentions
this app might be a little more attractive

00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:10.400
if they used the light hollow theme on the
action bar instead of the dark

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's true.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.940
The consistency there is definitely an issue.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.880
&gt;&gt;Chung: They have the default blue line here.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.299
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] With the red straight underneath.

00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:23.240
&gt;&gt;Chung: The red line is part of their brand.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.430
You can definitely theme a little bit.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.430
&gt;&gt;Meier: Hmm.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.430
Exactly.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.420
Given that you do have this strong color branding,
you may want to consider using, changing the

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.010
color of your action bar to match the recipe
color branding.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.519
That's definitely something you can do.

00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:41.660
But I'm intrigued by Roman's idea of switching
the whole theme around to something dark and

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.640
then emphasizing the images more.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640
&gt;&gt;Chung: Definitely.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:50.619
&gt;&gt;Meier: I'd also point out that the actual
text star that they're using there is a serif

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:55.950
font, which works really well if you're reading
a book or something like that, but it doesn't

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.520
work quite as well on computer screens, and
particularly when you're reading it from a

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.520
distance.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.079
You'll notice most presentations tend to use
a sans-serif font like an Arial or a Helvetica

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:07.040
or something like that.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.760
And again, you may be browsing it sitting
down on your couch, but you're going to be

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.920
using it in a kitchen on a stand, again, from
a distance.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.609
So again, it's great that they let you bump
up the text size.

00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:21.730
I would probably prefer here, either an option
or just a default, to be a sans-serif.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:22.730
&gt;&gt;Chung: That's a good point.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:27.400
&gt;&gt;Nurik: One of the other things I wanted
to mention on fonts is-- And this is unfortunate.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.069
[gong sounds] We just, I guess if we just
didn't have time or if we didn't plan on it,

00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:37.500
but the new font of Android, the new typeface,
is Roboto, obviously.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.510
There's no serif version of Roboto, though.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:41.640
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's interesting.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.589
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Basically, a lot of the improvements,
a lot of the core image and design philosophy

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:49.760
of Android is around the typography.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.049
So you're missing a lot of that by using Android
serif.

00:37:54.049 --> 00:37:58.470
Having said that, there's also Roboto Thin
and Roboto Light.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.740
When you have text that's larger, let's say
in the 30 or the 40 sps, Roboto Light can

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.020
really give it a sense of class or elegance.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:12.020
Coupled with increasing the font size, you
may want to consider using the different weights

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.220
of Roboto.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.220
There are several.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:21.510
Actually, as of Jelly Bean, we bundle very,
very many weights of Roboto, so you have more

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.510
options.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.570
Or you can just bundle the TTF directly here
if you can.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.190
&gt;&gt;Meier: Outstanding.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.190
Cool.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.730
That was our gong in the background, so we're
ready to move on to our next app, which is

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.059
one of mine.

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:34.579
TripIt's hard to demo without having some
trips in there.

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:39.290
We've only got a few minutes, so let's have
a look at IMDb instead.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.450
Based on the two apps that I've looked at
today, you can get a fair idea of how I enjoy

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.280
to spend some of my spare time.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.170
But I'm a big fan of the IMDb app.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.809
This is a great example of an app which users--.

00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:52.190
It's very much its own custom branding.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.540
This doesn't look like hollow.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.170
It doesn't not look like it either.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.369
But it definitely looks like IMDb.

00:38:57.369 --> 00:39:04.870
We have this consistent gray gradient branding
with the quite distinctive IMDb gold logo.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:09.480
And again, if we look at what we've been talking
about so far with today's apps, we load this

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.980
up and straight away, I'm presented with a
wall of images.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.349
I've got video front and center and a scrolling
marquee.

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:20.470
I've got another scrolling marquee down here
of awesome-looking movie posters.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.099
Coming soon is the same.

00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:27.630
This is basically full of imagery.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.990
That, I think, it makes for a really compelling
experience, because straight away, you've

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:35.560
got things to look at, you've got things to
scroll, you've got things to browse.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.200
Overall, I quite like that.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.990
It's not a standard action bar, because it's
too high to be a standard action bar.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:46.930
They've done some interesting things here,
like this overflow menu is clearly not a default

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.619
of the standard overflow menu, or even a standard
pop up menu, which a lot of people use to

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:53.410
simulate that effect.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.010
I don't know.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.569
To me, it almost works in that it's got the
branding, it's got the gray and the gold,

00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:05.260
which is obviously the theme they're going
throughout, but the weird rounded corners

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.000
and the drop shadow strikes me as being a
little off.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.270
This is the first time where I click something
on the app, and suddenly, it doesn't quite

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.049
feel like a native app anymore.

00:40:15.049 --> 00:40:16.180
What do you think, Roman?

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:24.319
&gt;&gt;Nurik: Yeah, I do want to call out, like
you said, the drop shadows, also some of the

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:29.789
gradients, like the title bar or rather the
fake action bar has this stark gradient.

00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:34.670
One of the things we generally recommend,
This is not like a "You must not use gradients

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:39.740
on Android" or anything, but we definitely
recommend using fewer visual effects.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:47.470
Things like drop shadows, things like gradients,
things like glosses.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:52.339
They clash with the minimalistic, cleaner
style of hollow.

00:40:52.339 --> 00:41:00.299
When a user gets their Galaxy Nexus or one
of their ICS devices, they're presented with

00:41:00.299 --> 00:41:02.619
somewhat minimal UI apps.

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:07.950
Apps that give you content and minimize the
number of pixels that are dedicated purely

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:13.230
to aesthetics of the Chrome, of the surrounding
elements of the app.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:20.470
Definitely minimizing that and using some
of the simpler, minimal styles would make

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.470
more sense, I think.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.289
Then definitely using the stock action bar
and tweaking the styles.

00:41:25.289 --> 00:41:26.289
Like you can make that--.

00:41:26.289 --> 00:41:29.940
If you absolutely needed that bar to be taller,
you could tweak that using styles.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.180
You don't have to reimplement the action bar.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.380
&gt;&gt;Meier: In fact, I'd suggest that they probably
don't need to make it taller.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.680
It just feels stretched for no really good
reason.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.820
I like that they've used the standard search
widget here.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.030
That's great.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:48.019
These keys here, "movies", "TV", "celebs",
that, again, strikes me as a little odd, because

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:51.490
they're not really action so much as navigation
cues.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.790
As per the Android stands, I'd expect them
to be over on the left-hand side over here,

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.450
next to the IMDb logo.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:01.320
Similarly, I expect this to behave like a
standard action bar.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:07.609
I'm looking for an up caret on the left here
so that I can return to this, to the main

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:08.609
page.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.440
The navigation actually works the way it should,
but I'm missing some of those standard queues

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.519
that I'm really used to seeing.

00:42:14.519 --> 00:42:21.220
I'd like to see these as default, regular
tabs or something similar to that, rather

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.769
than being actions when they're not really
actions.

00:42:23.769 --> 00:42:26.680
&gt;&gt;Chung: The general pattern goes on the action
bar on the left hand side.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.950
You have the icon followed by a navigation
control.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:35.289
Put everything else, like the action menu
items, on the right-hand side.

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:36.309
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:40.160
Things like "search," they've got in exactly
the right place.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.619
Having all this stuff in the overflow menu,
again, makes sense.

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:46.559
I want to highlight, as well, here, that they
have the ability to sign in.

00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:49.250
You can have an IMDb account and sign in.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.109
Presumably, things like your watch list, some
ratings history, and the ratings you provide

00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:55.450
are all then going to be part of it.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:43:00.119
What a lot of apps do wrong is that they don't
let you use anything until you've signed in.

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:05.299
When you install it off Google Play, hit open,
the first thing you're presented with is this

00:43:05.299 --> 00:43:07.240
sign in screen.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.100
That's a real off-putter, because it's like,
"Well, I've not even looked at this app yet.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:16.259
I have no idea what it wants, and it wants
credentials, it wants me to create an account.

00:43:16.259 --> 00:43:18.390
I want to know what I'm getting into first."

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.869
So I love that about this app, in that it
lets you experience the full app.

00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:27.109
It's not until you want to do something which
requires you to sign in that it actually asks

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:28.109
you to do so.

00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:30.670
It also lets you do so as well here in the
overflow menu.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.600
That style of presenting as much as you can,
and then having additional features as an

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.859
incentive to actually sign in, I think it's
a really good pattern.

00:43:38.859 --> 00:43:40.809
&gt;&gt;Chung: Great point.

00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:43.559
&gt;&gt;Meier: Let's have a look.

00:43:43.559 --> 00:43:46.470
Otherwise, it works pretty much as you'd expect
it to.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:52.170
Let's have a look at Total Recall, a movie
remake which fills me with dread.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.300
I'm a huge fan of Philip K. Dick.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.460
The movie implementations are usually pretty
questionable.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.470
Total Recall, again, is a movie I really enjoyed
when I was younger, but--

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.660
&gt;&gt;Off-camera engineer: [Terminator voice]
It's not a tumor!

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.039
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs] That may be the wrong Schwarzenegger
movie, but nonetheless.

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:14.369
I always wondered about Schwarzenegger in
the lead role of that.

00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:19.640
Colin Farrell is a better match, but I don't
know.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.200
I'm apprehensive, to say the very least, about
this remake.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.920
In any case, you can see here, as soon as
we navigate in, again, we have a wall of pictures.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.279
We have a big image of the movie poster.

00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:31.410
We see the top bill cast.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.720
They're all here on the left.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720
We have galleries.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.640
These aren't scrollable, so I guess you have
to hit "all" to see more of the images.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.799
This is interesting.

00:44:41.799 --> 00:44:43.339
They've got this pop up dialog.

00:44:43.339 --> 00:44:47.740
I hate, hate, hate pop up dialogs, particularly
when there's no obvious way to dismiss it.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.420
I'm going to guess that the back button does
the job.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.420
But I don't know.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.460
I feel like this could be done a little bit
neater.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.460
I like that--

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.460
&gt;&gt;Chung: You could do it in place.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.470
&gt;&gt;Meier: --to be scrollable here.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.470
Just let me scroll through.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:01.970
&gt;&gt;Chung: Yeah, I saw your first inclination
on this section of the screen was to scroll.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:06.200
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah, exactly, because they used
marquees elsewhere in the app, so I'd like

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.579
to be able to just flick through here and
see all the cast without having to change

00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:11.579
contexts.

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:12.579
Same with the gallery.

00:45:12.579 --> 00:45:16.369
If I click on an image, it actually goes to
the artist's page.

00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:17.640
That all makes sense.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.960
&gt;&gt;Chung: Let's check out how sharing is done
in this app.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.859
&gt;&gt;Meier: Done the right way.

00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:23.999
&gt;&gt;Chung: As expected.

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:24.999
That's great.

00:45:24.999 --> 00:45:26.220
&gt;&gt;Meier: Right icons, that's all nice.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:32.920
As you can see, they've really taken this
custom styling to the final degree.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.920
Everything is custom.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.130
These dialogs don't look like normal Android
dialogs.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:38.130
They're quite tall.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.269
They've got the action, not the action bar,
but the title bar on top.

00:45:41.269 --> 00:45:45.240
Now, there's nothing wrong with customizing
the look and feel of these sorts of things,

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.390
but particularly dialogs, which, our general
guidance is to use dialogs only when you're

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.059
doing a system level thing.

00:45:53.059 --> 00:45:54.250
That's when you pop up the dialog.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:58.599
It's like when WiFi is being disabled or if
you want user authentication.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:02.609
Something which is more than just the app,
beyond the context of the app, that's really

00:46:02.609 --> 00:46:04.150
the only time you should be using dialogs.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.289
If you're doing that, then they should look
like the system dialogs so that people know

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:10.089
what to expect.

00:46:10.089 --> 00:46:14.569
Here, What I would say is that rather than
saying you should be using standard dialogs,

00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:18.809
which would, in fairness, look really weird
on top of their custom UI, is see if you can

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:21.089
get out of using dialogs at all.

00:46:21.089 --> 00:46:25.320
Whether doing things in place or having a
different fragment switch out, some other

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.599
way of navigating which doesn't pop something
on top of what you're doing.

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:32.290
Do you hate dialogs as much as I do?

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.290
&gt;&gt;Chung: Not quite.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.460
&gt;&gt;Meier: Not as much?

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:40.380
&gt;&gt;Chung: I agree with your assessment in this
particular scenario where if this implementation

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.559
wasn't in place, transition would be better.

00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:47.930
It felt like I was focusing on the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:51.190
If the dialog pops, it just breaks the continuity.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.670
&gt;&gt;Meier: What about you, Roman?

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.250
In the couple of minutes we've got remaining?

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.769
&gt;&gt;Nurik: I generally agree.

00:46:57.769 --> 00:46:59.510
I generally hate dialogs.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.450
I, more than anything, hate progress and loading
dialogs.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.039
&gt;&gt;Meier: Oh, yeah, well, they are the devil,
clearly.

00:47:05.039 --> 00:47:10.540
&gt;&gt;Nurik: [laughs] In this case, I think the
dialog is really just a shortcut.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:17.170
I feel like in a lot of cases when a developer
doesn't really have a great idea of what's

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.920
the best possible way to present something,
a dialog is a shortcut.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.530
I've definitely done it myself.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.539
I've definitely just said, "Oh, just make
it a dialog."

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:32.339
But definitely, a more complete, a better
solution would be just another fragment gliding

00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:34.789
in, or something of that nature.

00:47:34.789 --> 00:47:38.099
It's tough to avoid dialogs always because
they're very tempting.

00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:39.839
But do try to avoid them.

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:40.839
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah.

00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:41.839
That's a really good point.

00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:43.559
Dialogs do represent, often, a shortcut.

00:47:43.559 --> 00:47:47.700
It's a way of being able to, as a developer,
when you haven't really thought through all

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.809
of the work flows, it's like, "I need to present
this information.

00:47:49.809 --> 00:47:51.260
How can I do that?"

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.510
A dialog is the easiest.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.410
It's like doing a print line as a debugging--

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:55.819
&gt;&gt;Chung: It's like a catch all.

00:47:55.819 --> 00:47:56.819
&gt;&gt;Meier: Exactly.

00:47:56.819 --> 00:47:59.559
It's like using a toast to know whether or
not something's happened.

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:01.770
We all do that as part of our development
process.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:06.749
Like, "Oh, the service has kicked off, so
I'm going to do a toast so I can see if it's

00:48:06.749 --> 00:48:07.749
happened."

00:48:07.749 --> 00:48:10.519
Then, by the time you actually go to production,
hopefully, you've removed all of those.

00:48:10.519 --> 00:48:13.789
There's very few times you actually want to
toast.

00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:14.789
Dialogs should be the same.

00:48:14.789 --> 00:48:21.190
That's when you really want to bring in a
UX designer or someone like that who can figure

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.690
out how that information can be best displayed
to your users.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.299
I think that pretty much takes us to the end
of our allotted time, if we want to give Dan

00:48:29.299 --> 00:48:34.849
and Ian any chance of being able to prepare
in time to go on air.

00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:39.310
Next week, what we've asked you guys to do
is to tell us some podcasting apps.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.910
That's what we're looking for, is--.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:43.609
All of our--.

00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:47.510
We've got all of the Google IO sessions have
been turned into a podcast.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:51.230
Same with all of the Office Hours shows that
we do on Wednesdays.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.789
They're all available as podcasts.

00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:57.060
Really, I want to know: what do you guys think
are the right apps that people should be using

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.079
to consume these?

00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.430
That's what we're going to be looking at next
week.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.609
Hopefully, if you guys suggest some podcasting
apps.

00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:04.609
&gt;&gt;Chung: Hopefully we'll get some.

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:05.609
Not zero apps

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.609
&gt;&gt;Meier: Indeed.

00:49:06.609 --> 00:49:09.920
I have a few which I use as well, so we will
be doing podcasting apps one way or the other.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.740
It's either going to be the ones that we've
heard of and use, or it's going to be the

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.109
ones that you guys would like to see us talking
about.

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:16.940
Tune in for that.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.200
The other thing that we have--.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.539
This is a special request.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:22.369
As you can see, we have a gong behind us.

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:25.920
As you can see, it is a gong that has been
optimized for a phone.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.910
If anyone out there has a gong app, which
looks like a gong, and when you press it [gong

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:31.910
sounds]

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.390
&gt;&gt;Chung: It sounds like a gong.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.710
&gt;&gt;Meier: It sounds like a gong.

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.710
We want to hear about it.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:40.579
There's a opportunity here to either promote
your own app or build one specifically for

00:49:40.579 --> 00:49:41.579
us.

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:45.619
It will be up here on the Friday App Clinic
every week.

00:49:45.619 --> 00:49:47.109
That's the other reminder as well.

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:50.470
We have the App Clinic now, for those of us
who missed us at the beginning.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.519
Hence the white coat.

00:49:52.519 --> 00:49:57.280
We're really all about trying to look at the
things which apps are doing well, things which

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.819
apps are doing poorly, and try to help you
guys and developers understand how you can

00:50:01.819 --> 00:50:06.059
build apps which are really great and provide
a magical experience.

00:50:06.059 --> 00:50:07.670
So we're going to sign off.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.509
We'll see you guys next Friday.

00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:10.509
Thank you for joining us.

00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:11.509
&gt;&gt;Chung: All right.

00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:11.599
See you guys.
