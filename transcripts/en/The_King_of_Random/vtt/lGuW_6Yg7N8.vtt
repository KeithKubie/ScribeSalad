00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.600
if you completely dehydrate soda.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.500
Does it become a syrup?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Can we get it to being a hard powder?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.700
Can we then mix it back
into some carbonated water

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.320
and make soda once again?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.100
[Captions by Y Translator]

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.400
Previously, we've done an
experiment where we boiled soda

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.200
until all of the water in it was gone.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.120
And that was pretty cool.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.540
But it had one thing in it
that I didn't really like.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.380
And that's the heat of the stove.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.580
It was so concentrated
that it began burning

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.100
the non-water ingredients
after all of the water had boiled off.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.120
I wanted to see what would happen
if you just pulled the water out

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.900
but kept the temperature low enough,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.780
that it wasn't going to burn anything else.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500
Sugar melts at approximately 320°F

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.560
and a lot of chemical changes 
start happening when that goes on.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.100
So instead of that,
we're going to be using

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.240
the Dehydro-Tron 5000.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.200
Pouring some soda into some
trays and seeing what we get

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.620
if we just dehydrate all of the water out.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.520
It might take a few days,
but we'll just keep it running.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.192
The idea here is really simple.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.400
We'll pour out the soda
into a couple of trays,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.360
stick them in the dehydrator
until it doesn't seem

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.920
to be doing anything anymore.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.320
And then see what it looks like.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.980
To start off, we've got two
of these cheap aluminum trays.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.900
They don't quite fit
into our dehydrator.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.900
We're going to cut the walls
down a little bit short.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020
It does fit in terms of the other dimensions.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.740
It's just that each trays a little too tall.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.720
So let's shorten those.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.760
Please note.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.300
If you do this with any nice scissors,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
it will probably ruin them.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.152
These came in a pack of five for $5.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.720
So, I'm not too worried about it.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.720
There we go.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.120
We've got our two trays.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.540
I think I'm going to put
them in the dehydrator

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.960
and then just pull them out a little bit

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.760
before I pour the soda in so I'm not like,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.440
lifting a tray full of
splashy liquid everywhere.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.600
Let's get this set up.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.440
If you've watched our other videos,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.320
you may remember the Dehydro-Tron 5000.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.580
This is a cardboard box lined with foil.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.920
We have a 250 watt heat lamp

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.660
and a small computer fan right here.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.620
Once both of those are on
at the same time,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.700
we get about 150°F

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.340
and a lot of good circulation.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.740
With the holes in the top,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.860
and the door closed,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.680
all the air flows in, up and out the top.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.500
It does a really good job
of drying things out.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.740
And we need to dry these out a lot.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.280
The tray is fitting nicely in there.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.280
Start with the cola.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.800
These are 20 ounces.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.640
It's 591 milliliters.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.720
Okay it's looking pretty full.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.960
It's not quite even
because our table isn't quite level.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.320
But that's all right.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.620
Fan is plugged in and it's blowing 
in of course if I turn on the light,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.920
I have adjustable control
over the brightness

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760
to some degree that also
controls the temperature as well.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.840
I don't think I'll go for maximum heat.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.980
Lot of bubbling going on.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.860
Turn it off for just a second.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.040
As we close the door here,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.920
carefully because we don't 
want to spill all over.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.740
Now of course we just need to let this run

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.900
and I'm not actually
going to leave it out here.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.820
I'm very carefully
going to move everything

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.040
to an indoor location.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.980
So it's not just exposed
to the elements.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.320
But we're just going to let this run.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.820
That's it.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.980
Its gonna dehydrate
and that takes time.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520
We need to slowly evaporate 
all of the water out.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.320
We'll try and check in
at about the 12 hour mark.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.700
And after that, we'll probably
just see how long it takes

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.500
for it to completely dehydrate.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.040
Update time.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.440
We've actually let this run
a little bit more than 12 hours.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.240
It's run for about 14.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.760
Let's check out what has happened
to our sodas in our dehydrator.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.740
Okay.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.460
Wow.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.360
So there is

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.240
clearly a lot less mass here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.320
That is definitely not 20 ounces.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.900
Definitely not our 591 milliliters.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.220
That is wow.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.000
You can see how thick that is.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.360
It's running like a syrup.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.540
See if our cola is the same.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.780
I think that's a little runnier,
but it's still definitely

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.920
thicker than soda.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.120
Not much running or just a little bit.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.360
Of course I have to taste these.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.920
Orange soda syrup.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.420
Well it tastes like orange soda.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.480
Oh man.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.640
It doesn't taste quite the way
I think I imagined it would.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.800
Obviously it's very sweet
because there's a lot

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.940
of sugar still in there
without a lot of water.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.220
But the other flavors when they
become concentrated like this,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.120
they don't really seem to scale

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.900
the same way that the sugar does.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.940
It's actually, there's a fair 
amount of bitter flavoring to it.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.000
This brand of orange soda
does actually have caffeine in it

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.780
and I know that caffeine is a 
flavoring used in lots of types of sodas.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.280
And maybe that's part
of what I'm tasting.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.080
It is sort of a bitter flavoring.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360
The orange definitely
comes through the most.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.920
But there are other flavors in there.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.380
It's not terribly different
from orange cough syrup.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.360
So.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.800
Let's try the cola.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.220
Definitely a thinner syrup.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.340
I'm not sure why.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.780
Oh man.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.020
The diluted Coke is really really strong.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.360
Very cola flavor, very strong sugar flavor.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.580
And it also has some of the bitter flavor.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.800
What I think we need to do
now is take our syrup trays,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.300
put them back in the dehydrator
and just keep letting it run.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.600
I'm really hoping that this
can dehydrate all the way out

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.400
to the point where we
don't even have a liquid.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.300
Where it's something that's 
dry and maybe crackly

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.920
and maybe even can be
broken up into a powder.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.760
But that may or may not happen.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.020
I haven't tried this before.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.680
Let's find out.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.400
We have now left our soda 
dehydrating for a long time.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.440
These trays were in the dehydrator,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.860
for about a week solid dehydrating.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.120
That's quite a bit.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.200
And it didn't take very long for
most of the moisture to disappear.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.260
And I was just seeing
if it would go even farther,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.100
I was trying to see if we
could get like a powder

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.380
or something crystallize.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.000
And it doesn't seem that that happens.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.500
There's enough other ingredients
other than water that what we end up

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.520
with is this thick sticky syrup.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.540
This 20-ounce bottle was 
entirely emptied into this tray.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.040
And this is all we have left.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.320
Almost everything has gone.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.040
So by far the largest part
of this was water.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.300
The second ingredient
in both of these bottles

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.380
of soda was high fructose corn syrup

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.480
and I'm guessing that's what's 
causing it to be a thick syrup

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.920
rather than just a powder.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.280
The high fructose corn syrup
clearly doesn't dehydrate

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.040
all the way down to being dry.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.500
So now what we want to do
is gather up all of the syrup

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.200
from one of these and put it into a cup

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.600
and see just how much of it we have left.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.060
Now this is thick enough
that I might have a hard time

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.880
getting all of it off
the bottom of the pan

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.200
but I'm going to do what I can.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.400
Random fact.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.660
The term soda is from the word sodium

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.320
which was a common mineral
in natural springs water.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.780
The word pop was first used in 1812
and referred to the sound

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.620
of a carbonated beverage opening.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.500
Almost all of the syrup.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.620
There's a little bit stuck
in the pan that I couldn't get out.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.100
And I would say we have
just under 1/4 cup.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.860
But now the question I think,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.960
is whether or not we can put this back

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.280
into the soda bottle and add water.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.900
Well we don't necessarily need
to mix it up in the bottle.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.740
But we do want to see if we
can reconstitute this into soda.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.260
Well I'm going to start
just by filling this bottle

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.300
with about 20 ounces of water.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.200
I'll try and leave out about that much.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.000
And then I'm going
to pour that into a pitcher

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.300
because it's easier to stir in

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.800
and we're going to scoop
and scrape all of this syrup

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.720
into the water and see
if it will dissolve back in.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.300
We're getting a change
in the color of the water.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.420
So at least the color is dissolving in.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.500
There's definitely some mixed in.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.900
There's a lot still in the bottom.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.280
I'm going to switch over

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.300
to something with a longer handle.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.220
And it's rigid so I can hopefully scrape

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.860
more off of the bottom as it,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.640
it just sinks to the bottom 
and then it's so sticky.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.160
It sticks even while it's covered in water.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.640
I think that has mostly dissolved
back into our carbonated water.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.440
So,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.060
make sense at this point
that we have to do,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.580
is test it out.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.820
Let's pour some off into a cup and

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.540
see if we've made something drinkable.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.180
Definitely has lost much
of the carbonation.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.840
But there's still some 
bubbles around in there.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.100
Now let's see how it taste.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.840
Hmm.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.260
It has the general taste.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.240
I think there's a little bit too much water.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.100
And probably that's because
we've lost some in our pan,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.740
we've lost some in our cup,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.400
we've lost some on our spatula.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.180
And so we probably don't have it
as concentrated as it should be.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.880
I don't know it almost seems
like it's missing more than that.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.160
And again, also part of that is
because it's not carbonated now.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.800
Real quick.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.980
Let's see if we can get the same result

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.700
or any sort of result using orange.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.040
When I'm going to concentrate
this one even less.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.000
I don't know what is
different about them.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.400
But we seem to have less
of the orange syrup

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.920
than we did of the coke syrup.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.100
I don't know if it just has fewer
ingredients

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.600
or more evaporated away,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.600
or the base ingredients of 
flavor for Cola are stronger

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.920
and so you need more corn syrup

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.920
to offset that.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.080
It's really hard to tell.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.420
I think that is mixed in as well
as it's going to mix in.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.700
Color doesn't look quite
as vibrant in my opinion

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.300
as it did when it was new

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.640
but we'll see maybe even though
I only filled that bottle halfway,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.800
it's still somehow not
concentrated enough.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.920
That would be interesting.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.300
Maybe the color dye
doesn't like to be dehydrated.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:36.742
Cheers.

00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:40.222
Oooh.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.480
That actually maybe too concentrated.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.960
That's strong.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.000
Reconstituting dehydrated soda.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.080
Does it work?

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.140
Not really.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.340
I give that like a C- at very best.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.780
Once you've made the syrup,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.400
it doesn't really mix in very well.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.700
It takes a lot of time
and effort to get it to mix

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.620
and the process de-carbonates

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.400
pretty much all of the liquid.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.320
So you end up with something very flat.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.400
And the flavor is very similar
but somehow a little bit

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.680
different than the original.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.700
So while I'd say it's very interesting to see

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.400
what happens when you remove
all of the water from soda,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.940
that thick, gloopy, severely colored syrup

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.240
is pretty interesting stuff.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.520
But I would not say that 
it's a practical application

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.560
and I wouldn't suggest you try
and make dehydrated soda syrup

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.360
that you can later mix back in.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.420
I do think it's really cool to see what's

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.600
in a bottle of soda other than water.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.500
Guys that's not all.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.700
We've always got more for you to see.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.500
That box up at the top
will transport you

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.640
directly to our last video
and you should check that out.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.640
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.540
you should be watching next.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.400
And if you hit this bomb,
you'll be a subscriber to the channel

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.980
so you never miss out on the fun.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.320
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.640
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.420
Talk to you then.
