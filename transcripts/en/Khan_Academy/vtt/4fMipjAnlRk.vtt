00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:02.424
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians,
today we're going to talk

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.630
about subject-verb agreement.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.355
What this is, is the idea
that you want your subject

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:11.292
and your verb to get along in a sentence.

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:15.364
What agreement is, in grammar, is the art

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:18.726
of making sure that sentence
parts connect with one another

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:20.290
in the right way.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.457
It's making sure that a square
peg goes in a square hole.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.507
Right, not a square peg in a round,

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:28.839
square peg in a triangular hole.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.807
You want to make sure that the way you

00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:34.224
render your subject

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:36.782
fits with the way you've
rendered your verb.

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:38.161
What do I mean by that?

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.244
Let's take this sentence,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.637
the dog barks.

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:47.440
We have this subject, the dog,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.213
and it is singular,

00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:50.310
there's one of it.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.050
The way this verb is,
the word is conjugated,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.826
the way this verb is conjugated,

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.959
the way we've assembled, or figured out

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.397
how the verb is going to be

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:01.402
is also a singular conjugation.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.569
So, we say the dog barks
and not the dog bark, right?

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.058
This is not standard American English.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.941
This is the plural form.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:20.380
You can say the dogs bark, right,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.768
because there's more than one dog here

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:24.939
and this is their verb,

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.354
this is their plural form.

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:30.258
I know it's kind of strange
that the third person,

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:33.091
singular form of a verb ends in S.

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:37.485
Like, if English made sense--

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:39.330
OK, like, if I ran the zoo, right,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.552
I would want it to work like, this,

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:43.313
the dogs barks, right,

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:44.880
because there's an S, there's multiple.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.047
Unfortunately, for many weird
reasons, and the history

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.790
of English, it didn't work out that way.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.812
A third person singular verb

00:01:55.812 --> 00:01:57.562
usually ends in an S.

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:02.737
Right, I talk that's first person.

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:07.494
Third person is she talks.

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:11.935
We eat.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.116
That's plural first person.

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:19.699
They eat, see no S.

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:22.623
It's only this weird

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:28.124
third person singular, here,
that's got that S on the end.

00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:29.905
So, if you're trying to figure out

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:31.507
how to make something agree,

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:33.838
if you're unsure as you're writing,

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:35.756
so if you're looking at a sentence like

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.398
the dogs bark.

00:02:37.398 --> 00:02:38.937
And, you can't figure out if it's suppose

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:41.575
to be the dogs bark or the dog barks,

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:43.327
or the dogs barks,

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:47.176
as yourself first, what is
the subject of the sentence?

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:48.800
So, first find the subject,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.017
and then ask yourself

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:52.651
is it singular or plural.

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:55.125
Is is S or P, is it salt or is it pepper?

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.261
And, then if you can remember that,

00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.347
then just remember

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:03.744
that singular S usually
results in another S.

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:07.245
So, if it's the dog, and that's singular,

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:10.512
then you're gonna want
to put that S over here.

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.968
So, if the subject isn't
noun but a pronoun,

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:14.004
same question.

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.098
Is it singular or plural?

00:03:16.098 --> 00:03:18.406
I is singular, there's only one me.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.574
We is plural, there's many of us.

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.885
And, if it's singular third person,

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:25.885
so like she, he, it, end it in an S.

00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:30.010
Another thing to remember, is that most

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.677
what we call indefinite pronouns

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.967
are third person singular.

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:38.387
So, if you wanted to ask whether or not

00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:40.728
anyone knows the way to
San Jose as a question,

00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:42.644
but you're not sure whether or not

00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:45.281
it would be does anyone
know the way to San Jose,

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.814
or do anyone know the way to San Jose?

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:51.267
Well, the work anyone is
third person singular,

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.696
and all though do is an irregular verb,

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.433
we still kind of hold to the idea

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.789
of the third person
singular verb ends in an S.

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.789
So, it's a z sound, written as an S,

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:03.677
so we would say does.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.707
Does anyone know as opposed to

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:17.597
if it were in the plural.

00:04:17.597 --> 00:04:19.097
Do we know, right?

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.446
So, does is singular, do is plural.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.396
And, that's kind of the basic idea

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:28.916
of subject-verb agreement,

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:30.488
cause you want to make sure

00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:33.498
that the number of things in your subject

00:04:33.498 --> 00:04:37.032
matches up with the
number in your predicate.

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:39.372
So, is the subject singular or plural?

00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:41.036
If it's third person singular,

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:43.000
the verb probably ends in an S,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.794
even though the third person singular

00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:47.877
noun or pronoun does not.

00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:52.660
You can learn anything, David out.
