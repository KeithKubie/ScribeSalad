00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.020
He died in 1849, aged 63.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.020
He was one of the important ones. Now we know
nothing of him save his name.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.500
Dust to dust.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.700
It sounds peculiar to want to come out here,
to the old graveyard and the ruined church

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.110
- for no motive other than to take in the
philosophy that emanates from them.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.520
How much these places have to teach us...

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.580
Nothing can matter quite so much when this
is what all achievement will amount to.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.820
There can be no protection from this fate.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.600
Once people sat in pews here; they were proud
of their new hat or fine gloves; they nodded

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.720
to their neighbours and whispered the occasional
rumour; they discretely scratched their legs;

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.310
they examined their consciences; some felt
deeply sorry for the wrongs they knew had

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.510
done others.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.140
Now, the institution, and not just this particular
building, is in ruins.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.320
They were trying hard of, course.
They tried to make death less terrifying.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.000
They invented rituals to bring consolation
and dignity to grief.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.500
They used soaring music.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.300
Lofty mysterious spaces.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.940
Stained glass.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.079
They invented powerful, magical stories which
said that dying was only a transition to another,

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.019
more real, existence. That there was a God
who would show us mercy.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.620
They wanted to remind us that loss is universal,
inevitable and not the end.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.620
That the sorrow we feel, though heartbreaking, is part of the plan.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.020
We don’t want to go back to those old beliefs.
And anyway, we can’t.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.660
But they didn't get everything wrong.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.040
The churchyard whispers to us about the shortness
of our days.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.380
These people were just like us.
Then it was over - as it will be for us too

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.520
- before long.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.560
Life is at best 500 000 hours of consciousness.
Many of which are behind us already.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.980
This haunting place urges us - with melancholy
poetry - to alter our lives and our priorities

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.980
while a little time still remains to us.
