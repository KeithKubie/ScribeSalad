hi I'm Carl Zimmer a columnist for The
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.549
hi I'm Carl Zimmer a columnist for The
New York Times and I'm in conversation

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559
New York Times and I'm in conversation
 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.680
New York Times and I'm in conversation
with Heather Berlin a neuroscientist at

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690
with Heather Berlin a neuroscientist at
 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.390
with Heather Berlin a neuroscientist at
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount

so Heather Ivy genius is this word that

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380
so Heather Ivy genius is this word that
 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.070
so Heather Ivy genius is this word that
we all use but I am really curious what

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080
we all use but I am really curious what
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.070
we all use but I am really curious what
people like you think about the word

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080
people like you think about the word
 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.170
people like you think about the word
yeah I guess well I mean I can describe

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180
yeah I guess well I mean I can describe
 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.300
yeah I guess well I mean I can describe
it looking through it my lens as a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310
it looking through it my lens as a
 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.740
it looking through it my lens as a
neuroscientist I mean I think just the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750
neuroscientist I mean I think just the
 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.720
neuroscientist I mean I think just the
word genius is a really all-encompassing

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730
word genius is a really all-encompassing
 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.170
word genius is a really all-encompassing
term and what we try to do is kind of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180
term and what we try to do is kind of
 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.750
term and what we try to do is kind of
break it down into the constituent parts

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760
break it down into the constituent parts
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.700
break it down into the constituent parts
and try to understand the neural

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710
and try to understand the neural
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.620
and try to understand the neural
mechanisms that drive those things so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630
mechanisms that drive those things so
 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.350
mechanisms that drive those things so
for example I think a really big part of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360
for example I think a really big part of
 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.020
for example I think a really big part of
what it means to be a genius is to have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030
what it means to be a genius is to have
 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.340
what it means to be a genius is to have
a great deal of creative or like novel

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350
a great deal of creative or like novel
 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.959
a great deal of creative or like novel
thinking making these novel associations

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969
thinking making these novel associations
 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.959
thinking making these novel associations
between ideas having a lot of pattern

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969
between ideas having a lot of pattern
 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.660
between ideas having a lot of pattern
detection so it's not just about

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
detection so it's not just about
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.799
detection so it's not just about
collecting a bunch of data and knowing a

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809
collecting a bunch of data and knowing a
 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.930
collecting a bunch of data and knowing a
lot of facts but it's making these novel

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940
lot of facts but it's making these novel
 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.120
lot of facts but it's making these novel
connections between ideas and I think

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
connections between ideas and I think
 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.920
connections between ideas and I think
what we want to look at is for example

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930
what we want to look at is for example
 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.539
what we want to look at is for example
what is the neural correlate of

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549
what is the neural correlate of
 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.280
what is the neural correlate of
something like divergent thinking or

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290
something like divergent thinking or
 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.280
something like divergent thinking or
thinking outside the box having having

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290
thinking outside the box having having
 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.200
thinking outside the box having having
novel associations between ideas and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210
novel associations between ideas and
 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.490
novel associations between ideas and
that's the kind of thing that we can

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500
that's the kind of thing that we can
 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.980
that's the kind of thing that we can
begin to measure so how can you measure

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990
begin to measure so how can you measure
 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.810
begin to measure so how can you measure
something like that so it's been

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
something like that so it's been
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.910
something like that so it's been
actually quite a problem how to quantify

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920
actually quite a problem how to quantify
 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.870
actually quite a problem how to quantify
this not just genius but let's say

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
this not just genius but let's say
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.010
this not just genius but let's say
creativity and we're breaking it down

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
creativity and we're breaking it down
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.929
creativity and we're breaking it down
particularly what I'm interested in is

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939
particularly what I'm interested in is
 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.300
particularly what I'm interested in is
is improvisation so when people are

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
is improvisation so when people are
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.149
is improvisation so when people are
being spontaneously creative and what

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
being spontaneously creative and what
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.520
being spontaneously creative and what
was that important to you what does that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530
was that important to you what does that
 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.789
was that important to you what does that
get it so I think that a lot of what's

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799
get it so I think that a lot of what's
 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.080
get it so I think that a lot of what's
happening in the brain is happening

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
happening in the brain is happening
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.170
happening in the brain is happening
outside of awareness and we when we're

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
outside of awareness and we when we're
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.289
outside of awareness and we when we're
when we have our sort of conscious brain

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
when we have our sort of conscious brain
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.340
when we have our sort of conscious brain
highly active it's it's kind of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
highly active it's it's kind of
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.020
highly active it's it's kind of
suppressing a lot of what's going on

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
suppressing a lot of what's going on
 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.120
suppressing a lot of what's going on
outside of wines and sometimes when

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130
outside of wines and sometimes when
 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.740
outside of wines and sometimes when
people are being creative they say it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750
people are being creative they say it
 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.749
people are being creative they say it
almost feels like things are coming from

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759
almost feels like things are coming from
 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.370
almost feels like things are coming from
outside of them when they're in this

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
outside of them when they're in this
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.100
outside of them when they're in this
sort of flow state and we're starting to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110
sort of flow state and we're starting to
 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.300
sort of flow state and we're starting to
understand a little bit more about that

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310
understand a little bit more about that
 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.219
understand a little bit more about that
state and it seems to be that when

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229
state and it seems to be that when
 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.160
state and it seems to be that when
people are being creative in the moment

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
people are being creative in the moment
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.050
people are being creative in the moment
that the part of their brain that has to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
that the part of their brain that has to
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.210
that the part of their brain that has to
do with their sense of self always self

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220
do with their sense of self always self
 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.399
do with their sense of self always self
awareness self consciousness is turned

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409
awareness self consciousness is turned
 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.140
awareness self consciousness is turned
down it's called the dorsal lateral

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
down it's called the dorsal lateral
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.299
down it's called the dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex where is it it's sort

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:18.309
prefrontal cortex where is it it's sort
 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:19.739
prefrontal cortex where is it it's sort
of like right here it's part of the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:19.749
of like right here it's part of the
 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.059
of like right here it's part of the
prefrontal cortex on the

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
prefrontal cortex on the
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.039
prefrontal cortex on the
dorsal on the lateral sides so you can

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049
dorsal on the lateral sides so you can
 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.440
dorsal on the lateral sides so you can
actually see that change like the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
actually see that change like the
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110
actually see that change like the
activity in there is changing and these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
activity in there is changing and these
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.089
activity in there is changing and these
kinds of situations yeah so for example

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099
kinds of situations yeah so for example
 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.410
kinds of situations yeah so for example
there's been a few studies and we're

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
there's been a few studies and we're
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.720
there's been a few studies and we're
doing a new one now but in in the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
doing a new one now but in in the
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.190
doing a new one now but in in the
studies all seem to show that for

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
studies all seem to show that for
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.990
studies all seem to show that for
example when a jazz musician is

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000
example when a jazz musician is
 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.089
example when a jazz musician is
improvising compared to when he doesn't

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099
improvising compared to when he doesn't
 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.890
improvising compared to when he doesn't
memorize piece or even a rapper when

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
memorize piece or even a rapper when
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.630
memorize piece or even a rapper when
he's doing a freestyle rap compared to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640
he's doing a freestyle rap compared to
 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.490
he's doing a freestyle rap compared to
doing a memorized rap there's a similar

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
doing a memorized rap there's a similar
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.069
doing a memorized rap there's a similar
pattern of activation across the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079
pattern of activation across the
 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.990
pattern of activation across the
improvising rappers and the improvising

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000
improvising rappers and the improvising
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.839
improvising rappers and the improvising
jazz musicians and they have a decreased

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849
jazz musicians and they have a decreased
 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.699
jazz musicians and they have a decreased
activation in that dorsal lateral

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
activation in that dorsal lateral
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.619
activation in that dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex which has to do with

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629
prefrontal cortex which has to do with
 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.509
prefrontal cortex which has to do with
self-awareness monitoring your ongoing

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519
self-awareness monitoring your ongoing
 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.099
self-awareness monitoring your ongoing
behavior making sure it conforms with

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109
behavior making sure it conforms with
 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.990
behavior making sure it conforms with
social norms but they have also

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000
social norms but they have also
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.479
social norms but they have also
increased activation in a part of the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489
increased activation in a part of the
 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.740
increased activation in a part of the
brain called the medial prefrontal

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750
brain called the medial prefrontal
 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.229
brain called the medial prefrontal
cortex which is sort of like right here

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
cortex which is sort of like right here
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.640
cortex which is sort of like right here
a little if you go straight back a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
a little if you go straight back a
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.860
a little if you go straight back a
little bit and that is turned up and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870
little bit and that is turned up and
 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.360
little bit and that is turned up and
that has to do with the internal

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
that has to do with the internal
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.000
that has to do with the internal
generation of ideas it's coming from

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010
generation of ideas it's coming from
 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.369
generation of ideas it's coming from
within its stimulus independent so if

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379
within its stimulus independent so if
 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.629
within its stimulus independent so if
you think of this state you're having

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639
you think of this state you're having
 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.270
you think of this state you're having
this sort of free flow of unfiltered

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
this sort of free flow of unfiltered
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.129
this sort of free flow of unfiltered
information coming from within that's

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139
information coming from within that's
 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.589
information coming from within that's
not being inhibited by that dorsal

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599
not being inhibited by that dorsal
 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.270
not being inhibited by that dorsal
lateral prefrontal cortex you don't have

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280
lateral prefrontal cortex you don't have
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.219
lateral prefrontal cortex you don't have
to worry about how do people think about

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229
to worry about how do people think about
 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.140
to worry about how do people think about
me and that free flow of information

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150
me and that free flow of information
 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.379
me and that free flow of information
allows for the novel associations to be

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389
allows for the novel associations to be
 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.879
allows for the novel associations to be
made if you think about a similar

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889
made if you think about a similar
 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.469
made if you think about a similar
pattern of brain activation happens

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:37.479
pattern of brain activation happens
 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.469
pattern of brain activation happens
during dreams or during daydreaming or

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479
during dreams or during daydreaming or
 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.240
during dreams or during daydreaming or
metis some types of meditation or

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250
metis some types of meditation or
 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.309
metis some types of meditation or
hypnosis where you lose your sense of

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319
hypnosis where you lose your sense of
 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.409
hypnosis where you lose your sense of
self and time and place and it allows

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419
self and time and place and it allows
 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.530
self and time and place and it allows
the filter to come off so that novel

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
the filter to come off so that novel
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.119
the filter to come off so that novel
associations are okay you know dreams

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129
associations are okay you know dreams
 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.219
associations are okay you know dreams
don't all make sense that's where the

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229
don't all make sense that's where the
 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.349
don't all make sense that's where the
creativity comes in so that's why I'm

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359
creativity comes in so that's why I'm
 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.180
creativity comes in so that's why I'm
interested in that state to see what

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190
interested in that state to see what
 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.589
interested in that state to see what
happens in people when they're in that

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599
happens in people when they're in that
 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.449
happens in people when they're in that
state because I think that's a big part

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459
state because I think that's a big part
 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.809
state because I think that's a big part
of what is involved with genius so I'm

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819
of what is involved with genius so I'm
 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.140
of what is involved with genius so I'm
picturing like someone in a scanner

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
picturing like someone in a scanner
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.080
picturing like someone in a scanner
wrapping and it's hard to picture so I

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090
wrapping and it's hard to picture so I
 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.539
wrapping and it's hard to picture so I
mean what how did what does it look like

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549
mean what how did what does it look like
 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.030
mean what how did what does it look like
I mean how do you I mean experiments are

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
I mean how do you I mean experiments are
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.300
I mean how do you I mean experiments are
so difficult to set up you've figured

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
so difficult to set up you've figured
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.069
so difficult to set up you've figured
something out so how does it work yeah

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079
something out so how does it work yeah
 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.499
something out so how does it work yeah
so what we're doing is and again it's

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509
so what we're doing is and again it's
 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.480
so what we're doing is and again it's
hard to make something ecologically

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
hard to make something ecologically
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.430
hard to make something ecologically
valid or sort of simulate what it's like

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440
valid or sort of simulate what it's like
 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.050
valid or sort of simulate what it's like
in the real world when you're laying in

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060
in the real world when you're laying in
 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.640
in the real world when you're laying in
this you know tube and there's this big

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650
this you know tube and there's this big
 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.800
this you know tube and there's this big
clicking sound so what it is is so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810
clicking sound so what it is is so
 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.060
clicking sound so what it is is so
there's a loud clicking noise in the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070
there's a loud clicking noise in the
 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.719
there's a loud clicking noise in the
scanner and we

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
scanner and we
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.999
scanner and we
picked a beat that matches the clicking

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009
picked a beat that matches the clicking
 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.890
picked a beat that matches the clicking
beat in the scanner you know so that

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
beat in the scanner you know so that
 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.230
beat in the scanner you know so that
it's not distracting and what we do is

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240
it's not distracting and what we do is
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760
it's not distracting and what we do is
in one condition we have them do a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770
in one condition we have them do a
 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.339
in one condition we have them do a
memorized rap and there was a similar

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349
memorized rap and there was a similar
 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.549
memorized rap and there was a similar
study that was done by another group in

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:47.559
study that was done by another group in
 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.140
study that was done by another group in
a small group of rappers but we've kind

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150
a small group of rappers but we've kind
 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.540
a small group of rappers but we've kind
of elaborated on that and we know in the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
of elaborated on that and we know in the
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.249
of elaborated on that and we know in the
improvised state we have we show them

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259
improvised state we have we show them
 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.679
improvised state we have we show them
random images and they have to improvise

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689
random images and they have to improvise
 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.200
random images and they have to improvise
and incorporate those images into their

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210
and incorporate those images into their
 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.510
and incorporate those images into their
rap in real time and we're giving them

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520
rap in real time and we're giving them
 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.029
rap in real time and we're giving them
real-time audience feedback so we're

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039
real-time audience feedback so we're
 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.909
real-time audience feedback so we're
having other professional rappers with

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919
having other professional rappers with
 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.249
having other professional rappers with
the dial going up or down because that's

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259
the dial going up or down because that's
 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.139
the dial going up or down because that's
part of the real world situation when

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.149
part of the real world situation when
 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.429
part of the real world situation when
you're improvising it's about audience

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439
you're improvising it's about audience
 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.989
you're improvising it's about audience
feedback whether it's comedy improv

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:12.999
feedback whether it's comedy improv
 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.209
feedback whether it's comedy improv
theater improv and we want to see how

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219
theater improv and we want to see how
 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.029
theater improv and we want to see how
that feedback affects their their sort

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039
that feedback affects their their sort
 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.049
that feedback affects their their sort
of creativity but how does that feedback

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:22.059
of creativity but how does that feedback
 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.089
of creativity but how does that feedback
and other people being aware of other

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099
and other people being aware of other
 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.129
and other people being aware of other
people listening to you how's that

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139
people listening to you how's that
 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.439
people listening to you how's that
connect with your ideas about how these

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449
connect with your ideas about how these
 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.420
connect with your ideas about how these
circuits are involved with the self are

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430
circuits are involved with the self are
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.700
circuits are involved with the self are
coming down when you're being creative I

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
coming down when you're being creative I
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.860
coming down when you're being creative I
mean I would think like you know if

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870
mean I would think like you know if
 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.679
mean I would think like you know if
you're in that flow state you could be

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689
you're in that flow state you could be
 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.300
you're in that flow state you could be
performing in front of an empty room

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310
performing in front of an empty room
 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.949
performing in front of an empty room
because you're just all it's all about

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:40.959
because you're just all it's all about
 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.589
because you're just all it's all about
what's coming from within yeah so what

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599
what's coming from within yeah so what
 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:44.999
what's coming from within yeah so what
we think is there there so there's

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009
we think is there there so there's
 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.290
we think is there there so there's
something called the default mode

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300
something called the default mode
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.409
something called the default mode
Network and that seems to be sort of

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419
Network and that seems to be sort of
 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.269
Network and that seems to be sort of
active it's sort of a neuro circuit of

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279
active it's sort of a neuro circuit of
 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.519
active it's sort of a neuro circuit of
the brain that's active when you're your

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529
the brain that's active when you're your
 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.679
the brain that's active when you're your
focus of attention is internal so when

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689
focus of attention is internal so when
 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.360
focus of attention is internal so when
they're kind of flow state we see

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370
they're kind of flow state we see
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.639
they're kind of flow state we see
activation of the default mode Network

00:05:59.639 --> 00:05:59.649
activation of the default mode Network
 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.709
activation of the default mode Network
but what we think is that there's

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719
but what we think is that there's
 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.570
but what we think is that there's
occasionally this they have to monitor

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580
occasionally this they have to monitor
 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.549
occasionally this they have to monitor
the environment seeing you know how am i

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:05.559
the environment seeing you know how am i
 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.439
the environment seeing you know how am i
doing what is it so then they'll switch

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449
doing what is it so then they'll switch
 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.360
doing what is it so then they'll switch
into what's called the executive network

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
into what's called the executive network
 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.089
into what's called the executive network
which is looking externally instead of

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099
which is looking externally instead of
 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.189
which is looking externally instead of
joining different knit circuit of

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199
joining different knit circuit of
 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.719
joining different knit circuit of
neurons we're talking about

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729
neurons we're talking about
 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.339
neurons we're talking about
yeah I'm sure flipping back and forth

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349
yeah I'm sure flipping back and forth
 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.230
yeah I'm sure flipping back and forth
yeah between these two sort of

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240
yeah between these two sort of
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.480
yeah between these two sort of
internally focused and generating new

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490
internally focused and generating new
 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.820
internally focused and generating new
ideas and externally focused kind of to

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830
ideas and externally focused kind of to
 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.350
ideas and externally focused kind of to
monitor your situation because if you

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
monitor your situation because if you
 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.239
monitor your situation because if you
think about it when if you just are

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:27.249
think about it when if you just are
 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.070
think about it when if you just are
having a random flow it's not like a

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080
having a random flow it's not like a
 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.049
having a random flow it's not like a
jazz musician is just playing random

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:31.059
jazz musician is just playing random
 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.029
jazz musician is just playing random
notes or rappers just saying random

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039
notes or rappers just saying random
 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.429
notes or rappers just saying random
words it has to make sense you know it

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:35.439
words it has to make sense you know it
 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:37.139
