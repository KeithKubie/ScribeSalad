TODD KERPELMAN: Hello.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.500
I'm Todd Kerpelman for
The Developer Show.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.050
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.910
news from Google.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.740
Android Q Beta 2--

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.650

available along with an updated

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.730
SDK.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980
Included in this release
are privacy features

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.990

feedback, a new way

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.950

large amounts of data

at extremely high
speeds and low latency.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.510
But configuring it
is a technically

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.880
challenging and
time-consuming task.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.610

to help you easily deploy

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.215
