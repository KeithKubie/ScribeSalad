00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Welcome
everybody to Thursday at 3:00

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.380
and the Rare Book and
Special Collections Division,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.060
part of the Rare Book Forum.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.190
Some of you are familiar faces
but leave it to Peter to draw

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.180
in a whole new crowd as well.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.510
It shouldn't surprise any of
you that you know, Peter Zilahy;

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.580
he's going to be speaking
about time.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.560
I met Peter when he first arrived
as a Kluge Scholar two years ago?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.280
Yes. At that time I was working in
the reading room and at the desk

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.210 position:56%
in the reference section, which is a
grand theater seat for the division

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.820
but also you're kind
of a prime target.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.320
So, Peter came by and
as often as those of you

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.730
who know Peter will know a short
conversation with Peter turns

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.640
into endless story after story
and it became kind of this moment

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.030
that I would look forward to when
he would walk in the reading room.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.310
We would go over everything from
panslovic backgrounds to any number

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.640
of issues with books to his current
work; so it's been a real pleasure

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.370
to have him associated with
the division all these years.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.040
Today he's going to be speaking
on in essence perception

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.070
or how we relay our perception
of time and timelessness.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.630
I won't say more because
he, as you know,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.930
if you know him will have a very
unique take on the subject matter;

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.510
so please welcome Peter,
and it's all yours.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.230
&gt;&gt; Peter Zilahy: Mark thank you
very much for the introduction.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.650
It's strange how memory works

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.110
because I remember
our first encounter.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.300
You were the one who was telling
the stories, endless stories.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.160
So the title is Time
and Timelessness,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.140 position:56%
everything you always wanted to
know about time, but you were afraid

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.150
to ask, the brackets naturally
refer to the Q &amp; A at the end.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.690
So, because of the
camera I will mostly read

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.550
because I wouldn't
like to make a mistake.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.090
So my last talk at the Library of
Congress was on visual thinking

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.390 position:56%
with lots of images and visual aids.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.860
So, this time I decided to
keep it more personal due

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.100
to the subject matter, that
is time and timelessness,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.310
and also because of
furniture in this room.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.930
Look at that amazing piece
there, if you are getting bored,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.900
just admire it and it can pass your
time in perfect visual harmony.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.150
If you don't see that table at
the end, you should really check

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.780
that out that's an
amazing collector's item.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.880
And so I should call
this work in progress,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.130
but that would already mean
taking a side in the debate

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.680
that is literally as old as time.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.890
So there's another lecture
at 4:00 at the Kluge Center,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.930
so no hard feelings for
those who will have to go.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.180
I just wanted to inform
the rest of the people

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.300
that if anybody leaves the
room before the fat lady sings,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.330
it's not because she's bombing.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.590
As you can see Thursday's are
popular for lectures and talks,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.350
and Thursday are also
popular in literature.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.730
There are novels whose plots
take place in a single day.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.360
Mrs. Dalloway takes place
on a Wednesday in June 1923,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.590 position:56%
perhaps because Thursday had already
been taken by James Joyce's Ulysses,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.930
also in June exactly 113 years ago.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.820
The books that you can
see on the table there

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.420
and perhaps holding your hands
later were written by me.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.290
And as you will see are full of
images as opposed to my lecture.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.360
They play the theme of
childhood and dictatorship.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.000
One of them looks like a
children's dictionary and it's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.780
about among other things,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.770
a childhood span behind
the Iron Curtain.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.710
The idea was that everybody
was treated like children

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.030
by the regime, not just me.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.250 position:56%
But my parents and teachers as well,
so a children's dictionary seemed

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.690
to be the ideal form
to write about the era.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.120
I'll give you a short example.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.240
"Bath time was during the news.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.080
Every now and then mother would
look in to see if I was all right.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.850
Dad was watching TV
in the living room.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.460
To protect me from the lies
they had to know the details.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.450
I could hear mother sighing,
what a mess I was making

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.990
on flooding the apartment.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.590
I dived down.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.950
Under the water I heard a voice
telling me what had happened

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.320
in the world that day.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.850
A landslide killed 150 people in
Bangladesh, a revolution broke

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.600
out in West Africa,
a new kindergarten

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.850
and Olympic swimming
pool were opened,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.330 position:56%
and MTK beat Ferencvaros two to one.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.850
I had no idea who was
sending the messages or why,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.390
but clearly they had plans for me

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.020
because they also told me what
the weather was going to be like.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.480
The following day I could
distinguish several voices

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.220
in the tub which pointed
towards an organization.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.640
This manner of communication
seemed logical.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.100
I couldn't send them messages
because you can't talk under water,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.650
and they could only get in
touch with me without my parents

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.100
and teachers knowing
during my bath time.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.330
I didn't understand why it was
important for the organization

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.370
that I should have detailed
information on the latest war games

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.800
in Poland, or which Transdanubian
towns were being granted city

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.100
status, but I knew that
if I paid attention sooner

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.610
or later I'd be given a sign.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.990
My life gained a deeper
meaning under water

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.630
when one Sunday mother
was washing my hair

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.850
and unsuspecting she pushed
my head into the water;

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.460
a pleasant female voice
whispered in my ear

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.150
that the harvest had
been flattened by hail.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.140
I knew immediately
what was expected of me

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.650
and to be honest I
had no objections.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.350
To make a big mess.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.110
From that day on I
sabotaged the development

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.180
of our people's democracy
like a busy honeybee.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.490
Earthquake, power failures and
gas explosions marked my way.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.560
I would figure out the location of
military objectives on the basis

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.730
of intelligence I received
in the bath tub.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.520
When a factory or a power plant was
inaugurated I would be there doing

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.960
what I had to do.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.360
Comecon fiddled at repairs behind
the Iron Curtain, little suspecting

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.170
that some, that a stone was being
thrown inside the glass house."

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.370
In the opening of Either
or, Kierkegaard,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.430
the Danish Philosopher
talks about the brazen bull

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.880
which is both an instrument
of torture and music.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.800
Filary is the tyrant of
a Greek city/state more

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.500
than 2,000 years ago had this
device for his pleasures.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.450
The bronze bull was
heated from below

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.240
and the victim was slowly
roasted while his screams came

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.530
through as music with
the help of various pipe

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.040
and some clever engineering.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.050
This actually happened.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.180
There are no recordings
of the musical quality

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.260
because as you know recording
devices are rather modern form

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.840
of torture and the
brazen bull is ancient.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.960
What is a poet Kierkegaard
asks, an unhappy person

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.360 position:56%
who conceals profound anguish in his
heart with whose lips are so foreign

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.850
that his cries sound
like beautiful music.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.050
And the crowd goes, "Sing again,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.580
me and you suffering
torture your soul".

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.450
Music and torture was never far
from each other as well illustrated

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.770
by the British Heavy Metal
band Iron Maiden that was named

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.940
after a torture device
of similar sorts.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.290 position:56%
Only that device never actually
existed, but was completely made up.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.260
They do look amazing, so you
can still find Iron Maiden

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.800 position:56%
in torture museums around the
world, if that's where you hang out.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.530
Fictional torture device sounds
like a collection of bad poetry

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.450
or a novel that is literally
crime scene, we've all been there.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.520
By the way bad poetry
causes dementia.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.650
Even if you're not
listening just sitting nearby,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.020
it's like secondary smoke
and you get lung cancer.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.630
Just Google it.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.060
Anyway this is a perfect place to
make a statement, be it philosophy,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.710
literature or science there are
only good books and bad books.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.150
Good books connect the world;

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.920
bad books make money
and/or cause dementia.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.910
Play to [Inaudible] Kierkegaard

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.350
and Nietzsche wrote some
great literary works.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.370
Even Wittgenstein had
some amazing one liners.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.480
At the same time a lot
of good literature turned

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.050
out to contain great philosophical
or scientific insights.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.480
Those [Inaudible] not only
influenced Kafka a great deal

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.680
but Einstein as well.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.760 position:56%
You must look at the bigger picture,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.470
which is also why I'm not
showing small images this time.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.900
Coherence plays back
in the long run.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.760
So, to be fair Kierkegaard writes

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.400
that he would rather be a
swineherd understood by his pigs

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.070 position:56%
than a poet misunderstood by people.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.290 position:56%
So if you are a poet you just need
to find the place where your screams

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.490
in pain are appreciated as
beautiful music or start a blog.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:13.290
This - that's enough
of my go to humor.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.970
Dictatorship have great audiences,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.490
and not just because
people cannot leave but also

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.130
because everything
has a double meaning.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.660
To read between the
lines is key to survival

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.880
but also a creative process
that's much more entertaining

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.210
for an informed crowd than
any form of [Inaudible].

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.030
Your expectations define
the reading.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.460
Sometimes you cannot see the
forest from the metaphors.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.710
To be informed does
not necessarily mean

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.320
to have enough information,
but to be given clues.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.260
Clues for reading a state
of affairs that makes sense,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.140
or seem to make sense and makes
your life more meaningful or seem

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.920
to make your life more
meaningful meaning is

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.220
in the eye of the beholder.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.080
When I, as a child growing

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.600
up in a dictatorship everything
had a political meaning.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.290
Books could sell ten times
more copies than today

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.390
for the underlying meaning.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.060
This has disappeared for decades,
perhaps it's coming back now

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.040 position:56%
but for a long time politics was not

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.510
that interesting for
a general audience.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.910
Though a few months ago I read some
stats that I did not double check,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.420
but apparently Breitbart
had more hits than Pornhub,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.830
which means that with successful
marketing politics could reach

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.290
out for more people
than we expected.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.430
We should really stop this.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.330
Censorship can also be
a source of success.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.660
Back in the day when I was a
young poet one oven guard magazine

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.770 position:56%
published a few of my teenage works.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.860
The issue had a strange
cover that became a scandal.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.560 position:56%
It had a caricature of the Hungarian
court of arms going back more

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.490
than 1,000 years, but instead of
the two angels holding the shield,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.140
they portrayed two horny
devils masturbating.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.760
This has of course, freaked
out a few conservative members

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.060
of the parliament and the leader

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.560
of the farmers party was waving the
magazine in front of the parliament

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.980
in live coverage asking for the
copies to be smashed immediately.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.800
But because of the scandal
and the free advertisement,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600
they sold five times
more copies than ever

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.030
and a lot more people
could read my poems.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.330
Moving on.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.850
Not only dictatorship
have great audiences,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.650
but dictatorships are not
necessarily bad for literature.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.900
Bad for the individual, but not
bad for the quality of the art.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.620
In fact, most great works
of literature that we know

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.190
of were written in
some form of tyranny.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.610
Since democratic governments
are pretty new,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.290
in fact Greek democracy only
happened in a few cities

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.840
for a short period of time
and it was widely regarded

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.000
as a bad idea for a long time.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.770
But every coin has two sides.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.920
Kierkegaard also wrote the
tyrant dies and his rule is over,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.640 position:56%
the martyr dies and his rule begins.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.010
Phalaris apparently was overthrown
by his people and tortured to death

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.240
in his favorite musical instrument

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.640
so his slaves could all hear his
swan song from the brazen bull,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.980
play things with the
Gods, very Greek idea.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.960
It's everywhere in Plato and
the Greek tragedies and in spite

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.260
of what you may have heard

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.170
in history class more
overwhelming majority

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.760
of the Greek population lived
in some sort of tyranny.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.230
Now in a good old 20th century
dictatorship history is cut off

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.780
from the past and people are forced
into living in an eternal present.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.120
My country was cut off from
the network that it used

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.320
to be part of for a millennia.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.480
The two sides of the coin, the
20th century were either the fake

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.680
enthusiasm of totalitarian
regimes like Stalinism and fascism

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.400
and pretending that everything
is happening right now,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.240
like never before, or
the version I grew up in

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.580
where you had the impression
that nothing is happening

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.180 position:56%
and nothing is ever going to change.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.840
When I was a kid most people
including the most educated

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.920 position:56%
seriously believed that the division
of Cold War Europe and the rest

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.340
of the world will remain
like that forever.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.650
I was one who didn't.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.590
I studied history and I
learned that things change.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.180
I thought the Wall will come
down some day and I wanted

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.920
to see it before that happens.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.100 position:56%
So, I went to all the nearby
countries in the former Soviet block

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.330 position:56%
to see the end and participate in
the protest that changed the system.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.180
I saw the euphoria.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.920
The moment when people all of
a sudden started to believe

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.060
that finally they can take
their lives in their own hands.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.860
It was a carnival in many cities,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.590
especially in Berlin,
Prague and Belgrade.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.240
Here's a paragraph from my book.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.210
In Belgrade, time is
measured in faces.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.930
After a week I began to
recognize people in the crowd.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.240
In a years' time I would
recognize everyone.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.330 position:56%
Anyone who has a face also has time.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.670
Watches are worn as ornaments, the
hands enclosing an arbitrary angle

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.870
that matches the wearer's mood.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.690
It's not possible for me to be
late if I stay on the street.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.220
The time for the demonstration
can be read from the faces.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.840
You look at someone and
you know: it's time.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.350
Neither of you will get
there on the agreed time,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.110
but you meet somewhere else
where you wouldn't have met

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.870
if you had gone to where
you were supposed to meet.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.980 position:56%
Belgrade had escaped side real time.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.450
People look one another in the eye.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.750
They are whirling

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.060
on the merry-go-round
in a shower of confetti.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.290
A chain reaction of faces
in a triggered explosion.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.150
Belgrade faces are
incendiary, quick to flare up.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.990
It is impossible to
become invisible.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.870
The Belgrade are not faceless.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.810
Out of any two faces,
one is always you.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:46.100
The way we look at time is deeply
rooted in our habits and lifestyle.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.120
We observe changes
and we call it time.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.450
We had very different
observation behind the Iron Curtain

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.400
and what behind means
is already a viewpoint.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.950
You were behind from
our perspective.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.370
This could be a source of
many thought experiments.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.450
Just take Vietnam for example; it
took me decades of my adult years

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:11.880
to realize that if you have lost
Vietnam, then they must have won.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.180
Then who are we?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.540
Then of course nobody
really looked at it that way

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.230
and you don't see many blockbusters

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.260
from the Vietcong perspective
either.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.050
If they were to do
it, they should start

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.090
by imagining how time was
passing in those rabbit holes.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.300 position:56%
Can we step out of our box and think
of time beyond our own experience,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.140
are we always going to be late.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.920
Timelessness smartly is also
based on your experiences.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.940
So your timelessness and my
timelessness may never sit

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.380
at the same table or the
same universe for one.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.770 position:56%
Timelessness seems to be a state and
you have all the time in the world,

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.390
which does not make sense, if
you consider time as rhythm.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.380
Experiencing time can
also add to our sensation

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.730 position:56%
in seeing another country or another
continent is profoundly alien.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.390
When I was 13 years old my
parents drove me and my brother

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.500
to Western Europe one
summer holiday.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.630
We had never been to
the West before,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.270
passing Austria, we
didn't even blink.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.660
It didn't feel that much different.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.960
But when we arrived to Germany we
saw American soldiers with tattoos

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.830
and big motor bikes just like
in an Oliver Stone movie.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.560
I'm not kidding, we got genuinely
scared and we wanted to go home.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.980
The west felt cold and cruel.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.160
We wanted to go back to our safe
little communist dictatorship.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.740
Luckily my dad didn't approve.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.670 position:56%
On the two sides of the Iron Curtain
people had very different views

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.970
in time.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.810 position:56%
In America it seems nobody has time.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.450
Everybody is busy.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.250
You buy your time.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.590
We had a completely different idea.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.600
We had a lot of time on our hands.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.600
You could learn Japanese or
Swahili, higher math or whatever.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.950
You had time, but you did not have
things as opposed to the other side

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.440
that had a lot of things to
play with but no time to do so.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.890
Behind the Iron Curtain you could
visit your friends at 2:00 a.m.,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.300
no problem, just knock on the door.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.440
You did not have to call,
anyway few people had phones.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.320
And the reason for this was
that you're equally unimportant.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.250
When you are unimportant you
have all the time in the world.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.850
The idea of a job behind the Iron
Curtain was that you were there

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.760
with the intention of getting
nothing done, which is both cruel

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.800
and bad work could be a problem,
when nothing becomes nothing.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.100
It's safe.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.500
And not being safe in a
dictatorship can be quite different

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.870
from what may scare
you in these parts.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.450
When I traveled more and I saw that
in the west everybody is so busy,

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.260
even the cleaning lady is busy
for weeks ahead you kind of have

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.130
to make an appointment you're your
children if you wanted to see them.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.640
It was culture shock, but
it was really about time.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.170
You may call it culture or jet lag.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.570
If you ever had children you know
that time changes around a baby.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.030
As if you have entered
a different time zone.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.180
You don't know how long at
night or a day is to a child,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.460 position:56%
Joan Berger argues in Fortunate Man.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.370
It may be that subjectively
a childhood is much longer

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.650
than the rest of a lifetime.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.540
There is no dedicated sensory
organ that detects time,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.440
it again might suggest
that the passing

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.010
of time is a psychological
phenomenon.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.140
Time ticks fast or slow depending
on their age, emotional state,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.470
whether we are in pain or
in love, or just bored.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.070 position:56%
As a child we learn time by playing.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.440
Just like lion cubs learn to
kill, we learn to kill time.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.950
How we deal with time
reflects on us.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.250
In New York we are watching
the ball drop on Time Square,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.160
counting backwards and forwards.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.960
The idea of living in the past or
in the future, but unable to live

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.240
in the moment, unable to
exist without references,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.850 position:56%
without measuring or time constantly

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.730
but also measuring our
importance in comparison to others.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.960
That's what we do waiting
for a moment.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.320
And by waiting together
it feels more real.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.890
We're afraid to miss it.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.230
We're afraid of falling out
of time, of not existing,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.570
of not having a life, so we try to
prove our existence by being busy.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.520
Facebook is a perfect way
to avoid the presence,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.670
by being constantly present.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.340
A perfect distraction
with a measure of likes.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.950
Another aspect I should
perhaps mention here,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.800
still talking about the
point of view is the role

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.600
of humor in a dictatorship.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.890
We watch television and
we saw very serious,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.120
very boring people telling lies.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.610
Then we went on to the pub and
then we heard jokes that were true.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.770
You could only tell
the truth as a joke,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.590
otherwise you could get arrested.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.830
I still do not trust people who
are always serious, they lie.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.760 position:56%
A lack of movement seems to be
pretty absurd if you're able to look

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.950
at it from a distance,
absurdity was a daily bread

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.870
of the communist regime.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.460
Absurd humor thrive behind
the Iron Curtain together

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.430
with absurd theater.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:19.020
When life is absurd normality can
seem unnatural even revolutionary.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.090
The riot police breaking
through the fog come marching

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.730
down the embankment, the static
perhaps too blatant but authentic.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.680
Some people start to run but most
stand transfixed as if they're

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.390
at the shooting of a costume drama.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.160
In the scene many men in armor
are marching in formation,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.020
the clanking of the shields and the
thud of the boots parting in an air

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.390
of heightened solemnity
to the troop.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.970
The movements are not robot-like
but loose after having to stand

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.960
around helplessly for so long,
they feel a sense of liberation.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.540
They're fired by the will to fight.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.850
They approach with steps
neither hasting or leisurely

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.330
but rather homely like someone
going out to check the mail

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.510
who knows full well
that it won't run away,

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.930
a steaming hot breakfast
is waiting for him.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.390
It's just gone out for a moment,
accept has spotted something

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.430 position:56%
in the grass, some large object, a
forgotten bowl or pair of sunglasses

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.600
and he proceeds to kick it
to the side with his leg.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.440
In the Communist dictatorship
nobody is important individually

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.280
and money is not worth much so you
can only create value by sacrifice.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.100
Human sacrifice is
crucial to the regime.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.250
What's wrong with a little
human sacrifice compared

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.430
to eternity dictators would say.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.070
In a university in which
everything is laid out eternally

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.380
and unchanging, innovation
is impossible.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.580
Time is an illusion according

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.080
to the ancient Greek
Philosopher Parmenides.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.440
And a deeper reality is
eternal and unchanging.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.170
Now he has departed from this
strange world a little ahead

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.640
of me, that signifies nothing.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.850
For us, believing physicist the
distinction between past, present

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.550
and future is only a
stubbornly, persistent illusion.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.490
Albert Einstein wrote this a
month before his own death,

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.550
about the death of his
lifelong friend Michele Besso.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:16.070
For Einstein the past and
the future exist eternally,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.720
time does not flow, it just is.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.160
In fact, all physical theory so
far devised, Etonian mechanics,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.610
Einstein's two theories
of relativity,

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.740
even quantum mechanics
are time symmetric.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.530
No era of time is indicated.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.650
There is no physical reasons
why a smashed plate might not

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.040
rejoin itself.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.130
This is hard science, not fiction,

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.100
or gene sequences are 95%
identical to those of yeast.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.300
The difference between yeast

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.580
and the human being is largely
a matter of organization.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.220
We share 50% of our
genetic code with a banana.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.510
The same goes for a book, content
is one thing, but it's a matter

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.620
of how you organize your material.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:08.160
Please do not understand
me too quickly.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.980
Andrew Sjeed (ph) wrote, There
is a reason why we think slowly.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.320
To also think fast,
they do not think.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.440
They are hoarding information.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.230
Your scientists have discovered
that the brains of people

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.340
with high IQ's tend to
be highly integrated

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.620
in neuropath connecting
distant brain regions.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.640
Why less intelligent people's brain
build simpler, shorter routes.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.400
But no one knows why some brains
construct much longer range

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.350
connections than others.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.910 position:56%
Perhaps it has to do with the
bigger picture or a bigger illusion.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.140
I guess it's time for
a little Kafka.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.670
I'm going to give you
three quick quotes;

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.290
the meaning of life
is that it stops.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.150
I am free and that is why I'm lost.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.340
I am a cage in search of a bird.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.230
Reading Kafka time and space seems

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.940
to be very different
from your own world.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.490
It can never get from A to B, and
it's hard to tell whether it's

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.040
because of temporal
or spatial relations.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.510
Another quote, the first
sign of the beginning

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.010 position:56%
of understanding is the wish to die.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.000
That's kind of the
definition of time according

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.380
to Kafka in my interpretation.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.150
There is an infinite amount of hope
in this universe, but not for us

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.870
and that's the definition of space.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.280
I would like to point out
if needed that this humor

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.850
and if it doesn't sound funny,
you still have a lot of time.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.460
We are dying, that's what
we do and we need a sense

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.220
of humor for the journey.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.040
So let's talk about death and time.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.780
There are two kinds of
literature in this respect.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.590
Here it is hard to refrain from
the joke that there are two kinds

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.450
of people in the world, those
how say that there are two kinds

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.670
of people in the world and
those who say there aren't.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.450
So there are two kinds
of literature.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.670
One that says "I'm going to die".

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.680
It's a scream but all we hear is
just beautiful music of course,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.700
that's the domain of poetry.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.700
And the other kind says
"Hey we are all going

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.380
to die" this could be a novel
going on for 1,000 pages or a play

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.320
by Shakespeare where you have all
the characters laid out in the end.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.490
With every work of art we create
a specific form of time for

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.130
or against death depending
on your disposition.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.650
But before it starts to get
way too serious here's a bit

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.370
for comic relief.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.770
The time is measured by death, in
this case not necessarily your own.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.640
For those who may not know the
names in the next paragraph,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.350
they're all communist
dictators and bad, bad people.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.080
My bumpy road to sexual
maturity was paved

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.740
with the death of communist
dictators.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.320 position:56%
My first sexual experience coincided
with the death of [Inaudible].

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.490
I was bitten by a girl called
Diana in nursery school.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:59.910
My voice broke when Tito died and
I first came and Brezhnev went.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.320
For three days there was nothing
but classical music on the radio,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.430
which I thought was over doing
it; some schools even closed.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.960
Then for a long time, nothing.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.220
As an experiment I took
a girl to the movies,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.500
but the film was too good
and I got cramps in my hand.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.470
Events accelerated in high school.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.070
It was only a couple of
months between the first kiss

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.120
and the first frantic
fumbling following Andropov,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.000
Cherenkov also checked out.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.070
A couple more weeks and
it was [Inaudible] turn,

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.480
but I'd rather not go into that.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.690
I first found out about the G spot
when [Inaudible] was executed.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.750
[Inaudible] cast new light
on my broadening horizons,

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.060
luckily the charges were dropped.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.760
Fidel, this I wrote
a long time before.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.100
Still waiting.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.890
Our expectations define time, more
than the orbit of suns and planets.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.310
If you can look death
right in the eye,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.560
if you have no trouble going
gently into the good night,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.120
if you take away the
fear and horror of death,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.120
what would you write about?

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.440
What would you do if you had
all the time in the world?

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.220
What would even the word "do" mean?

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.580
Time for a little [Inaudible].

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:15.790
The devil appears in
Ivan Karamazov (ph)

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.020
in an old fashioned clothe wearing
a huge golden ring and no watch.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.760
For the devil time is relative

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.950
or at least not measured
in an earthly manner.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.510
In the theory of relativity
time is not independent

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.470
of space, but united with it.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.440
Einstein was reported to have
remarked that he learned more

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.650
from Dostoyevsky than
from other scientists.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:40.120
Dostoyevsky work is a
quest for a cosmic order

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.810
that would not ignore the
sufferings of individuals.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.040
But Einstein attempts to
find harmony in the universe

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.410
on the large scale that would not
ignore action on the nano level.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.530
He was known for his fierce
resistance to new theories

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.790
and quantum mechanics
that would imply

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.840
that microscopic processes
are random.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.790
Einstein's famous remark "God
does not play, dies" is an analogy

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.960 position:56%
to Ivan Karmoslov's rejection to
any harmony built onto the suffering

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.050
of a child, for this
would imply that God plays

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.450
with the fates of individuals.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.130
And that would be as mentioned
earlier a very Greek idea indeed.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:25.020
Dostoyevsky's clock was ticking
in a more Judao Christian manner.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.430
Ivan also complains to Iesha that
his mind is too three dimensional.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:34.830
And he would need to think 4-D
to understand divine harmony.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.140
He's too down to earth and does
not get time even in his dream;

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.730
the devil wears no watch,
that kind of a 3D guy,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.640
talking about revolution
or space time.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.170
And another quote, who has said
to have been both a chronophiliac,

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.860
a lover of time and a
chronophobiac someone who dreads

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.950
to loss of things and time.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.290
Perhaps a good angle on this
is that he was a lepidopterist,

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:04.140
a butterfly collector who collects
miniature monuments of death.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.260 position:56%
The main character in Adda, his most
complex novel claims I confess I do

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.560
not believe in time.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.970
And then goes on about the
highest enjoyment of timelessness

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:21.720 position:56%
and ecstasy and behind the ecstasy a
sense of oneness with sun and stone.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.850
A thrill of gratitude
to whom it may concern.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.970
Navaco's hero negates the future
and so does proofs by the way

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:33.590
and embraces the past
which equates with death

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.330
and conceive eternity
as a work of art.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.280
Space is comedy, time is tragedy.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.120
And the suspicious hyphen
between them, no he does not

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.810
like the idea of space time.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.880
That would be of course
tragic comedy.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.030
In Adda, the core of the book,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.750
the texture of time is
revealed by the intervals.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.230
Nothing prevents mankind as such
from having no future at all.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.120
Either by evolving
into a novo [Inaudible]

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.310
which will enjoy other
variety of being and dreaming,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:10.500
beyond man's notion of time, or by
evolving into a sub-human slime.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.420
I wish to caress time.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.110
I delight essentially in time and
its stuff and spread in the fall

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:20.910
of its folds, in the very
palpability of its [Inaudible].

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.620
Time is written, in
[Inaudible] of warm, humid night.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.230
Brain ripple, breathing,
the drum in my temple,

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.670
these are faithful time keepers.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.800
And reason corrects
the feverish beat.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.670
Maybe the only thing that hints
at a sense of time is written,

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.290
the great gap between the black
beats, the tender interval,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.280
the regular throb itself merely
brings back the miserable idea

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.690
of measurement.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.950
But in between something
like two time lurks.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.300
If my eye tells me
something about space,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.690
my ear tells me something
about time.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.650
I can listen to time
only between stresses.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.990
Listening not to time itself
but to the [Inaudible] coursing

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.420
through my brain, space
is the imposter.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.840
Some critiques may say
that this is pseudo-science

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.070
and pseudo philosophy, but
there's also poetry and science.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.960
[Inaudible] came up with a
theory of cosmology selection

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.970
to explain the universe
not going in -

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.960
to explain how the
universe got going in time.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.340
He reconceived the universe as
if it were some kind of organism.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.360
Everything in the universe
is evolving at every scaling

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.820
to novelty according to Smolling.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.490
He believes at the quantum
level the deeper reality is time

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.790
and not space.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.910
I think it likely that space
would turn out to be an illusion,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.760
Smolling remarks, a way to
organize our impressions of things

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.820
on a large scale, but only
a rough and emergent way

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.480
to see the world as a whole.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.610
And now back to Kafka who
writes, by believing passionately

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.010
in something we create it.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.540
The non-existence is whatever we
have not sufficiently desired,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.770
so lack of existence
is lack of desire.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:15.360 position:56%
There's a dream equality to the
trial, the court itself is not real,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.160 position:56%
but reactions to the court are real.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.370
The dreams are more or less real

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.100
than our daily life depends
on the level of desire.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.100
Kafka had dreamt the world that
we call real today and we have

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.230
to face it on a daily basis.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.280
If you visit the Kafka museum
in Prague you will find

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.360
that the shop is bigger
than the rest of the place.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.370
There is Kafka on everything.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.640
You can even buy Kafka
underwear and if you know

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.780
that the very image had already
been doctored by his publisher back

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.710
in the day you may say
it's rather Kafka-esque.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.610 position:56%
Today we even call Kafka-esque
stuff that was written before Kafka.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:33:00.170
Reality is imprecise said the
physicist Werner Heisenberg,

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.630
which is rather Kafka-esque
coming from an [Inaudible] who was

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.680
in charge of Nazi atomic
bomb project.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.840
According to Kierkegaard
the truth is a trap,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.920
you cannot get it without
it getting you.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.010
Newsbore once said that quantum
mechanics only makes sense

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.970
if you change the meaning
of the word understand.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.000
&gt;&gt; Peter Zilahy: Einstein
said that the problem

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.250
of the now were seriously.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.150
He explained that the experience

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.770
of the now means nothing
special for man.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.130
Something essentially different
from the past and the future

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.410
but that this important
difference does not

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.090
and cannot occur within physics.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.940
That this experience cannot
be grasped by science seen

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.910
to him a matter of painful,
but inevitable regret.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.960
Physical theories do
not privilege now.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.440
Physics tells us that
everything that will ever happen

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.490
in the universe has
already happened.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.480
Dostoyevsky writes
[Inaudible] last night

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.470
in which each moment
stretches into eternity.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.580
And now one paragraph, and I know -

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:19.190
I was a virgin but
it didn't bother me.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.780
I didn't have a clue.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.080
The world was black and white.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.890
You could watch it on TV.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:27.560
It's still in front of me, extra
time in the whole Argentina final,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.380
the link up of the bother
[Inaudible] the death of the king.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.920
I didn't know who Elvis was,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.910
but my dad was [Inaudible]
The gas explosion

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:40.030
in [Inaudible] the volcanic
clouds over Mt. St. Helen's,

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.330
the Hungarians space flight

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.330
and the Rubik Cube world
championship in Budapest.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.190
Sports were exciting
in black and white.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.160
During a boxing match you
had to count the number

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.530
of strips on the guys socks.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.670
I even remember how many
strips my first date had,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.480
not sure about the
color of the eyes.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.540
I see her in black and white.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.370
After the first kiss my parents
bought a colored TV and it turned

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:06.250
out that the Dutch are
orange, the Italians are blue

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.050
and there are green and red devils.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.170
Only the Germans remain
black and white

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.050
as if they were being punished.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:19.260
The country was split into two as
well, almost felt sorry for them.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.510
What we think and what we know
about the universe has changed

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.050
through centuries and change
the same way in the future.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.240
Today people believe in space ship

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.320
and that's what they
expect appearing in the sky,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.620
and not Zeus appearing as an eagle.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.450
Science has historically
taken the physical world to be

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:41.180
out there separate from
us and it's not surprising

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.160
that it has not succeeded
in describing consciousness.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.160
The outside world cannot
be separated

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.340
from the experience we have of it.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.280
Consciousness appears to be a
construction like virtual reality.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.560
It's an illusion but
no less real for that.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.860
There is still a real world

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.220
but the two natures
hidden behind the illusion,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.880
what we call real is the
illusion we most believe in.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.590
Ludwig Wittgenstein while he
was a professor at Cambridge

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.430
at Trinity College
once wondered in front

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:14.270 position:56%
of his students why do people say it
was natural to say the sun revolved

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:18.970
around the earth, for
which one student answered,

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.930
"Because it looked like that".

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.250
To which Wittgenstein
replies, "And how would it look

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.340
if it was the other way around"?

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.180
All right.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.890
I can cut it short, do
we have five minutes?

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:44.200
Okay, I do a little more reading.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.130
When my grandfather
was the same age as me,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.610
[Inaudible] showed
the heir apparent,

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.180
fait brought the failed student
and the future emperor together.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.870
The meeting brought
immortality to both and death,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.170
they did not know each other

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.540
and possibly they exchanged
a look, how do you do.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.280
The princette and the prince,
the prince and the pauper.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.820
One thing is certain they
both heard the shots.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.690
Since then in the depths
of parks [Inaudible] prince

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.880
of statues are shooting are
France Ferdinand statues.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.300
The trench warfare of
[Inaudible] Prince of Streets

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.220
with France Ferdinand avenues.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.310
You can't battle over memorial
plaques, museums, medals, films,

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.850
in Sarajevo they took down the
statue of the crown prince,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.910
his death which gave
millions a cause to die

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.850
for was the crowning
achievement of his life.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.240 position:56%
The first world war began as a feud.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.160
When my grandfather
was the same age as me,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.840
his fate crossed that of another.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.830
Both men were called
up as volunteers

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.110
into the imperial and royal army.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.830 position:56%
Both were sent to the southern front

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.280
and during the Russian
offensive, both to Galicia.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.590
Both distinguished
themselves, [Inaudible]

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.180
and his company captured an 18
member strong Russian union,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.690
while during a surprise attack
my grandfather received 21 shell

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.560
fragments and a bunch of medals.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.960
When they wanted to amputate his
leg he pulled a gun on the surgeon

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.020
and ordered him out
of the operating room.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.740 position:56%
Within a year they were both taken
prisoner and both loss consciousness

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.780
in the middle of hand
to hand combat.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.080
They wake up in hospital

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.080
and in their fevers they both
haunted by an earlier trauma.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.920
My grandfather thinks they
want to amputate his leg,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.910
while JB accuses the saint
hanging above his bed

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.460
of trying to steal his clothes.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.720
After several failed
attempts of fleeing,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.280
the revolution catches
up with them in Russia.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.200
[Inaudible] is caught by the
Bolsheviks and is enlisted

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.140
in the international brigade.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.670 position:56%
While lying next to his Russian wife
he suddenly realizes the meaning

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.490
of historical inevitability.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:47.330
I hate to think what might have
happened had my grandfather ended

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.970
up in the hands of the Bolsheviks.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.060
In the hospital where they're lives
ended before the century had come

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.360
to an end.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.420
The century in which
everything was stood on its head.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.430 position:56%
Tito's leg is amputated and somebody
steals my grandfather's clothes.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.890
The little differences are crucial

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.770
as in our everyday
moves, as in genocide.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.770
Kane and Abel, Serbs and
Croats, Shiites and [Inaudible],

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.990
the more similar you are the
more you look at the differences.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.680
What bothers us is the
similarity without union.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.300
Our main problem is not
that we are too different,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.150
but that we are too similar.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.250
We are all limited similarly.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.300
It is our limitations
that connects us,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.920
and what connects us
also separates us.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.490
So going back to the banana,

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.090
it is all about how we
organize our limitations.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.110
In politics and science
and in the arts as well.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.510
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Peter Zilahy: Just before the
Q &amp; A I would like to mention

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.380
that there's a - apart from
the million quotes that I used

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.110
in this book, I also used a very
nice book of a friend of mind

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.930
for the science parts, Christopher
Potter, How to Make a Human Being;

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.520
I just wanted to make
this acknowledgement.
