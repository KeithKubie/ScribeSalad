Try solving this third problem. What do you think would be the value of m?

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:08.672
Notice that m is the base here, and also we have a fraction. We have log with

00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:15.010
base m of 1 16th equal to negative 4. When you think you know the value of m,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.622
write it here.
