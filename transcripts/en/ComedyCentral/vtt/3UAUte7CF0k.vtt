We learned that Sweden
now has their own phone number

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.272
to finally get those confusing
Ikea instructions translated,

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.608
and I asked you to tell me
what you might hear

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.977
if you called
The America Number.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.479
Let's dial it in. Carrot Top,
let's start with you.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.847
All right.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:16.550
You've reached America.
Before we get started,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.752
I'd like to first apologize
for the senseless wars,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.422
the Kardashians, the Republican
party, the Democratic party

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.925
and, of course, Carrot Top.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.527
I'm very sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.729
(applause)

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.430
MORRIS:
Very funny.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.100
Thank you.
Why are you laughing at that?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.801
Arden.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.970
Thank you for calling America.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.672
We can't come to the phone
right now

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.342
because we're morbidly obese
and the phone is way over there.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.946
If you want to start a war
press one

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.449
or to talk to Emperor Trump
stay on the line.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.451
-(applause)
-All right.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.020
Lamorne.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.058
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?
You reached America.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.929
I-It's Adam and Eve, not Adam
and Steve, you summamabitch.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:04.331
Because if God wanted it
that way, he wanted two dudes

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.933
to be doing all this kind
of stuff, he would've

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.135
made 'em that way!
But instead you got a hole here

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.204
and you got a thing there
for babies to come out of.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.672
All right.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.640
(beep)

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.276
Leave your message.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.376
"Is this thing still recordin'?!
What the (bleep)?"
