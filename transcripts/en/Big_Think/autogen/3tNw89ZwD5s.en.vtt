market right and we have this

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769
market right and we have this
 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.820
market right and we have this
evolutionary analysis of the healthiness

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
evolutionary analysis of the healthiness
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.769
evolutionary analysis of the healthiness
of people and things like symmetry and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779
of people and things like symmetry and
 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.240
of people and things like symmetry and
skin without blemishes and all kinds of

skin without blemishes and all kinds of
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520
skin without blemishes and all kinds of
things like that and basically create

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
things like that and basically create
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650
things like that and basically create

evolutionary fit that person is so in
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590
evolutionary fit that person is so in
the dating market of course people who

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
the dating market of course people who
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.229
the dating market of course people who
are more beautiful and we infer from

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
are more beautiful and we infer from
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.119
are more beautiful and we infer from
that that a more evolutionary fit are

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
that that a more evolutionary fit are
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.779
that that a more evolutionary fit are
more attractive but does it also

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
more attractive but does it also
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360
more attractive but does it also

reproducing reproduction markets like
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950
reproducing reproduction markets like
the job market it turns out that even in

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
the job market it turns out that even in
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110
the job market it turns out that even in
those markets it is the case so more

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
those markets it is the case so more
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840
those markets it is the case so more
beautiful people do get all kinds all

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
beautiful people do get all kinds all
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.250
beautiful people do get all kinds all
kinds of benefits one of the nice papers

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
kinds of benefits one of the nice papers
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899
kinds of benefits one of the nice papers
on this was actually written about

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
on this was actually written about
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210
on this was actually written about
height and not about beauty but the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
height and not about beauty but the
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390
height and not about beauty but the
principles are the same so there is a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
principles are the same so there is a
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420
principles are the same so there is a
height premium tall people make more

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
height premium tall people make more
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640
height premium tall people make more
money than short people I'm five nine

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
money than short people I'm five nine
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.359
money than short people I'm five nine
not so good for me taller people make

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369
not so good for me taller people make
 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.130
not so good for me taller people make
make more money but in that particular

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
make more money but in that particular
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520
make more money but in that particular
paper they looked at the age in which

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
paper they looked at the age in which
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.200
paper they looked at the age in which
people shut up

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
people shut up
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319
people shut up
and they looked at their final height so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
and they looked at their final height so
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420
and they looked at their final height so
in general people who are tall at age

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
in general people who are tall at age
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370
in general people who are tall at age
forty will probably also tall each age

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
forty will probably also tall each age
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.240
forty will probably also tall each age
17 and 15 but not everybody there are

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
17 and 15 but not everybody there are
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980
17 and 15 but not everybody there are
some people who shoot up in height

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
some people who shoot up in height
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.810
some people who shoot up in height
earlier and some people shoot up in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
earlier and some people shoot up in
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.929
earlier and some people shoot up in
height later and what they found out was

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
height later and what they found out was
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.560
height later and what they found out was
that the way height was concerned it was

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
that the way height was concerned it was
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590
that the way height was concerned it was
about height at puberty rather than

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
about height at puberty rather than
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.530
about height at puberty rather than
final height so if you shut up and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
final height so if you shut up and
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.719
final height so if you shut up and
height earlier on but then you stop so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
height earlier on but then you stop so
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370
height earlier on but then you stop so
your final height is not that high but

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
your final height is not that high but
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.899
your final height is not that high but
when you were in puberty you're

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
when you were in puberty you're
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.179
when you were in puberty you're
relatively tall people still got the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
relatively tall people still got the
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.359
relatively tall people still got the
premium for as if they were tall and if

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
premium for as if they were tall and if
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999
premium for as if they were tall and if
you were not all during puberty and then

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
you were not all during puberty and then
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.890
you were not all during puberty and then
you just became taller later you don't

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
you just became taller later you don't
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430
you just became taller later you don't
have this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
have this
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.700
have this
a premium now what they suggest is that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
a premium now what they suggest is that
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.740
a premium now what they suggest is that
it's not just about the final attribute

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
it's not just about the final attribute
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.510
it's not just about the final attribute
it's not just that we look at tall

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
it's not just that we look at tall
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.040
it's not just that we look at tall
people's a head is a tall person let me

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
people's a head is a tall person let me
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.230
people's a head is a tall person let me
give them more money but partially it

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240
give them more money but partially it
 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.150
give them more money but partially it
has to do with self confidence

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
has to do with self confidence
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830
has to do with self confidence
that's what happened is that aids

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
that's what happened is that aids
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440
that's what happened is that aids
puberty the tall people basically get to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
puberty the tall people basically get to
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.170
puberty the tall people basically get to
experience more confidence and the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
experience more confidence and the
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580
experience more confidence and the
shorter people get to experience less

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
shorter people get to experience less
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.200
shorter people get to experience less
confidence and that confidence stays

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210
confidence and that confidence stays
 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.980
confidence and that confidence stays
later whether or not they stay they stay

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990
later whether or not they stay they stay
 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.690
later whether or not they stay they stay
tall and I think the same thing would

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
tall and I think the same thing would
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850
tall and I think the same thing would
happen if we could do this study on

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
happen if we could do this study on
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.970
happen if we could do this study on
beauty that yes if you're beautiful I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
beauty that yes if you're beautiful I
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740
beauty that yes if you're beautiful I
would look at you I would say hey you're

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
would look at you I would say hey you're
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.240
would look at you I would say hey you're
just pleasant to stay around with you're

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
just pleasant to stay around with you're
 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.860
just pleasant to stay around with you're
probably qualified in all kinds of ways

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
probably qualified in all kinds of ways
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.530
probably qualified in all kinds of ways
like that but if you were beautiful at

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
like that but if you were beautiful at
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.340
like that but if you were beautiful at
puberty or at a young age and you got

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
puberty or at a young age and you got
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.350
puberty or at a young age and you got
lots of attention and so on it might be

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360
lots of attention and so on it might be
 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.590
lots of attention and so on it might be
the case that you now have confidence

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
the case that you now have confidence
 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.660
the case that you now have confidence
that comes from that so it's not just my

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
that comes from that so it's not just my
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.280
that comes from that so it's not just my
perception of you it's but it's your own

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
perception of you it's but it's your own
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.370
perception of you it's but it's your own
definition of yourself that is changing

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
definition of yourself that is changing
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.890
definition of yourself that is changing
because of that and that would be like a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900
because of that and that would be like a
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.810
because of that and that would be like a
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
self-fulfilling prophecy
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.890
self-fulfilling prophecy
so maybe the advice is to let all kids

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
so maybe the advice is to let all kids
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.690
so maybe the advice is to let all kids
during puberty think that they are

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
during puberty think that they are
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.110
during puberty think that they are
beautiful something like
