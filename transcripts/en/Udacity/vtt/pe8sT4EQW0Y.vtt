00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.459
Security is not
an easy subject,

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.349
and the issues we
covered in this lesson

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.619
are not sufficiently fixable
on just the front end.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.439
Your back end, whatever it is,
needs to implement validation

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.869
as well to be properly
secured against CSRF

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.065
and cross-site
scripting attacks.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.440
What you have
learned here is how

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.210
to spot potential
vulnerabilities,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.592
and how to verify if
they are exploitable.

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:22.799
Whenever you are about to
add any kind of input field

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.423
in your web app, you
should immediately

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.960
start thinking about
cross-site scripting and CSRF,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.710
and whether there are
potential risks that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.359
need to be mitigated.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.159
You'll do yourself and
your users a big favor.
