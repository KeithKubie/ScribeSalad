1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,590
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is radio
lab. Robert is traveling, uh, today.

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,600
So it's just me and, uh,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,460
today we have a very different kind
of story than we've ever done. Uh,

4
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:13,770
it comes from a journalist and
filmmaker named Luis trays.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,150
And an interesting thing kind of
happened as we were reporting.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,410
This sounds pretty clear. Yeah. It's
gotta be a landline. Luis and a,

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,180
one of our producers, Tim Howard had, uh,

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,950
called up this Guy
Vladimir [inaudible], uh,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,350
who is a filmmaker
himself, Cuban guy, exile.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,570
And the interview happened to
be just a few hours after, um,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,000
Obama had made that
big announcement today,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,780
the United States of America is changing
its relationship with the people of

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,614
Cuba

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,050
and the most significant changes in
our policy and more than 50 years that

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,870
happened just before the interview.
Hello? Is this Vladimir? Hey,

16
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,360
we're recording. Yes, it's flooding
me. Vladimir, how are you doing?

17
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:58,290
This is Tim in New York, and we
also have Luis. Hi. [inaudible].

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,730
It's a if Lewis, how are you Lewis?
Good. Good. And love the news now. Yeah.

19
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,230
Amazing News, right? I was crying.
Really? Yeah, I was crying, man.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,733
Yeah.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,890
First of all, you know,

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,870
I've been here in the United
State for 20 years and I never,

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,290
never think that I was gonna
see the state. You know, really,

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,320
we will begin to normalize relations
between our two countries because east has

25
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,980
been 55, 50 year, 53 years
since the United States.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,450
You know, bro,

27
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:36,240
the relationship with diplomatic
relationship with the [inaudible]. Yeah.

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,400
And nothing happened in Cuba. You
know, everybody sees it the same.

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,843
No.

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,460
Everything is going to change.

31
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:56,800
[inaudible]

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,700
today, a collaboration, uh,
with, uh, a fantastic program.

33
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:03,880
Radio and Volante Luis
tress comes to us from them.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,290
This is a story that predates the stuff
you've been hearing the news in many

35
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,690
ways. It's maybe a tiny dark

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,430
amble too. All of that stuff.
It's a story about Cuba,

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,700
the power of music and a group of Cuban
kids who decide to opt out in this crazy

38
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,590
way that when Lewis Tris told us
about it, we almost couldn't believe.

39
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,480
So the reason we called up laddy is that
we wanted to hear the backstory of all

40
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,314
of this. Wow.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,560
I was pouring peanut Rio in 1964 tell me
about what it was like for you to be a

42
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:37,944
kid.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,220
I wasn't happy because in Cuba
we didn't have any information.

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,860
We didn't have any communication
with anybody else. High Q1. Right.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,150
And anybody seen that we receive it was
the, you know, the news that they go,

46
00:02:55,151 --> 00:03:00,040
I mean, want to give us to us
[inaudible] he remembers listening to

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,050
endless field Castro's
speeches on the radio.

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I remember when I was a kid in elementary
school all the time they were teaching

49
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,254
us that

50
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,560
Rochelle [inaudible],

51
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,070
what's the big country in
the world? The big economy.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,000
And every scene we would hope
east to be like, Dang. Yeah.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,930
It was a given that he would get in
line every year to get his story.

54
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,160
You know, are you only got three toys
every year because of rationing. Exactly.

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,400
And then every week he and
his folks would wake up,

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,870
they would go to the Knicks nearest church
to throw eggs at the church building,

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,310
throw eggs at the church. Why? Because
we didn't believe in God, the government,

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,170
they didn't believe in
God. You know, that's,

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,870
that's how you showed you were a good
revolutionary and Vladimir was just being

60
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:46,650
a good boy.

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,650
But when he turns 14 there comes a day
when a friend takes him aside and shows

62
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,170
him a video of led Zeppelin.

63
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,850
I remember that day. I remember like,
do you remember what lights up on Song?

64
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:00,230
It was costumer

65
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,090
[inaudible] cashmere. Oh yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,410
Coaching was my first
time and I hear the music.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,910
How did it, how did it make you
feel when you heard cashmere? Whoa.

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,953
Differ.

69
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,610
You know, you see role playing and you
see you me page with those long hair.

70
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,950
They moved on. They had,

71
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,130
I gave her a rabbit and
the scene love, they say

72
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,740
you must read different

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,660
[inaudible].

74
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,060
And because his dad
was completely changed,

75
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,660
[inaudible]

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,380
completely changed my life. Let me
tell you, completely changed my life.

77
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,180
He's not sure why,

78
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,710
but in that moment I went from English,

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,570
Islam to Freaky,

80
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,670
freaky and went to freaky. What
is, what is freaky? So freaky.

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,150
These are what Cubans call
the most extreme metal heads.

82
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,180
Hard rock punk rockers. We start waving

83
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,820
the close close with
whole a long hair problem.

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,690
Was that given the Cuban one radio
station didn't put any rock music down.

85
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,570
I remember when I was 19
years old, 20 years old,

86
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,930
my father giving a Russian
radio and he was a good at fam.

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,620
We went to the,

88
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,450
to the roof or some friends because
in those rooms you can listen today.

89
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,070
A station from Florida.

90
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,950
Yeah. Oh Man.

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,220
We've listened. Running style.
A sympathy with the devil. Yeah.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,160
Hello. Hello.

93
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,210
Hello baby man.

94
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,680
Mighty man. You know we
were decided though. Listen,

95
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,100
Berryman and I said that I
didn't like it in the beginning.

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,220
Everything that came from there
in English, it was good. You know,

97
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,670
because I don't know that King of Muesli.

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,890
Give us another

99
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,943
door.

100
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,130
Two ladies walking around with ripped
jeans, long hair. And that's fine.

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
It's a normal youth rebellion.

102
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,460
But then in the late
eighties everything changes.

103
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,110
Mr Gorbachev Open this gate.

104
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,030
[inaudible] Mr Gorbachev
tear down this wall.

105
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,510
The Wall Berlin Wall went down.
They are here in the thousands.

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,640
They are here in the tens of
thousands and in reaction. Hey

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,570
[inaudible] smoke the
Casto government. Dugin

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,700
[inaudible] [inaudible] says
[inaudible] one thing or death.

109
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,890
The slogan is painted freshly all
over Havana, socialism or death.

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,050
Suddenly music you listen to became very
ideological and if you listen to rock,

111
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,860
you were listening to the
enemy of the Cuban state.

112
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,040
The United States government created a
police presence in every neighborhood,

113
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,530
every five blocks, and Vladimir says,

114
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,510
the police found you and you had
long hair. They'd beat us, kick us,

115
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,090
send you away to work, putting
sugarcane in the cane fields.

116
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,750
That's like that booth in school. They'd
often cut your hair against your will.

117
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,093
He wasn't abused.

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,920
And just to jump in, this is the point
in the story where things take a very,

119
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,180
no other way to say it, a very punk rock
turn, because into this cultural war

120
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,830
step's a guy named Papa
Papa. We name me, he knew

121
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,980
Popolo Papa Labella, you
know Popo the bullet.

122
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,310
I really want to say that
he tried to embody that,

123
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,040
that kind of bullet to
your brain that wake up

124
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,650
[inaudible].

125
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,340
That's Bob Mariano. He's a professor
at southern Oregon University.

126
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,430
He went several times in the 90s to Cuba
to interview papa who he calls the Kurt

127
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,710
Cobain of the free keys.
Yeah. He looked very intense.

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,760
Who was cocky and confident and just
charismatic. Super Tall. Skinny.

129
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,660
Yeah. He always wear a American
flag. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,630
He like a Bandana.

131
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Use Holly User two friends [inaudible]
his sous Diaz and Lisa Nandis who is also

132

time he met [inaudible] and it was on a

134
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,380
night that uh,

135
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,910
Communist Party meeting was taking
place right outside his house.

136
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,100
Outside the building. Outgoing

137

Papa was, it was a weird guy.

146
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,990
[inaudible] giving you a
hug in the body. When we do,

147
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,670
you can see video of Papo because Vladimir
shot a documentary in 1994 where he

148
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:00,000
interviewed Papo and some of the other
freebies and in that documentary,

149
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,110

and he's an alcoholic, mother abandon

150
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,590
[inaudible] by age 14 he's in the
streets and a few years later he makes a

151
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:16,550
decision that's really at
the heart of this story from

152
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,410
[inaudible] just to set it up so that
you can understand the context yet

153
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,150
what happened was that 1989 I
think 1990 somewhere around there,

154
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,060
the Cuban government
is fighting in Angola.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,620
It's backing a leftist liberation movement
and it's kind of a proxy war with the

156
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:42,120
United States and in the late eighties
Cuban soldiers started coming back home

157
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,890
and some soldiers from the Cuban
army they're wearing in Africa,

158
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,050
they came with HIV,

159
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,140
HIV positive. Because of that,

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,500
the government has all the
[inaudible] tested with HIV.

161
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,620
If you belong to a high risk group,
you were tested. They went to the,

162
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,040
to your place of war, they went to your
apartment, they went to the school,

163
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,580
they went to everybody. Wow.
I remember if they went,

164
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,180
they went to my ward and they test
everybody over there and they run your

165
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:13,850
station. 50 people's over there. Wow.
Give me your blood. Give me your bro.

166
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,530
Give me your broke. Give me your
blood. Bloody says they would come in,

167
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,190
take your blood and if they
found that you were positive,

168
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,900
the police came to you in the, in the
police car, go straight to the cemetery.

169
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,560
They just locked you up.
Yeah, and I remember,

170
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,470
I remember one day I was talking to
him Papo and his wife. I said, look

171
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,800
[inaudible] I want to leave free.
Look, they're kicking me out.

172
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,850
They're beating me out. They don't,

173
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,820
they don't want me to
leave like a rocket here.

174
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,110
They are doing a lot of things to
me. I'm going to do a lot of things.

175
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,130
[inaudible] and he told me, look,

176
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,650
I went to this rock concert in via Clara.

177
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,320
Papa told him I met up
with these other Rutgers,

178
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,490
they were HIV positive and
I went and took a syringe,

179
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,880
drew some blood from their arm and I put
the needle in my own arm and I jammed

180
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,020
myself with HIV. I get my tail,

181
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,900
we would blow contaminated
with you. Did HIV, you know,

182
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,250
and I look at him said,
do you know what you did?

183
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,690
Do you know what you doing? You're
going to die man. I ain't said to me,

184
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,170
I don't care. That's
crazy. That's crazy. He,

185
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,050
he knew for sure that
when he did that that he,

186
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,500
that that was a death
sentence for him. Yes.

187
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,190
He knows Vladimir is not quite sure that
the others that came after Papo really

188
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:46,420
knew what they were doing but, but papa
knew, remember he says Saas Helene's

189
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,960
death and he proposed
to me death is a dog.

190
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,190
[inaudible]

191
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,030
when you don't have any more
doors to open, death is a door

192
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,690
coming up. That door gets wider,

193
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,310
others walk through and for at least a
beat, they find something besides that,

194
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,900
something quite the opposite.

195
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,483
[inaudible]

196
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960

Hey, I'm Chad. I'm Rod. This is Radiolab.
Yes. One, two, one two. Mike Chick.

203
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,200
That's Lewis trace of radio on Bellante.

204
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,690
Let's go back to his story about Cuba
and music in the late eighties and

205
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,110
nineties and so far a dude
has made a crazy decision,

206
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,980
dude named Popo to inject himself
with HIV. Would you call the protest?

207
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,880
I think a papa would have called
it a protest, but not the,

208
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,230
the guys that came after

209
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,990
this is at a moment when there was a
cultural work happening between the Castro

210
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:17,420
government and anyone
eat deemed antisocial,

211
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,420
which included included kids with
long hair who listened to rock.

212
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,440
And it was also a moment where if you
were found to be HIV positive in Cuba,

213
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,750
you were forcibly quarantine.

214
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,200
So poppo injects himself and
he gets sent to the sanitarium.

215
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,320
And can you describe that place?
Like what did he find? Well,

216
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:39,030
he found a beautiful place in the
middle of the [inaudible] countryside.

217
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,700
Really? It's full of
palm trees, very green,

218
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:49,650
very lush farm animals roaming
in. And you went there?

219
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,600
Yes, yes I was there. I was there.
And there are still farm animals.

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,250
They would Romaine, a
couple of cows and chickens.

221
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,190
It's like kind of an idyllic place.

222
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,980
So I went there to visit the last two
rockers that still remain the place are

223
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,090
some go way out and his wife Yolanda,

224
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,370
and they're kind of like the keepers
of all that went down in there,

225
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,880
the memories. So I spent a couple
of days with them and they,

226
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,040
they walked me around and it's full
of like these little housing units and

227
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,020
you're saying this place
was idyllic even back then

228
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,000
[inaudible] are walking me
through it and you're like, okay.

229
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:36,830
So we would be walking around here 10
years ago and Nirvana would be coming out

230
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:37,664
of here.

231
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,990
TELECO would be coming
out of the next house.

232
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,690
Didn't see separately

233
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,190
[inaudible]

234
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,180
no kidding. Yeah. So it was like
a headbangers ball and the rear,

235
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,110
you know, wait, why?

236
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,330
How come they were able to have that
freedom in the sanatorium but not outside.

237
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Initially the sanitarium system was
under the military and it was more of a

238
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:11,560
gulag. But in the late
eighties, early nineties,

239
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,650
the sanitariums went from the military
being in charge to the Ministry of Health

240
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,720
and medicine. And these
were by all accounts,

241
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,410
very progressive doctors, very
concerned about their patients.

242
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,520
They gave them all the food and
medicine they needed and they were like,

243
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,730
you want to rock out? Go
ahead. So it was like a prison,

244
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:37,970
but it was also kind of a little bubble
of freedom. And strangely enough, they,

245
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,550
they soon found out that
they even had power. Nope.

246
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,020
No police power. They didn't have
before. Laddy told me the story.

247
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,130
Um,

248
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,870
patients who said the sanitarium could
go out every 21 days for a day trip and

249
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:57,490
some of the freak keys would go out and
just by flashing their ID cards that

250
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:00,430
said they were aids patients,
police would leave them alone.

251
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,460
I remember in two or three occasions that
the police came after name and one of

252
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,400
them have, say a Guineans, a Syringe,

253
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,350
syringe full of blood,

254
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,240
and Vladi says the guy took out the blood
and waved it at the police and said,

255
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,640
you want to come to me? Come in, came
to me. And they were afraid of that.

256
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,750
And so word began to spread about what
life was like inside the Santeria.

257
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,170
And you have to keep in mind that
outside Cuba was falling apart.

258
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,060
Hard economic times in Cuba,

259
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:39,510
the government today tightened red
rationing and raised egg prices.

260
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:41,670
It blamed delays in
Soviet shipments to Cuba.

261
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,580
Almost overnight after the
fall of the Soviet Union,

262
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,850
Cuba was left without the massive
subsidies that used to get that man

263
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,940
long lines for bread. Oh, a short temper.

264
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,740
Or we were suffering that immersive
survivors who never actually lived inside

265
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:02,970
the sanitarium. He says that people
outside were going hungry and he himself,

266
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,990
I was waiting like a hundred
pounds, 98 pounds. Oh my God.

267
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,140
And things just kept
getting worse. You'll see

268
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,950
hungry sunburn, dehydrated.
50,000 people leave Cuba.

269
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,510
They managed to escape on a raft and
make it to the Florida keys these days.

270
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,940
More Cubans than ever
are taking the risks.

271
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,090
It was the big group crisis,
you know, in the Clinton era.

272
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,070
But if you were in the
sanatorium you were fine. Yeah,

273
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,810
just being able to get
milk and egg and beans.

274
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,220
Valerie Yanno says that that was one of
the big motivation for a lot of kids.

275
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:41,670
Yes. I'm not going to be
harassed. Yes, I'm free. And yes,

276
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:46,671
I also get meals and it went from
being a couple of self injectors,

277
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:53,190
a couple of dozen self injectors
to being hundreds. Hello.

278
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,110
And did the government know
that this was happening?

279
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,993
Well

280
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,990
[inaudible] there's this
Swedish documentary from
the time it's called Sociale

281
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,800
East [inaudible] and in it
there's this bishop of Abana

282
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,750
[inaudible] [inaudible],

283
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,180
his last name is [inaudible] and he says
that he met some of the kids that were

284
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:19,181
injecting themselves with aids and that
at a state dinner he approached Fidel.

285
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,193
He told him

286
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,240
[inaudible] did these kids stare at
during injecting themselves and, and

287
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,190
[inaudible] [inaudible] couldn't
believe it. Like what does

288
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:32,980
[inaudible] say to you?

289
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,190
And then after that in the pharmacy,

290
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,230
they don't sell cerise anymore.

291
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,970
They put a low def [inaudible]
in gather salvage HIV.

292
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,980
You want to spend eight years in prison,

293
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,600
but it didn't matter.
It was like a movement

294
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:55,790
[inaudible]

295
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,660
and all of a sudden you have all these
bands forming across the island in

296
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:03,980
different sanitariums in the biggest
one at the mall in Santiago, La Vega.

297
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,070
Let's go costs, which is like a
half hour, 45 minutes south of five.

298
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,390
I know you have the first group that
gets formed, it's called [inaudible],

299
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,770
which translates to HIV

300
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,393
[inaudible]

301
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,700
but then in central of the island
in this town called Santa Clara,

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you had the Cuban punk band is cornea
and the scoria translates as scum,

303
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:31,070
right? Scoria and according to Bob,

304
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,100
if you look back to the eighties the
people who were fleeing Cuba about Ceros

305
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,330
the rafters, one of the responses of
the Cuban government were billboards.

306
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,740
That's at Camp Lai. Scoria
[inaudible] let the scum leave.

307
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,950
So to call yourself a score,
[inaudible] call yourself that

308
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,350
is punk rock.

309
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,390
And were these bands a big outside?
The sanitorium too is Scoria is,

310
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,410
I mean you can't talk about Cuban
punk without, I mean a Skoda is like,

311
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,040
so their tapes got out or something.
Yeah, totally. It would have is next.

312
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,270
I mean these bands are forming,

313
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,570
kids are self-injecting does it just keep
growing and growing? Yeah, but are we,

314
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:14,460
I don't have [inaudible] yet.
[inaudible] there's tape of uh,

315
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,640
her son on Yolanda saying that it got to
be so fashionable that kids started to

316
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:25,170
think that in order to be a
freaky you had to have aids. Yeah.

317
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,680
I know that there was
[inaudible] saying Amy

318
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,250
[inaudible], which is, and
the kids were saying that

319
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,480
really want it to be a rocker. In that
time you had to have aids. It's like the,

320
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,510
the fact that it went from
10 or 20 to 200 or more.

321
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,950
It was obviously like
this kind of just, um,

322
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,100
joiner phenomenon of like, that's so
cool. I'm going to do it too. And then

323
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,710
[inaudible] [inaudible] there was even
talk among some of the young people I met

324
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,550
of thinking that, oh, eventually feed
ELL and those guys will find a cure.

325
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,910
You're going to find a cure
for this. Cuba with a bell,

326
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,010
one of the best health care
systems in the western hemisphere.

327
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,000
We're going to leave forever.

328
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,290
When everything started to change,
when the first of them died

329
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,450
[inaudible]

330
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,060
according to [inaudible], the
first kid that died in [inaudible],

331
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,840
the view was a guy named Manuel. We
don't know his last name or his age.

332
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,980
He was the first one. The second
day I wanted to set a date,

333
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,170
anybody to stop at one point
in Hillary's documentary,

334
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:37,010
which was made in 1994
[inaudible] that in two years

335
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,810
[inaudible] about 18 people died
[inaudible] and on their style scene,

336
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,880
how you die because you don't die like a
normal person and had a heart attack or

337
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,350
anything. No, you transform yourself.

338
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,170
A lot of them went blind.
Then they went insane.

339
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,650
They started getting opportunistic
diseases. You know how eats works.

340
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,710
Seeing that as Dan sinking
and my, what they did

341
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,100
[inaudible]

342
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,980
did kids start saying they wish
they hadn't done this? Well,

343
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:10,340
when you see bloodies documentary
and that Swedish documentary,

344
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,650
sociologist one went to
summit in 1995. Yeah.

345
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,970
You definitely see the
kids having deep regrets.

346
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,300
You have one of them saying,

347
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,430
you gotta be entirely
[inaudible]. I regret this.

348
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,070
I regret it a million times.

349
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,910
[inaudible] how about Papa?

350
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,260
Well, I don't, I never heard Papa, uh,

351
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,330
ever questioned that he had done it.

352
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,213
[inaudible]

353
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,470
and in that Swedish documentary,

354
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:45,770
there's a scene towards the end
where you see poppo and he's sick.

355
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,080
He's real thin. His face is swollen.

356
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I remember he's had like [inaudible]
and stepping into an evangelical church.

357
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,060
He's wearing a nirvana tee shirt, but
he's become a fervent Christian man.

358
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,120
He's found this community of Evan Delco
Christians that accepts aids patients is

359
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:10,530
still taunting the government
because he says, oh,

360
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,630
you still a rocker. And that he thinks
that Christ is the perfect communist.

361
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,710
More communists were like the
Christians. That would be perfect.

362
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,761
It's interesting though,

363
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:28,240
because in that last video we also
see him taking English classes.

364
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,930
Oh, you fine.

365
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,190
I know. And he's saying like, you know,

366
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,110
I told him from the other patients in the
sanitarium, they're like sick like me.

367
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,690
They won't go out at night.

368
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,950
They won't rock out
till the early morning,

369
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,730
but I'm like going know this is my life.

370
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,440
So he was sort of defined
to the end. Yeah. C a

371
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,610
[inaudible] and a few months later,

372
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,580
or according to Gerson bubble
started to bleed out from his mouth.

373
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,660
He but do it online too. They
lay down the an eyes book

374
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,790
[inaudible] he had a
parasite in his brain.

375
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,820
He became a violet and he
died from that disease.

376
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,110
So it's like, I want him and he going,
I'll say, yeah, part of me wonder.

377
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,401
It's like,

378
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:30,401
is this strong and fierce or is it
just dumb and sad and maybe fear.

379
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,610
It's also like, I can't figure
out how to feel about this. Yeah.

380
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,840
Well I think it can be
all those things, right?

381
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,990
It was dumb and stupid and immature and
it was also nihilistic and an archaic.

382
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,150
You think in the end it had
any impact? Well, that's,

383
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,710
that's hard to say. Um, it must have,

384
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,953
it must have.

385
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,450
Here's how Lewis puts it. Not
even five years after Papa died,

386
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,250
things did start to shift in Cuba.

387
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,320
Make it a bit what you will.
But December 8th, 2000,

388
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,390
Castro unveils a statue of John Lennon.

389
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,093
That same year,

390
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,420
Bob Mariano and a bunch of rock musicians
including will Oldham, David Paho,

391
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,260
they were given permission to play a bunch
of rock shows in Cuba out in the open

392
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,150
and at one of those
shows and Pinar del Rio.

393
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,000
I announced, listen,

394
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:39,001
we're going to send out this next
number to Papa labella and the free keys

395
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,753
[inaudible]

396
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,080
and uh, everyone sang along.

397
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,650
Now it would be impossible to draw any
kind of cause and effect and say one

398
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:04,750
thing led to another that
would be ridiculous. But

399
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,790
Luis says that back when this free keys
were streaming into the sanitorium,

400
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,560
Cuba wasn't changing back then.

401
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,890
It started to change precisely because
of a hundred gestures big in small.

402
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,980
He says around Cuba at that moment,
there are all of these tiny,

403
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:25,060
mostly silent protests taking hold.
And then you have the Maliko Lasso,

404
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,480
which was like the first serious civil
disobedience that Castro had in in 94,

405
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:36,810
where the mob in Havana rose up because
they were so tired of the power outages.

406
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,730
They were angry at their poor living
conditions. They were leading the, uh,

407
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,920
the city in rafts by the
thousands, by the hundreds.

408
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,020
Castro literally had to come down to
the Cuban Malica and the beautiful, um,

409
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,850
uh, seaside road that, that
circles around Havana and he,

410
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,090
he literally had to talk the mob
down to, at this moment, you know,

411
00:27:58,091 --> 00:27:59,350
late eighties, early nineties,

412
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,150
th there's this breeding ground
of discontent all over Cuba.

413
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,210
And I think the self injector movement
is the best crystallization we have of

414
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:11,530
that. Yeah.

415
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,200
It's like the sort of a thousand points
of light and this is the brightest

416
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:18,730
point, right? Or the darkest point,
frankly. Yeah, right, exactly. Dude. Off

417
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,913
[inaudible]

418
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,380
huge thank you to Luis

created a Spanish version,

426
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,320
a Spanish language version of this story
which goes in a different direction,

427
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:43,321
goes into way more depth into visit to
Cuba and the story of girth and your

428
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:46,870
Honda, the last two remaining
self infected free keys.

429
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,070
And we may just put that story in our
podcast feed for the Spanish speakers out

430
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:52,840
there who want to hear their story.

431
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,070
Thank you to Vladimir Sibos and Barbara
Yana for use of their documentaries.

432
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,440
This story was produced by Tim Howard,

433
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,210
who I'm very sad to say
is leaving us this week.

434
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,970
[inaudible] the rains in the building

435
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,470
and I would take the bus here.

436
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,890
Tim, we love you. We wish you the best.

437
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,080
We had production support from
Matt Kielty and Andy Mills,

438
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,690
[inaudible] and original music from
Leo dye and the Cuban punk bands,
