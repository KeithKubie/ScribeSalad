00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.959
This episode was proudly made possible by
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.680
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.269
Movies in space are awesome, don't get me
wrong, except when it comes to the sound.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.730
But, if space is a vacuum, then there's no
sound… but maybe space isn't a vacuum.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.590
Can you hear me DNews fans?

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey, it's Trace here and I'm not in space,
and if you're not in space either, then you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410
should be able to hear me just fine.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.700
As regular viewers already know, sound travels
using a medium.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Sound is a mechanical, longitudinal wave of
energy emanating from a vibration.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.870
When a guitar string vibrates, the atoms of
the metal string hit the atoms around it,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.930
and that vibration is passed along to the
next and next until it gets to your ear.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.050
Once there, the tympanic membrane, or eardrum,
vibrates at the same frequency, and the tiny

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.140
bones in your middle and inner ear translate
the movement to energy that your brain can

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.140
interpret.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.780
Because all atoms can vibrate like this, sound
can travel through solids, liquids, and gases.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.500
Outer space on the other hand, is thought
of as a vacuum, the ABSENCE of matter; and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.160
no matter means no sound.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.600
But really, in space it more like, atom, atom…
atom…

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.160
NASA says there's about one atom per cubic
centimeter!

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.130
If you took all those free-floating atoms
into account, you'd have 90 percent hydrogen,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.320
9 percent helium and less than one percent
of other stuff.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.500
Which makes sense considering the makeup of
everything we know in the universe, amirite?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.031
Even though one atom per cubic centimeter
might seem like more than you thought, it's

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.430
still fantastically thin.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.890
With such low density, sound's energy waves
cannot bounce from one atom to another.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.140
No atoms, no waves, no sound.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.000
So, George Lucas: you're wrong!!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.220
Spaceships don't make noise - unless they’re
flying within the atmosphere of a planet…

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.310
And not just ours!

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.650
You can hear sounds on certain other planets
too.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.390
For instance, sound travels FASTER on Venus
than it does on Earth, because its atmosphere

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.320
is "thick and soupy," says Tim Leighton of
the University of Southampton.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.730
This means if you COULD talk on Venus, the
sound would zoom through your vocal chords,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.610
but deepen in pitch because of the makeup
of the air.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.630
Basically, you'd sound like a Bassy Smurf.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.580
We get around this by building structures
that contain pockets of air.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.850
The atmosphere INSIDE the International Space
Station sounds pretty normal.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.400
But if an astronaut hit his helmet against
something outside, he would hear the impact

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.450
because his helmet has air, but the people
INSIDE wouldn't hear anything.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.120
Purely hypothetically, if somehow, you could
put your bare head against the outside of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.650
the International Space Station you might
be able to "hear" Chris Hadfield inside the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.900
ISS playing his guitar.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.300
See, that guitar vibration might travel through
the air inside, to the walls of the ISS vibrating

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300
them.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.210
And then, if your bones were touching just
right, that vibration MIGHT vibrate your BONES

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.940
and thus get directly to your inner ear.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.819
This is called bone conduction, and it's used
in some headphones and in tech like Google

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.819
Glass.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.720
Because your bones conduct that vibration,
it surpasses the need for air and doesn't

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.849
require the eardrum at all… but again, it
would only work if your bone was touching

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.849
the ISS.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.160
Plus, of course, you'd die pretty quickly…

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.770
There IS another way to to pull sound directly
from space, not in an atmosphere, or in a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.310
spacesuit… can you guess it?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.880
Tell me your guess in the comments!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.990
If we get 7,000 likes, I'll release a follow-up
with the answer!

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.040
We wanna extend a quick thank you to Subaru,
for making this episode possible.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.170
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.190
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.300
It’s not just a sedan.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.739
It’s a Subaru.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.060
