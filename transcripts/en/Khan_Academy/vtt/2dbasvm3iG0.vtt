00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.420
Use less than,
greater than, or equal

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.170
to compare the two fractions
21/28, or 21 over 28, and 6/9,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.060
or 6 over 9.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.110
So there's a bunch
of ways to do this.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.690
The easiest way is if they
had the same denominator,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.450
you could just compare
the numerators.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.040
Unlucky for us, we do not
have the same denominator.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.600
So what we could do is we
can find a common denominator

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840
for both of them and convert
both of these fractions

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.250
to have the same denominator
and then compare the numerators.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.340
Or even more simply, we could
simplify them first and then

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.970
try to do it.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.511
So let me do that
last one, because I

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.190
have a feeling that'll be
the fastest way to do it.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.050
So 21/28-- you can see that
they are both divisible by 7.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.650
So let's divide
both the numerator

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.570
and the denominator by 7.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.190
So we could divide 21 by 7.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.600
And we can divide-- so let
me make the numerator--

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.489
and we can divide
the denominator by 7.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.280
We're doing the same
thing to the numerator

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.655
and the denominator,
so we're not

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.950
going to change the
value of the fraction.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.650
So 21 divided by 7 is 3,
and 28 divided by 7 is 4.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.510
So 21/28 is the exact
same fraction as 3/4.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.770
3/4 is the simplified
version of it.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.680
Let's do the same thing for 6/9.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.520
6 and 9 are both divisible by 3.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.410
So let's divide
them both by 3 so we

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.430
can simplify this fraction.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.080
So let's divide
both of them by 3.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.380
6 divided by 3 is 2,
and 9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.060
So 21/28 is 3/4.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.760
They're the exact same fraction,
just written a different way.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.700
This is the more
simplified version.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.580
And 6/9 is the exact
same fraction as 2/3.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.590
So we really can
compare 3/4 and 2/3.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.230
So this is really
comparing 3/4 and 2/3.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.990
And the real benefit of
doing this is now this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.870
is much easier to find a common
denominator for than 28 and 9.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.680
Then we would have to
multiply big numbers.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.850
Here we could do
fairly small numbers.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.780
The common denominator
of 3/4 and 2/3

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.810
is going to be the least
common multiple of 4 and 3.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.570
And 4 and 3 don't share any
prime factors with each other.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.520
So their least common
multiple is really

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430
just going to be the
product of the two.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.890
So we can write 3/4
as something over 12.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.800
And we can write 2/3
as something over 12.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.570
And I got the 12 by
multiplying 3 times 4.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.150
They have no common factors.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.500
Another way you could
think about it is 4,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.470
if you do a prime
factorization, is 2 times 2.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.870
And 3-- it's already
a prime number,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.239
so you can't prime
factorize it any more.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.030
So what you want to do
is think of a number

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120
that has all of the
prime factors of 4 and 3.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.970
So it needs one 2,
another 2, and a 3.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.744
Well, 2 times 2 times 3 is 12.

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.160
And either way you
think about it,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.243
that's how you would get
the least common multiple

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:57.450
or the common
denominator for 4 and 3.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.360
Well, to get from 4 to 12,
you've got to multiply by 3.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.460
So we're multiplying the
denominator by 3 to get to 12.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.710
So we also have to multiply
the numerator by 3.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.740
So 3 times 3 is 9.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.640
Over here, to get
from 3 to 12, we

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.320
have to multiply the
denominator by 4.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.080
So we also have to multiply
the numerator by 4.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.540
So we get 8.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.250
And so now when we
compare the fractions,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.770
it's pretty straightforward.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.270
21/28 is the exact
same thing as 9/12,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.140
and 6/9 is the exact
same thing as 8/12.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.960
So which of these is
a greater quantity?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.210
Well, clearly, we have the
same denominator right now.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.120
We have 9/12 is clearly
greater than 8/12.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.180
So 9/12 is clearly
greater than 8/12.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.450
Or if you go back
and you realize

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.650
that 9/12 is the exact
same thing as 21/28,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.750
we could say 21/28 is definitely
greater than-- and 8/12

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.130
is the same thing as 6/9-- is
definitely greater than 6/9.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.867
And we are done.

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:13.450
Another way we could
have done it-- we

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.370
didn't necessarily
have to simplify that.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.310
And let me show you
that just for fun.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.450
So if we were doing it
with-- if we didn't think

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.920
to simplify our
two numbers first.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.270
I'm trying to find a
color I haven't used yet.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.270
So 21/28 and 6/9.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.460
So we could just find
a least common multiple

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.980
in the traditional way
without simplifying first.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.340
So what's the prime
factorization of 28?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.720
It's 2 times 14.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.710
And 14 is 2 times 7.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.230
That's its prime factorization.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.490
Prime factorization
of 9 is 3 times 3.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.070
So the least common
multiple of 28 and 9

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.570
have to contain a 2,
a 2, a 7, a 3 and a 3.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.830
Or essentially, it's
going to be 28 times 9.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.232
So let's over here
multiply 28 times 9.

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:05.940
There's a couple of
ways you could do it.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.870
You could multiply
in your head 28 times

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.079
10, which would be 280,
and then subtract 28

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.370
from that, which would be what?

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.140
252.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.850
Or we could just multiply
it out if that confuses you.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.580
So let's just do the second way.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.110
9 times 8 is 72.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.380
9 times 2 is 18.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.370
18 plus 7 is 25.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.880
So we get 252.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.660
So I'm saying the
common denominator here

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.650
is going to be 252.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.270
Least common
multiple of 28 and 9.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.370
Well, to go from 28 to 252,
we had to multiply it by 9.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.590
We had to multiply 28 times 9.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.570
So we're multiplying 28 times 9.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.240
So we also have to multiply
the numerator times 9.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.336
So what is 21 times 9?

00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:56.710
That's easier to
do in your head.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.080
20 times 9 is 180.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.710
And then 1 times 9 is 9.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.080
So this is going to be 189.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.100
To go from 9 to 252, we
had to multiply by 28.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.630
So we also have to multiply
the numerator by 28

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.290
if we don't want to change
the value of the fraction.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.512
So 6 times 28-- 6
times 20 is 120.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:22.420
6 times 8 is 48.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.414
So we get 168.

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:25.830
Let me write that
out just to make

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.290
sure I didn't make a mistake.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:36.180
So 28 times 6-- 8 times 6 is 48.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.040
2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.770
So right, 168.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.819
So now we have a common
denominator here.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.860
And so we can really just
compare the numerators.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.380
And 189 is clearly
greater than 168.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.110
So 189/252 is clearly
greater than 168/252.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.710
Or that's the same
thing as saying 21/28,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.580
because that's what
this is over here.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.400
The left-hand side is
21/28, is clearly greater

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.710
than the right-hand side,
which is really 6/9.
