00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:08.852
You might have seen this symbol before,

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.807
whether it's as a temporary tattoo

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:12.523
or at a Chinese temple.

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.427
It's called the yin-yang symbol.

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:15.895
It comes from Taoism,

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:17.232
a religion born in China

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:20.439
and it has far more meaning than you probably realize.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.818
The yin is the dark swirl,

00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:23.737
and the yang is the light one,

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:26.825
and each side has a dot of the opposite color,

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:29.441
which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang.

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.427
Everything contains the seed of its opposite.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:34.689
Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness,

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.874
and Luke has the potential to follow

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:39.487
his father to the dark side.

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:40.924
Like Luke and his father,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.805
yin and yang are not total opposites,

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.782
they are relative to each other.

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.827
Taoists believe that the universe is made up

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.151
of energies, vibrations, and matter,

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:51.397
which behave differently

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:53.057
in different contexts.

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:54.935
Something can be yin or yang

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:55.813
depending on,

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.311
well, depending on lots of things.

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.728
So, while wheat that's growing is yang,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.342
when it's being reaped, it's yin.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.012
A wave's crest is yang,

00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:10.070
and the trough is yin.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.451
Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.322
have names like Liuyang or Shiyang,

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.117
but on the shady side, for example,

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:19.713
of the Yangtze River Valley,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.846
there's Jiangyin.

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:25.467
The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang.

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:28.623
An eggshell is yang,

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:31.282
the egg inside is yin.

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:32.697
You think you're getting it?

00:01:32.697 --> 00:01:33.993
Yang is harder,

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:34.868
stronger,

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:35.449
brighter,

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:36.837
and faster,

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:38.991
but one can turn into the other

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:41.498
or are two sides of the same coin.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.951
The sunbeams are yang

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.479
in comparison to the shadows.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.219
The pitch is yang,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.922
the catch is yin.

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:52.217
The yang starts an action,

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:53.912
and the yin receives it,

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:54.973
completes it.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.474
Yin is the inside space of a cup;

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.190
it wouldn't be a cup without it.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.395
Yang is the cup.

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:04.087
The coffee's heat, however, is yang,

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:06.785
and its blackness is yin.

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.805
Yang goes berserk sometimes,

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:12.695
but there's some very powerful yins, too,

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.553
if they don't quite go berserk.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:17.625
Yin is the darker swirl, the female,

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.447
but there is a white dot in it.

00:02:19.447 --> 00:02:21.829
And yang is the lighter, the male,

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.967
but it has a black dot.

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:28.253
Water flowing calmly in a river is yin,

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:29.639
but when it goes over the waterfall,

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.674
it's very yang.

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.210
Toothpicks are yin

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.587
compared with a telephone pole.

00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:37.474
The back of a person is more yang

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:38.987
than the front.

00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:42.644
The top of a person is the yang end.

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:46.184
Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe.

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:49.715
It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:51.796
They call it the Tao.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.246
It means the way.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.708
Like the Force in Star Wars,

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.307
the Tao has two sides.

00:02:57.307 --> 00:03:00.199
Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good,

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.204
and perhaps has an all-evil rival,

00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:05.438
Taoism teaches that we need to learn

00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:07.495
from both yin and yang.

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.843
And unlike religions with gods that are personal,

00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:13.009
the higher power in Taoism is not.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.616
Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way,

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:19.190
a person will not have to fight

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.606
against the universe's natural flow.

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.354
So, for example, listen more,

00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:27.329
argue less.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.731
Be ready to back up or undo something,

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.711
and you will make even faster progress.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.845
Don't worry about being the best,

00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:36.892
be who you are.

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:38.313
Live simply.

00:03:38.313 --> 00:03:41.253
Complications take you away from the Tao.

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.866
"The wise person is flexible," Taoists say.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.543
Learning to use the Tao

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:50.132
is what Taoism is all about,

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:51.253
and that's why you should know

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:53.630
your yin from your yang.
