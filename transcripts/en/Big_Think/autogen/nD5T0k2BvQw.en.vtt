you do it in very interesting ways well

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529
you do it in very interesting ways well
 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.759
you do it in very interesting ways well
a first the first way is by taking the

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769
a first the first way is by taking the
 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.440
a first the first way is by taking the
story as it happens you know our

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450
story as it happens you know our
 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.510
story as it happens you know our
biographies happened one part at a time

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520
biographies happened one part at a time
 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.340
biographies happened one part at a time
there is a a sequence of events in our

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350
there is a a sequence of events in our
 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.580
there is a a sequence of events in our
lives and so there there's a a temporal

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590
lives and so there there's a a temporal
 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.509
lives and so there there's a a temporal
aspect to our experience there brings by

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519
aspect to our experience there brings by
 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.090
aspect to our experience there brings by
itself sense into the story in other

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100
itself sense into the story in other
 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.329
itself sense into the story in other
words you were not walking before you

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339
words you were not walking before you
 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.420
words you were not walking before you
were born and you were not doing x and y

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430
were born and you were not doing x and y
 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.369
were born and you were not doing x and y
before you did something else first

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379
before you did something else first
 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.950
before you did something else first
so there's the sequencing of events that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
so there's the sequencing of events that
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.060
so there's the sequencing of events that
imposes a certain structure to the story

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070
imposes a certain structure to the story
 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.979
imposes a certain structure to the story
then there's something that intervenes

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
then there's something that intervenes
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.689
then there's something that intervenes
and is very important which has to do

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
and is very important which has to do
 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.210
and is very important which has to do
with value value in the true biological

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220
with value value in the true biological
 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.079
with value value in the true biological
sense which is that contrary to what

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089
sense which is that contrary to what
 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.890
sense which is that contrary to what
many people seem to think taking it at

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900
many people seem to think taking it at
 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.649
many people seem to think taking it at
face value sorry for the pun we do not

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659
face value sorry for the pun we do not
 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.450
face value sorry for the pun we do not
give the same amount of emotional

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460
give the same amount of emotional
 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.370
give the same amount of emotional
significance to every event so there are

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
significance to every event so there are
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.160
significance to every event so there are
things in our lives that take up an

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170
things in our lives that take up an
 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.359
things in our lives that take up an
enormous importance and that become very

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369
enormous importance and that become very
 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.569
enormous importance and that become very
dominant effects in our biography and

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
dominant effects in our biography and
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.450
dominant effects in our biography and
that comes out of a variety of reasons

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460
that comes out of a variety of reasons
 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.080
that comes out of a variety of reasons
but fundamentally comes out of how that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090
but fundamentally comes out of how that
 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.010
but fundamentally comes out of how that
particular experience connects with your

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020
particular experience connects with your
 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.580
particular experience connects with your
f effective systems of response so if

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
f effective systems of response so if
 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.609

something produces an undue amount of

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
something produces an undue amount of
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.120
something produces an undue amount of
pleasure or undue amount of displeasure

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130
pleasure or undue amount of displeasure
 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.910
pleasure or undue amount of displeasure
it's going to be judged differently and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
it's going to be judged differently and
 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.219
it's going to be judged differently and
it's going to be introduced in your

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229
it's going to be introduced in your
 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.639
it's going to be introduced in your
narrative with a different size with the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649
narrative with a different size with the
 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.550
narrative with a different size with the
different development and so that is the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560
different development and so that is the
 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.590
different development and so that is the
the the next element to superimpose on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
the the next element to superimpose on
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.109
the the next element to superimpose on
the sequencing element and in fact their

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119
the sequencing element and in fact their
 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.270
the sequencing element and in fact their
element is so powerful that very often

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
element is so powerful that very often
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.540
element is so powerful that very often
it can trump the sequencing event

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550
it can trump the sequencing event
 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.270
it can trump the sequencing event
that the sequency aspects so something

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
that the sequency aspects so something
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.330
that the sequency aspects so something
may have happened before and yet this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340
may have happened before and yet this
 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.610
may have happened before and yet this
thing that happened just after maybe so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
thing that happened just after maybe so
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.260
thing that happened just after maybe so
important that you don't even know about

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270
important that you don't even know about
 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.900
important that you don't even know about
the thing that happened before and when

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
the thing that happened before and when
 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.300
the thing that happened before and when
you tell your story to yourself or to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
you tell your story to yourself or to
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.720
you tell your story to yourself or to
someone else it's going to be told not

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730
someone else it's going to be told not
 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.780
someone else it's going to be told not
on the basis necessarily of the time

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
on the basis necessarily of the time
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.290
on the basis necessarily of the time
course but rather on the basis of how it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300
course but rather on the basis of how it
 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.710
course but rather on the basis of how it
was valued by you in that value by the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720
was valued by you in that value by the
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.160
was valued by you in that value by the

way and does not need to be conscious
you know you're not designing haha this

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420
you know you're not designing haha this
 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.800
you know you're not designing haha this
is very good x-value no you're you're

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
is very good x-value no you're you're
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.210
is very good x-value no you're you're
assigning value naturally as life

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220
assigning value naturally as life
 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.690
assigning value naturally as life
unfolds and and that's this very

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700
unfolds and and that's this very
 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.310
unfolds and and that's this very
important element for the construction

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320
important element for the construction
 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.070
important element for the construction
of one's narrative and the other thing

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
of one's narrative and the other thing
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.150
of one's narrative and the other thing
that is very important is that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160
that is very important is that
 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.840
that is very important is that
narratives are not fixed we change our

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850
narratives are not fixed we change our
 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.970
narratives are not fixed we change our
narratives we change our narratives for

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980
narratives we change our narratives for
 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430
narratives we change our narratives for
ourselves and we change them not

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440
ourselves and we change them not
 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.340
ourselves and we change them not
necessarily deliberately in other words

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
necessarily deliberately in other words
 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.930
necessarily deliberately in other words
some people do some people will

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940
some people do some people will
 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.310
some people do some people will
constantly reconstruct their biography

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320
constantly reconstruct their biography
 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.710
constantly reconstruct their biography
for external purposes it's a very

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
for external purposes it's a very
 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.720
for external purposes it's a very
interesting political ploy you know but

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730
interesting political ploy you know but
 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.699
interesting political ploy you know but
whether we want to do it because we want

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709
whether we want to do it because we want
 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.130
whether we want to do it because we want
to have people to have a different idea

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140
to have people to have a different idea
 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.400
to have people to have a different idea
of who we are or not we do it naturally

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410
of who we are or not we do it naturally
 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.140
of who we are or not we do it naturally
so the way we construct our narrative

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150
so the way we construct our narrative
 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.699
so the way we construct our narrative
today is different from the way we

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709
today is different from the way we
 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.160
today is different from the way we
constructed it a year ago the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170
constructed it a year ago the
 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.930
constructed it a year ago the
differences may be very smaller than

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
differences may be very smaller than
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.900
differences may be very smaller than
maybe huge and they're constantly

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910
maybe huge and they're constantly
 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.110
maybe huge and they're constantly
changing as a result of events that

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
changing as a result of events that
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.390
changing as a result of events that
happen in your life you're not the same

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400
happen in your life you're not the same
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.000
happen in your life you're not the same
after say an incredible love affair that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010
after say an incredible love affair that
 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.699
after say an incredible love affair that
went very well or a love affair that

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709
went very well or a love affair that
 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.030
went very well or a love affair that
went bad or something that happens to

your health or something that happened
to somebody else's health that is close

to you or something that happens
professionally all of those things sort

professionally all of those things sort
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.120
professionally all of those things sort
of rearrange the way your story gets

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130
of rearrange the way your story gets
 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.790
of rearrange the way your story gets
constructed

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.059
well it did of course it happens first

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069
well it did of course it happens first
 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.670
well it did of course it happens first
of all in the brain and and it's

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680
of all in the brain and and it's
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.559
of all in the brain and and it's
affecting the brain because it sort of

changes the weights with which memories

changes the weights with which memories
are recalled so you know we we had a

are recalled so you know we we had a

are recalled so you know we we had a
chance of talking on another occasion

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099
chance of talking on another occasion

about the architecture of conversions

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590
about the architecture of conversions
 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.279
about the architecture of conversions
and diversions all of that is constantly
