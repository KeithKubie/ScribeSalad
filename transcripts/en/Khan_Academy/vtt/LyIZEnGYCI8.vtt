00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.260
Mary has decided
to buy a new car.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.670
The local car dealership states
the car she is considering

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.860
has an estimated gas mileage
of 24 miles per gallon.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.620
The car has a 12 gallon tank.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.380
Mary tells her
friend that the car

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.110
will travel exactly 288
miles on a full tank of gas.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.610
Is this a reasonable statement?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.984
Why or why not?

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.150
And I encourage you to pause
this video now and look

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.250
at these statements.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.310
And think about is this
a reasonable statement,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.620
yes or no?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.960
And then justify.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.560
Use one of these
justifications to say

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.890
whether it is a reasonable
statement or not.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.047
So let's read
through each of them.

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:40.380
So the first one says, yes,
it is a reasonable statement

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.510
for Mary to tell her friend that
the car will travel exactly 288

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.320
miles on a full tank of gas.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.180
And the rationale is, the
car can travel exactly 24

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.670
miles per gallon
times 12 gallons.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.970
We see that the units, the
gallon in the numerator,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.540
gallon in the
denominator cancel out.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.480
And we're left with 24
times 12, which is 288.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.730
And the units we're
left with is miles.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.370
288 miles on 1 tank of gas.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.340
Now there's one
little thing that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.360
makes this-- the
math seems right.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.030
The unit cancellation
seems right,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.790
the dimensional
analysis, so to speak.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.500
But it seems like the statement
is using a stronger assumption

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.540
than what the car
dealer told her.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.110
The car dealer told her
that it has an estimated gas

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.055
mileage of 24 miles per gallon.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.290
To do this, she
would have to assume

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.560
that the car can travel
exactly 24 miles in a gallon.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.410
There's a big difference
between an estimate

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.080
and being exactly
24 miles per gallon.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.860
In the estimate, first of all,
they might have rounded it.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.720
When they did the tests,
it might have been 23.9.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.520
It might have even have
been 23.6 miles per gallon.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.739
Or it might have been
24.4 miles per gallon.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.030
That's a pretty big difference.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.610
You definitely wouldn't
get to exactly 288 miles.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.000
The other thing is this
estimate is probably

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.961
based on an average of
traveling many, many, many miles

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:02.960
in different conditions.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.790
You get better gas mileage
if you're on the highway,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310
or if you're going downhill.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.050
And you get worse
gas mileage if you're

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.770
in traffic, or if
you're going uphill,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.790
or if there's a strong headwind.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.500
So it just averages here.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.590
So you can't say that it's
going to go exactly 288

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.969
miles without knowing exactly
how this was measured.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.510
And frankly, every car is going
to be a little bit different.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.150
The octane of the fuel will
be a little bit different.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.830
And so that's why it's hard to
make this assumption right over

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.270
here, that the car can travel
exactly 24 miles per gallon.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.940
The dealership just
gave an estimate.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.153
So let's go to B. Yes,
the estimated gas mileage

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:40.010
of the car can be used to
calculate the exact distance

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.220
the car will travel on
any one tank of gas.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.690
Well, no, we just already
said it's an estimate.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.200
It's roughly how far the car
can travel on a tank of gas,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
but it's not the exact
distance the car will

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.940
travel on any one tank of gas.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820
C, no, it's not a
reasonable statement.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.500
24 miles per gallon is an
estimate, likely rounded

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.166
to the nearest integer,
so it would not

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.540
be reasonable to
try to calculate

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.441
the exact distance
the car can travel.

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.940
That's what I think
I've been saying

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.540
all along throughout this video.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.350
So let's just read
D. No, the distance

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.460
the car will travel is found
by dividing 24 miles per gallon

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.280
by 12 gallons.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.560
No, this is just wrong.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.500
This is wrong
mathematically, and this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.810
is just troublesome
on a lot of levels.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.950
C is the right answer.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.924
D is the most wrong of
all the answers here.
