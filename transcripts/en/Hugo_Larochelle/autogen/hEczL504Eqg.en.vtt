00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this video we will see the calculation 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.269
 marginal pro liter and filtering 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.370
 as part of hm 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 so we saw how to calculate the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.730
 probability joined this in a hlm this is 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.180
 to say how to calculate the parity of pde 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 is up till you and h1 until you miss 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.210
 but in what will be more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 interesting fact since normally the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.260
 hidden variables are hidden 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.450
 not observe we will rather be interested in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 calculate what is the probability of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.059
 observation that I have in hand so except 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.489
 that it requires so it's 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 marginalize variables that are not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.000
 observed the hidden variables in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 too much what it means is that I 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 have to sum up on all 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.329
 possible assignments of variables 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 hidden 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 I have to sum up their 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.550
 probabilities x given the policy 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 to have these hidden variables there the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 political this assignment of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.140
 hidden variables the rs and generate the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 observations for which I try 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.369
 to evaluate the probability so the part 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 marginal it is useful among others for 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 try to see to measure how much 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 my model let go even is a good model 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.369
 for my data is what gas inc of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.979
 pro liter to observe observations 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.100
 that I collected policies are 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 high or not so that's what we have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.720
 calculated to calculate the probability 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.579
 marginal the problem we see here 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 it is that the sum of 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.380
 all possible sequences of rates 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.110
 cash and it's a sum that very very 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 big which makes it exponential so if 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 for example we were hidden took 2 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.180
 possible value but I have two values 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.880
 for h 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.100
 once the two values ​​for h two 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.610
 times both possible values ​​for h3 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.450
 and so on until you buy 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.229
 so I'm going to have two to act and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.240
 possible sequences of value value 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.640
 for kosher states and that's it just 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.530
 for the case where the states to cyprus 2 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.060
 value if they take more than 2 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 valence that still sells this practice 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.170
 will be 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.569
 thoroughly the number of values ​​can the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.580
 variables n at the act and so that's 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.140
 exponential it's something that gets 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.209
 not calculate in practice so a calculation 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.640
 naive from basically the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.860
 definition of the marginal policy is going 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.599
 not and effective in the context of schemas 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.590
 so what we're going to do is 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.120
 that we will use a technique to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 do this kind of calculation had operated 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.170
 the structure of the hlm as part of a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.910
 dynamic program 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.610
 so the idea of ​​doing programming 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.720
 dynamic it's actually breaking down the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.180
 calculation we want to do 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.390
 but intermediate calculations that we will 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.569
 structure in a table and we will 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.790
 start in a corner here that we're going 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 calculate all of the other 15 as 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 that and we will progress until we 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 calculated all the elements of my 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.620
 table and there I will be able to consult 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.049
 the elements of my chart at the end which 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.730
 I'm interested in the interest of doing that 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.160
 in a table like that it's when we 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.019
 does that will require in the case between 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.180
 others of the hmm only two iterations 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.250
 iteration over the number of rows and the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.840
 number of columns and if he appoints 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.290
 tidy the number of columns and small 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.549
 bath the calculation is going to be effective and it's going 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.120
 to be the case in the context of letting go even 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.319
 could do the calculation that we are late 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.819
 when we want to fage remember knows 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.920
 calculate the probability for a 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.680
 sequence that we observed that I noted 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.200
 little s1 until t so if that's the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.549
 sequence the observations I have in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.019
 hand for which I will evaluate the 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.130
 probability then the dynamic program 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.290
 the big thing we are going to do is we 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.549
 will start by defining what are the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.370
 table elements that owl 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.100
 calculate and dance only if what we're going 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.540
 wanting calculated is therefore the element of 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.510
 table that I will call al fahm 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.690
 the element monday two cols tidy i 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.870
 'the index of columbia that's going to be the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:19.260
 probability that I observed from s1 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:22.710
 up is this little and and that the 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.700
 hidden variable at time t be equal 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.820
 at 10 or 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.650
 i of a possible value value 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.180
 possible from the domain of but variables 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.820
 hidden that's how I go 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 set the elements my table of my 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.340
 dynamic program 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.940
 when I have to do it is to do the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.640
 link between these corners there values ​​I 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.620
 have to comp inc in my chart at the 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.040
 column of the healthiest and bind him with 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.840
 what I would have already calculated at the 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.760
 Colombia what will make that game strong 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.220
 make a pass from left to right 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.510
 then calculated all the elements of my 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.120
 array then by definition alpha it 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.760
 is no longer a bath it's this probability 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.700
 here here is the probability that 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.110
 I observe the elements in my reader 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.760
 rss 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.380
 1 to a little more we just have to 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.360
 replaced here by type the st 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.440
 actually I was full here I had 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.070
 tm and so the pop to observe that and that 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.640
 the variable hidden in the state at the instant t 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.550
 + 1 be equal to what I the same 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.190
 illicit then now this 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.020
 probability there I'm going to write it as 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.330
 following you'll see why it's me 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.790
 allow to close reduction which of 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.370
 make the link with the elements of the lake 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.530
 holland therefore addresses this probity there 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.330
 here in fact what I can do is 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.980
 simply added the value the variable 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.200
 random buy so if I had bought 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.810
 less more a game here bought + 1 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.360
 i still have s1 until been more successful 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.360
 I'm going here too I just added 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.480
 a 'buy' assignment to a 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.030
 possible value j by cons for that 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.710
 I have equality since for me to have to 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.900
 equal in fact mowing marginalized 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.580
 this random variable so I'm going 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.500
 summit on all these possible values 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.670
 here so if I sum up on all 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.210
 values ​​possible to buy 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:21.600
 I fall back on this probability here here 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.460
 so I have equality now I'm going 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 take this probity June is there then 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.270
 I'm going to break it down in fact I just 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.920
 rewrite it a little differently for 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.580
 the moment so what I did was 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.300
 that I took the smells the observation 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.150
 sgs was healthier 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.900
 then I broke down in two 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.490
 so if I talk about f1 until st and 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.020
 then it was simpler I'm going to 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.580
 put in the end so it changes 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.520
 nothing i'm just going to give the elements 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.330
 the probity but I go there again the 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.730
 probity that s-21 jca-t be equal to small 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.800
 is a gold up to that and that was 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.540
 more a gala care is more a it's the 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.980
 same as writing swiss 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.620
 it's just a different way the 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.770
 crimes is so now I'm going 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.720
 take the probability that I have here 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.110
 joined then I had compounds have a 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.840
 conditional product so we know that 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.620
 I can take if I have a distribution 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.710
 on three random variables like that 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:25.700
 I can still write it camping two 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:29.840
 extreme xp ii x2 sacha x 1 xp ii x3 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.220
 sascha riether ok so I'm here I 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.020
 prefers this for four barred thouars 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.150
 for that does not take so that's what 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.400
 I'm going to do here then the equivalent 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.290
 an exxon it'll be the first 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:44.590
 elements that I have here maybe it's okay 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:47.150
 peace of s-21 until you and peace and 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.720
 pardon is bought by it's just the 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:54.230
 first two elements here so kind the 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.360
 probity attached to his is the interest of 

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.300
 do that that was my match 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.890
 alfort that I want to do appears 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:04.400
 after that I must have priority 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:06.740
 of a second asset element but 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.130
 random variable here knowing this 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.290
 so I'll take bought + 1 the 

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:17.480
 manage purchased policy + 1 be equal 

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:18.980
 given that I bought either gala 

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.170
 what I have here 

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.200
 but normally I should have this 

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.960
 also s1j cat equals a small s1 

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.530
 until you're here it's not written if it's 

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.330
 because in fact given that https 

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.430
 galls is the random variable 

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:38.420
 bought + 1 it is independent of everything 

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:40.520
 that's why it's the case 

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:47.140
 reminds that in the task and even we have 

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:50.380
 bought like that here we bought + 1 

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:54.220
 unfamiliar slump bought + 1 and 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:58.290
 then here I would have hesitated and then further 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:05.920
 there over there I would have all the s1 then 

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:08.530
 st up to st - and to find out if sort 

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.970
 is independent of all the esses sacha 

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.580
 buy I have to check if the paths 

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.250
 are actually stuck if I observe 

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.080
 it's all paths between the s is 

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.450
 bought + 1 will all be blocked at 

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.310
 this one so actually if I 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.500
 know buy buy more 

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.700
 interdependent of all 

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.350
 so that's why they do not have 

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.800
 appear here there is an independence 

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:32.440
 conditional then the path of two 

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.210
 I will deal with the case of this 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.170
 victory there and there he stays now 

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:41.370
 is healthier here 

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:45.700
 so I see I was more a sacha 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:49.690
 the previous random variable purchased 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:54.490
 + 1 and all others 

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:56.920
 labs here buy and s2 is 

00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:00.490
 until is quoted now for the same 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.800
 reason so if i add here is is more 

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:06.460
 a 

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:10.540
 again if I watch bought + 1 

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:14.350
 all paths between st +1 and buy 

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.300
 as well as st up to s1 until st in 

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.670
 all the variables here are their 

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.710
 way to st plus we are stuck so 

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.350
 that means if I watch bought + 1 

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.410
 if I suppose added value more 

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.310
 healthy is mentioned above is independent 

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.050
 of all these variables 

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.020
 so I have not put them right in 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.510
 so my conditioning that's the reason 

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.660
 for which we do not find is this one 

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.340
 to incite and buy here right 

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.770
 now the reason I 

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.540
 the outputs of the sum is that one 

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.400
 notice now this term does not disparate 

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.640
 no j so they constant against 

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.840
 at j then normally they would be they 

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.580
 would have been here but I can 

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.130
 go out because the term is constant 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.830
 compared to June 

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:59.680
 then from this bath I take this 

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.250
 successful equation and I notice that this 

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:06.790
 term there here it's actually the definition 

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:09.370
 even of alpha it is actually it's al 

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.790
 flip through but to be honest I got it 

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.780
 my place 

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:18.640
 the place to use here gj so that 

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.740
 it's equal to alpha jt so that's me 

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.330
 allows to calculate the elements of the tee 

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.140
 plus 1st columns in my table to 

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:30.100
 from the elements of the teapot 

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:32.200
 columns in my alpha array and 

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.520
 finally ben if I can initialize the 

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.470
 first column that means I 

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.720
 able to calculate everything my case my my 

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.990
 table from left to right and 

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.760
 by definition alpha has a it's the 

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:46.510
 probability that pedretti is equal to 

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.310
 little s hours and h one penny equals 

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.880
 a value give it that gave a 

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:54.790
 cinnamon clues and that in a hlm that's 

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.980
 simply p2a charity gallery times pds 

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.740
 have integrated little sister sacha who has 

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.930
 sung gallery so that allows me 

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.570
 to initialize the variables in the 

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:07.510
 world in the first column and then to 

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.980
 from there recursion that I have here I 

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.660
 want to be able to calculate the 

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.490
 second column from the first 

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.170
 then the third part of the second 

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.400
 is instituted since calculated all my 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:21.040
 table once all my table 

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.960
 is calculated but I can get the 

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.170
 probability of all my sequence is this 

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.770
 logical up to incite by taking the 

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:32.680
 probity of monkeys up to st 

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.360
 and that ht is equal to a value lying 

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.660
 data can sum up on 

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.570
 all possible values ​​j and then this 

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:43.120
 term there it actually corresponds to my 

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.850
 last column the column grown up in 

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.950
 so my alpha chart is actually for 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.110
 get the probability of all the 

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.930
 marginalized sequences I just have to do 

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:56.020
 the sum of the elements of the last 

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.730
 column of my painting so here is the 

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.170
 dynamic program that will allow me 

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.050
 among other things to calculate the probability 

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:07.860
 marginal for an observed sequence is 

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:07.860
 this small s1 up thies great t 

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.850
 so let's do an example to see 

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.250
 concretely how does someone get 

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.310
 in this example if I want to assume that 

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.970
 I have a sequence of size 4 and dense 

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:25.900
 that if but variable h 

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:28.120
 winds is binary 110 0 or 1 then 

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.880
 but observed variable is quoted are going 

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.770
 also be binary say you did 

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.040
 you can imagine that someone who 

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:38.260
 is in the process of transferring a signal that 

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040
 is going to be the ht signal which is a signal 

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.180
 binary but there is some noise in 

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:48.610
 the observation of this signal there is to 

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.360
 say that if the person has transferred to a 

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:54.040
 moment t 

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.930
 the bit 0.50 and 0.9 I'm going to observe 0 

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.630
 but with a politeness 0.12 I will 

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:02.200
 observe a no sorry here with the 

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:04.810
 british 0.1 I'll observe rather then 

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.730
 the same way if the person to 

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.680
 the moment t but transmits the bit 

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.870
 a game supposed that some noise in 

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.300
 communication that makes that with a 

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.640
 quality big enough 0.8 I 

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.200
 actually observed a but with a 

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.160
 probability 0.2 I observed earlier 

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.840
 and then now to the model of 

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.530
 transition but I'm supposed to actually 

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.010
 that if it is more likely that the 

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.750
 person alternate in 10 01 01 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.790
 to send several times 000 1 

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:36.250
 so that was illustrated by the fact that 

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.990
 the probability that I transferred to 

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:42.100
 the previous example 0 and that I 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:43.930
 still transfer 0 the moment t maybe 

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.830
 smaller than the probability of 

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:50.770
 transfer 1 after transferring 0 which 

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.810
 0.7 the same way here if I transferred 

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:56.170
 forward I resume the higher type 

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.540
 to transfer 0 after that to transfer 

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.920
 again ok so that's it 

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.780
 assumptions I make in my model 

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.730
 to finance an initial distribution 

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.070
 which assumes that the practices first 

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:10.030
 symbol the first pit that I send either 

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:11.980
 0 or 1 is actually respect replications 

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.340
 our alpha chart from its 

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.340
 producers 

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.730
 I removed lancre for the rest so we 

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:24.930
 wish as firstly initialize 

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:27.779
 our alpha chart then as we have 

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.959
 saw her loudly for the first column 

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:33.600
 this is it here so it's alpha sy 1 for 

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:39.089
 different values ​​of i sava head the 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:42.600
 probity that to songs of the galleries times 

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:48.000
 the probability of observing is a knowing 

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:52.200
 that h integrate this value of ibra for 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.459
 the first element we only have that 

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.970
 corresponds to the calculations that the 

00:15:53.459 --> 00:16:00.779
 probability of purchase equals zero 

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.990
 times the probability that from 

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:05.910
 ax is zero I generate or 

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.740
 that I observe they are equal to zero 

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.440
 so that's saint calais 0 because in 

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:15.120
 my other message observed s1 equals 

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:20.670
 zero and then it corresponds to 0.5 which is 

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:23.700
 here times 0.9 that are here this 

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:27.420
 last patented that h1 be equal to 

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.350
 zero forgiveness the part that went 

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.950
 equal to zero 

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.570
 knowing that h a tea gala 0 so saturday 

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:38.070
 0 points 45 that I insert in my 

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:42.750
 table enough of this fact the same calculation 

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:44.940
 but for purchase is equal to 1 and the other 

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:48.029
 it gives and praline 0.2 times 

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.160
 0.5 which gives 0.1 that I insert in 

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:52.829
 my table again that's it 

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.630
 to initialize my first column and the 

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:56.370
 part of the recursion that I derived 

00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:01.199
 sometimes I will be able to calculate the 

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:03.570
 other columns so you have there 

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:05.419
 recursion here I will not tell them but 

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.459
 it's the same recursion that we saw before 

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:10.350
 and visually that means that for 

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:12.780
 calculate the elements here in fact I 

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:15.630
 am going to combine the values ​​in the column 

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.490
 previous then weighting them from 

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.290
 transition probabilities in a 

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.240
 observation reality also for 

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.709
 derive what I have to inserted into the 

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.709
 table to the next column 

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:33.150
 especially for the probability for 

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:38.520
 alpha 0 2 which is the ultimate proof alpha 

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:43.950
 0.2 ok the probability psn is equal to 

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.690
 zero ps2 equals zero or 

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:50.330
 because s 2 what I observe if it is 

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:53.070
 equal to zero and that h2 equals zero 

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:56.430
 so we saw that it was written 

00:17:53.070 --> 00:18:01.350
 with 17 recursion there to know I take 

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:04.230
 my alpha element 0 1 that is here and I 

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:06.900
 multiplies it by the parity of being at 0 

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.970
 to go hide yourself at the moment a well 

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:16.530
 to stay at 0 she was in cash and at 

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:19.620
 like its more alpha 1 1 which from here 

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:22.170
 so in that if we were on the nose in 

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.550
 the poop hatcher is equal to 1 and there I 

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.340
 look what's to enjoy the tasks 

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:29.940
 or equal to 1 then move on like 

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.680
 the hd is zero and I take all 

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.830
 together then I multiply by ckoi the 

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.690
 probability that h2 is equal knowing that 

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:39.210
 she age is equal to zero that i have 

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.060
 observed s2 tegana 0 and the remainder of equal 

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.130
 to zero it comes from the fact that it is the 

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.210
 sequence that is observed for which 

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:50.340
 I will evaluate its probability 

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:53.520
 so I replace it gives the calculation 

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.940
 next and then I insert it into my 

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.340
 board 

00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:04.500
 so if we did know al fallah 

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:08.430
 x the parity to pass from here to pass 

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:13.020
 from 0 to 0 which 0.3 because of that I have the 

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:15.540
 body the half associated with h1n equal to 1 

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:21.900
 yoga what is the probability of being 

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:22.850
 to rota previous to 1 then 2 to get to 

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.600
 zero 

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.840
 actually that's the case 

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.180
 corresponds to h 2 is equal to zero I 

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.490
 hopefully 0.6 and here I multiply by 

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.850
 the policy from h2o is equal to 

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.140
 zero 

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:38.539
 i observe s2 equals zero that they in 

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.950
 point 

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:42.179
 so if I do it all together 

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.830
 give also know that I insert 

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:49.379
 lamentable I'm doing the same thing for the 

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.869
 alpha case 1 2 which I will not repeat 

00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:56.009
 the exercise here but everything that changes 

00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:58.710
 in the background it's the probabilities here 

00:19:56.009 --> 00:20:00.119
 are punished even so that this is it 

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:04.619
 all that change I reuse again 

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:05.909
 there it was dark then the time one if I 

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:08.940
 replace by the numbers it gives me 

00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:13.799
 this value if I insert my 

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.179
 chart I go to the high column and 

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:17.039
 I'm doing exactly the same thing 

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:20.129
 until now rather than having been 

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:22.529
 equal to 1 as previously kind t he 

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:24.600
 there are two sleeves filling up 

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:30.749
 the healthiest column so the 

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:34.289
 column 3 so I show you the 

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:38.850
 calculations here quickly and I continue 

00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:41.039
 like that until the last column that 

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.019
 was born the last column that is 

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:45.600
 four what do I have a sequence 

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:53.369
 of length 4 so I filled in at 

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:55.619
 complete word alpha board and hello 

00:20:53.369 --> 00:20:59.489
 come here and now if I had wanted 

00:20:55.619 --> 00:21:04.379
 calculate the probability that s1 is equal 

00:20:59.489 --> 00:21:07.889
 to zero that s 2 is equal to zero that s3 

00:21:04.379 --> 00:21:08.909
 be zero and that s 4 be equal to 

00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:10.679
 1 

00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:16.529
 all I would have done is the sum 

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:20.090
 of spells over that and that was my answer 

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:20.090
 on the probity of the whole sequence 

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:25.980
 now another policy we are not going 

00:21:23.489 --> 00:21:27.779
 calculate with the alfa which often more 

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.480
 interesting in fact that calculate the 

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:33.629
 marginal probability is to make 

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.909
 filtering ie in an example if 

00:21:33.629 --> 00:21:37.559
 so, but I only have four 

00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:38.970
 observations I have the first four 

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:40.919
 beats of a message I received 

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.779
 but here I want to know what is it 

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:44.970
 did the last big one that I received is this 

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:46.590
 that it's zero or is it one and 

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.289
 when I would like to know it's actually 

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.850
 what is the probability so h4 its 

00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:51.389
 equal to zero given the whole message 

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.729
 than 

00:21:51.389 --> 00:21:56.129
 received until now or what is 

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:57.559
 the policy h4 or equal to a torrent or 

00:21:56.129 --> 00:21:59.789
 the message I received until now 

00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:01.769
 a conditional political base 

00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:03.570
 so I can recess like the ratio of 

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:10.759
 the attachments on all the variables 

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:13.440
 involved know h4 s1 s2 s3 and s4 / the 

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:16.190
 sum of the numerator for all 

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.509
 possible values ​​2 h 4 on which 

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:20.459
 for which I am interested 

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:22.940
 conditional distribution so I'm doing 

00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:25.969
 the sum here of hashes cap galleries 

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:29.399
 and all other observations fixed 

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:31.049
 and there it makes these contents all these 

00:22:29.399 --> 00:22:34.079
 elements are contained in my chart 

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:35.309
 alpha they're right here so I'm doing 

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:38.729
 just replaced I'm going to have a 

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:41.549
 better 0 point 0 043 useful that is 

00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:43.139
 here then if I have the sum in fact of 

00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:44.249
 my column so either we notice that it 

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:47.039
 actually corresponds to the probablity 

00:22:44.249 --> 00:22:49.739
 marginal the sequence is this it gives me 

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:53.279
 that the policy h 4 the last bit be 

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:55.379
 0 is still pretty low 0.07 is 

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:56.099
 just if i do the same calculation with hk 

00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:57.719
 is equal to 1 

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:59.070
 all that actually changes is 

00:22:57.719 --> 00:23:03.959
 liberator of the numerator it is 

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:05.700
 now the other alpha alpha 1 4 the 

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:07.229
 denominator remains the same 

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.209
 I get a very high policy in 

00:23:07.229 --> 00:23:11.369
 does so I have a pretty heavy confidence 

00:23:09.209 --> 00:23:16.289
 that the last bit is indeed a 

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:20.190
 is actually an error here here it helps 

00:23:16.289 --> 00:23:23.669
 and 0 then 6 and 1 06 and 1 

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:26.419
 so what despite the possible noise 

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:29.639
 I have a fairly high confidence with them 

00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:31.709
 I did receive skt garin and 

00:23:29.639 --> 00:23:32.279
 it was good but the message that 

00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:34.919
 been sent 

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:35.669
 so the bit was not corrupted in the 

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:37.649
 communication 

00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:38.999
 so thanks to the table thoroughly we are going 

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:40.829
 also be able to filter 

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:43.109
 like that and reasoned about your 

00:23:40.829 --> 00:23:47.690
 certainties about our observations by 

00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:47.690
 relation to the hidden variables
