00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.190
This brings us to the first quiz. After every lesson in this

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.470
course we'll have a short quiz, in which we'll ask you to write down what you

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.840
learned in this lesson in this blue box here. These quizzes have two goals.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
The first goal is to help you synthesize and organize what you have learned.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.440
The process of writing down what you learned may help you, in fact,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.350
learn it more deeply. The second goal is to provide us with feedback. Perhaps we

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.550
could have been clearer or more precise about some of the concepts. Perhaps we

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.450
left some misconceptions. Note that these quizzes are completely optional.
