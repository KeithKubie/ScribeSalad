00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.100
Let’s say you just had a big row with someone close to you.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.540
They behaved terribly, maybe broke something and said something hideous to you.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.660
It’s so tempting to give up on them and just hate them, but there’s another way.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.880
Here’s a big idea

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.760
People are almost never simply bad.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.720
What they are far more often is scared.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.080
When they behave in really horrible ways, it tends to be because they’re extremely anxious for some reason or another.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.900
Though their behavior can seem strong, no one who actually felt strong would be all arsey like that.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.280
The mature response shouldn’t therefore be to increase tension and flare up in return

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.760
but to strive to see all you’ve got in front of you is someone who can’t cope.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.620
We are so aligned to the idea that it’s patronizing to think of people as younger than they are

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.260
we forget that it’s also, at times, the greatest privilege to look beyond someone’s adult self

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.440
in order to engage with and forgive the anxious or disappointed, furious or inarticulate child within

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.500
There’s another thing to bear in mind when all you can see is a person’s weak points.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.480
Weak points are always linked to strong points and vice versa.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.460
So, for example, the strength of thoroughness is always going to bring with, in other contexts, the weakness of pedantry.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.960
Creative brilliance might well be inseparable from logistical unreliability.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.200
People who are fantastic leaders at work are likely to be seriously difficult around domestic chores.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.080
The reason for keeping this in mind is that we often encounter people’s weaknesses

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.980
at moments when we’re in danger of losing sight of their strengths.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.620
At certain points, all it seems we’re bumping into are the weaknesses.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.680
We wonder “how did I end up in this relationship or hanging out with this person?”

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.000
During tough times, we only see the flaws.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.300
We are failing to step back enough and ask a really vital question

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
not just what are these people’s weaknesses

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.540
but what are the strengths of which these annoying traits are the unfortunate shadow sides.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.940
Everyone is going to have the weaknesses of their strengths.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.460
Forgiving people must mean doing everything we can to keep their strengths in view

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.620
at moments where their weaknesses are only too painfully apparent.﻿
