00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.801
- [Voiceover] The spring is
now compressed twice as much,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.741
to delta x equals 2D.

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.249
A student is asked to predict
whether the final position

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:11.612
of the block will be twice
as far at x equals 6D.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.807
The student reasons that since
the spring will be compressed

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:18.338
twice as much as before, the
block will have more energy

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:21.623
when it leaves the spring,
so it will slide farther

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:26.024
along the track before stopping
at position x equals 6D.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.844
So, let's just think about
what the student is saying

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:30.816
or what's being proposed here.

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:34.259
So, in the first version, the
first scenario, we compressed

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.227
the block, we compressed the spring by D.

00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:40.721
And then, the spring
accelerates the block.

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:43.183
And then, right when we
get back to x equals zero,

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:45.066
all of that potential
energy has been turned into

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.162
kinetic energy.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.977
And then, the friction is acting

00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:53.247
against the motion of the block,

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.794
so you can view it as it's
providing negative work.

00:00:56.794 --> 00:01:01.717
The direction of the force is
opposite to the change in x.

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:05.957
And the negative work eventually
causes the block to stop.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:09.961
And all of that kinetic energy
has now turned into heat.

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.292
And so, the block goes 3D.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:15.397
Now, this new scenario, we
could call that scenario two,

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:19.018
we are going to compress
the spring twice as far.

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:22.826
So, now we're gonna compress
the spring twice as far.

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:25.160
So, we're gonna compress it by 2D.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.758
So, this is x equals negative 2D here.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:30.140
And what's being said,
or what's being proposed,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.345
by the student is alright, if
we compress it twice as far,

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.715
all of this potential
energy is then going to be,

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.418
we're definitely going to have
more potential energy here

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:42.006
because it takes more work to
compress the spring that far.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:43.845
And then, all of that more
potential energy is gonna

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:46.360
be converted to more kinetic
energy once we get back

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.985
to x equals zero.

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:50.284
And so, not only will it go
further, but they're saying

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:52.861
it'll go exactly twice as far.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.984
So, we are going to go,
instead of going to 3D, we are

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:59.259
now going to go to 6D.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:01.580
Now, let's read.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.065
Let's see what the questions are here.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.376
And actually, I'm gonna put
a question mark here since

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.506
I'm not sure if that is exactly right.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:14.500
So, part (b) i., let me do this.

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.690
So, we're in part (b) i.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.908
It says which aspects of the
student's reasoning, if any,

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:21.613
are correct.

00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:23.416
Explain how you arrived at your answer.

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.191
And then, part two says which
aspects of the student's

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.574
reasoning, if any, are incorrect.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:28.291
Explain how you arrived at your answer.

00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.297
So, the student is correct that two times,

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:33.621
so compressing more,

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:38.607
compressing spring more,

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:44.822
spring more, will result

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:50.367
in more energy when the
block leaves the spring,

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:54.926
result in more energy

00:02:56.396 --> 00:03:00.336
when block leaves the spring,

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:04.436
block leaves spring,

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.486
which will result in the block

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:14.442
going further, which will result,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.254
or the block going farther I should say,

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:22.276
which will result in
longer stopping distance,

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:27.933
which will result in longer stopping

00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:32.703
stopping distance.

00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:35.651
Now, part two.

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:37.993
Part two, here.

00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:42.091
Which aspect of the
student's reasoning, if any,

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.809
are incorrect.

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.786
Explain how you arrive at your answer.

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:51.499
Well, two times I could
say, let me say compressing,

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.606
compressing twice as much,

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:03.276
twice as much, does not result

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:05.771
in exactly twice the stopping distance,

00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:10.643
does not result in

00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:14.033
twice the stopping distance,

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.902
the stopping distance.

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:22.252
And we can explain more if we like.

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:26.542
We know that potential
energy is equal to 1/2 times

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:31.351
the spring constant times how
much we compress, squared.

00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:35.581
So, we could say that energy,

00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.221
energy grows

00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:43.091
with the square,

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.271
with the square,

00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.543
of compression of how much

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:51.102
we compress it.

00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:55.132
of how much

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:57.812
we compress.

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:02.977
So, two times the compression.

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:04.607
I'm gonna say two times.

00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:07.709
I'll write it out, two times compression

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.341
will result in four times

00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:15.751
the energy.

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:18.554
Energy.

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:21.740
And this will result in four
times the stopping distance,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.680
four times stopping distance,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.690
four times stopping,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.200
stopping, distance.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.724
I think that it does a decent
job of explaining where

00:05:38.724 --> 00:05:41.105
the student is correct, where
their reasoning is correct,

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.859
and where it is incorrect.
