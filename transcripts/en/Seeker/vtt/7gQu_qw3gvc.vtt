00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.060
Most species of shark evolved in the oceans
before the first trees evolved on earth.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.650
They’ve been around up to 450 million years
and have survived 4 mass extinctions so far.Many

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.259
of the OG ancient sharks that first started
to appear millions of years ago remain virtually

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.580
unchanged today, like this frilled shark--yeah,
that guy’s been through some stuff.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.040
One thing's for sure, you probably wouldn’t
want to be caught swimming near a shark, let

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.340
alone a Great White.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.980
Yet that’s what long distance swimmer Ben
Lecomte could encounter as he journeys across

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.240
the Pacific Ocean from Japan to San Francisco
to raise awareness about Ocean health.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.500
Seeker will be tracking Ben and bringing you
updates on the crew’s efforts to collect

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.740
the most extensive data set on the Pacific
Ocean to date, so make sure you check that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.740
out.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.410
Oh and to be clear, as Ben draws nearer to
San Francisco he will be crossing expanses

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.750
of water that are known Great White migration
areas...yikes!

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.989
Great Whites are a species of shark that recently
been discovered to live longer than previously

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.559
thought, to around 70 years or more.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.219
However, some sharks can live to be really
old AF--in some cases even living centuries

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.460
longer than we’d thought before, giving
us new insight into both shark ecology...and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.960
potentially the science of aging.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.790
Ok let’s back up.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.170
Scientists have thought that sharks were probably
older than originally estimated for about

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.170
a decade.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.650
And I’m talking individual sharks, not sharks
as a group of animals.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.299
But results from a study published in 2017
used novel methods to definitively determine

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.120
that yes, sharks live really unexpectedly
long lives.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.939
Most biologists age fish by measuring features
like scales and otoliths, which are boney

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.720
calcium deposits that are essentially a fish’s
‘ear bones’.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.350
Measuring these is like measuring tree rings
and can help us track seasonal growth and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.409
organism age.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.040
The problem is, sharks lack many of these
key structures.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.219
They don’t have scales the same way other
fish do, and they don’t have otoliths.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.369
Instead, shark scientists have been making
do by counting the calcified growth bands

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.450
that form along a shark’s cartilaginous
spine--but this isn’t necessarily that accurate,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.000
and the older the shark, the harder it is
to calculate its age this way.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.960
This new study took a different approach,
looking at bomb carbon dating age data.Bomb

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.770
carbon dating is based on the atmospheric
nuclear tests that were conducted in the 50s

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.160
and 60s, which deposited a huge spike of radiocarbon
into the atmosphere.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.000
We can detect the spike of this particular
radioisotope in the tissue of animals that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.430
were alive during those tests.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.140
This most recent study I mentioned compared
bomb carbon dating with the previous age estimates

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.860
found by measuring just the growth bands,
and found that the growth band estimations

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700
of shark age could be off by more than half.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.060
This breakthrough is important, not because
we’re obsessed with being rude and asking

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.470
sharks how old they are, but because conservation
policy is built around organismal life spans.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.120
Greenland sharks, for example, are a near-threatened
species of shark that claim the title of longest

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.120
living vertebrate on Earth--they could live
up to 500 years, and this means that they

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.770
don’t even start to reproduce until they’re
almost 150 years old.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.290
Fishing regulations and environmental protections
that impact shark populations of all kinds

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.330
are built on population models that rely on
our knowledge of how these animals survive

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.300
and reproduce, and if our numbers are wrong,
it could spell disaster for conservation efforts.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.370
Ever since the extreme life-span of the Greenland
shark was uncovered, scientists have also

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.700
been interested to see what they and their
fellow long-lived counterparts could teach

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.630
us about living for centuries.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.340
These organisms, despite being literally as
old as the Enlightenment in some cases, still

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.460
seem to have low incidence of cancer and other
age-related diseases.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.620
One possible explanation for this is that
they spend their lives thousands of meters

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.410
below the surface in freezing temperatures,
which slows down their maturation and metabolisms.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.102
But this is still a matter of scientific investigation,
and it remains to be seen if anything of use

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:37.950
will come of studying ye olde shark health.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.110
For now, we can use our improved understanding
of their life cycles to inform our conservation

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.020
efforts in the face of overfishing and changing
oceans during climate change.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.290
And as for me, there’s no way I would endure
those living conditions, even for near immortal

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.290
life.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.220
So, do you think you got what it takes to
swim across the Pacific ocean?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.290
Even now knowing some sharks have been lurking
there for centuries?

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.840
Check out how Ben Lecomte prepared for his
trip and how they’re collecting the most

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.620
extensive data set during his journey.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.660
And fun fact, female sharks can use sperm
from multiple males, meaning some pups born

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.200
at the same time are actually half-siblings.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200
Sharks, guys!

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.530
They’re so cool.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.590
I’m maren thanks for watching.
