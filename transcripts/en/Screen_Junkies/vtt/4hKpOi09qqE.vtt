00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.540
Okay.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.540
Based on the book that inspired a million
crying girls' Tumblr posts...

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.680
Comes the romance that did for cancer what
Twilight did for vampires.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.220
The Fault In Our Stars

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.760
Ride along for a touching story about how
one girl's cancer led to fun,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.340
sex,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.410
and extravagant European vacations.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
But instead of sugarcoating the truth, get
ready for two well-rounded characters with

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.059
a powerful message:

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.290
Everyone you love will die.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.440
Meet Hazel, and her sidekick:

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.070
luggage.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.269
She's a smart young girl who's more than
just a cancer survivor:

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.510
she's also a total downer.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.010
"Depression's not a side-effect of cancer;
it's a side-effect of dying."

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.710
"Hey, I just wanted to say that you know there's
gonna come a time when all of us are dead."

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.460
"You just die in the middle of life."

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.350
"Dying sucks."

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.630
Hazel's world will transform when she attends
the most adorable

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.320
cancer support group ever.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.130
There, she'll meet fellow survivor Augustus
Waters,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.420
a confident, 6 foot 4, well-spoken, adorkable,
polite, funny, star-athlete, philosopher-poet

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.340
with a six pack.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.649
"Probably why I'm still a virgin."

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.740
Uh huh, sure you are.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.579
Together, they'll bond over a book with
a title just as pretentious as "The Fault

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.579
In Our Stars."

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.060
"An Imperial Affliction."

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.409
And their shared habit of talking like really
weird old people.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.920
"Your daughter, she's done a great injustice."

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.369
"You have no idea how utterly unprecedented
you are."

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.630
"I am in the midst of a grand soliloquy here!"

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.109
"Welcome to the sweet torture of reading An
Imperial Affliction."

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.640
"Drink gimlets, and take pot."

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.380
"Uh, you don't take pot."

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.259
Follow Gus' heroic struggle to get into
a dying girls pants,

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.969
a struggle so difficult he has to read her
favorite book.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.729
"Pain demands to be felt."

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.139
"You're quoting my book!"

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.780
Score her a meeting with its reclusive author,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.820
and exploit a cancer charity to send them
on a dream vacation, just to get out of the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.040
friend-zone.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.820
"Friends."

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.040
"Friends."

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.500
You earned it, pal.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.180
Say "OK" to a PG-13 film that glorifies
underage drinking,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.620
"I'm tasting the stars."

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.940
life threatening sex,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.220
"I can't breathe."

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.140
And making out in the room where Anne Frank
was abducted, with no consideration for the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.470
people who came there to honor the Holocaust.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.680
Uhhh, not sure that warrants a slowclap but...

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.190
OK?

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.830
So cuddle up for a beautiful finale where
our star-crossed lovers have a moment of true

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.190
happiness together...

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.440
before everything goes to hell.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.750
"What is it?"

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.700
Featuring...

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910
Tough to watch medical emergencies,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.640
heartbreaking hospital visits,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.560
a close friend going blind,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.970
a close friend getting dumped for just for
going blind! The bitch!,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.630
Willem Dafoe being a dream-crushing dick,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.400
"I want you to leave."

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.320
Teenagers with cancer attending their own
practice funeral,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.490
real funerals,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.870
and FOUR different eulogies?!

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:24.060
"You gave me forever within a number of days,
and for that I am eternally grateful!"

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.210
Enough!

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.960
It's too sad!

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.770
Just go to starring!

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.360
Go!

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.280
Starring...

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.380
Oh That's Ansel, He's So Hot Right Now

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.790
Sick McLovin

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.140
Jurassic Mom

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.010
That Guy Who Showed His Butt A Lot on True
Blood

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.340
Douchepants

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.710
and Tewwwbs.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.180
Cancer F*cking Sucks

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.980
"You put the thing that does the killing right
between your teeth but you never give it the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.950
power to kill you."

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.140
He totally stole that from Gettin' Jiggy Wit'
It.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.500
"Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba. I just bite
it, it's for the look, I don't light it."
