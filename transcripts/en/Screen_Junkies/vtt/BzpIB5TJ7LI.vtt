00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.590
From Martin Scorsese, the legendary director
of that movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.360
that other movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.200
and also these movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.770
Comes the Wolf of Wall Street
...starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.800
Strap in for the last film you’d ever want
to watch with your grandparents...

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.580
Featuring an average of 3.16 “f*cks” per
minute

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.250
"F*cking 30,000 f*cking dollars!"

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.590
"F*cking half-wit!"

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.590
"Beni-f*cking-hana!"

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.260
"Absolutely f*cking not!"

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.270
"F*ckity f*ck f*ck!"

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.309
But f*ck it: we can do better than that!

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.620
Leonardo Di-f*cking-Caprio stars as a f*cking
hot young rich guy who

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.079
hangs out on f*cking yachts and has sex with
f*cking models

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.969
...basically Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.649
Watch as he yells his way to an Oscar nomination

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.680
And watch as the guy who stole Best Actor
stops by to pound his chest

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.100
right in Leo’s f*cking face.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.200
F*ck you!

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.540
Rejoice at the triumphant return of fat f*cking
Jonah Hill

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.850
and recoil at the triumphant debut of his
fat f*cking penis.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.660
Thrill as he tries to shed his image as the
funny fat guy in comedies... by becoming the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.930
funny fat guy in a Scorsese movie.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.330
"You're alright... we all love you..."

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.619
"Shut the f*ck up!"

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.969
Experience the film that critics f*cking slammed
for glorifying the lifestyle of a corrupt

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.670
Wall Street stockbroker...

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.340
Even though he’s a f*cking miserable wife
beating drug addict who loses his business,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.450
family, and fortune.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.060
They do make qualludes look f*cking awesome,
though!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.590
"Get off the phone!"

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.590
"Hahaha!"

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.820
"Jesus Christ, Jordan!"

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.210
Witness Scorcese break out every Scorcese-ism
in the book, like

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.590
a f*ck-ton of tracking shots

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.250
f*ckin’ Voiceover

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.930
"See that humongous estate down there? That's
my house."

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.240
f*ckin' freeze frames

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.120
multiple f*ckin’ wives

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120
having a huge f*cking hard on for

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.220
And an ambitious criminal main character with
a short temper whose pride is ultimately their

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220
downfall.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340
"I ain't goin' nowhere!"

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.170
So settle in for a movie that’s all about
f*cking excess,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.800
from the 3 hour run time

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.040
To the f*ckin cursing

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.080
"F*ck this, sh*t that, c*ck, c***, a**hole"

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.900
To all the people in suits listening to Leo
talk

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.260
To shots of those same people going

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.690
f*cking

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.100
