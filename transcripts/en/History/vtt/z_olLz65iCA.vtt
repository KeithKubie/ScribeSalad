00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.705
MAN 1: Physically,
I am exhausted.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.608
You've done everything
you wanted to do out here,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:12.445
you've tried everything
in your mind to get

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.382
food, and have mostly failed.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.450
MAN 2: Made it outside.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.320
First time I've been outside
in four days, first time

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.989
I've put my pants on in three.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.792
But I'm still I'm motivated,
I'm still here for a purpose,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.427
and I still have
fight left in me.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.535
MAN 1: At this
point I'm not sure

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.772
how long I can go like this.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:43.276
I'll have to tell my wife, my
kids, even though daddy tried

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:47.380
his best, he couldn't do it.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.352
MAN 2: I'm sorry
and I'm not sorry,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.788
but the remainder
of the footage will

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.823
probably look a lot like this--

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.760
20-hour days of me laying
here becoming common.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.861
MAN 1: And as much
and I'm trying

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.931
to keep my family in
mind and do it for them,

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.499
I'm starting to have
thoughts in my brain

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.135
that if my wife could
see me right now,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.771
it would bring her to tears, and
she would beg me to come home.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.241
[music playing]

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.144
[wind whistling]

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.088
[slow steady beeping]

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.060
[truck engine humming]

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.981
MAN 3: How you doing?

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.490
I've been better
I'm all right.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.992
I'm just-- I'm just beaten down.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.528
I've run all the
tread off my tires.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:13.566
And I'm sitting in there looking
at my shelter, and I can't--

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.702
I can't lay in there
another night by myself,

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:19.672
and be freezing, and
hungry, and by myself.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.241
I just couldn't do it anymore.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.748
I mean, I may have hit my
limit about a week or so ago,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.217
but I just kept trying
to dig in and think

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.353
about the goals I was here for.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.189
And today I sunk to a low I
just didn't think I could pull

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.058
myself back out of this time.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.561
And I know what I
really really need

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.230
is waiting for me on the
other side of the world,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.565
and I just really want
to get back to that.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.037
This is not how I
saw myself leaving,

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.807
but I'm not hanging my
head about anything.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:59.512
I battled myself way further
than anybody thought I could.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.881
I'm definitely not the
prototypical survivalist.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.983
I'm that dude that
sits over in accounting

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.818
and does the spreadsheets.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:10.423
I'm not the guy that goes out
in the wilderness for 56 days.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.226
I achieved a great deal,
and I'm really proud of it.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.931
The hardest thing
about this experience

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.767
was it's definitely
a battle of the mind.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.435
I've spent a whole lot
of time in Patagonia

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.971
breaking down interior walls.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.941
That's the reason that I
got out of there quickly.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.677
Mongolia enhanced the
way I was when I came,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.680
so when I came here now
I felt a lot more open.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.682
I was a lot more
open in speaking,

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.550
I was a lot more
open in my feelings,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.186
and in the end where I
look at where I ended up,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.521
I'm extremely happy.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.123
I feel cleansed,
and new, and open,

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.558
and ready to go
back to my family

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.294
and show them a
different type of love.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.230
