00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:13.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once a quaint outpost
in the middle of nowhere, Las Vegas,

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.396
Nevada has become a
sprawling metropolis,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:21.026
and its public school system
is still bursting at the seams.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:23.476
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Clark County is the
sixth largest school district

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:24.426
in the United States.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:29.256
We have approximately 270,000
students today, and we,

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.476
on the average, open
up a school a month.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.576
It's kind of insane to be able
to keep up with the growth.

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:39.276
We have 6,000 people moving in
to the Las Vegas Valley a month,

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:43.146
from all over, and so
our big push is literacy.

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:45.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At C. P.
Squires elementary,

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:48.946
90 percent of incoming
students don't speak English.

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:51.976
For principal, Carol Lark,
literacy is paramount..

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:55.546
&gt;&gt;Carol: [Speaking in Spanish]

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.536
&gt;&gt;The only hope our Hispanic
youngsters have, I believe,

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:01.516
is to master English, and then
they will truly be bilingual.

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:05.406
I say to the parents, it's your
responsibility to teach them Spanish

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:06.656
in your home, and please do that.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.716
And it's our responsibility
to teach them English,

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:12.626
and then they will have all
their world open to them.

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.066
And so I really believe that poverty

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.296
and second language are
absolutely not any excuse

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.736
for not teaching children to read.

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:23.036
&gt;&gt;All: A, B, Cs and counting, one--

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers here use a
variety of techniques to teach

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.366
and reinforce English
language skills,

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:30.846
from memorizing months
with The Macarena..

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:34.056
&gt;&gt;All: May, June, July,
August, September--

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To learning letters
with computer technology.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.196
&gt;&gt;Computer: Find the balloon, T, T.

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:40.046
&gt;&gt;Carol: What I guaranteed
each teacher was

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.126
that if they would just
slow down their speech,

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:44.306
and teach everything
three different ways,

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.736
that these little five
year olds are like sponges,

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:47.736
and they will pick it up.

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.186
And the brain research
supports that dramatically.

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:53.226
The first year it was very
scary, because we weren't sure.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:54.796
Now we're positive.

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.786
We know that it works, and
when they go into first grade,

00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:00.906
we have 98 percent mastery
of all letters and sounds.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:06.256
[Singing]

00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:07.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What did you pick?

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:08.826
Baby animals.

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:12.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school has received
several grants and partnered

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:16.456
with local business to create
innovative programs like this one,

00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:19.646
where students get to take
home a new book each month.

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:22.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There you go,
that's yours to keep forever.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:26.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's also an annual
district wide storytelling festival

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:28.566
for fourth through seventh graders.

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:30.336
&gt;&gt;Student: She settled
it on the last one,

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:32.796
and then it was just
right, and then broke it.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.186
&gt;&gt;Ardelle: Storytelling
is a way for kids

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.666
to sequence events in their head.

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.136
It also helps them to
develop sentence structure

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:44.486
and story structure, a
beginning, middle and end.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:47.736
&gt;&gt;Student: She saw the
three bears and screamed,

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:48.976
and went running out the window.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:54.936
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking in Spanish]

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:59.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Squires also promotes
literacy with after school programs

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:01.976
for preschoolers and their parents.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Number one,
John is a student.

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:07.576
&gt;&gt;Carol: We knew we had to meet
the needs of the entire family.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.886
So by working with the middle school
across the street, the parents go

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.226
across the street and get
English lessons, which is going

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.356
to enhance their future,
in terms of job potential.

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:20.056
&gt;&gt;Doctor: Here, put
this under your tongue.

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With the after
school programs, and the opening

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:27.206
of a new medical clinic on campus,
the school has become the heart

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.106
of the community, offering parents

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:31.806
and their children
everything from literacy..

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Stray cats are
often lonely without--

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:34.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To line dancing.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:37.646
&gt;&gt;Leah: The biggest thing,
building self esteem.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:40.726
They didn't think they'd
be able to perform.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:42.576
First of all, they couldn't
even do the first dance.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.586
They said, we can't do this.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:46.536
Now they know three dances, we're
working on the cowboy hip hop.

00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:51.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While grants pay
for many school programs,

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:54.796
private citizens have also stepped
forward to support their schools.

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:55.676
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Well,
howdy, boys and girls,

00:03:55.676 --> 00:04:00.666
welcome to the McCaw's School Mine.

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:04.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Community volunteers
built and financed the School

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:07.096
Of Mines, and McCaw
Elementary School,

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:10.526
where visitors can explore
a replica of a silver mine.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:13.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is
the model of our mine.

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:15.326
You can see a chute going up.

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:18.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Tours in the school of
mines address curriculum standards

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:20.596
in history and earth science.

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:24.246
&gt;&gt;Student: It has all
these levels, called steps.

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:27.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in hands on
activities like panning for gold--

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Pick up the pan,
let the ripples away from you.

00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:33.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: McCaw students teach
visitors about the science of mining.

00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:38.016
&gt;&gt;Cheyann: Over here
are some little drills.

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:42.546
&gt;&gt;It's very interesting
that I get to talk to kids,

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:44.946
and I get to teach them
what they want to learn.

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:50.396
And they are always looking
at it, and talking about it,

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:51.596
and saying how cool it is.

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.716
&gt;&gt;Bill: I really think we
ought to mount it on something

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:55.526
that would look authentic.

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:58.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Local architect
Bill Snider,

00:04:58.026 --> 00:04:59.806
volunteered to design the mine.

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:03.826
&gt;&gt;Bill: We went to Disneyland, and
we went to the, "Indiana Jones" ride,

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:07.566
where they created the illusion
of taking people down underground

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.816
and into a cave situation.

00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:14.126
So we sort of figured out,
with the resources that we had,

00:05:14.186 --> 00:05:17.726
what we could do, and it's kind
of funny, because the company

00:05:17.726 --> 00:05:19.616
that built the, "Indiana Jones" ride,

00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:22.886
actually did the work
here for us as well.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.546
And what we did for them to do that,

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:27.686
we had several kids help us
write pleading letters to them,

00:05:28.086 --> 00:05:31.196
and we took the model that we built
of this, and we set it in their lobby

00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:33.936
for about a month, before they
said, "Okay, we surrender.

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:34.736
How can we help?"

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:44.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Other privately financed
learning environments include this

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.716
tropical biosphere at
Vandenberg Elementary School.

00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:48.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What layer

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.506
of the rainforest do we
call that really high up?

00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:52.296
&gt;&gt;Student: The canopy?

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:53.506
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The canopy, and the--

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:56.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But faced with
staggering construction costs,

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:59.376
and the lack of qualified classroom
teachers for every subject,

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:03.306
the district has decided to beef
up its virtual infrastructure.

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:06.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Let's do a sound check
real quick, and if it's all right,

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:08.006
then we'll go ahead and get started.

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:09.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Clark County,

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:13.886
more than 4,500 students take
online courses in everything

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:17.156
from English One, to
AP Micro Economics.

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:19.706
&gt;&gt;Jhone: The Clark
County School District has

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.016
about 15,000 new students every year.

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:27.156
If we provide education at a
distance, the student can be

00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:31.016
in their home learning
without us providing a brick

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.206
and mortar four walls building.

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:35.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, Alyssa said no.

00:06:35.276 --> 00:06:35.956
What do you think, Alyssa?

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:38.906
&gt;&gt;Alyssa: I would think maybe 50.

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:39.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:44.286
&gt;&gt;Jhone: Online curriculum allows
the student, if they have a question,

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:47.946
to go ahead and e-mail the teacher
right then, and not wait their turn

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:51.006
as you do in a regular
classroom, so the teachers

00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:54.656
and the students both feel
that there's more communication

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:58.196
in an online classroom when they're
not physically sitting together,

00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:00.826
than they do in a face-to-face
classroom

00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.076
with a teacher and 35 students.

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:04.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have the
full period to do this.

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:08.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many of his students
math teacher Mike Patterson now

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:13.666
splits his instruction time between
real classrooms and virtual ones.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.566
&gt;&gt;Mike: The particular design of
this distance learning program,

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:20.466
made me feel like I was still
teaching, that I was still a part

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.086
of the classroom experience.

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:26.616
Students, they log in, I'm able
to interact on a live whiteboard

00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:30.976
with the students, they raise their
hand, and I see them in front of me.

00:07:31.166 --> 00:07:33.256
We speak through the mic.

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:34.546
&gt;&gt;If you look at your work,

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:37.156
see if you should have been adding
instead of multiplying them.

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:41.006
&gt;&gt;I want them to get as much as
they can of a classroom, but online.

00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:43.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Giving
students the flexibility

00:07:43.136 --> 00:07:45.096
of scheduling courses online,

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:49.716
also addresses another district
challenge, a high dropout rate.

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:52.826
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Las Vegas is different
than anywhere I've ever been,

00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:56.386
because think about it, if you drop
out of school here, people have jobs.

00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:59.086
And just think, you
can earn between 40

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:01.286
to 80,000 dollars parking cars here.

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:02.896
&gt;&gt;Joe: Okay, have a good night.

00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:05.366
&gt;&gt;Carlos: So it's a
very unique situation.

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:08.966
&gt;&gt;Joe: I think I can make up to 130
dollars a night on the weekends,

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.266
maybe, and it's real easy,

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.566
because you don't need the
education to make the money.

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:16.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now Joe Patterna can
pursue his high school diploma

00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:20.866
and keep his night job, thanks to
a unique high school that caters

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:23.676
to students who have
dropped out in the past.

00:08:23.676 --> 00:08:26.566
&gt;&gt;Kay: We have kids that work
early morning construction,

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:31.616
we have kids that work late night
at casinos, and so the high school

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:34.366
that goes from two in the
afternoon to nine o'clock

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:36.756
in the evening is perfect
for these kids.

00:08:37.146 --> 00:08:39.456
They don't have to
give up their education

00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:42.376
if they need money,
and they need a job.

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:47.746
We have a day nursery with our
school, which allows the mother

00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:52.056
and the father to come to
school and have their child

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:54.196
on campus and safely cared for.

00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:57.106
&gt;&gt;Student: Does this have
anything to do with the negative

00:08:57.106 --> 00:08:58.886
and the positive, when
you've got to find the--

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:00.496
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Sure does.

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:03.086
&gt;&gt;Kay: I'd say the one thing
that is common about all

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:06.376
of our students is they're
very graduation focused.

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:09.196
They want to graduate,
they want to be successful.

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:12.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Success for the Clark
County School District means

00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:16.396
overcoming illiteracy,
stemming the dropout rate,

00:09:16.396 --> 00:09:21.026
and addressing the needs of
15,000 new students each year.

00:09:22.016 --> 00:09:24.856
The key, says, Garcia,
is embracing change.

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:27.976
&gt;&gt;Carlos: We have an advantage
over everyone in this country,

00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:31.376
because with the growth,
everybody expects change.

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:35.096
You don't need a rearview mirror
when you're going the speed of light.

00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:37.116
And here, we're going
the speed of light.

00:09:37.116 --> 00:09:40.156
We're always building, we always
have to train people, hire people.

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:43.056
Our cup is not empty, it's
overflowing with good things.

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:44.226
Can we still improve?

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.086
Absolutely.

00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:49.806
And I think that educators have to
be critical of our own practices,

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:54.206
and we can adapt programs
and be at the head of it,

00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:58.526
and instead of reacting, pro-act
to create things for the future,

00:09:58.586 --> 00:10:00.296
and boy, you can't beat that.

00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:02.916
It doesn't get any more
exciting than that right now.
