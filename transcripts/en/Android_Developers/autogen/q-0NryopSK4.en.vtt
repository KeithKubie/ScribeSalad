00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
in launch window so here's a couple
things

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:49.690 align:start position:0%
things
 

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.290 align:start position:0%
things
be<00:08:49.870><c> touching</c><00:08:50.260><c> on</c><00:08:50.380><c> quickly</c><00:08:50.680><c> that</c><00:08:51.490><c> will</c><00:08:51.730><c> give</c>

be touching on quickly that will give
 

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
be touching on quickly that will give
you<00:08:52.570><c> some</c><00:08:52.900><c> thought</c><00:08:53.170><c> starters</c><00:08:53.650><c> and</c><00:08:53.890><c> things</c><00:08:54.370><c> to</c>

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:54.670 align:start position:0%
you some thought starters and things to
 

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.870 align:start position:0%
you some thought starters and things to
check<00:08:54.880><c> out</c><00:08:55.200><c> maybe</c><00:08:56.200><c> I'd</c><00:08:56.500><c> say</c><00:08:56.800><c> one</c><00:08:57.580><c> or</c><00:08:57.730><c> two</c>

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
check out maybe I'd say one or two
 

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
check out maybe I'd say one or two
months<00:08:58.120><c> before</c><00:08:58.630><c> you're</c><00:08:58.840><c> launched</c><00:09:01.830><c> so</c><00:09:02.830><c> maybe</c>

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.070 align:start position:0%
months before you're launched so maybe
 

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.830 align:start position:0%
months before you're launched so maybe
we<00:09:03.820><c> can</c><00:09:04.030><c> make</c><00:09:04.180><c> you</c><00:09:04.360><c> a</c><00:09:04.390><c> hundred</c><00:09:04.660><c> percent</c>

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
we can make you a hundred percent
 

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
we can make you a hundred percent

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%

maybe<00:09:10.230><c> way</c><00:09:11.230><c> more</c><00:09:11.470><c> confident</c><00:09:11.890><c> than</c><00:09:12.040><c> you</c><00:09:12.130><c> have</c>

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
