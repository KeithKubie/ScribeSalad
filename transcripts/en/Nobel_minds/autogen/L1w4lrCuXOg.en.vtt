that's clearly one of the big ones and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
that's clearly one of the big ones and
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889
that's clearly one of the big ones and
it would be just as important to find

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
it would be just as important to find
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110

bigger breakthrough if all our theories
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920
bigger breakthrough if all our theories
are wrong then if we find out that we

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
are wrong then if we find out that we
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230
are wrong then if we find out that we
were right all along other big

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
were right all along other big
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.550

we could measure it and probably will

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
we could measure it and probably will
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.340

there isn't even a possibility of
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.280

that really well we have the hope of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
that really well we have the hope of
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740

if we can find out these things there
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.460
if we can find out these things there
are possibilities of breakthroughs in

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
are possibilities of breakthroughs in
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.770
are possibilities of breakthroughs in
all of them and then of course there's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
all of them and then of course there's
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.520
all of them and then of course there's
the possible

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
the possible

think of which will become even more

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
think of which will become even more

think of which will become even more
surprising so I think we have to wait a

surprising so I think we have to wait a
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.030
surprising so I think we have to wait a
