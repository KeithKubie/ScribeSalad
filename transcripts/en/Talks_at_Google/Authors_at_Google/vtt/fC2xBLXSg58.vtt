[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.777
DANIEL JACKSON: This project
is, in a sense, an MIT project

00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:10.610
through and through.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.320
It's about MIT.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.790
It was produced at MIT.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.040
It was funded by MIT grants.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.400
But in some sense, I think
there's nothing about MIT

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.130
here at all.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.015
This is a universal project
about a universal problem.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.390
But I have to start by telling
you a little bit about MIT

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.630
and where this
project came from.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.432
So as many of you probably know,
MIT's a rather quirky place.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.390
It's probably one of the
only universities that

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.660
has an annual piano
drop, and this

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.660
is a picture I took of
the piano drop in 2015,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.580
and there is the
piano about to fall.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.200
And MIT is a quirky place, full
of fun things and fun people

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.250
mostly having a good time.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.780
But it's also a
highly competitive,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.890
high-pressure environment.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.223
I'm sure none of you have
ever been in a place like that

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.430
before.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.950
And that can exact its costs.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.177
And in 2014, 2015 we had a
terrible mental health crisis.

00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:09.260
That makes it sound as if
it came out of the blue.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.170
The truth is it had been
brewing for a long time,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.230
but it really came to
a head in that year.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.600
In 2014 in particular, four
students took their lives,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.430
and my colleague Seth
Teller died that summer too.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.160
At the same time, there
were smaller crises

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.370
happening everywhere-- just
the burden of depression

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.349
and anxiety at MIT was
increasing year by year.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:36.890
And I had noticed
this in my courses.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.200
I would have, typically, when I
started teaching, maybe none--

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.950
maybe a couple of students who
had some issue during the term.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.230
By 2014, 2015, I was often
having 5 or 10 or more students

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.361
coming to me during the term.

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.610
They would normally come and
say that they wanted help

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.070
with a problem set, and then
once we sat down and talked,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.910
it became clear that they had
no difficulty understanding

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.480
the material.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.160
They had no lack of talent.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.100
They were just suffering
from, basically,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.150
a major episode of
anxiety or depression

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.950
that was preventing them
from doing their work.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.510
And this is actually a
shot of my office window

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.220
in the lovely Stata Center.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.610
And so this got me thinking
about how pervasive depression

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.360
and anxiety at MIT had become
and how big a problem it was.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.520
And then in the spring of 2015,
when this photo was taken--

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.330
as you know, this is what spring
often looks like in Boston--

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.000
it was a really terrible time.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.722
In a week in March 2015, two
students took their own lives

00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:44.430
in the same week.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.020
And the shock of
these two deaths

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.450
really galvanized
the entire community,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870
and the MIT newspaper published
a series of articles--

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.490
a remarkable
editorial-- about how

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.440
it was time for us to
face up to this issue,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.740
but also two articles
in particular that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.300
really struck a chord with me.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.950
One was this article--

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.700
a guest column by a sophomore
called Karen [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.700
about her own
experience with dealing

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.270
with her own depression.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.220
The other was an article
by Professor John Belcher,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.670
that it was actually
republished--

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.850
it had actually been
published previously in 2012,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.430
and that article had been
inspired by an article,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.380
I think, in 2010 by a student
whose name was Grace Taylor.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.590
And one of the things that I
noticed about these articles

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.130
was that they produced
an extraordinary wave

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.930
of consolation--

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.310
particularly in
the student body,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.840
but I think in the
institute as a whole.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.410
And there was something
just incredibly reassuring

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.530
about people
standing up in public

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.330
and saying this
is a real problem,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.215
and I've experienced
this problem

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:50.840
and I've grappled
with it, and I'm here

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.020
to tell you that I came out
the other side of the tunnel.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.129
It's possible to do that.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.170
And this got me thinking.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.930
It got me thinking in particular
about how important it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.580
was that they had their
names on these articles.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.140
I suspect at Google,
too-- at MIT,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.790
we have what you might call--

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.300
what I like to call a
geek libertarian culture,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.520
and that culture often
puts what I think

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.450
is actually an inappropriate
value on anonymity.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.690
Because a lot of people are
very concerned about privacy,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.060
they think anonymity is
somehow a good thing in itself.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.530
And what I noticed was that when
people used anonymous forums

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.590
to talk about things that
they weren't happy about,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.510
it didn't have this
consoling effect.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.090
And I came to actually
think that perhaps it had

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.770
exactly the opposite effect--

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.660
that there's actually
something that

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.700
reinforces stigma about
expressing yourself

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.060
anonymously.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.410
Anyway, so like many
other people at MIT,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.820
I was wondering
if anything could

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.430
be done to respond to
these horrible tragedies

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.050
and to do something
to help our culture.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.870
Anyway, so as [INAUDIBLE]
mentioned, I'm a photographer.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.170
And every summer, I'd
been going off to Maine--

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.460
to the Maine Media
Workshops up in Camden,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.800
which is this fantastic
place that has--

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.000
I don't know-- 30, 40,
50 photography workshops

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.110
every summer.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.910
They last a week long,
and you study them

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.690
with one photographer and
it's a remarkable experience.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.390
And I'd been going
for many years,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.530
and that summer I studied
with a photographer

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.266
called Joyce Tenneson.

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:27.390
And one of the great things
about these experiences

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.660
is that you learn not only
a lot about their style

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.120
of photography and
their aesthetics

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.612
and the way they go about
constructing an image,

00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:38.070
but you also get to learn about
their life and the way they

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.910
think about their career.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.050
And Joyce said something
that was really remarkable

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.370
and that really
struck me very deeply.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.720
This is a picture I took
of Joyce that summer.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.170
These are pictures that
Joyce is famous for.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.240
She'd been a commercial
photographer,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.250
and then she had really moved to
becoming a very successful art

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.080
portrait photographer.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.400
She produced a book
called "Light Warriors"

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.150
that these photographs
were taken from.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.860
And as she put it, she came to
realize that she was spending--

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.470
or had spent--
much of her career

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.310
making photos of beautiful,
young women in their 20s.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.860
And it suddenly
occurred to her that she

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.290
was a woman in her 70s--

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.090
early 70s, I guess.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.070
All her friends were
in their early 70s.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.840
And yet she was still taking
pictures of women in their 20s.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.450
And it occurred to her that
maybe what she should do

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.232
is take pictures of beautiful
women in their 70s instead.

00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:38.940
And so what she did
was she did a project

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.898
that she called "Wise
Women" where she traveled

00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:43.080
across the country,
and she took pictures

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.230
of women between the
age of about 50 and 100.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.290
And she produced that book,
and it was a huge success.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.100
In fact, by her telling,
it was the biggest success

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.330
of all her books.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.730
This anecdote really
got me thinking,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.080
and I started wondering
who are my wise women?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.870
As a photographer, if I
was going to come home,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.110
as it were, and find the people
who were my obvious subject

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.840
rather than going to the
traditional art subjects,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.440
what might that subject be?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.050
And I realized--
well, that subject

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.450
would have to be
people at MIT who

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.260
were in the midst of this battle
against depression and anxiety.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.079
So I came back from this
workshop totally fired up

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.620
with this idea that I was going
to do a project where I would

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.800
make a gallery of photos of
people who had experienced

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.910
depression and anxiety.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.069
And my idea was that by
showing this gallery,

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.860
it would signal to
people that this was not

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.984
something to be ashamed of.

00:07:35.984 --> 00:07:37.530
On the contrary,
this was something

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.680
to be proud of-- to have
faced this enormous challenge

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.500
and to have endured it, and
become even enriched by it.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.290
And I hope that
in so doing, this

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.810
would bring some consolation
and encouragement to people

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.300
who are suffering
from these conditions,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.600
and it would also destigmatize
it for everybody else to see.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.020
And I also had this
feeling that these people

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.980
had something to teach
us all, because one

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.259
of the ironies of the way
that we'd been thinking

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.050
about mental health is
that a lot of people

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.140
were talking about mental
health, a lot of the experts--

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.150
the psychiatrists,
the psychologists,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.470
the anthropologists and so
on, and the administrators--

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.820
but the people who actually
experienced depression

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.500
and anxiety, they
didn't seem to be

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.990
playing a part in this
conversation at the institute

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.770
level.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.300
So I wrote to the
three people who

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.770
had published those articles--

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.730
Karen the sophomore, John
Belcher the faculty member,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.039
and Grace, who had written
the original article.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.049
She'd moved on to
Harvard Med School.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.600
And I asked the three of
them if they'd be Guinea pigs

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.309
and if they'd let me
take photos of them

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:42.480
as the beginning of a
gallery of photos of people.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.740
And to my delight, they
accepted very enthusiastically.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.640
So I started by making
a photo of Karen,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.160
and my original idea was to
make environmental pictures--

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.650
whatever part of MIT they chose.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.861
And that turned out to
be a pretty crazy idea.

00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:59.610
This was taken in the
library, and it just

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.730
wasn't the right kind of
private, quiet atmosphere

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.690
to do that.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.500
So I switched to doing more
traditional studio-like shots.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.520
So this was the photo that
I ended up making of Karen,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.830
and I took photos of
the three of them.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.600
And then at the end of--

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.040
that was 2015.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.900
At the end of the
year, with the help

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.630
of some extraordinary
undergraduates,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.170
we pitched to "The Tech--" which
is the MIT school newspaper--

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.990
the idea of doing
a series in which,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.590
every week, we would put
up a picture of somebody

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.400
and an excerpt about their life.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.710
And I should say originally
I was going to just

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.510
have a little caption
associated with the picture,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.310
but as soon as I heard Karen's
story and the remarkable things

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.562
she had to say, I
realized that there

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:49.020
was an opportunity, essentially,
for a whole mini biography

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.560
here.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.210
So that's what the
project became.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.760
It became, basically,
a portrait in words,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.100
and a portrait in an image.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.420
And at the beginning,
I was excited about it,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.610
but I have to
admit-- having agreed

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.700
to produce one every
week of the term,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.850
you can imagine I thought-- wow,
that was a pretty crazy thing

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.630
to do.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.760
What the heck was I thinking?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.100
They'll never come.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.000
But they did come.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.830
And in fact, enough came not
only to publish one every week,

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.040
but to get a few that I didn't
even have room for in the term,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.040
and that's eventually what led
to this book that you've seen.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.780
So typically this is
what would happen.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.560
I would take a photo.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.090
This is the wonderful
Victor Morales, whose story

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.950
is completely remarkable.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.980
And then the MIT newspaper
published the photo.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.780
They usually gave us a full
page, which was wonderful,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.520
with the story around it.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.700
The story is an entirely
verbatim accounting

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.990
by the subject.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.070
It was only minimally
edited by me.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.315
I basically recorded the story--

00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:59.050
I recorded their words, had
them transcribed, and then

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.900
just minimally edited it,
removing "ums" and "ahs"

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.940
and punctuating it,
and occasionally moving

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.940
things around to preserve
the chronological order

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.260
of the story.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.700
But aside from that, every
word in these stories

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.720
was spoken to me.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.750
And then what I did
was I put up posters

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.990
all around campus that said
if you have a story to tell,

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.530
please come and tell it to me.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.740
And lots of them came.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.990
And by the end of
that first term,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:31.510
I'd interviewed 18 people,
which included mostly students--

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.690
interestingly, mostly
women-- a couple

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.280
of professors, and a bunch
of administrative staff.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.150
So that was what
happened that term,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.010
and then I decided that I--

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.800
actually, to be honest, I
had hoped from the outset

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.494
that this would become
a book, because I

00:11:49.494 --> 00:11:51.160
had a sense that this
was something that

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.040
could be valuable beyond MIT.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.390
And so I proposed this
book to The MIT Press,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.450
and they agreed to publish it.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.020
I was very lucky that
two MIT organizations

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.050
helped fund this project.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.930
As a photographer, I wanted
to have a lovely book printed

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.850
on very nice paper with a
very nice binding and so on,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.860
and that's incredibly expensive.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.420
So the book probably should
have cost $60 or $70,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.080
but the MIT Council for the
Arts gave me their biggest grant

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.510
of that year.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.220
And then I got another grant
from the MIT MindHandHeart

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.140
Innovation Fund,
and that allowed

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.740
us to subsidize the printing so
much that the book is actually

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.270
relatively cheap--

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.520
I think very cheap by the
standards of this kind of book.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.360
So they're typically going
between about $20 and $30

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.520
a copy depending on Amazon's
current algorithmic state.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.850
And then a wonderful thing
happened the following--

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.820
actually, this was
before the book came out.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.740
An alumnus approached
me and said

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.350
that he was very
interested in giving

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.080
the book to new students
at MIT, and he proposed

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.460
running a Pi Day Challenge.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.070
That's our MIT annual
fundraising day.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.440
And we ran that
challenge collaboration

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.900
with MindHandHeart, which
is the mental health

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.250
initiative on campus, and
amazingly raised about $15,000

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:15.756
that day.

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:17.380
And that was enough
money to buy a copy

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.030
of the book for every student.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.420
So we gave a copy of the book
to every incoming student

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.780
the following year.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.440
And since then, it's been a
really fun and exciting project

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.380
of basically taking
these remarkable stories

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.900
of these extraordinary
people on the road

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:40.240
and trying to
proselytize for the book.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.330
We've had some wonderful
media engagements.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.450
And what, for me, has been
particularly wonderful

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.908
is that on every
occasion when I've

00:13:46.908 --> 00:13:48.920
been invited to go
somewhere, I've always said,

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.700
well, want my subjects, not me.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.570
And so they've
always come with me.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.040
This is in the BUR studio
for "All Things Considered"

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.920
with Lisa Mullins, and
that's Emily Tang and Victor

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.680
Morales, who are both
extraordinary people.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.430
And actually, BUR
then played it--

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.951
"All Things Considered" was
just a local production,

00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:11.450
but then they actually played
it nationally on "Here &amp; Now."

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.100
So that was really terrific.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.250
And then we had a really
extraordinarily exciting

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.710
opportunity that "PBS NewsHour"
decided to come to MIT

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.560
and talk to us about the
story, and they actually

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.596
played two long segments
two nights in a row.

00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:30.970
This is the
classroom I teach in,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.370
and here are three of the
students being interviewed

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.410
by Jeff Brown, the
arts correspondent.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.090
We also had a very entertaining
interview with Jim Braude,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.280
who some of you might know
from "Greater Boston."

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.380
He's also on an NPR
show with Margery Eagen,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.140
and he's a very funny guy.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.790
This is Haley on the left.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.490
They're cracking up
after she calls him sir,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.120
and he exploded in amusement,
claiming that nobody had ever

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.695
called him sir before.

00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:02.660
And I'd like to show
you a little video

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.200
in which the subjects
speak for themselves.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.610
It starts with audio
excerpts from the interviews.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.490
And as you'll see, people
really said some amazing things

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.170
about their life experience.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.130
And then it includes some
photographs that I took during

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.050
the sessions-- many of
them not in the book--

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.660
along with excerpts--
verbatim excerpts--

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.660
from what they told me
during the interviews.

00:15:38.474 --> 00:15:39.140
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.360
- I committed a week before.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.810
I said yes to MIT, and then
she has this heart attack

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.190
in front of me.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.200
So I went through with my plans.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.910
This is what I'm
doing in the fall.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.810
I'm going to college.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.024
And people die all the time.

00:15:54.024 --> 00:15:55.940
Everyone has to deal
with their parents' death

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.830
if they have parents.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.140
This is something
I can deal with.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.660
And I think that was a mistake.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.750
- Especially because
when someone dies,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.340
you don't know, necessarily,
until they're dead.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.770
You just take for
granted everything

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.420
that they had been holding up.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.124
- So over those
next two days, I was

00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:19.290
feeling absolutely terrible.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.430
I had [INAUDIBLE] to do.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.480
I was already
getting really down,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.695
and I really wanted
to commit suicide.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.070
And I just said this to the
guy I was doing therapy with.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.410
And he was like, hm, I'm
going to have to go talk

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.236
to someone about this.

00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:35.610
And as soon as he said that,
as soon as he left the room,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.235
I'm like, fuck.

00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:38.530
I'm getting transported.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.224
And sure enough, I sent
a message to Danny.

00:16:41.224 --> 00:16:42.640
I'm like, Danny,
I think I'm going

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.765
to get sent to [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:45.730
- He stood at the
foot of my bed.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.110
He had a clipboard,
a stethoscope.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.690
He had a main tank,
a white coat--

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.080
all the accoutrements
of authority.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:04.540
And he said, Mr. Kaiser,
your operation was a success.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.910
But I'm sorry to tell you
that you'll never walk again.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:15.180
Now, when he said that to me,
what I said inside my head was,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.569
fuck you.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.170
What I said to him was,
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.069
- The big goal was to walk.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:29.240
And I remember when I
first stood on my legs,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.330
my hamstrings hurt so bad.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.090
- I always knew there
was something wrong.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.630
There's a better way
to live than this.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.440
I just didn't know where
it was or who knew that.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.640
I just knew that I just
felt crappy all the time

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.310
when I was a kid, when
I was a teenager, when

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.005
I was a young adult.

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.380
- And then I went
to my therapist

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.160
and I said, is this how
normal people feel every day?

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.910
And she said, yes.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.490
And I said, well, I had no idea.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.040
- My medication mellowed me out.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:17.190
And it was a good thing,
because I wasn't having

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.980
the extremes of the depression.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.070
So it helped me survive.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.980
- The most useful thing
I learned from being away

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:35.400
was that you can
always ask for help,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.800
and there will always be
someone to help you here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.080
DANIEL JACKSON: So I wanted
to close by telling you

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.390
a few things that I
thought I learned from what

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.010
my subjects taught
me, and then talk

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.801
about what I think some
of the implications

00:29:11.801 --> 00:29:13.740
are for a place like Google.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.040
So the first thing I
learned from talking

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.030
to all these people is how much
unhappiness is in the world.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.990
And I was reminded of this
remarkable comment from

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.400
the Hasidic master, Rabbi
Nachman of Bratslav--

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.660
who's widely thought to
have been bipolar himself--

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.070
who basically said that
the principle that we all

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.410
have to deal with is to
struggle with all our strength

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.070
to be happy.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.160
That happiness is
not a natural state,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.760
but it is human nature to be
drawn to darkness and sadness.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.692
And sadly, I think,
that's really true.

00:29:45.692 --> 00:29:47.900
And so happy people aren't
people who are just lucky.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.756
They're people who work at it.

00:29:49.756 --> 00:29:52.130
The second thing-- which you
won't be surprised to hear--

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.810
is that competition
really hurts.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.710
Everyone told a story of coming
from a high school where they

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.800
were the top of 1,000
students, and they come to MIT,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.840
and they're just the
same as everybody else.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.970
You hit MIT, and it's
not enough anymore.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.050
I learned that depression--
that major depression--

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.840
depression is really
on a spectrum,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.117
and that major depression is
a terrible, terrible disease.

00:30:17.117 --> 00:30:19.700
I mean, I knew already that it
wasn't just like being a little

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.640
bit unhappy, but the people who
suffer from major depressive

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.550
episodes go through
something that many of them

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.880
describe as much worse
than physical pain.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.040
And it's a terrible and
debilitating disease

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.920
that robs you,
more than anything,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.570
of your resilience,
which makes it very hard.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.290
I learned that relationships--
for all these people,

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.490
they all explained how their
relationships to other people

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.470
were really at the
center of their recovery,

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.930
and Lydia in particular
said this remarkable thing,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.210
which has stuck in
my mind ever since.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.820
She said you don't
realize what people

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.670
are doing in your life,
what roles they're playing,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.922
sometimes, until they die.

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:58.880
And you don't know what
you're holding together

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.900
in other people's lives.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.720
You might not know that you're
the glue holding together

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.420
so much, because you
take yourself for granted

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.857
like we take other
people for granted.

00:31:07.857 --> 00:31:09.440
So anyway, there are
many other things

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.550
that I learned from
the book, and I

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.425
hope you'll get a chance
to read the stories.

00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:15.260
I think they all have
really remarkable insights

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.390
into the nature of
life and diversity

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:21.230
and ideas for how
to achieve happiness

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.420
in the face of obstacles.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.940
I want to say a few things
about resilience at work.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.100
The first is that these
conditions, if we're just

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.250
talking narrowly about
anxiety ans depression

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.210
and bipolar-- these
are universal.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.750
And so this is just
applying the normal rate.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.810
So if I'm assuming an almost
90,000 people at Google,

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.630
that means you have about
18,000 people at Google who

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.890
have a severe anxiety disorder,
about 7,000 who've experienced

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.650
major depression,
and about 3,000

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.550
who have bipolar disorder.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.630
So this is basically everywhere.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.210
It's pretty clear what
causes depression.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.550
We don't know, in any
individual, what the cause is,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.010
but in pretty much
all my stories,

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.440
there's some combination of
a genetic predisposition,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.620
traumatic experiences, and
then a stressful life--

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.890
not enough sleep and exercise,
poor social connectivity,

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.470
and ultimately a
loss of self-worth--

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.280
which seems to be the trigger
that, for a lot of people,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.280
really takes them to
a quite ruinous state.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.460
So I've thought a little
bit about strategies

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.090
for resilience.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.340
First of all, to
value the whole person

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.280
and to be very careful
about judging people

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.140
on one dimension--
the way they perform

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.010
on the team, what their program
ability is, whether they're

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.270
intelligent only in a logical
sense rather than their larger

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.120
emotional intelligence.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.390
Secondly, we always
pay lip service

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.210
to rewarding the team
players, but do we really

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.400
reward the team players
who actually build up

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.870
the other members of the team?

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.490
Who aren't just
team players because

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.230
of their outsize
contribution to the end

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.330
result, which is
different from really

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.350
building the team itself?

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.460
And I think one that I've
come to realize more and more

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.490
as really critical is
that an organization needs

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.310
to encourage people to be
able to acknowledge and talk

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.530
about their own vulnerabilities.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.150
A friend of mine,
who's been educating me

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.810
in organizational
matters, shared with me

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.040
this extraordinary paper.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.221
It's quite old, and I
think it's from 2014--

00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:24.470
by Robert Kegan and his
colleagues at Harvard Business

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.640
School.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.820
And the contention
of this paper is

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.620
that if an organization
actually encourages people

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.480
to be open about
their vulnerabilities

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.350
and their weaknesses
and their obstacles that

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.260
sit in front of them,
then it will actually

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.930
be able to dramatically
not only change

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.670
the environment in
the organization,

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.470
but also to give people
opportunities for growth

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.760
and improvement in their
lives and their careers

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.690
that they wouldn't have
had in an organization that

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.150
tends to want to
smother any talk of all

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.180
these vulnerabilities.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.250
And this, to be honest,
is the biggest flaw

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.280
that I see in our
culture at MIT.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.310
We're always rah-rahing
and saying we're so great.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.130
We're so amazing.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.590
We have all these
cool inventions.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.199
We have all these
amazing people.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.780
And the truth is
that can actually,

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.420
ironically and paradoxically,
be a very negative message

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.880
to a lot of people, because
the first thing it says

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.760
is if you're not on this list of
people who have been mentioned

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.260
as the great,
fantastic people, then

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.340
there must be something
wrong with you.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.040
But it's also
saying subliminally

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.639
if you feel, in any respect,
that the environment isn't

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.380
perfect and that
you're not perfect

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.889
and that you can't see a
direct path to huge success,

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.080
then there must be something
very wrong with you.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.330
And that doesn't empower
people to be their best,

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.210
and that doesn't actually
create an organization in which,

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.600
rather than feeling jealous
or disappointed and angry

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.101
and bitter about not
being the best achievers--

00:34:51.101 --> 00:34:53.600
it doesn't create an atmosphere
in which people can actually

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.260
work together to
achieve great things.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.900
On the subject of
team players, I'm

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.420
reminded by this
wonderful comment

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.190
that Jerry Weinberg made--

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.740
famously-- in his old
book on "The Psychology

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.130
of Computer Programming."

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.240
And he was talking more in
the context of programming

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.520
in its various
problems, but I think

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.360
it applies very much in
the emotional sense of team

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.021
players.

00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:19.020
And here's what he said.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.010
He said if a programmer is
indispensable, get rid of him

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.836
as soon as possible.

00:35:23.836 --> 00:35:25.460
And I think the only
way I would update

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.010
this is by saying get rid of
him or her as soon as possible.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.650
But in every other
respect, I think

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:36.290
this is just as powerful and
relevant as it has ever been.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.870
Strategies for
personal resilience--

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.600
I think people have obviously
written a lot about this.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.400
To me, there are three that
I found particularly helpful

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.340
and that, reflecting on
what my subjects told me,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.210
I think were influential
in their lives.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.290
One was to know what
your purpose is.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.090
And in particular,
for your purpose not

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:01.400
to be a particular GPA or
getting a particular fellowship

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.040
or getting your internship
at Google in the summer

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.210
or getting a certain promotion
or having a certain salary

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.270
or being at a certain
rank in your organization.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.780
None of those are a purpose.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.400
Those are all means to an end.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.820
And if you can have a real
sense of what your purpose is

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.410
in life, that's a much truer
way to resilience and happiness.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.970
The second thing
is that people who

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.670
are open to other people
about their own fears

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.130
and vulnerabilities
end up being,

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.959
I think, much happier and much
more resilient themselves.

00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.500
Partly because they
share the burden,

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.870
partly because other
people respond in kind,

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.217
and they realize
that the world is

00:36:38.217 --> 00:36:39.800
both a more vulnerable
place, but also

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.780
a kinder and more supportive
place than they imagined.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.680
And I think the other thing
is that one of the things

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.720
that we all do--

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.803
well, I won't say we all
do it, but I've certainly

00:36:48.803 --> 00:36:49.970
done enough of it myself--

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.540
is we all play certain parts
and we all try and pretend,

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.630
to some extent, to be
people that we are not.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.530
And particularly if
you're the kind of person

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.392
who works for Google or MIT, you
could get pretty good at that.

00:37:03.392 --> 00:37:04.850
And then if you're
intelligent, you

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.470
can sometimes play that game.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.320
But ultimately it comes back to
bite you, because ultimately,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.520
if you don't project yourself
for who you really are,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.560
then there will come a
point at which you're

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.680
doing things you don't want
to be doing and presenting

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.490
yourself in a way that
doesn't feel right.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.920
So I thought I
would ask you-- what

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.670
do you think the biggest
challenge is that you face

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.280
in the tech industry at
Google, or societally,

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.930
organizationally,
and personally,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:38.270
and what are the best strategies
and opportunities to address

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.504
that?

00:37:40.504 --> 00:37:42.170
I'll just show my
last slide, which is--

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.740
I have a little resilience
postcard that I send out

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.480
about once a month,
and I'd be delighted

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.730
if you'd like to
subscribe to that.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:53.280
And you can find out more
about the book there.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.040
But at point, I think
I will stop talking,

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.625
and I'd love to hear from you.

00:37:56.625 --> 00:38:00.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:01.364 --> 00:38:03.280
AUDIENCE: Doesn't quite
address your question,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.560
but do you have plans to
continue this project,

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.754
or are you done with
this form of [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:07.754 --> 00:38:09.670
DANIEL JACKSON: I'm
trying to figure out how--

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.045
I don't think I'm going to
continue it exactly like this,

00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:15.250
but I'm looking at
working with some people

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.970
on some exciting projects
of a similar nature.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.410
I did a little
project, actually--

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.270
which now seems quite timely.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.790
When the travel ban came
out I did a little project

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.540
of a much smaller project
of photos and stories

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.010
of MIT immigrants and
their life stories.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.190
And I'm talking to some
women at MIT about,

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.490
perhaps, doing some #metoo
stories at MIT and beyond,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.400
but we'll have to see.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.200
I'm suddenly very
intrigued by the idea--

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.980
the role that this kind of
photography and storytelling

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.670
can play in changing
people's attitudes.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.152
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:38:53.152 --> 00:38:53.860
I had a question.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.040
You gave this book out to a
whole class of MIT students.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.210
That's a huge data set.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.480
Did you happen to notice
any effects of that

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.960
of increased self-reporting,
increased seeking for help,

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.400
increased freedom and peer
mentorship in the following

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.030
years when that class went on
to be sophomores and juniors?

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.940
Did they carry that on back
to the new incoming freshmen?

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.270
DANIEL JACKSON: That's
a great question.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.420
And it was only last year, so
we don't have any data yet,

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.010
but I know that
MindHandHeart is very

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.750
interested in tracking that.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:27.430
I'm not sure how this
particular intervention would

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.070
be decoupled from other ones.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.570
I do have some anecdotal
reactions, a couple of cases

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.650
where students have sent very
moving messages to participants

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.220
in the book about how
their stories helped them--

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.315
in sometimes quite
surprising ways.

00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:47.700
And so that's been
quite interesting.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.232
But you're right.

00:39:49.232 --> 00:39:50.690
You're asking a
very good question.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.820
I don't really have a
good answer to that.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.390
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
more of the portraits that you

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.520
took were of women than of men.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.460
Do you have any idea
why that might be?

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.830
DANIEL JACKSON:
Well, my guess is

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.320
just that women are
more open and are more

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.180
willing to share these things.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.820
One of the very interesting
things was that the beginning

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.280
of the project, when I sat
down with John Belcher--

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.840
the professor--

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.890
who was one of my Guinea
pigs at the start,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.550
he said to me, for old
fogies like you and me,

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.207
this is easy, because
we have nothing to lose.

00:40:21.207 --> 00:40:21.790
We're tenured.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.850
We can't be fired.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.850
He said, you'll have no
trouble getting faculty.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:30.670
But students, they've got
their careers ahead of them.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.040
The idea of social
media being covered

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.270
with their early
troubles in life--

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.590
they're not going to want that.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.240
And the fascinating thing was
it was exactly the opposite.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.670
By and large, with the exception
of two or three people,

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.170
no faculty members
wanted to talk to me.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.030
And I know for sure
there are many, many,

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.890
many who have experienced
depression and anxiety.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.040
And students, completely
to the contrary,

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.030
had a extraordinary
openness and candidness.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.140
In fact, Krista Tippett--

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.181
I don't know if you know.

00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:03.340
She's the host of this
wonderful NPR show, "On Being."

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.980
She once commented--
actually, in an interview

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.950
with danah boyd talking about
the internet and social media

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.250
behavior-- how she thinks it's
almost a new kind of ethic

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.790
that the way young
people behave in sharing

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.610
has an openness and generosity
that's really unprecedented.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.280
And I certainly
experienced that,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.000
and I experienced it
particularly from these women

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.790
more than men.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.599
I tried to, actually,
get more men.

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:29.890
One of my colleagues-- a
female colleague-- said to me,

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:30.580
it's all women.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.660
Can't you get some men?

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.280
And I said, I'm trying.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.510
But yeah, so I don't
know what it is,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.990
but there's certainly a
gender difference there.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.115
AUDIENCE: Hi, I missed the
first half of your talk,

00:41:43.115 --> 00:41:45.073
so I'm so sorry if you've
already covered this.

00:41:45.073 --> 00:41:47.140
But how do you think that
we can teach resilience

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.444
to university students?

00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:50.110
Do you have any
strategies for that that

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.630
work in the classroom, or
that can work in our meetings?

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.760
DANIEL JACKSON: Sure.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.900
I think the main way that
we can teach resilience

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.040
is by example, is by the way
that we talk about the goals

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.130
that we set for ourselves
and for each other,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:12.070
and by making a culture in
which we actually value openness

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.640
and encourage people to
share their struggles,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.970
with the idea that that's
the way you become better.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.530
Just one thing that
occurred to me--

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.720
I realized that for
a long time, I'd

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.880
been saying we should value
people for who they are,

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.240
not because they've
won certain prizes

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.770
or have certain possessions.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.050
And then one day,
sitting in a lecture,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.110
seeing someone introduced,
the person said, and I'd

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.330
like to introduce you to my
colleague so-and-so who's

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:42.340
won A, B, C, and D prizes
and whose article is

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.240
the most cited, blah,
blah, blah and so on.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.270
And I realized I've
done that myself,

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.580
and that completely
undermines any claim

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.880
that these proxy measures don't
matter when you're constantly

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.220
sending a subliminal
message to the students

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.830
that actually, these are
the things that count.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.570
And so I think we
need to change the way

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.670
we talk about these
things and I think

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:08.260
we need to try and value people
in a much more holistic way.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.380
I think that would produce
the biggest effect.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.970
I think we also
somehow simply need

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.220
to crank down all the pressure.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.120
I'm not sure how to do that, but
we certainly need to do that--

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.720
give people time to mull
things over a bit more.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.940
AUDIENCE: One of the
things is by the time

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:31.330
they get to college, there's
already some processes in place

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:34.960
and some experiences that
these kids have, and is there

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.850
any things that you guys are
looking into around earlier

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.900
experiences that can help
students coming in already

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.614
prepared with resilience?

00:43:46.614 --> 00:43:48.530
DANIEL JACKSON: Whoa,
that's a great question.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.990
I don't know.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.870
Yeah, I'm not part of the team
that worries about this at MIT,

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.370
but I think you're
absolutely right.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.670
It's often well-established.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.520
But in my experience talking
to the subjects of my book,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.560
it's often in early
childhood that they

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.380
had traumatizing experiences,
and those experiences then

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.700
come up much later.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.370
They get triggered by their
experience in university

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.910
or in the workplace.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.240
And so I think you'd
have to go way back.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.280
So I suspect we also--

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.250
I mean, I have a--

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.520
and I'm sure you've read
the famous Jean Twenge

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.770
article in "The Atlantic"
about mobile devices

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.720
and those extraordinary
graphs that

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.390
show the advent of the
iPhone almost perfectly

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:30.100
correlated with huge
drops in social activity,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.530
whether it's driving
cars, going out

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.230
with friends, sexual
intercourse-- everything

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:38.650
plummets in 2009 with
the advent of the iPhone.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:41.410
And just anecdotally,
I think a lot of people

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:45.340
are feeling that devices
are a very large part

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.530
of the alienation that
young people feel,

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.519
and that that's dramatically
exacerbating the problem.

00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:52.810
So maybe as a technologist,
one of the things we can do

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.670
is work on that.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.070
AUDIENCE: So you would
ask what does Google

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.180
do to help its employees?

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.950
And I still remember
the orientation--

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.900
that they point out
that you will feel

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.970
overwhelmed in the beginning.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:04.820
This is expected.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.860
This is normal.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.800
Everybody gets this.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.970
And even some points later
on, you'll get to the point

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.010
where you feel like,
what am I doing here?

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.710
And pointing out that there
is a lot of imposter syndrome

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.140
at Google, and
pointing out that it's

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.390
normal-- which is very
helpful, especially when you're

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.955
starting out.

00:45:19.955 --> 00:45:21.580
DANIEL JACKSON: Yeah,
that's very good.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.440
I think just setting
expectations.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.150
I think that's one
of the things that's

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.500
very demoralizing for
people who somehow--

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.190
particularly if they came from
an experience early in life

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:33.307
when everything was easy, and
then suddenly it's not easy.

00:45:33.307 --> 00:45:35.140
And maybe if they could
just be told-- maybe

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.585
we need to do a
better job of that

00:45:36.585 --> 00:45:38.710
as well-- telling people
it's not going to be easy,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.649
and here are the
challenges you'll face.

00:45:40.649 --> 00:45:42.190
AUDIENCE: I know
you said you weren't

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.290
part of the overall
program that deals

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:48.100
with the application of
this, but have you changed

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.960
the way you teach
within your classroom

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.114
at all, incorporating
any of these ideas?

00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:53.780
DANIEL JACKSON: That's
a great question.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.519
Have I changed in
my own classroom?

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:58.060
So I have to first admit that
that makes me feel tremendously

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.340
guilty, because one of the
things that we did was we

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.540
tracked the amount
of time people

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.581
spent on the programming
assignments in my course

00:46:03.581 --> 00:46:06.880
this term, and I don't dare to
tell you what the numbers were.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.507
But suffice it to say it was
a classic MIT Firehose course.

00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:14.590
Who would have thought
that learning Node.js could

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.511
take so long and then you'd
need more than three days to do

00:46:17.511 --> 00:46:18.010
that?

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.530
I mean, who would imagine?

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.150
And it turns out you need
more than three days.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.970
And so I think I've
done, actually,

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:27.130
pretty badly in my
own course-- certainly

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.580
in terms of cranking down the
pressure, and that's something

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.640
I know we really
need to work on.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.030
I think I've become better--

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:38.680
I hope in a couple of respects.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.050
One is that when a student
wants to come and talk to me,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.190
I never, ever, any
longer say, well,

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:46.717
have you checked with the TA?

00:46:46.717 --> 00:46:48.300
Because I'm worried
that they're going

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.850
to ask me something about
installing Node or something

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.280
that is really a
technical question

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.109
that the TA can do
better than me anyway.

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:57.150
And I've come to realize
that when a student goes

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.670
to a professor, they
have a reason they

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.980
want to talk to you,
and that often is not

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.930
what the pretext is.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.930
I think I've also
learned that when

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.790
people come to talk to you--

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.260
I had a very MIT-ish attitude,
engineering attitude,

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.300
that you have to solve
people's problems.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.490
So someone's feeling sad
or depressed or whatever,

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.520
you have to know what to do.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.160
You have to say, well,
here's what you do.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.880
Get more exercise.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.330
Get more sleep.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.246
Go see a psychiatrist.

00:47:22.246 --> 00:47:23.460
Go see a psychologist.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.020
Go to MIT Mental Health.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:29.280
And I came to realize how
incredibly misguided this is.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.650
First of all, you can't
solve their problems.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.139
But secondly, they don't want
you to solve their problems.

00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:35.430
They're smarter than you think.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.900
If they wanted you to
solve their problems,

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.640
they wouldn't be coming to a
computer science professor.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.530
They could be going
to a psychologist.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.490
The reason they
come in to you is

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.590
because they want you to
listen to their problems.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.690
And so I've realized
that actually, it's

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.910
a lot easier than
you might imagine.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.980
And I think, as
faculty, we just need

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.990
to realize that sometimes
our students just

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.210
need us to listen to them
and to pay attention.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.270
So I hope I've improved
in that respect.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:03.360
But in the structural respects
of the class, I have to admit--

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.700
that needs some work.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.640
And it's also particularly
challenging in a large class.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.272
I think in a small
class it's a bit easier,

00:48:13.272 --> 00:48:14.730
because you can
build relationships

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:15.624
with the students.

00:48:15.624 --> 00:48:17.040
I should say one
exciting thing is

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.577
that some of the counselors
from MIT Mental Health

00:48:19.577 --> 00:48:21.660
have been doing a freshman
seminar this fall using

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.990
my book on resilience, so
I'm very interested to see

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.581
how that will turn out.

00:48:26.581 --> 00:48:28.080
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to comment--

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.955
because I brought this
up in a Google context

00:48:29.955 --> 00:48:33.510
before-- that I think the
partner skills or resilience

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.430
are compassion and humility.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.140
And for people
who don't struggle

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.450
with any kind of mental
illness or barriers,

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.210
if we can teach them to be more
compassionate and more humble,

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.177
it supports the
work of the people

00:48:44.177 --> 00:48:46.260
who need to be resilient
because of various things

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.176
they'll struggle with.

00:48:47.176 --> 00:48:49.440
So just something
to think about.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.480
I taught freshman CS
for a couple years,

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.310
and I specifically
worked with my students

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.140
on compassion, humility,
and resilience.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.000
And so I think we
would all do well

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.780
to consider those three values
in our workplaces and courses.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.280
DANIEL JACKSON: I think that
that's a great point, actually.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.620
And one thing to mention
is that at MIT, there's

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.917
been an explosion of
these failure activities.

00:49:06.917 --> 00:49:09.000
There was an undergraduate
one and a graduate one,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.300
both of which I was
honored to participate in.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.669
I guess I was honored
to be chosen as someone

00:49:14.669 --> 00:49:16.710
whose failures were
considered major enough to be

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.411
able to talk about them.

00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:20.160
But I think that's
actually a great move--

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.055
having people talk very publicly
about failure and about how

00:49:23.055 --> 00:49:24.180
they've coped with failure.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.390
And I also think it's actually
interesting pedagogically,

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.540
because I think that people
who are good at something

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.236
are normally-- it's
not that they just

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:34.110
have a natural ability
and they get it right.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.526
It's that they've
actually learned

00:49:35.526 --> 00:49:37.382
how to deal with things
when they go wrong.

00:49:37.382 --> 00:49:39.090
I mean, that's what
crafts are all about.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:41.910
It's not that you can measure
perfectly and cut perfectly.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.950
It's that you know
how to adjust things

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.780
when things are slightly off.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.542
And I'm reminded
of how I finally--

00:49:48.542 --> 00:49:50.250
I had been working
with my daughter, when

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.960
she was a teenager,
for many years trying

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.150
to help her get into math.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.820
And she was so fearful of it and
so convinced she was bad at it.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.900
And finally, I got her to
admit that she actually

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.660
thought that if she
was good at math, then

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.790
the answers would come
back to her immediately.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.544
She wouldn't need to think hard.

00:50:07.544 --> 00:50:09.960
And what I explained to her
was that might be true for one

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.360
in a million, really,
really extraordinary,

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.747
off-the-charts math
students, but actually,

00:50:14.747 --> 00:50:16.830
most of the students who
are really good at math--

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.080
they're good at it because
they're good at the thinking,

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.070
and they're not frightened
to do the thinking.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.310
And that what she needed to
do was get over that fear

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.090
and realize that
it isn't natural.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.420
It doesn't come naturally.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.000
And that if you can
sit with the problem,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.660
then you can actually
make progress.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.410
And I think that made
some change for her.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.150
So I think that this idea of
us all being a bit more humble

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.040
and explaining that
things are hard--

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.590
I think can also be
pedagogically very powerful

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.460
as well.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.390
Thank you all so much.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:44.730
It's been a pleasure being here.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:48.080
[APPLAUSE]
