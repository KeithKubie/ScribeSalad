got to move it to the up time event is
 

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.750
got to move it to the up time event is
going on it's just not working

00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760
going on it's just not working
 

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.060
going on it's just not working
maybe it's moving because look I'm out

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.070
maybe it's moving because look I'm out
 

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:09.850
maybe it's moving because look I'm out
of frame again it's not weird oh my OMG

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:09.860
of frame again it's not weird oh my OMG
 

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:15.470
of frame again it's not weird oh my OMG
what's happening oh it's trying to focus

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480
what's happening oh it's trying to focus
 

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.090
what's happening oh it's trying to focus
or it's Oh

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:17.100
or it's Oh
 

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.130
or it's Oh
oh my god right I think when we play

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140
oh my god right I think when we play
 

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.530
oh my god right I think when we play
clips it's trying to focus on this or

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540
clips it's trying to focus on this or
 

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.430
clips it's trying to focus on this or
something it's just not it's oh my gosh

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440
something it's just not it's oh my gosh
 

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:35.150
something it's just not it's oh my gosh
oMG I don't know what going on sorry

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160
oMG I don't know what going on sorry
 

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.250
oMG I don't know what going on sorry
about that anyway back to cousin fucking

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260
about that anyway back to cousin fucking
 

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.140
about that anyway back to cousin fucking
now you have it completely wrong when

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:39.150
now you have it completely wrong when
 

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.700
now you have it completely wrong when
you say it's okay and now he's telling

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:40.710
you say it's okay and now he's telling
 

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.870
you say it's okay and now he's telling
me you have children that are

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880
me you have children that are
 

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.970
me you have children that are
genetically fine you got all the testing

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980
genetically fine you got all the testing
 

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.790
genetically fine you got all the testing
done sure because like most people don't

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800
done sure because like most people don't
 

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.830
done sure because like most people don't
have to have all the testing them before

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:48.840
have to have all the testing them before
 

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.230
have to have all the testing them before
they decide to start breeding sure the

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240
they decide to start breeding sure the
 

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.870
they decide to start breeding sure the
so he's at a much higher risk for having

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880
so he's at a much higher risk for having
 

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.930
so he's at a much higher risk for having
those genetic abnormalities and I would

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940
those genetic abnormalities and I would
 

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.910
those genetic abnormalities and I would
say this guy is in the smallest

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920
say this guy is in the smallest
 

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.070
say this guy is in the smallest
percentage of people who go we should do

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.080
percentage of people who go we should do
 

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.500
percentage of people who go we should do
that before we reproduce when they are

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:03.510
that before we reproduce when they are
 

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.620
that before we reproduce when they are
first cousins okay it definitely causes

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:06.630
first cousins okay it definitely causes
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.320
first cousins okay it definitely causes
abnormalities oh yeah I mean I don't

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:09.330
abnormalities oh yeah I mean I don't
 

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.910
abnormalities oh yeah I mean I don't
know I don't know I heard somewhere

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920
know I don't know I heard somewhere
 

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.150

especially in relation to royal

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160
especially in relation to royal
 

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.890
especially in relation to royal
marriages that they are married cousins

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900
marriages that they are married cousins
 

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.110

frequently in royal families like way

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:18.120
frequently in royal families like way
 

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.240

back in the day so they do what

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.250
back in the day so they do what
 

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.710
back in the day so they do what
is that but they don't have a lot of

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720
is that but they don't have a lot of
 

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.010
is that but they don't have a lot of
cards in the royal family have more

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020
cards in the royal family have more
 

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.100

genetic issues health problems than

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.110
genetic issues health problems than
 

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.470
genetic issues health problems than
those who do not reproduce within the

those who do not reproduce within the
 

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.840
those who do not reproduce within the
same genetic family but it's not it's

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:32.850
same genetic family but it's not it's
 

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.270

not a for sure target it's not for shirt

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280
not a for sure target it's not for shirt
 

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.610

breeding of course you want to vary the

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520
breeding of course you want to vary the
 

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.120
breeding of course you want to vary the
genetic pool I clearly I understand that

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:47.130
genetic pool I clearly I understand that
 

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.920
genetic pool I clearly I understand that
but I'm saying it's not necessarily at

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:48.930
but I'm saying it's not necessarily at
 

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.310
but I'm saying it's not necessarily at
our town sentence you're not you're not

variances are time yeah and and what

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180
variances are time yeah and and what
 

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.660

this guy mentioned that they had testing

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:56.670
this guy mentioned that they had testing
 

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.190
this guy mentioned that they had testing
done beforehand I think is probably

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200
done beforehand I think is probably
 

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.140

I know that it's also very very common
 

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.800
I know that it's also very very common
in a lot of cultures yes I'm just saying

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:36.810
in a lot of cultures yes I'm just saying
 

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.720
in a lot of cultures yes I'm just saying
that I think I think more people should

not even getting solid it was weak I'll
 

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.110
not even getting solid it was weak I'll
give you yeah why would you do that I

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:03.120
give you yeah why would you do that I
 

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.880
