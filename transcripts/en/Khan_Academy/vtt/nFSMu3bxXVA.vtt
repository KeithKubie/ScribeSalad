00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:03.417
If we have some mass, m,

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:07.379
and it is moving with some velocity,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.506
let's say the magnitude of
that velocity we say is v,

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:15.456
we know that this object
right over here has momentum.

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:17.441
Translational momentum.

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.913
And that momentum, and we
use the Greek letter rho

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:22.005
to represent momentum.

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:25.400
Translational momentum
is defined as being equal

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:30.649
to the mass times the velocity.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.155
This is all a review, we have other videos

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.435
where we talk about
translationial momentum,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.691
and one way to think about it is,

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:42.921
"Well how hard is it to stop this thing?"

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.669
Literally in everyday language you think,

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:47.805
"Well how much momentum
does something have?

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.938
"The more momentum this has
the harder it's going to,

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.247
"the harder it is to stop it in some way."

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.812
And so we know if we wanna get

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:58.476
a little bit more mathematical,

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.100
that if we wanna change momentum,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.668
we have to apply force
for some amount of time.

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:05.979
And so the magnitude of our force

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:11.678
times the duration of the
time that we apply it for,

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:15.151
force times time and
this is called impulse.

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:18.039
And this is once again, all review.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.338
This is equal to change in momentum.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.496
Let me do this in that yellow color.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:28.374
That is equal to change in momentum.

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:30.209
So if you don't have any impulse,

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.212
especially if you don't have any net force

00:01:32.212 --> 00:01:33.491
acting on an object,

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:35.793
its momentum is going to be constant.

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:38.260
You have a conservation of momentum.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.863
And we use that idea in all sorts of

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:43.076
interesting physics
applications in the world,

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:45.236
and especially a lot of
cases using billiard balls

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.020
and whatever else.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.132
So now let's try to take a similar idea,

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:51.579
but go into the rotational world.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.707
So let's imagine you have a mass,

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.091
for the sake of this we're
gonna assume it's a point mass.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.111
So you have a mass there.

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.358
And let's just say it's attached by,

00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:03.510
essentially a massless wire,

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:08.312
to you know, it's just nailed down

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:09.364
right over here.

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:10.668
And so this right over here would be

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:11.948
its center of rotation,

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:13.611
and so you could imagine
if someone applied

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.396
a torque to this mass,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.371
this mass could start
rotating in a circle.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.211
And you can just assume that maybe

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:21.814
it's sitting on a, you know the screen,

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.125
this is kind of a frictionless surface,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.587
there's no air resistance.

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:28.227
And so then it will, if
you apply a torque here,

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.699
it will start rotating.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.915
And so you could think about,

00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:33.004
"Well there might be an idea,

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:34.546
"just as momentum is this idea of,

00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:37.687
"well how hard is it to stop something?"

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.473
You might say, "Well how?"

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:42.682
And this is, stop translating
something from moving.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:44.881
You might think, "Well
maybe there's a similar idea

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:46.474
"of how hard is it for something,

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:50.013
"or how hard is it to
stop rotating something?"

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.506
And you could imagine that
that idea has been defined

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.157
and it has been defined
as angular momentum.

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.010
So let me make this clear,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.763
this right over here is momentum.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.154
And over here we'll talk
about angular momentum.

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:18.482
And actually both momentum
and angular momentum

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:19.757
are vector quantities.

00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:21.930
So here I just wrote
kind of the magnitudes

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.930
of velocity and momentum.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.722
But momentum is a vector
and it could be defined,

00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:29.874
the momentum vector could be
defined as equal to the mass

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.113
which is a scalar quantity
times the velocty.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:34.894
Times the velocity vector.

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:37.545
Now the same thing is
true for angular momentum,

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:39.743
but I'm gonna stay focused on

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:43.586
the magnitude of angular momentum.

00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:45.866
Angular momentum can have
direction as you can imagine

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.849
you could rotate in two different ways,

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.075
but that gets a little
bit more complicated

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:51.449
when you start thinking about
taking the products of vectors

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.377
because as you may already know

00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:54.921
or you may see in the future,

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:56.962
there's different ways of
taking products of vectors.

00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:59.090
But just to get the intuition
of angular momentum,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.017
I'll focus on the magnitudes.

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:03.323
So angular momentum is defined

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:05.346
and the letter used is L.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.105
I did a lot of research
to try to figure out

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:09.537
why it is called L, and I
could not find a good reason.

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:13.337
So in the message board below
if anyone has a good reason

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.159
I would like to know

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.584
why angular momentum is called L.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:22.238
A lot of the best arguments I saw

00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:23.445
is that almost everything else was,

00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:25.246
all the other letters were used up

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:27.333
for other ideas in physics.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.061
But anyway, angular momentum is defined,

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.821
and it's defined very similarly.

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.240
Just as kind of torque
is the thing that can

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.064
change how something rotates,

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.734
and force is the way
that something changes

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:41.400
how something translates it,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.673
and torque is force times distance

00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:47.465
from the center of rotation,

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:49.945
everything in kind of the rotational world

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:52.329
is defined in a similar way.

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:54.625
You kind of take the analogue
in the translational world,

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.704
and you multiply it times the distance

00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:58.633
from your center of rotation.

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.297
So angular momentum is defined as

00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:06.898
mass times velocity

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.484
times distance from the center of rotation

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:16.940
so let's call this distance
right over here, r.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.223
r for radius 'cause you could imagine

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:20.492
if this was traveling in a circle

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:22.380
that would be the radius of the circle.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.041
m, v, r.

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:26.028
Actually let me be a little
bit more careful here.

00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:28.452
It's the magnitude of the velocity

00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:30.837
that is perpendicular to the radius.

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:33.716
Sometimes it might be called
the tangential velocity.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.124
So this symbol right over here,

00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:37.227
this is the magnitude of the velocity

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:38.996
that is perpendicular to the radius.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:43.580
So it would be that
magnitude right over here.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:48.170
This is what we define
as angular momentum.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.238
Now what I will tell you here is,

00:05:50.238 --> 00:05:52.591
just as in the absence of a net force,

00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:54.538
momentum is constant.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.101
We know, and I haven't
shown it to you yet,

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:59.453
I haven't proven it to
you yet mathematically,

00:05:59.453 --> 00:06:01.845
but in the absence of torque,

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:03.925
so if torque is equal to zero,

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:06.171
we'll do torque in pink.

00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:09.194
If torque is equal to zero,

00:06:09.194 --> 00:06:11.565
if there's no net torque going on here,

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:15.069
if the magnitude of
torque is equal to zero,

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.065
then we will have no change.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:26.236
No change in angular momentum.

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:29.412
And we will look at that
mathematically in a few seconds.

00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:30.760
But just from this

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.214
there's a very interesting
thing that arises.

00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:35.062
And something that you might have observed

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.254
at even the Olympics or in other things.

00:06:37.254 --> 00:06:39.164
And this is the idea that you can,

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:41.857
by changing your radius,

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.874
you could actually change
your tangential velocity.

00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:46.340
And as we've seen in previous videos,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.579
tangential velocity is closely related to

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.013
angular velocity.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.806
So let's explore that a little bit.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:57.146
So when we write it in the world where,

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:59.198
well actually you see
it straight out of this,

00:06:59.198 --> 00:07:02.650
if L is constant, if r went down,

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:04.116
so let me write this down.

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.924
So let me rewrite it over here.

00:07:05.924 --> 00:07:08.196
So L, whoops.

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:16.042
L is equal to mass times
tangential velocity,

00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:19.185
or actually well yeah,
tangential velocity,

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:22.445
or the velocity that's
perpendicular to the radius,

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:24.620
times the radius.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.066
Now what happens,

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:27.865
if we assume that this is constant,

00:07:30.463 --> 00:07:32.345
if we assume that there's no torque,

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:33.618
so we're in this world.

00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:35.930
So this over here is going to be constant.

00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:42.544
So what happens if we were to reduce r?

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:46.055
Somehow this wire started
to reel in a little bit

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.405
or started to wrap around here,

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.115
and that's actually a reasonable thing,

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:51.392
you could imagine as it rotates
it starts to wrap around

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:53.587
this thing so the wire gets shorter.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:56.350
So if r goes down,

00:07:57.746 --> 00:08:00.234
and this is constant, the
mass isn't going to change,

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:02.160
Well if L is constant,
mass isn't changing,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.521
r is going down, tangential velocity,

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.181
or the velocity that's
perpendicular to the radius

00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:07.980
is going to go up.

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:14.833
And if we wanna think about it,

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:17.505
we can think about it in
terms of angular velocity,

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:20.545
we know that angular velocity,

00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:22.588
which we would measure
in radians per second,

00:08:22.588 --> 00:08:24.846
we would use the symbol omega,

00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:25.990
omega is defined,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.934
and we go into much more
depth in this in other videos,

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:31.154
as tangential velocity,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.405
the magnitude of the velocity that is

00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:37.056
perpendicular to the radius,

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:38.576
divided by the radius.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.318
Or if you solve for tangential velocity,

00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:47.894
you get v is equal to

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.517
is equal to omega r.

00:08:56.882 --> 00:08:59.342
And so if you substitute back into this,

00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:02.767
really this definition
for angular momentum,

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:07.108
you get angular momentum

00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:11.725
is equal to mass times this times r.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:16.067
So mass times, I'm just
substituting for velocity here,

00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:18.478
times omega r,

00:09:20.153 --> 00:09:22.087
times r.

00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:26.621
Which of course is just omega r squared.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.528
So once again we do the same exercise.

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:31.304
If our radius goes down,

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.001
what happens to our angular velocity?

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.153
Remember we could measure this in

00:09:34.153 --> 00:09:36.449
angles per second or radians per second,

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:38.688
well if this is constant,

00:09:38.688 --> 00:09:40.896
remember we're assuming
that there's no net torque

00:09:40.896 --> 00:09:42.194
being applied to the system,

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:45.521
so we're still in this
world right over here.

00:09:45.713 --> 00:09:47.864
If we assume that this
thing isn't changing,

00:09:47.864 --> 00:09:49.777
but the radius were to change,

00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:52.022
what's going to happen to omega?

00:09:52.022 --> 00:09:54.150
Well omega is going to go,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.190
omega is going to go up.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.817
Now likewise, if the radius got longer,

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:03.025
So the radius got longer,

00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:04.589
what's going to happen to omega?

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:06.217
Omega is going to go,

00:10:06.217 --> 00:10:08.169
omega is going to go down.

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:10.305
So if you reduce the radius

00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:12.313
you're going to start spinning faster

00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:13.929
if you increase that radius,

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:15.903
you're gonna start spinning slower.

00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:17.184
And you have seen this,

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:18.774
or I think there's a high likelihood

00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:19.878
that you have seen this

00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:23.160
probably at the Olympics when
you have seen figure skaters.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.866
Where they might start spinning

00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:26.377
and they have their arms out.

00:10:26.377 --> 00:10:27.498
So when their arms are out

00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:29.218
you could say that their
radius is further out.

00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:30.413
And obviously a figure skater is

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:33.514
a much more complex
system than a point mass.

00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:34.686
You could imagine a figure skater is

00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.641
a bunch of point masses.

00:10:37.656 --> 00:10:39.303
Well you could just model a figure skater

00:10:39.303 --> 00:10:41.105
as a huge number of point masses

00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:41.895
at different radii,

00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:44.311
and you would wanna sum
up their angular momentum,

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.428
but the essence of what is happening is

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:49.605
is when her arm is out

00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:52.509
the average radius when you're calculating

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:55.874
all of the point masses in
her arms and all the rest,

00:10:55.874 --> 00:10:58.066
the average radius is higher.

00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:59.938
And then when she pulls them in,

00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:02.238
when she pulls them in
that radius goes down,

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:05.730
and her angular velocity goes up.

00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:07.424
And you see that. They start spinning,

00:11:07.424 --> 00:11:08.957
and then without applying any torque,

00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:10.277
when they pull their arms in

00:11:10.277 --> 00:11:11.805
they start spinning faster.

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.070
And then if they push their arms out,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.837
once again without applying any torque,

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:16.802
they start spinning slower.
