00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:02.250
What I want to do in this
video is introduce you

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.500
to the idea of Sigma notation,
which will be used extensively

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.780
through your
mathematical career.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's just say you wanted
to find a sum of some terms,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430
and these terms have a pattern.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.830
So let's say you want to
find the sum of the first 10

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.329
numbers.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.320
So you could say 1
plus 2 plus 3 plus,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.280
and you go all the
way to plus 9 plus 10.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.776
And I clearly could have even
written this whole thing out,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.150
but you can imagine it becomes
a lot harder if you wanted

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.480
to find the sum of
the first 100 numbers.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.350
So that would be 1
plus 2 plus 3 plus,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.410
and you would go all
the way to 99 plus 100.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.080
So mathematicians said, well,
let's find some notation,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.330
instead of having to do this
dot dot dot thing-- which

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.090
you will see sometimes
done-- so that we can more

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.640
cleanly express
these types of sums.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.980
And that's where Sigma
notation comes from.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.140
So this sum up here, right
over here, this first one,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.490
it could be
represented as Sigma.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.780
Use a capital Sigma, this
Greek letter right over here.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.840
And what you do is
you define an index.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
And you could start your
index at some value.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.650
So let's say your
index starts at 1.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.660
I'll just use i for index.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.830
So let's say that i starts at
1, and I'm going to go to 10.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.690
So i starts at 1,
and it goes to 10.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.390
And I'm going to sum up the i's.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.920
So how does this translate
into this right over here?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.650
Well, what you do is you
start wherever the index is.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.980
If the index is at
1, set i equal to 1.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.560
Write the 1 down, and then
you increment the index.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.386
And so i will then
be equal to 2.

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:43.560
i is 2.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.390
Put the 2 down.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.290
And you're summing each
of these terms as you go.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.320
And you go all the way
until i is equal to 10.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.920
So given what I just
told you, I encourage

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.230
you to pause this video and
write the Sigma notation

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.580
for this sum right over here.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.220
Assuming you've
given a go at it,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.125
well, this would be the sum.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.500
The first term,
well, it might be

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800
easy to just say we'll
start at i equals 1 again.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.000
But now we're not going to
stop until i equals 100,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.380
and we're going to
sum up all of the i's.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.820
Let's do another example.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:36.620
Let's imagine the sum from
i equals 0 to 50 of-- I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.163
don't know, let me
say-- pi i squared.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.430
What would this sum look like?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.513
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:50.090
and write it out,
expand out this sum.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.920
Well, let's just
go step by step.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.400
When i equals 0, this will
be pi times 0 squared.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250
And that's clearly 0,
but I'll write it out.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.330
pi times 0 squared.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.869
Then we increase our i.

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.910
And, well, we make sure
that we haven't hit this,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.370
that our i isn't already
this top boundary

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.420
right over here
or this top value.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.530
So now we said i
equals 1, pi times 1

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.620
squared-- so plus
pi times 1 squared.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.990
Well, is 1 our top value right
over here, where we stop?

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.490
No.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.670
So we keep going.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.840
So then we go i
equals 2, pi times 2

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.855
squared-- so plus
pi times 2 squared.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.240
I think you see
the pattern here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.890
And we're just going to
keep going all the way

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.650
until, at some point-- we're
going to keeping incrementing

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.280
our i. i is going to be 49.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.660
So it's going to be
pi times 49 squared.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.900
And then finally we increment
i. i equal becomes 50,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.710
and so we're going to have
plus pi times 50 squared.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.010
And then we say,
OK, our i is finally

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.750
equal to this top boundary,
and now we can stop.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.640
And so you can
see this notation,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.360
this Sigma notation for this
sum was a much cleaner way,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.519
a much purer way,
of representing this

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.410
than having to write
out the entire sum.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.510
But you'll see people switch
back and forth between the two.
