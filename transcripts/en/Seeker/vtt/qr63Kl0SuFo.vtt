00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.290
Wireless charging seems so great, I plug this
thingy in and then set this other thingy on

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.290
it…

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.290
BAM power!

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.470
But how the heck does electricity get from
the wall into my phone?

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.430
Hello everyone!

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.580
Trace here for DNews, thanks for stopping
by!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.600
You're probably watching this show via a device
that has a battery.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.340
Laptops, mobile phones, toothbrushes, though…
not this new watch everyone's talking about

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.340
for some reason…

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.040
All these things need charging and for the
moment we're still using cords and plugs for

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040
this…

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.690
Inductive charging isn't new, it's been used
since the early 1990s in electric toothbrushes,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.450
and for surgically implanted devices like
artificial hearts.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.219
You've even heard of this in pop culture!

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.710
In the late 1800s, Tesla was allegedly able
to power light bulbs with no wires, and claimed

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.450
to be able to transmit power from one location
to another with no wires…

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.300
To make it work relies on simple physics.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.790
If you ever wrapped a coil of wire around
a nail and attached a battery, then you know

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.220
the electricity in the battery runs through
the wire creating an electromagnetic field,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.220
or flux.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.940
Do it at home, it's fun and you can use it
to pick up paperclips or whatever.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.711
With that same principle, a coil of wire…
magnet… battery… you can make it go the

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:17.820
other way too.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.810
Spin a magnet in the coil and you'll GENERATE
electricity by taking that magnetic flux and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.970
moving it through that coil to create electricity.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.630
The battery creates a stable electromagnet
because it's direct current, it's going one

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.630
way.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.409
The power from your walls is alternating current,
changes direction 60 times a second -- or

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.200
cycles at 60 hertz -- so the electrons are
moving back and forth -- remember that because

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.730
that's the key to the charging.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.829
Wireless inductive charging gets its name
from that magnetic field interaction, called

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.900
induction.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.830
Inside of the charging pad, and the inductive
charging device are tiny coils of wire.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.759
The pad, being plugged into the wall, is fully
powered -- and the power is cycling.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.329
When the other coils come within a short distance
their flux will interact with the flux in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.299
the device, move the electrons around and
charge the battery.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.000
Chances are, the number of cycles per second
isn't going to be 60 hertz, but like, 5 or

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.349
10, so it doesn't mess up other things in
your house.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.769
Your WiFi network cycles at 2.4 gigahertz
or 2.4 billion cycles per second, so it's

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.109
DEFINITELY not going to mess THAT up, but
with all the radio waves flying around, you

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.109
can't be too careful.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.959
If it's that easy, you'd think it would be
everywhere, but the problem is efficiency.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.379
You waste a lot of power filling up two coils
and letting them talk to each other.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.840
It's SO much better to just plug right in.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.559
The future of wireless charging is unclear.

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.819
It seems like a great idea, but it's still
going to be a short-distance system for a

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.819
while.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.150
In 2006, MIT found if you match the frequencies
of the devices, you can make the power go

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.819
a few METERS -- so if you were in your living
room, and a charger was there -- your phone

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.040
would charge right in your pocket…

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.839
They're working on marketing the technology
now, but it's still not everywhere…

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.879
Mr. Tesla, we're getting there, man.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.549
Speaking of awesome innovations - how about
ones that make flying a little less suckier?

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.389
That happens to be the focus of discussion
on THIS episode of Anyhoo, hosted by my friend

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.389
Catie Wayne.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:31.909
Check it out!

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.419
Back to wireless charging - what would you
want to power wirelessly?

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.670
I'd love to beam power to my TV!

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.589
Then I could put it anywhere!

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.299
Down with cables!

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.879
