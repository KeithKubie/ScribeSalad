00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.050
Everything we've covered so far
dealt in a world of only

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.000
one bank and we all know that
there are more than one bank

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.750
in this world.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.360
Let's see what happens
in that example.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.810
So I've drawn the balance sheets
for three hypothetical

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.660
banks in a world where gold is
the reserve currency and let's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.450
see what happens
in that world.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.210
So let me show you all of the--
so that's the first one

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.090
and that's the last one.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.990
They all didn't fit on the
screen, but just so you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.560
understand and a bit of review
of what we covered in the last

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.840
several videos, in these balance
sheets, of course the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.170
left side are the assets, the
right-hand side, up until

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.490
here, is liability.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.165
So from here to here,
that's liabilities.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:38.910
And what's left over
is the equity.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.960
So in every balance sheet, just
to be consistent, I made

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.690
this blue color equal
to the equity.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.940
Let me write that down.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.830
And just to be consistent, I
made this little orange color

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.830
the building, brown
for building.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.080
And this yellow or this gold
color-- that's actually the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.500
gold reserves of that bank.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.830
And each of these lines, these
divide the various other

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.700
assets of the bank.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.100
In this case, they're just
loans, maybe to different

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.250
entrepreneurs.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.650
And then these green lines
separate the different demand

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.040
deposits or checking accounts
that are with that bank and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.220
then the green-- this filled in
green, for example, in this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.870
middle bank-- that shows
its notes outstanding.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.140
Remember, there's two ways that
you could essentially

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.080
give someone an IOU
from this bank.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.400
One is to say, oh, you have a
checking account and you can

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200
write checks against it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.280
The other way is to issue this
bank note and someone can come

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.010
back later with this bank note
and you should have to give

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.450
them an equivalent
amount of gold.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
So in this middle bank, this
green area, that shows its

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.610
bank notes outstanding.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.630
This purple area in this bank,
that's its bank notes

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.660
outstanding.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.740
And then down here, this
off-white color is its bank

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.700
notes outstanding.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.390
Fair enough.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.540
We've created a world
with three banks

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.550
Now what is the problem here
or, are there any problems?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.840
Well, there are a couple
that I see immediately.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.960
The first is, all of
them might have

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.830
different reserve ratios.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.770
In the last video, I kind of
talked about a world with

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.220
regulation, but let's say in
this world, since every bank

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.020
is kind of a separate
entrepreneur, maybe it was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.130
originally the goldsmith, they
all just made their own rule

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.460
of thumb that if I have this
amount of demand deposits

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.190
based on how my customers act
or whatever or based on my

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.000
liabilities or however it works,
I'm going to keep this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.570
amount of gold.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.490
So maybe this guy's reserve
ratio-- I don't know what the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.140
ratio of this to this is, but
maybe his reserve ratio is 8%.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.650
So for every 100 gold pieces
of demand deposits and bank

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.500
notes, he keeps eight gold
pieces on reserve.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.330
Maybe this guy is 10%.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.370
Looks a little bit better.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.990
Maybe this guy up here is
keeping a 12% reserve ratio.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.460
So there's no consistent
reserve ratio.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.000
So let me write that down.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.180
And there's a couple things
that that might lead to.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.440
Maybe this guy right here, he
was the first bank to start--

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.020
or maybe this guy.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.830
This guy had a 12% reserve
ratio-- and people really

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.120
trusted it for a long time.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.440
Every time they deposited money
and then they came back

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.810
later, they were able
to find it.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.790
He really lent money
really well.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.830
So that there was never any
scare on this bank.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.150
No one ever felt afraid to
keep their deposit there.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.650
But as the banking business got
more and more profitable,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.160
more and more risky people
showed up and this guy only

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.190
has an 8% reserve ratio.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.010
And maybe one day, 9% of their
checking accounts want their

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.750
money back and this guy's
not good for it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.770
This guy up here, the 12% guy,
he knew that 9% could happen.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.770
That on any given day 9% of
your demand deposits might

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.430
want their gold back.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.180
So that's why he kept 12%.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.820
But this guy kept an 8% so he
could get extra interest on

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.890
more loans.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.290
So one day, he can't
give his gold back

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.530
and that scares everyone.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.230
So everyone comes and you have
a run on this bank, but he's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.050
not the only bank.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.430
Everyone starts having less
trust in the banking system as

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.260
a whole and so there are runs
on all of these banks.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.180
And that's unfortunate
for two reasons.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.210
One, these guys were
safe to begin with.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.350
They kept enough reserve
ratio so that people

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.540
could get their gold.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.390
And then the other sad thing
about it is, if this guy just

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.670
needed another 1%-- I keep going
off the video screen--

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.980
if this guy just needed another
1% of gold, he could

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.870
have borrowed it from that top
guy and then you would have

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.540
prevented this whole
banking crisis.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.600
He could have borrowed it
from either this guy

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.100
or that guy, right?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070
If this guy's gold gets depleted
and more people still

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.980
want money, this guy would
clearly rather lend the money

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.090
to this guy as long as he's
still solvent than have a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.525
systemic run on all banks.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.190
Bank runs affect everyone.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.310
So in this world that we're
dealing with right now, just

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.100
one weak link in the chain can
break the whole chain.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.410
If you just have one
irresponsible bank, it'll

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.440
create a bank run on all of them
even though some of the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.350
more capital rich banks could
have lent to the other ones.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.090
And then finally-- and I did
this here and this is a

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.450
situation that we're not
familiar with today, but it's

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.290
a situation that's happened
many times in history.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.740
It happened in the colonies
before we had our

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.170
independence.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.300
Is that you had a bunch of
different banks each issuing

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.450
their own bank notes as
a form of currency.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.660
So this one up here issues the
purple bill, this bank here

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.380
issues a green bill, and this
bank here issues this

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.660
off-white bill.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.770
Besides the confusion, you're
always going to have all these

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.420
exchange rate differences,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.250
You don't know ahead of time--
this guy's the riskiest bank

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.370
so maybe his bills should be
worth a little bit less than

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.390
this guy up here.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.530
But you don't have-- it really
just becomes a big mess to the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.850
economy for someone in a cash
register to keep track of.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.650
In this case, I only have three
banks, but imagine if

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.110
all 13 colonies each had their
own banks that were each

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.510
issuing their bank notes and
you always had to translate

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.230
between them.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.250
And then one bank defaults and
their bank notes are worth

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.780
nothing and you have to
worry about that.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.000
So you have another problem;
inconsistent currency.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.120
Inconsistent paper currency.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.920
And I think you know where
I'm going with this.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.940
So what's the solution
to all of this?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.590
Well, what if there were a way--
and I guess you could do

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.550
this without any extra
institutions.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.190
You could just regulate
reserve ratios.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.960
So that's easy to do.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.830
That's just government
intervention.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.000
Just say, if you want to be a
bank in our world, you have to

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.570
keep at least 10%
reserve ratios.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.680
But we have to think about who
regulates that and who sets

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.100
that reserve ratio, but it's
fair enough that we need

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.000
someone to regulate it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.750
We don't need a separate
institution.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.380
But how could we do this
mechanism where we can

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.370
prevent bank runs?

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.550
Especially when there's
money to lend from

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.270
one bank to the other.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.380
And if we could use a mechanism
that prevents this

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.250
and provides a consistent
currency, then we're all set.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.185
Well, the only way you can
provide a consistent currency

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:12.300
is if you only had one bank
issuing currency.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.970
So let's call that bank
a reserve bank.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.640
There you go.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.900
So let's say these three banks
get together-- all the banks

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.590
in this world get together and
say, let's start a new

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.290
institution where we all keep
our gold reserves there.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.380
So what happens is, this guy,
this guy, this guy, they all

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.215
keep their gold reserves
at this central bank.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.230
And now with these guys,
instead of having gold

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.160
reserves here, what
do they have?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.370
They have checking accounts
with the reserve bank.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.620
Let me write that down.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.800
Let me erase the top of that
balance sheet just because I

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.500
don't want to make
things confusing.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.500
So that's the balance sheet that
our reserve bank now has.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.270
Now what does this do?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.049
Well, it definitely solves that
bank run problem because

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.440
now in this world-- and of
course we're regulating it

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440
now-- and I kind of threw that
out there because this guy

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.530
will be the regulator.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.360
This central bank will be the
regulator, but what you could

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.480
say now-- is if for some
reason-- let's say 11% of

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.490
these demand deposits come due,
11% of these people want

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.250
their money all of a sudden--
this guy, he just has to go to

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.060
his reserve bank account and he
can borrow from one of the

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.520
other players.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.920
The gold is all centrally
in one place.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.320
Now the notes issue-- how
do we solve that?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.320
Well, what if by government law,
from now on only one bank

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.920
can issue bank notes and that's
this central bank.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.470
Let's say this middle guy--
instead of having just a

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.520
checking account, maybe he took
half of it as a checking

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.500
account and half of his gold
deposits, he gets in these

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.960
bank notes of this
reserve bank.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.420
So now these turn into bank
notes of the reserve bank and

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.050
these bank notes of the reserve
bank are the only

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.340
currency that's allowable.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.140
So we've already solved two
problems. We've solved an

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.980
inconsistent currency.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.240
And now think about what
starts to happen.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.820
The reserves of these banks
no longer become gold.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.130
The reserves at the banks that
people actually interact with

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.890
now become these bank notes, the
bank notes of this central

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.310
reserve bank.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.160
And this gold is just sitting in
some big vault someplace in

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.640
this world right now.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.680
So let's just-- I know it's a
little bit disjointed-- so

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.860
reserve ratios.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.840
Now you have a central banking
authority where they all

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.750
chipped in a little bit of
money, created this big vault,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.180
and this central bank dictates
reserve ratios.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.510
It prevents bank runs because if
for whatever reason-- let's

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.820
say on some day all of this
bank's customers get scared

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.390
and want their gold back, this
bank can just go to its

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.020
checking account and borrow gold
from the other banks and

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.410
it'll get transferred to it.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.500
But if you think about it, in a
world where people get used

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:52.630
to enough of this one central
bank note, then people

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.420
probably won't even want
that gold back.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.300
They'll probably start viewing
this one currency as the

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.610
equivalent of gold.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.300
So when people actually want
their money back, they don't

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.500
even have to give gold.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.050
They can just give bank notes,
but there's this one

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.860
consistent bank note now from
this central reserve bank.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.870
Anyway, I think I said the word
central and reserve too

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.720
much, but I will see you
in the next video.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.880
Hopefully it wasn't too
complicated and I think you

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.750
see where this is going.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.110
We'll slowly extend this to
getting off the gold standard

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.900
and how this relates to the
Federal Reserve or central

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.160
banks as we know them today.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.410
See you soon.
