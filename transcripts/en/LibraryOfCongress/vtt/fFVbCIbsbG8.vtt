00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All right.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.350
Good evening, guys.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.650
Thanks for making it out.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.590
We're up now with our
[inaudible] for the night.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.290 position:56%
My name is Michael Cavna, columnist
cartoonist with the Washington Post,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.280
and I write the daily
comic grips blog

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.370
and also did the syndicated
strip [inaudible] comics.com.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.640
It is my true pleasure to
bring an artist here who --

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.080
a graphic novelist --
who is just amazing,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.830
one of the true rising
stars in comics.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.130
Mr. Ed Piskor.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.680
He was self-taught, and he
was [inaudible] to two things

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.290
that in 70's and 80's
culture throwing back.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.690
One was Marvel Comics.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.730
People like Jack Kirby,
this brilliant style

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.420
and the other was hip hop.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.560
And so he's just taken
these twin passions

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.870
and married them beautifully.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.310
He got his big break working

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.720 position:56%
with the great Harvey Pekar [assumed
spelling] who liked his style,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.100
liked what he did,
and they collaborated.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.670
He worked on American Splendor
and The Beats and Macedonia.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.080
And he had his great
book, a graphic novel

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.880
about hacking called the Wizzy
Wig, but he had a vision.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.860
He wanted to do this
thing, not one book.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290 position:56%
And so he began doing hip hop,
telling the true history of hip hop,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.050
and works like a true journalist, a
true researcher, a true historian.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.020
And he does these beautifully,
and he does it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.790
in that awesome 70's
Marvel aesthetic,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.620
and it's just the coolest thing.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.240
And so this year, we got
Hip Hop Family Tree Book 4.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.540
We're getting to the 80's.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.840
We're getting to Dre.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.870
We're getting to Will Smith, and
they're going to keep coming.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.590
And beautifully, and I just --

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.430
I know he'll continue
to show that dedication.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.960 position:56%
Let's hope we see it in other forms.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.030
Let's hope we see it on the screen.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.750
And moderating with him
tonight will be Damon Locks,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.170
Chicago based visual artist,
musician [inaudible] cool projects,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.230
many kinds, but he
works with unheard music

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.160
of the [inaudible] archive
and puts it to animation,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.930
and he also has worked with the
Stateville Correctional Facility.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.030
He's a man of just many talents who
spreads creativity in many forms.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.290
It is my true pleasure to welcome

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.510
to the stage Mr. Ed
Piskor and Mr. Damon Locks.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.250
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.760
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: How's
everyone doing?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.540
Welcome. Thank you very
much for being here.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.600
I am very excited to
be here and talk to Ed.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.400
One of the things I am interested
in doing is finding out --

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.060
since we have an opportunity to
talk to Ed, I want to talk to him

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.560
about the work that he does,
but I also want to talk to him

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.710
about being an artist and
how you make that happen

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.810
and how he got to where
he was today.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.270
Because it's the book fair,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.600
I tried to do something a
little bit extra creative today.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.950
So I broke my questions up into --

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.250
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Sun in my eyes.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.550
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Yeah.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.850
It is bright.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.150
I tried to break my
questions up into chapters.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.350
So I made chapter titles that are
hip hip or comic book related.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.810
So the first chapter is this.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.330
I like hot butter -- I'm like
hot butter on my [inaudible].

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.140
I'm like hot butter on
your breakfast toast.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.440
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Right, right.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.740
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.040
So that's comics, right?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.140
So comics are like hot
butter on breakfast toast.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.580
So comic books were at one
point like a niche genre

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.410
and now we're finding that comic
books like truly are the myths

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.870
of this American culture.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.060
So they're getting a format.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.880
They're getting highlighted in ways

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.360
that as a comic book fan I couldn't
have imagined when I was a kid.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Right.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.190
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: What was your
first experience with comics

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.710
and when did you know that
you wanted to do them?

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I think that -- I was
born in 1982, and the people who are

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.760
around my age, a little
older, a little younger,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.060
we are the last vestige

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.530
of the corner store
newsstand comic book fan.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.200 position:56%
That's basically saying that I would
go to the grocery store with Mom,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.240
and there would be a couple of
spinner racks at the grocery store,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.530
and I could just choose a
couple of Spider Man comics,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.900
X-Men comics, whatever they had.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.090
You could almost be
guaranteed to not be able

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.480
to get two consecutive
issues of anything.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.780
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Exactly.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.320
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Because
it was very sporadic,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.490
but that was my introduction
to the forum.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.380
Most people my age would
probably have this similar answer.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.730
So I've always known comics.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.510
When I was a kid, it
was definitely a stack

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.050
that I had that I didn't buy.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.540
It's almost like my Dad was
preparing for me to like,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.840
"Ah, kids read comic books."

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.560
So while they were buying
onesies and stuff, he was stacking

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.860
up some comics for the future
whenever I was old enough

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.960
to start reading or whatever.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.870
But always read comics.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490
Reading the Marvel and D.C.
stuff, what was really cool

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.990
about that was instantaneously
once you're able to read,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.230
you see the credits page on
the splash page in the front

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.880
of the book, and you could read
that this story was written

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.270
by Chris Claremont
[assumed spelling],

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.380
drawn by John Byrne,
inked by Terry Austin.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.680
So that --

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.410
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Good,
so good, so good.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.740
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: That created the
idea that these things are not made

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.520
by an elaborate computer algorithm,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.210
that actual human beings are behind
these works, and from day one,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.580
I never wanted to be a policeman
or fireman or something like that.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.550
It was always -- always
going to be comics for me.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.150
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So once you knew

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.610
that you would be a comic book
artist even as a young person,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.570
like what trajectory, like did
you make a plan that you're

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.010 position:56%
like this is how I'm going to do it?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.310
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.610
The goal because I was very --
I had a lot of self-awareness,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.060
and I knew that my skills were
weak, I wasn't going to be one

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.790
of these outlier 14-year-old
cartoonists,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.440
wonder kid genius types.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.450
So in a lot of those Marvel comics,
there would be an ad somewhere

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.380
in the middle for the
Joe Kubert School

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.010
of Comic Art and blah, blah, blah.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.160
So that was my goal for my entire
childhood through high school

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.440
to just build a strong portfolio
that was good enough to be able

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.910
to gain entry into that
amazing institution.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:30.330 position:56%
I would read a lot of articles about
-- about the alumni of that school

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.970 position:56%
and how tough it was to get in there

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.290
and how you really
have to be on the ball.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.700
You can never be late
with an assignment

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.620
because they'll kick
you the hell out.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.680
And I was preparing
for all this stuff,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.740 position:56%
putting together this big portfolio,
and I got in, and once I made it

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.790
to campus, I'm looking around me.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.420
I was probably one of the younger
people to ever go to the school

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.100
because a lot of people would take
a couple years off and maybe go

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.220
to real university for
awhile or whatever.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.050
But I quickly learned that you --

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.060
if you have the money to afford
to get in, they'll let you in.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.400
So what I'm saying
is I was surrounded

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.300
by a lot of knuckle heads.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.930
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: But that
was your -- that was your --

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.730
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: My young -- my young
childhood, before that point,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:28.230
working up to that point I easily
made a thousand comic book pages

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.390
that will never see
the light of day.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.730
So I have a bunch of them too.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.770
And it would vary from making my
own stories, which would be very,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.380 position:56%
very -- four or five page things
that were meant to be bigger comics,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.350 position:56%
but after three pages, I would get
a better idea and just abandon that,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.520
go do something else all the way

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.780
up to just copying,
complete comic books.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.590
It's like I drew -- I
copied the first issue

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.900
of Frank Miller's Dark
Knight Returns to just --

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.200
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So you copied?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.420
That was your way of learning
by copying the whole thing?

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.720
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, for sure.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.020
And I had my mother letter it

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.510
because her hand lettering
was nicer,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.570
and when she would read the copy,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.160
she was like laughing
at Frank Miller.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.930
And I'm like, "What are you --
this is serious literature, lady."

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.190
I almost divorced my parents
like Dominique Moceanu,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:20.080
the 1994 gymnast, gold medalist.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.890
I'm sorry.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.190
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: No.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.490
That's okay.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.040
So about storytelling,
comic book storytelling.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.340
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yes.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.640
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.550
So now -- now we realize, as
I said, comic books age huge.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.680
The comic book world is huge.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.570
Major motion pictures are -- every
year there's like ten of them.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.870
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Right.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.210
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: What -- what
can comics do in storytelling

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.970
that other formats can't do?

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.390
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Well,
the marriage of words

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.320
and pictures is nothing
to sneeze at.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.540
The ability to go back a
couple of pages and kind

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.110
of revisit somethings can
be a storytelling component.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.350
You can draw something that
seemed incidental on one page.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:16.040
It could have some payoff five
pages later that makes you go back

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.010
or upon second reading,
you're like, "Oh my goodness.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.040
This object was there
the whole time."

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.240
There are -- there's -- I mean,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.980
we could talk about
that all day for sure.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.780
It's something I really like.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.910
The idea that you're
seeing this whole unit

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:38.720 position:56%
at once is an interesting challenge
to overcome because as a cartoonist,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.720
one of the big puzzles is trying
to capture the reader's attention

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.210
and also their motives
so it's like you want

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.010 position:56%
to lead their eye in a specific way.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.060
And that's not easy to do.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.050
It has a lot of advantages.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:02.710 position:56%
Like I said, my entire life has been
devoted to the art of making comics.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.750
But if we were to be
frank in our discussion,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.120
it's a tremendously
inefficient form of storytelling

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.710
if we want to be honest about it.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:19.220
The amount of time put in to each
page and the yield that you receive

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.860
in terms of how long it
takes to read is very fast.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:32.050
But it's the coolest -- what I like
about it most is it's democratic.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:37.360
It's -- you just need a pencil
and paper to be able to do it.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.690
You don't need a focus group.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.070
You don't need a lot of money
to put a comic together.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.820
So the budget can be endless.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.980
You mentioned the Hollywood movies

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:52.340
that have these multi hundred
dollar budgets or whatever.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.050
To do -- to achieve the
same effect in a comic,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.870
you just need the price
of pencil and paper.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.170
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Right, right.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.230
And people can enjoy it for like
-- well, it used to be 35 cents.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.060
Now it's like $3?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.360
$4?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.290
You remember the old
danger of comics

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.630
when you were reading those
Marvel D.C. things was

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.600
when you would get an issue,
and it would say still 50 cents

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.900
because you know the
very next issue --

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.200
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That
it was going to go up.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.500
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: 55 cents.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.800
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Exactly.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.950
But I have a question
about storytelling.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.250
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yes.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Is that something --

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.150
okay, so when I used to try to
draw comics a long time ago,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.860
I only wanted to draw
the fight sequences.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.160
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.460
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That's
all I wanted to do.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.860
I didn't want to draw them
sitting in their like fortress

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.780
or driving a car or going
to the grocery store.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.580 position:56%
But the question is is
storytelling in the comic book form,

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.010
is that something that you can
learn or did you have already

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.480
like an inate sense of how
to put something together.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.840
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I was talking
with Gilbert Hernandez

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.130
of the famous Hernandez Brothers
who put together Love and Rockets.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.810
I completely agree with
what he said to me.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.210 position:56%
He said that he learned storytelling
from guys like Jack Kirby

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.700
from looking at these
mainstream comics.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:19.580 position:56%
And as human beings, we sort of have
something in our brain that's kind

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.120
of attuned to pattern
recognition and stuff like that.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.660
So on an intuitive sense, I think
if you look at comics long enough,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.860
you kind of intuitively
figure out how they work.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:36.310
And that's an advantage that we
have by reading those X-Men comics

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.220
that are kind of put together by
many people, and then it has to go

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.600
like a gatekeeper to sign off
before the lowly artist gets paid

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.900
or however that works.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.740
And I think it can be learned.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.370 position:56%
The craft of drawing can be learned.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:59.520
When I went to that Kubert
School, there was a guy who knew

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.230
that on an ideal face the width

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.840
of the face is five
eyeballs wide, right?

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.610
And he knew how the clavicle fit

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.870
into the shoulder and
all of this stuff.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.240
His work had no soul to it.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.660
And that's the thing that
is kind of like built in,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.880
that you really can't teach.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.180
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Right.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.060
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: And that stuff is
very evident when you look at a lot

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.900
of comics and you're just
like [inaudible], souless.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.590
It's very clear that the person
is drawing it because they live

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.900
in Brooklyn, and they
have to pay $3000 a month,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.730
and they have to get this
done to keep the lights on.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.500
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: One
of the things just

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.490
out of my own personal curiosity
and luckily I can do that.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.790
I can ask this question.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.170
How to draw comics the Marvel way?

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.760
Did that have any impact?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.060
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Huge.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.490
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay, because
that book as a child, I ordered it

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.040
and waited every single
day since the day --

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.260
the check had not even
arrived to them,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and I was checking
the mailbox for it.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.560
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.140
That book was in my
elementary school library.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.050
When we were learning
the Dewey decimal system,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.970
the first word I looked
up was comics,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.800
and that was the one
book that we had.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.100
And I would just take it out.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.510
I think in elementary school you
just keep the book for a week,

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.770
but I would just take it out week
in, week out, and not too long ago,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.780
I visited that elementary school,
and they still have the same copy.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.950
And it has some blemishes and
imperfections that I put on there,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.250
and I remember putting
them on there.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.550
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Nice.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.850
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I had
an eraser melt on it.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.070
Our house was so hot, and this
eraser kind of had some sort

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.210
of chemical reaction with
whatever they binded the thing

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.540
with that it just melted
eraser shape in it.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.840
That was me.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.140
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That's hot.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.440
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.740
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.470
So my next -- next chapter,
of course, [inaudible].

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.840 position:56%
Yes, yes, ya'll, and you don't stop.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.140
Okay?

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.440
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: These
are the chapter types?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.740
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: This
is chapter type.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.210
Okay. So hip hop was
also something that --

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.890 position:56%
whose relevance has grown over time.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.190
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.290
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Like comics, it was
perceived as a niche of some sort.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.590
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Right.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.030
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Now
has grown to being

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.820
like probably America's biggest
export -- cultural export.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.120
Could be.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.420
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: One of them.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.720
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: It
could be argued, right?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.020
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, sure.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.320
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So how long have
you been listening to hip hop?

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.620
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Once
again, that was something

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.440
that I was born into as well.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.090
The neighborhood that I grew up in
was -- it's predominantly black.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.500
I was one of the few white
kids in the neighborhood,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.120
and there would just be guys
walking up and down the street

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.620
with the boom box that took

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:49.910
like 16 C cell batteries
to last for one hour.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.360
Just playing different
kinds of music.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.960
My parents had some
disco anthologies

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.820
that would have Curtis Blow's The
Brakes and the Chaka Khan song

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.730
with the Melle Mel verse.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.590
I would hear this stuff
constantly, and that was the music

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.890
that my friends would listen to.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.040 position:56%
So I was kind of like a crowd clown.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.760
I'm like, "Oh yes, I want
to hang out with you guys.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.060
What are you listening to?"

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.670
I spent all my money on comics.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.120
So I would kind of give them --

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.550
it was Magnavox tapes to
dub me their favorite stuff.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.750
And then I grew up through the
era where on MTV if you wanted

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.180
to watch -- if you wanted
to see a rap music video,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.240
you had to watch Yo MTV Raps.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.490
And then as I got a little bit
older, that wasn't the case.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.170
The Yo MTV Raps kind
of became obsolete.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.110
It went away because
you would be able

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.100
to see rap music videos
any second of the day.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.620
So it was extremely popular
at that time when I was --

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.700
it really hit its tipping
point around then.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.210
But I still kind of like did
it wrong in a way because --

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.790
you know to high schoo
kids, you can't listen

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.530
to any music that was
six months old.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.870
It would be considered played out,

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.710
and I would just keep
digging back further.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.260
I had this impulse to just
keep digging back further,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.220
and they were like, "Why are
you listening to that old stuff?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.390
My Dad has a Grandmaster
Flash record.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.010
Like that's not cool."

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.500
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.800
So what made you decide
you were going

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.300
to put these two loves together?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.120
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: For a really long
time, I wanted to do some kind

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.630
of comic using a lot
of hip hop imagery.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:39.500
A lot of my favorite kinds of hip
hop imagery, the fashion, graffiti,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:48.680 position:56%
pre-Ed Koch New York, like scary
New York, like Taxi Driver New York.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.560
And I didn't know what
the kind of McGuffin

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.350
of whatever this tale would be,
and then at a certain point,

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:01.880
I was just thinking when it comes
to all the cartoonists that I know,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.520
many are fans of rap music,
but they could never beat me

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.820
in a trivia contest.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.120
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.040
Just the inherent knowledge
of the records

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:17.010
that I have is probably
greater than most cartoonists,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.770
and I have the willingness
to do the homework to figure

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.070
out the stuff I don't know.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.040
So I just -- all of a sudden
was like, you know what?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.370 position:56%
I'm just going to make a straight
forward linear history of rap music,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.660
and it was off to the races .

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.960
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Was this something

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.300
that had been on your
mind for awhile?

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.000
Had you had like tons of -- tons
of projects and tons of things

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.680
that you've already done,
but you were like, "Oh,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.510
I'm still going to do this project.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.410
I'm going to make it happen
when I have this opening."

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.790
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Somebody sent me
an interview that I did in 2009

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.730
where I mention wanting to
do a history of hip hop.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.920
So it at least goes back that far.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.620 position:56%
I was actually surprised that I said

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.210 position:56%
that because I think it was probably
just a frivolous conversation

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.640
that I had with a writer who
I was very comfortable with,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.770
and I spit that out, but
I wasn't conscious of it

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.710
because I didn't start
making the comic until 2012.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.160
Obviously, I have a lot of ideas.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.230
And this one, for whatever
reason, just felt exciting

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.040
to explore at that moment.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.890
I was posting these strips on a
website called Boingboing.net,

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.270
which had a built in
audience of I think like five

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.260
or six million readers
per month or something.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:44.730
So when I did my first Hip Hop
Family Tree strip, it went viral.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.110
Within a couple of hours, tens
of thousands of people shared it

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.950
on their Facebook accounts.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.310 position:56%
It was retweeted thousands of times.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.280
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That's
where I first saw it.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.580
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: That's cool.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.880
That's cool.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.180
And then it -- I don't know.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.480
There's just something about it

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.780
that gave me an incentive
to just keep it going.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.670
I was going to do it semiroutinely,
but then I got like some kind of --

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.240
some of the addiction that
"I like all this attention.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.640
I'm going to keep it rocking."

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.820
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So -- I have
a question about structure,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.540
how you go about walking
into this giant project.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.010
In some ways, it reminds me
of the book, Please Kill Me.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.310
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.610
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: You know?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.910
Oral history, you know?

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.210
But have you taken oral history --

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.880
like that's a format
where you can be like,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.700
"I'm going to read what this
person said, this person said,"

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.560
and you can just organize
it this way.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.880
So for me, this idea of taking
a genre of music, which had tons

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.560
and tons of people involved and
try to create a linear kind of path

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.680
through it, what was the
-- what was your process?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.300
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: As I said, I put this
work on that BoingBoing website.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.470
They were goodly [phonetic
spelling] enough to allow me

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.920 position:56%
to post a strip every week of almost
any kind of comics that I felt like.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:05.070
And that was my motivation.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.710
Let me kind of fill this slot each
week so that was the exercise.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:16.300 position:56%
Comics, for me, it just -- it starts
as an exercise, to just test myself.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.010
And I wanted to see what it would
be like to be a weekly cartoonist.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.310
And you know what?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.610
It's hard.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.910
And I found that out the hard way.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.320
So it's like all right,
I got to fill some space.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.860
Every Tuesday, I put
out a new strip.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:36.660
And so I had this kind
of format locked in,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:44.260 position:56%
and thankfully the history is fairly
in stone, and that gave me my kind

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.490
of blueprint for how
to format this thing.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:54.130
As I said earlier, I was going
to do this strip semiregularly,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.580
but as I started accumulating
material for the first strip,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.110
I came across a lot of really
visually interesting stuff

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.760
that I thought would
lend well to comics.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.570
So I'm like, "I'm just
going to do another one."

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.270
And then as I would
flesh out that moment,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.510
I would learn about something else,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.270
and it continued that
way for 4.5 years.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.610
I'm taking a little bit of a break
right at this moment from it,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.540
but for 4.5 years,
that was the thing.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.590
I never had any lead time.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.920
I never had a buffer, so it's
like every single week --

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.220
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Just
have to keep going.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.860
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: 4.5 years
of just putting

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.990
out a new strip every Tuesday,
do two new pages of comics.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.060
But even in that time, I was like
the books came out, and I would be

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.990
on a book tour and traveling the
world so it's like I drew pages

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.020
in Denmark and in Norway.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.830
It -- I was talking with some
friends, and they were like --

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.080
it's literally -- they
were like, "Man,

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.940
it's literally like
being a rock star."

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.240
I'm like, "Shut up."

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.540
And they're like, "No, man."

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.840
Because a musician is expected

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.860
to continue making music
even when they're on tour.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.870
And I was like, "Yeah, but at
least those guys got private planes

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.170
and stuff like that.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.140
Man, I'm sitting in coach like."

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.370
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Now, I assume
-- do you have like a regimen,

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.730
the way you treat your work ethic?

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:30.370
Do you have to draw X amount
a day or week or month or -- ?

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.670
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.690
I mean, I think the more people you
would talk to who would know me --

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.630 position:56%
I'm sort of known for my work ethic.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:44.570
And I have this keen ability
to just say F everything,

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.270
and I'm just going to
get this thing done.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:56.770
When I started the Hip Hop Family
Tree comic, a routine developed.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:01.220
I knew that Monday is like
writing day, and that would consist

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.250 position:56%
of doing some interviews,
researching, all that sort of stuff.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.120 position:56%
I would let all this information
swirl in my head for most of the day

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.680
and then basically by 1 a.m. would
have some sort of eureka moment,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.450 position:56%
like okay, it's all coming together.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:20.860
The comic will look like this.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.180
Draw it in pencil for
two days that week.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.060
Spend another couple days
inking it, color it in a day

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.410
and then it goes up the next day.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.280
Wash, rinse, repeat 45 times.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.580
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Right.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.880
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: 45 times in a row.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.570
Then I have enough material
for a book, spend the rest --

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.510
and then that would become like
the most busy part of my year

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.280
because I would spend the rest
of the year designing that book

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.050
but also keeping the strips
going in the meantime.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.300
The covers take me a month
to do to just kind of play --

00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.160
figure out all the possible angles
and ideas and design compositions.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.460
Yeah.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.960
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: How did you
gain -- I mean Pittsburg --

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.880
is there a big hip hop
scene in Pittsburgh?

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.220
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It exists.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.690
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So how did you gain
access to people that you needed

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.160
to interview for this
book or for the strips?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.460
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:23.110
When I was putting that first book
together, nobody would talk to me.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.160
And then it became a New
York Times best seller,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.910
and then I started getting some
phone calls, and it would be

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.260
like pretty cool guys
just like, "Listen, Ed.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.170
I just want to make sure
you get my part right

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.830
when it comes down to it, man.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.450
Here's my number."

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.950
And that was really cool.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:43.240
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: I was going to ask
about that because like hip hop,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.780
within the genre especially
like the golden era of hip hop,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.860
authenticity was a really
big aspect of the genre.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.730
Like how authentic or how real --

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.030
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.470
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Was that
something that you had to consider

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.750
like transposing this
into a comic book?

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.070
Like a comic theme?

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.290
Did you have to figure out
what authenticity meant

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.260
to a hip hop comic?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.560
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Right.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.060
I think I understand what you mean.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:18.240
There are a lot of competing
ideas about this happen

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.160
or that happened kind of thing.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.510
So as a for instance, in the
first book, there are no less

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.780
than three -- at least three
people who I give credit

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.060
for creating the term hip
hop because there's this camp

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.460
who believes that this
person did it.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.070
There's this camp who believes
this person did it and so on.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:44.490
There are many moments like that,
that come up in the culture.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:49.170
And certainly as I began
interviewing and talking

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:54.760 position:56%
with more people, you would think
that the work would get richer based

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.930
on that, but one of the ways --

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:05.990
one of the necessary tropes of
hip hop is self [inaudible],

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.410
and destroying your
enemies verbally.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:12.700
So there was a lot of gossip and a
lot of stuff like where I was like,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.330
"You know, we're approaching seven
billion people on this planet.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.410
Can I talk to maybe one
person on this globe

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:25.190
who can corroborate this
thing that you just told me?"

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.490
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Right.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.910
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: So I think I was the
perfect age to begin this comic

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:34.800 position:56%
when I did because if I was 21 years
old, I would just be like, "Yes,

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.520
sir, Mr. Biz Markie,
whatever you say."

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.900
Yes, sir. Whatever.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.520
It would have been
a different thing,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.880
and it would have been
a big piece of crap.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.880
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Do you hear back
from people that are in the book?

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.720
Like how do they feel
about the book?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.560
Like maybe Russell Simmons.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.600
Has he contacted you?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.900
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:59.940
He got his president of Def
Entertainment or something to get

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.860
in touch once, and they have a
bunch of projects in the works,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:08.060
and I think they were trying
to kind of like casually get me

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.260
to tone things down because
he offered me these jobs

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.960
to punch up scripts and stuff.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.800
And if you're unfamiliar, I draw
Russell Simmons the way he kind

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.790
of was when he was a young
man, kind of used angel dust,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.860
had a severe lisp, had kind
of like wandering lazy eye.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.290
And that was -- give him
sort of [inaudible] approach.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.540 position:56%
Anyhow, when he got in touch with
all that noise about doing this work

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.760
with him, I still drew
him the same way.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.100
And then they never called again.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.280
And so I feel like they were
trying to throw me some bones

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.600
so that I would be some kind
of dork, like, "Okay, man.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.620
I don't want to mess up this
opportunity to work with Russell."

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.920
Whatever.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: But there's probably
tons of people that are huge fans.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.980
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.320
It's awesome to just kind
of do a little vanity search

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.930
on Twitter every now
and again and then see

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.040
that De La Soul retweets the thing.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.910
Or, you know one of the more
popular strips that I did was --

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:20.770 position:56%
it was because Ice Cube shared it
on all of his social media accounts.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.790
And what I liked about that
moment was that it was a moment

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.330
where Ice Cube met Dr. Dre

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.000
for the first time before
they put together NWA.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.450
And the language that he used

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.680
when he shared it, he
took ownership of it.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.250
So he's like, "Check out this
comic about when I met Dre."

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.550
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.850
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: He took -- owned it.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.210
And like millions of people
saw that thing thanks to him.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.510
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That's amazing.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.810
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.160
Real cool.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.460
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.600
It's clobbering time,
AKA [inaudible] smash.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.450
Now, Hip Hop Family
Tree is doing fantastic.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.750
People love it.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.190
Ice Cube is retweeting about it.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:08.340
How has this experience making the
work and presenting it and having

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.910
such a positive feedback on it --

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:15.970
how has that affected
and changed your world

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.670
as an artist and as a person?

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.350
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Well, I mean,
it's taken me around the world,

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.840
and it's made me a worldly person.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.510
The book is in several languages,
and I get to go to the places

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.650
where this stuff is translated,
and I get to meet the people

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.230
of these other cultures

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.950
who are observing the
work for the first time.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.270
That's awesome.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:45.080
I've created a sort of buffer
for myself so that I can --

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.380
so that I could think about
what my next step would be.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.060
The books have made it
possible for me to kind

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.540
of design my career moving forward.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.010
So it's been positively
life-changing in a lot of ways.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:02.480
I got to collaborate with Public
Enemy and make some action figures,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.040
and that's my favorite
rap group ever.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.520
So --

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.900
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: And
they play tonight.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.200
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.030
We're showing our professionalism
by not being over there right now.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.330
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Yeah.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.630
It was hard.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.930
It was hard.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.230
I went there.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.530
I went there.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.960
I went, and I had the
worst case scenario,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.420
the worst of all worlds for me.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.630
I saw the end of Living Color.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.930
I'm sorry.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.670
I apologize to Living Color.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.380
But I saw them doing a
clash cover, and they --

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.850
to me it was just terrible.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.150
It was horrible.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.280
And so then I saw all of
the soundcheck and set

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.670
up for Public Enemy, and
then had to come back.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.230
And as I was like three
blocks away from it,

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.330
I hear Chuck D's voice coming, and
I was like, "You're taunting me."

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.630
I tried hard.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.930
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: He's a pro.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.230
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: I tried
-- I tried for both of us.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.530
I was like we got to be here.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.830
We have to see it.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.910 position:56%
And I just didn't make it, you know?

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.210
The world --

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.510
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: We love you, guys.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.810
Thanks for showing up.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.110
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That
-- that -- yeah.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.830
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: For real.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.680
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: I was
going to ask -- oh.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.640
When you look at your
own work, what's --

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.240
what do you like best about
it and what is the most fun?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.540
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I can tell you this,

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.050
and it's taken me 32
years basically --

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:30.270
30 years to be able to say that I
think that I found my own voice.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.970
The comics I make are Ed Piskor
comics, and it was not that way

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.540
for the first 30 years of my life.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.720
I would read Love and Rockets
and want to make comics

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.530
like Jaime Hernandez, and I would
read a Frank Miller comic and want

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.780
to make a super hero comic
like Frank Miller, right?

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.520
So I think I found my voice,
and I felt kind of like found --

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.380
not my niche but just
who I am as an artist.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.680
And that's awesome.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.120
And just the whole
process of comics,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.760
of making comics is completely
necessary so I'm talking

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.030
about even rolling the
panel borders is --

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.880
there's a part of it that's
necessary, and it's all fun to me.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.550
It's like I get to basically
meditate for eight, ten hours a day

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:23.110
and just kind of go into myself,
enter this almost zen-like state

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.970
and at the end of the day,
I have a new comic page.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:30.110
And then after many days, I
have a books worth of stuff,

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:37.240 position:56%
and it's just like this very calming
thing that's -- can't beat it.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.110
If I was a kid traveling forward
in time, looking at myself now,

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.750
it's like I'm exactly in a position

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.990
that I've been planning
for my entire life.

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.140
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: That's
just super rare.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.440
I mean --

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.740
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: What can I say?

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.040
I'm rare.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: One of the things I
noticed about your work that drew me

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:03.590
to your work is that as a fan of
both hip hop and a fan of comics,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.680
the way you approach making
comics is that it appears

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.910
that you love the form
from top to bottom,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.760
from [inaudible] to
making the panels.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:22.820
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: The [inaudible] ads,
man in the 1970's Marvel comics.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.520
That guy with that crazy hair
trying to sell his ninja academy.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.510
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: So that's something
that I think is super beautiful.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.810
How --

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.110
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: We have five minutes.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.410
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Oh,
we have five minutes.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.220
Okay, so let me see.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.750
I think I have two more
chapters, short chapters.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.860
Okay. Who the blank is this?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.090
Page me at 5:46 in the morning,
crack of dawn and now I yawn

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:47.680
and wipe the cold out my eyes.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.140
See who's this paging me and why.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:57.810
Came you name some of the -- your
both comic book and hip hop heroes

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.710
that you've been able to meet?

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.440
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Public Enemy.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:09.780
Last weekend, was at this comic
event SPX, and my publisher --

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.520
it's called FenoGraphics,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.930
and FemoGraphics this year is
celebrating their 40th anniversary.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.930
And I specifically
chose this publisher.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.730
One, because they gave me no kind
of editorial feedback on anything,

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.690
design, format, whatever.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.270
But also the pantheon
of cartoonists who are

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.580
under the FenoGraphics
umbrella are like --

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.700
to bring up another Olympic
reference that is less obscure

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.800 position:56%
than Dominique Moceanu, the 1992
U.S. basketball team, the Dream Team

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.390
with Michael Jordan, Larry
Bird and Magic Johnson, right?

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.790
So my cartoonist heroes
are like Dan Clowes.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:54.030
I don't want to say heroes on
camera because I know these dudes,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.900
and hip hop isn't -- doesn't
[inaudible] Clowes, Chris Ware,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.420
Charles Byrnes, Jessica
Abel, Joe [inaudible],

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.550
these people who I'm
like in the family.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.130
That's the other kind of cool
thing is when I went to --

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.850
I mentioned SPX the first time,
it was about ten years ago

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.140
and FenoGraphics was celebrating
their 30th anniversary.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.670
They were going to have
this big oral history book.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.050
It didn't happen for ten years
so they actually got it together,

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.620
put it together for the 40th
anniversary and how cool

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.150
because I get to be in it.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.450
Yeah.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.530
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: I see some
-- look like comic fans,

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.350
look like there are
some young people.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.580
This is the classic question, but
like what advice would you give

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.890
in terms of like making comics?

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:49.080
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I think
that it's best to just be

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.380
into it for the right reasons.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.670
Just don't expect to make
a lot of money upfront.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.970
Do it for the love.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.270
Do it almost for the tradition.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.220
Do it because you can't not do it.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.160
And you have to be relentless.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.910
You have to almost punt
your teenage years away.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:13.470
When all your friends are partying
and smoking weed and having sex --

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.770
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Don't
do that, don't do that.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:18.430
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: If you're
drawing, don't worry about that.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.460
If it pays off later,
something like that.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:27.160 position:56%
You have to punt your teenage years,
and you have to punt your 20's

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.820
and then the rest of your
life can be clear sailing.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.090
But -- so it really takes -- I had
this idea that it takes 20 years

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:38.310
to get to be good enough to be
publishable and then it's going

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:42.650
to take another 20 years
to create your masterpiece.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.930
Like I truly sort of believe that.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.480
[Inaudible] trajectory like I
haven't done my masterpiece yet,

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.540
but I keep learning and I'm still
a student like any teenagers

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.840
or whatever who are here.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.140
I'm the same as you.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.440
I'm still learning stuff.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.060
It's just I've been putting in
a little -- a few more hours.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.360
&gt;&gt; Damon Locks: Okay.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.660
I think that's a good
place to stop, right?

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.960
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Awesome.
