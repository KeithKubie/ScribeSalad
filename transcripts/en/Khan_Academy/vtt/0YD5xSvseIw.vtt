00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.590
I want to add one super fast
addendum to the video on

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.340
Friedel-Crafts acylation.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.570
In the last step of the
mechanism I had this chlorine

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.920
swipe the electron, or
essentially that electron that

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.050
was with the aluminum.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.590
It was given to the
hydrogen proton.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.040
So the hydrogen was
nabbed away.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.350
Its electron was allowed to go
back into the benzene ring.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.320
So the aluminum lost
a chlorine.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.350
This benzene ring
lost a proton.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.320
It was able to take back
that electron.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.330
And I forgot to draw the
hydrogen and the chlorine.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.619
So then that results in
hydrogen chloride.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.380
So you have the hydrogen proton
bonded-- it took this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.020
electron from the aluminum--
and it is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.740
bonded to the chlorine.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.320
I didn't want to forget that
in that last step of the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.820
Friedel-Crafts acylation.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.200
We also get some hydrogen
chloride.
