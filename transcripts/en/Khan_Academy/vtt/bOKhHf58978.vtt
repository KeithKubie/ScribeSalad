00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.700
Welcome back.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.150
I keep rushing to try to get
under the wire for these

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.080
problems, but let me explain
it properly.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.680
So what we did is, we said
that a new student joins.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.510
And the average after he joins
is equal to the median.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.610
And what we did is we figured
out, what's the average and

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.750
the median before the
student joins.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.490
Well, the average before the
student joined was 13/12, and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.580
the median before the student
joined was 1.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.160
If the new student has 1 or 0--
and we established that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.200
the only way to bring this
average down is for the new

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.260
student to have less than
the average number

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.880
of siblings, right?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.040
That's the only way we can
go from 1 1/12 to 1.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.240
And I'll tell you right now that
he's actually going to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.380
have a 1/13 impact, right,
if he's 1 away.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.050
So actually I can tell you right
now he has one sibling,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.790
but I'll show it to you
mathematically if you don't

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.430
have that intuition
on averages.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.380
But the important thing to
realize is that he's either

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.590
going to have 0 or 1 sibling.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.165
He's going to have to have less
than 1 1/12 siblings, so

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.690
it's either 0 or 1 in order
to bring the average down.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.560
And regardless of whether he has
0 or 1 sibling, the median

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.220
won't change.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.910
If he has one sibling, then
we're just going to have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
another one here and then
this'll become the median.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.900
If he has 0 siblings, then
that's going to be a 0 there,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.610
but that's still going
to be a median of 1.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.840
The median is not
going to change.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.110
So what we have to do is figure
out how many siblings

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.040
does he have to have for the new
average to be exactly 1?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.050
So we can go back to
this calculation.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.720
Let's take the average, but now
let's take it with him.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.940
So this was our previous average
where we said well,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.590
there's three students with 0
siblings, six students with 1,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.640
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.240
But now we're going to add
this new student in.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.690
There's one student with
x siblings, right?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.060
And instead of 12 in the
denominator, we have 13.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.350
Because we now have 13
students, right?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.670
So what happens?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.800
You essentially have 13,
so this becomes x plus

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.530
6 plus 4 plus 3.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.730
This becomes 13 plus
x, and then the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.770
denominator is equal to 13.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.700
And actually I was wrong before,
he's actually going to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.140
have to have 0, my intuition
was a little bit off.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.390
Because look, this is the new
average, 13 plus x over 13.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.540
The new average is going to be
13 plus x over 13, right?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.550
13 plus x over 13.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.710
And what does that new average
have to equal?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.230
It has to equal 1.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.790
Because that's the new median.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.320
Or the old median, because we
said the mean doesn't change.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.100
So how can 13 plus x
over 13 equal 1?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.680
Well, if you can't eyeball that,
you can just say 13 plus

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.310
x, multiply both sides by
13, is equal to 13.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.690
And then subtract 13 from
both sides and you get

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.690
x is equal to 0.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.630
So that new student
has 0 siblings.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.200
I know that was a little bit
convoluted, so let me just

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.690
tell you what I did again.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.970
I said what is the
current median?

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.280
And I just listed out all of the
number of siblings, and I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.440
took the middle number,
and that was 1.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.790
Then I said well, what is
the current average?

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.470
And the current average
was 1 1/12.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.050
And this might confuse
you a little bit.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.370
You could just say, well this is
the same thing as 0 plus 0

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.850
plus 0 plus 1 plus 1 plus
1 plus 1 plus 1

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.270
plus 1 and so forth.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.410
Instead I said that's three
students with 0, six students

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.490
with 1 sibling, two students
with 2 siblings, and so forth.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.260
And I figured out that the
current average-- and I

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.470
divided by 12-- was 1 1/12.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.600
So I said well, no matter how
many siblings the next student

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.070
has-- and actually, it didn't
even matter, even if you had

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.750
more or less, one of the middle
numbers still would

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.620
have been the 1.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.090
So the median will not change
regardless of where the new

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.870
student falls into the mix.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.230
So we said, how many siblings
does that student need to have

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.440
for the average to come
down back to 1?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.590
And then I just added x to my
previous average and I divided

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.490
by 13 instead because we now
have an extra student.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.674
This was a 13 too.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:19.580
And we got this equation: 13
plus x over 13 has to equal my

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.100
new average, which is 1.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.810
And then I solved for
x, which is 0.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.910
So the new student
had 0 siblings.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.960
Next problem.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.730
And the really fast way of doing
this-- not to harp on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.410
this problem too much, and I
should have done this from the

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.460
beginning-- is to figure out
that the median is 1, then

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.920
figure out that it doesn't
matter how many siblings the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.660
student has, the median's
still going to be 1.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.280
You can insert a number anywhere
in this list and the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.290
median would have still been
1 because there's so many

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.510
students with one sibling.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.550
And then you just have to figure
out well, how many

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.060
siblings does the student
have to have for the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.660
average to become 1?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.350
That's probably the most
convoluted explanation I've

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.760
given, but let me just
hope it helps you.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.860
OK, problem number 9.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:21.050
If 2 times x minus 3 is equal to
8, what does x minus 3 over

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.700
x plus 3 equal?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.140
What does that equal?

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.350
Well, let's just solve for x.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.390
So we get x minus 3 is equal
to-- I'm just going to divide

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.070
both sides by 2, so 8 divided
by 2 is 4, right?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.900
2 divided by 2 is 1, so
x minus 3 equals 4,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.330
x is equal to 7.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.390
So you go here.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.860
What's x minus 3?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.690
Well it's 7 minus
3, which is 4.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.710
We also figured out that x
minus 3 was 4 up here.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.080
And then what's x plus 3?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.350
That's 7 plus 3, so that's 10.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.180
4/10, we can reduce that to 2/5,
dividing the numerator

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.900
and the denominator by 2.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.150
So that's our answer,
2/5 or 0.4.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.210
Problem 10.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.060
When twice a number-- so
whenever I start writing it,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.050
let's say x is the number.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.570
So they say when twice an
number-- so when 2 times x,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.930
that's twice a number--
is decreased by 3.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.810
So, twice a number is
decreased by 3,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.080
the result is 253.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.830
What is the number?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.090
Well, while reading
it, I set it up.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.180
So now we just have to solve.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.770
So we add 3 to both sides.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.220
2x is equal to 256, right?

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.900
I added 3 to both sides.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.100
x, divide both sides by
2. x is equal to 128.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.520
And we are done.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.770
Next problem.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.110
Problem 10.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.240
OK, this says Outdoor Sneaker
Company's July production.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.430
So we have white, black,
and then total.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.215
And then they have high-tops,
low-tops, and then total.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.510
I don't know if people even
wear high-tops anymore.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.080
I used to.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.290
I guess for basketball.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.625
OK, high-tops, low-tops,
and total.

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:24.040
I'm very not plugged-in.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.520
High-tops, low-tops,
and then total.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.480
And what numbers do they
have in the box?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:50.130
So there are 3,600 here, 1,500
here, 5,500, and then 10,000.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.280
So even before reading this
question, I could tell you

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.540
they're just going to want us
to fill in this diagram.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.450
10,000 here.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.870
Outdoor Sneaker Company
manufactures only white

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.990
sneakers and black sneakers,
both of which are available as

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.030
either high-tops or low-tops.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.990
On the basis of the information
in the table

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.820
above, how many black sneakers
did Outdoor Sneaker Company

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.440
manufacture in July?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.690
So how many black sneakers-- so
they didn't differentiate

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.310
between the high-tops or
low-tops-- so they want to

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.930
know, how many total
black sneakers.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.010
So that is black total.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.120
So we need to figure
out this square.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.320
Total black.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.660
So let's see what we
can figure out.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.570
I'll do my figuring out
in this magenta.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.789
So if low-tops-- I need a total
of 5,500 low-tops--

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.320
1,500 are black, how
many are white?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.870
Well, it's going to
be 4,000, right?

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.830
I just took 5,500 minus 1,500.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.210
4,000.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.990
Similarly, if I made a total of
10,000 sneakers and 5,500

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.570
are low-tops, how many of
them are high-tops?

00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:00.070
Well, it's going to be 10,000
minus 5,500, so this is 4,500.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.820
And out of the high-tops, if
3,600 are white and I made a

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.760
total of 4,500, how many
black are there?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.740
Well, 4,500 total minus the
white ones, that's what?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.820
That's 900.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.070
And so if we want to figure out
the total black, we now

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.880
know how many high-top blacks
there are and how many low-top

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.920
black sneakers there are,
so we just add.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.480
So 900 plus 1,500 is 2,400.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.540
So I actually wasted both of our
times figuring this out,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.310
so I could have saved a few
seconds I didn't do that.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.780
But I was just mindlessly
chugging along.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.030
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
