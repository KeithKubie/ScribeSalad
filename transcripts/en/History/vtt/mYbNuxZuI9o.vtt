00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.880
[laughter]

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.670
You're going to love this.
[rock music]

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.500
Look at him, man.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.830
[laughter]

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.670
Check you out, Dee.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.540
Another new car.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.000
This car is a gift for my wife.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.210
Nice.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.880
I thought I'd surprise her.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.830
You know, she and I have
been together 40 years, man.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.210
Wow.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.380
She's been putting up
with you for 40 years?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.580
Yes.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.170
Yeah, against her will.
[laughter]

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.750
Dee Snider from Twisted
Sister and I, we go way back,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.420
and he's always
full of surprises.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
DEE SNIDER: I thought I'd
surprise her with a new Z4.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.580
Very nice.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.830
I got it in white
because I figure

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.250
it's like a clean canvas.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.000
[rock music]

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.670
DANNY KOKER: The Z4 is BMW's
follow-up to the wildly popular

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.080
Z3 Roadster, known
for being manufactured

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.670
in the United States.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.710
The Z4s are being built
in Germany once again,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.330
and a combination of beautiful
body lines, spacious interior,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.670
and the ability to hit
60 miles per hour in 4.8

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.540
helped the Z4 win the coveted
Red Dot Design Award in 2009.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.880
Well, brother, like Suzette,
the car is already very classy.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.040
What direction should
we go with this, bro?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
I know she's thinking pink.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.290
Pink?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.290
She doesn't want
it to be all pink.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.380
I think she's thinking of
using the white with styling--

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.790
Accents.
DEE SNIDER: Accents.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.750
OK.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.750
I heard you requested me.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.540
You know the-- the
Z4 BMW that we're doing

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.120
for Dee Snider's wife
for her anniversary?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.620
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.080
Beautiful pearl white car.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.290
He says her favorite
color is pink.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.540
I like this one.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.120
That's what I would
do right there.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
You're absolutely no help--

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.210
none.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.960
That's-- that's what I think.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.920
Never mind.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.710
You know what?

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.420
No pink.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.920
We told Suzette that Dee had
to pick up something from me

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.420
to use on his new record.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.880
She has no idea she's
about to get a new Beamer.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.790
Dee, Suzette, thank you
guys for stopping by, man.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.790
You know the thing we talked
about last time you were here?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.830
Oh, yeah.
Is it done?

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.250
I-- yeah.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.670
Hey Ryan, bring that
sweet ride out there.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.620
[engine revving]

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.500
[laughter]

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.670
[rock music]

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.080
Happy anniversary.
- Wow.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.120
Wow.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.000
You're so sweet.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.290
[laughter]

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.670
I love it.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.750
I love the way you got all
the ghost patterns in there

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.330
in the metallic silver.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.670
DANNY KOKER: Yeah.
SUZETTE SNIDER: Amazing.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.170
RYAN EVANS: OK.
- But the truth?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.120
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.670
I want pink.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.580
RYAN EVANS: Pink.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.000
- Yeah.
- OK.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.380
Pink.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.290
DANNY KOKER: Bam.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.710
Ooh.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.790
DANNY KOKER: Dee wanted
us to add a bit of flair

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.380
to Suzette's brand new BMW Z4.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.830
As much bad luck as we've
had with pink around here,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.880
I think this car looks amazing.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.960
The pink and silver
graphics perfectly

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.120
accentuating the sexy lines
of this beautiful Beamer.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.380
I think it's exactly
what Suzette had in mind.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.880
At least I hope so.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.880
I don't want to have to
take this baby back again.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880
[rock music]

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.830
Well, is that the
best you could do?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.040
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, man.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.790
It's great.
- Oh my god.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.960
[laughter]

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.790
[rock music]

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.210
I love it.
It's awesome.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.330
Thank god.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420
The car is fantastic, right?
Beautiful.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.880
SUZETTE SNIDER: Yeah,
she looks beautiful.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.080
RYAN EVANS: The right
amount of color to it?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.380
SUZETTE SNIDER:
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.670
Those hips like
that, that looks great.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.500
It looks beautiful,
elegant, and sexy.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.830
You did good.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.670
But one thing.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.750
Oh.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.000
But one thing.
But one thing.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.330
That damn wheels don't match.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.750
[laughter]

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.750
Are you kidding me?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.250
I did all the emblems on the
car except for the ones in the--

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.250
come on, man.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.080
Seriously?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080
DEE SNIDER: Dude.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.380
This is actually kind of fun.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.380
I'm enjoying this
because Ryan hates

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.210
doing things more than once.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.380
I detest it.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.380
And now, it's
coming back again.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.420
Why don't you drive it
down to the shop right now?

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.920
I'll take care of those
center caps, 20 minutes tops.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.210
All right.
All right.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.210
RYAN EVANS: Let's do it.
- I love you.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.120
You did a great job.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.880
You really, really
did a great job.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.250
RYAN EVANS: Putting
me through the ringer.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.120
Isn't that what
all women do, though?

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.540
RYAN EVANS: I love it.
I love it.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.960
It happens.
DANNY KOKER: Yeah.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.290
RYAN EVANS: It happens
to the best of us.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.040
DANNY KOKER: Yeah.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.540
Ryan?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.540
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.920
You forgot something.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.380
[laughter]

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.960
Center cap to
the steering wheel.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.620
I got it.
I'll take care of that, too.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.960
You'll do that.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.710
Drive safe.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.120
We'll see you guys down there.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.380
RYAN EVANS: You're
buying me a drink, right?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.790
I'm buying you four.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.620
[laughter]

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.380
RYAN EVANS: Wow.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.250
[siren]

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.540
[explosion]

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.620
DANNY KOKER: Really, you
missed the center caps?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Come on, man.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.620
RYAN EVANS: I'm so sorry, dude.
