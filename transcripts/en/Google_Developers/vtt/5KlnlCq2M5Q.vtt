SETH LADD: Hi, my name
is Seth Ladd.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.940
I'm a developer advocate
with the Dart project.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.620
In this video, I will introduce
you to the different

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.790
parts of Dart and explain how
Dart can help developers be

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.820
more productive, building
faster apps

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.710
for the modern web.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.880
Dart can be a productive
environment for developers new

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.480
to the web, especially
developers familiar and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.930
comfortable with structured
languages and tools.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
You can use Dart to scale from
small scripts to large apps

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.820
that take advantage of the wide
array of HTML5 features.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.230
Dart apps compile to JavaScript
and run across

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.660
modern desktop and
mobile browsers.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.890
The Dart language is designed
to be easy to learn for

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.970
developers that are familiar
with C#, Java, ActionScript,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.390
and JavaScript.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.890
It is a class-based,
object-oriented, dynamic

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.830
language with closures, lexical
scope, and more.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.190
As you can see, the code syntax
looks familiar and is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.700
easy to learn.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.290
Dig a little deeper, and you'll
find some cool features

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.570
like optional static type
annotations for inline

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.350
documentation, safer concurrent
programming with

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.750
isolates, libraries for code
organization, and more.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.120
The language is easy to use
with your favorite text

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.700
editor, or with our lightweight
and productive

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.190
Dart Editor.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.140
Dart Editor can help you create
a project, explore

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.480
unfamiliar APIs with code
completion, update the code

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.200
with refactoring and quick
fixes, find problems early

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.470
with inline warnings and
errors, and much more.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.800
You also have the option of
using Eclipse and IntelliJ, as

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.230
both products support a rich
Dart editing experience.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.970
Once you've written some
Dart code, you can

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.450
run it in two ways.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.090
You can run your app across
modern desktop and mobile

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.590
browsers, thanks to our
third-generation Dart to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.010
JavaScript compiler.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.850
For faster app downloads, Dart
to JS eliminates dead code

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.700
from the generated JavaScript.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.850
Dart to JS also generates
source maps, which tells

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.280
browsers how to debug the
original Dart code, even when

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.250
it's first compiled
to JavaScript.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.080
For even faster performance,
quicker startup, and a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.910
productive debugging experience,
Dart programs can

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.480
also run natively in the
Dart Virtual Machine.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.840
This new VM was originally
designed by the same team that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.190
built V8, Chrome's fast
JavaScript engine.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.300
The Dart VM is built
for speed.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.550
For example, VM snapshots
improve application startup by

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.590
up to 10 times.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.240
The VM can power command-line
Dart scripts that access

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.600
sockets, files, processes,
and more.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.000
You can even build your own web
server with the Dart VM.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.250
But with the VM embedded into
web browsers, developers can

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.480
quickly test their apps without
first compiling to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.750
JavaScript.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.250
You can debug your apps directly
from Dart Editor by

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.570
launching into Dartium,
our custom build of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.410
Chromium with a Dart VM.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.710
Using Dart Editor with Dartium,
you can launch the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.310
app, set breakpoints, inspect
variables and objects, and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.600
step through the code.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.655
Developers experience a fast
edit/reload cycle, thanks to

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:02.510
the editor's integration
with Dartium.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.300
Building new apps with the
editor and Dartium is fun.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.800
But developers often need to
integrate with existing

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.350
libraries and code.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.510
Now there's a way to call
existing JavaScript libraries

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.190
directly from Dart.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.330
You can use JavaScript APIs like
Google Maps, or your own

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.730
in-house code, without first
porting it to Dart.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.440
But perhaps there's already
a port of your

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.390
favorite library to Dart.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.890
To discover, install, and
manage third-party Dart

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.940
libraries, use Pub, our
package manager.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.880
A simple configuration file
declares your application's

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.260
dependencies, and with a quick
command, those libraries are

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.930
downloaded and installed
for your app.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.790
Pub makes it easy to share your
code, install libraries

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.780
from other developers,
and keep your

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.810
dependencies up to date.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.610
As you can see, Dart is much
more than just a language.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.270
To try it out, you can join
our open-source project,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.310
download Dart Editor, and
learn more about Dart at

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.490
dartlang.org.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.740
We look forward to
your feedback.
