00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.900
ROB LEWORTHY: Welcome to
today's Talks at Google event.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.120
My name is Rob Leworthy.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.420
And I'm very pleased to
welcome John Kay today.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.200
John is an economist
whose career

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.540
has spanned the academic world,
business and public affairs.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.440
John is currently a visiting
Professor of Economics at LSE

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.826
and a Fellow at St
John's College, Oxford.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.325
He's a Fellow at
the British Academy

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:26.050
and at the Royal
Society of Edinburgh.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.200
He's a director of
several public companies

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.880
and contributes a weekly column
to the "Financial Times."

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.759
He's the author of many books,
including "The Truth About

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.330
Markets."

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.290
And his latest book--
"Other People's Money"--

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.650
towards a financial system
for the needs for the economy

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.690
rather than financial
market participants--

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.010
is published by Profile
Books and out now.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.970
Please join me in a
massive round of applause

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.140
in welcoming John Kay.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.096
John.

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.460
JOHN KAY: People who don't
know very much about finance

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.660
often ask me, what do people
in the city and on Wall Street

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.070
actually do?

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.460
And the answer is-- to an extent
that almost defies belief--

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.710
what they do is they
trade with each other.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.480
Let me give you some examples.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.400
World trade in goods and
services has grown a lot.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.780
We all know that.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.880
But World trade in
foreign exchange--

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.780
the amount that's traded on
foreign exchange markets--

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.920
is 100 times the total of
trade in goods and services.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.130
Some of you probably still
think that what banks do

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.070
is they take your deposits
and they lend them out

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.320
to businesses.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.580
Actually if I look at the
assets of British banks,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.040
then I discover that lending
to non-financial businesses

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.040
accounts for about 3%
of their total assets.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.640
Lending to other
financial institutions

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.660
accounts for about 70% of it.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.730
That is, what they do is
that they lend to each other

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.480
and borrow from each other.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.440
The total volume
of assets that are

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.610
subject to derivative
contracts that contract

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.870
to buy securities at some price
or sometime in the future--

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.890
the total volume of
exposures under that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.020
amounts to three times the value
of all the assets in the world.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.520
And about 10% of that
each is held by JP Morgan

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.570
or by Deutsche Bank.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.850
Some of you will have heard of
high-frequency trading, which

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.030
now accounts for
more than half of all

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.460
the trading on the London
and New York Stock Exchanges.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.850
That's essentially
done by computers

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.830
that are programmed
with algorithms

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.510
that trade with each other.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.140
And speed, obviously,
matters critically

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.470
in doing this with the
result that a company called

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.350
Spread Networks
has recently built

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.900
a link through the Appalachians
which is designed to reduce

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.640
the time it takes to transmit
data between Chicago and New

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.130
York from 7.3 milliseconds
to 6.6 milliseconds.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.730
Just to give you some
idea of what that means,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.960
the physical irreducible
minimum is 4.3 milliseconds,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.540
which is the time it takes light
to travel from Chicago to New

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.360
York.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.120
Now I think you might ask two
questions about all of this.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.360
One, what is it all for?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840
And secondly, why
is it so profitable?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.250
Because if we shut
the doors of this room

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.080
and lock them and spent the
rest of the day exchanging bits

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.140
of paper with each
other, what we'd

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.430
walk out with at the end
of the day-- in aggregate--

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.850
would seem to be very
much the same as what

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.300
we walked into it with.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.340
What I'm going to talk
about this morning

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.810
is what I call in
the book-- it's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.300
not an original word for me
and it's not a very nice word--

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.100
it's called financialization.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.670
It's essentially the process
over the last 30 to 40 years

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.420
by which the activity I've
just been describing-- people

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.530
trading secondary
assets with each other--

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.630
has grown to be such a
large part of our economy

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.080
and such a dominant part
of the financial system.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.990
It's essentially the change
in the financial world

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.940
that looks like that to
the financial world that

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.570
looks like this.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.730
This was the plaque when
Lehman went bankrupt.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.890
It was actually sold for
quite a large amount of money.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.770
This was Gordon Brown opening
Lehman Brothers London.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.770
Well, I guess you guys
are lucky enough not

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.720
to have a chief executive
who's quite like that

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.670
in your particular business.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.000
But that's the impact
of financialization

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.700
which I've been describing.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.250
And I want to point out
two consequences of that

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.420
because lots of people think
that financial crises are

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.410
inevitable.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.740
That is, they're
just something that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.450
happens, like hurricanes
or earthquakes that

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.070
happen every few years.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.980
This is a story.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.530
It's a graph of
what has happened

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.010
to the incidence
of banking crises

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.980
over the last two centuries.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.710
And you can see a
rather clear pattern

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.890
in this, which is you
get a steady increase

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.170
across the 19th,
early 20th century.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.510
Then you get a spike in 1929
with the Great Depression

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.430
in the early '30s.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.500
And then you get a period
of extraordinary stability

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.430
from the Second World War
through to about the 1970s.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.630
And then the process which I've
described as financialization

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.420
takes place, and you get this
steady increase again followed

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.240
by the global financial
crisis of 2008

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.080
we're all familiar with.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.750
This is another
illustration of what

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.430
has happened as a result of
this financialization process.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.390
There's been a lot of
talk about inequality

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.180
in the last year or two.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.000
And you can see that
in the four countries

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.660
I take on this slide--
Britain, US, France,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.800
and Germany-- in all four of
these countries, what you get

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.120
in the first half
of the 20th century

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.860
is a steady decline
in inequality.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.090
Then in two of the countries--
Germany and France--

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.660
you get a levelling out.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.630
But what you get in
two other countries--

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.770
Britain and the United
States-- is the sharp reversal

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.930
of that trend.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.900
And that is clearly
very much to do

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.310
with both the effect of the
growth of the financial sector

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.630
itself and the impact
of the financial sector

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.750
on the behavior of people
in large businesses.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.850
I could talk a lot more
about financialization

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.700
and its origins
and effects, but I

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.370
want to go back to the
question with which I began.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.410
If we are all sitting in
this room passing around bits

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.160
of paper to each other,
how do we actually all

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.710
make profits out of doing it?

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.870
Well, if I go back to
that great crash story,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.660
I find out a little
bit about that story.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.060
Because perhaps the best little
book about the 1929 crash

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.400
is by John Kenneth
Galbraith, who's

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.370
one of the few economists
who writes well.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.990
I hope to try and
imitate him a bit.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.990
Galbraith created what he called
the concept of the bezzle.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.310
And what he meant
by the bezzle was

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.610
that there's a kind of magic
interval between someone

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.270
actually stealing some
money and the people

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.610
from whom it's been
stolen finding out

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.400
that they've lost it.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.610
And in that interval
both parties

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.985
imagine they're enjoying
the same wealth.

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:43.200
Now one of the ways we can
create profit is by bezzle.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.050
You see, I might have
this bit of paper here,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.160
which is called a
very complicated

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.940
financial instrument.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.470
It's actually a subsenior
tranche of collateralized debt

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.110
obligation based on
subprime mortgages,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.590
but you probably don't
want to know about that.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.590
You certainly don't want to
read the thousands of pages

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.010
which the lawyers
have constructed

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.750
to explain what's in it.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.280
And probably no one
in the world has ever

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.050
read these 1,000 pages
that explain what is in it.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.890
All you need to know-- and it's
really quite important for you

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.140
to know this-- is that
it yields more than 1%

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.220
more than a US treasury bond and
it's rated by rating agencies

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.800
as at least as safe
as a US treasury bond.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.430
Now I'd be willing
to beg-- I imagine

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.210
you might be willing to pay
a modest premium for that.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.700
And actually when you
explain the attractions of it

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.860
to your colleague
sitting beside you,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.600
she might be willing to pay a
little bit of a premium to you.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.040
And we can pass this
round and we can all

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.750
make a little bit of profit out
of passing it on to each other.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.670
And I bet you at the back
over there are now thinking,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.050
can't we join in and make
profits in this kind of way

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.210
as well?

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.550
And what we can do is we
can pass this bit of paper

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.880
around until everyone appears
to have made a profit out of it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.840
Now one day someone is going to
discover that this bit of paper

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.000
isn't worth as much
as people thought.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.390
But so long as that
hasn't yet happened,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.800
we've created a pool
of imaginary wealth

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.810
which will benefit
everyone in the room.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.110
Now that's a caricature, but
not a very great caricature

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.520
of what happened
between 2003 and 2008,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.350
which was that
banks announced they

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.500
had made very large profits,
paid out a large share of these

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.210
to their senior employees, and
then announced in 2008 that it

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.820
had all been a mistake--
more or less wiped

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.230
out bank shareholders--
and actually, as we know,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.250
needed lots of money from
taxpayers to keep them going.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.610
Another way of creating
this kind of bogus wealth

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.170
is what I generally
describe as tailgating.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.080
I have a house in France.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.170
And those of you who
have driven in France

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.680
will know that if you drive
in a French autoroute,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.390
you will find that unless
you're 20 kilometers an hour

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.040
above the legal speed limit,
you will be tailgated by someone

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.740
who's your tail,
flashing their lights,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.030
and trying to persuade
you to get out of the way.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.930
And the thing about tailgating
is it works 99% of the time.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.190
The tailgating driver gets
to his destination a minute

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.440
or so earlier than
people who drive

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.590
in some kind of sensible,
more rational way.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.290
One time in 1,000,
it doesn't work.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.490
But actually what
then happens is

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.430
that there's a kind of
cognitive dissonance

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.920
that separates the
accident, which

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.010
happens one time in
1,000, from the behavior

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:58.290
of which the other 999
times gave rise to in this.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.160
And there's always
a reason for that.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Because the reason
there's an accident

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.340
is that someone else made
a mistake on the road

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.510
or there was an obstruction in
the way or something like that.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.370
So there's always an explanation
of why this happened.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.670
But actually the real
cause of the accident

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.740
is the driving behavior
that gives rise

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.040
to it in the first place.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.850
But these kind of
strategies, by which

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.120
you can make sequences of
small profits punctuated

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.570
by occasional large
losses, are characteristic

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.330
of a whole variety of
financial market strategies.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.920
So for a moment
instead of talking

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.570
about what it is that these
guys in the finance sector do,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.410
I'm going instead to talk about
what finance is actually for.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.580
Because let's be quite clear,
economies need finance.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.270
We need finance really
for four kind of purposes.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.780
We need finance, first of all,
to operate a payment system

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.570
so that we can pay our bills,
receive wages and salaries so

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.990
that businesses can
trade with each other.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.000
We need finance to help
us with wealth management.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.500
That means we need to transfer
wealth across our lifetimes

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.130
because we have education
when we're young,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.310
eventually we'll be retired.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.100
The pattern of earnings
over our lifetime

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.620
is different from the
pattern of consumption

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.020
we want to maintain.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.700
We need finance for
capital allocation.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.380
That is to take the
savings of the country

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.370
and translate them into the
capital stock of the country.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.180
To take our everyday
savings and build

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.640
houses and roads and bridges
and businesses with all of that.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.660
And finally, we need finance to
help us with risk mitigation.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.240
Finance can help share the risks
of life among groups of people

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.980
so that the costs of them don't
fall in such an extreme way

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.960
on particular individuals.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.710
Now what I try to do in the
book, which people have found

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.110
surprisingly
original in a sense,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.640
is to ask them the question
instead of asking what people

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.720
in the finance sector
do, ask the question,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.320
what would a finance
sector that was devised

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.180
to meet the needs of the
real economy actually

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.870
look like in terms of these
kind of four functions?

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.740
Now I don't have time to talk
about all of that this morning.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.640
So what I'm going to do is to
focus on one of them, which

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.310
is actually risk mitigation.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.080
And in order to do that,
I'm going to introduce you

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.820
to a rather elegant venue
in the United States,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.660
which some of you may have
heard of, called Jackson Hole.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.520
Because way back
in 2005, not long

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.130
before the global
financial crisis,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.090
the Federal Reserve
Bank of Kansas

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.640
held a beanfeast, which it does
every year as a matter of fact.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.900
But this one was to celebrate
the imminent retirement

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.460
from the chairmanship
of the Federal

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.560
Reserve of Alan Greenspan.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.660
And there were a whole series
of laudatory papers about him

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.660
with one exception, which is
a guy called Rag Rajan who

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.740
was then the Chief Economist of
the International Monetary Fund

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.040
and is now a governor of
the Central Bank of India.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.360
And Rajan warned about
the tailgating problem

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.050
which I've been describing.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.800
That is, Rajan said,
we have this problem

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.340
with-- more technically you
call it heavily out of the money

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.730
options, which is
going to come around

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.500
and hit us in the
next few years.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.910
Anyway, what Rajan said
did not go down well--

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.280
to put it mildly.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.100
The discussant of
his paper was a guy

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.590
called Don Kohn, who said,
by allowing institutions

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.100
to diversify risks, to choose
their risk profiles more

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.990
precisely, to improve the
management of the risks they

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.080
take on, financial
innovations have

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.990
made institutions more robust.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.320
These developments have also
made the financial system

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.260
more resilient and flexible,
better able to absorb shocks

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.500
without increasing the
effects of these shocks

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.750
on the real economy.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.680
And Kohn was followed by another
Federal Reserve governor called

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.540
Ben Bernanke then, who said
that banking organizations-- he

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.910
said-- have made substantial
strides over the past two

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.610
decades in their ability to
measure and manage risks,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:38.760
resulting in greater resilience
of the banking system.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.690
Another Federal Reserve member
called Tim Geithner said,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.590
financial institutions are now
able to measure and manage risk

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.840
more effectively.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.710
Risks are spread more widely
across a more diverse group

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.840
of financial intermediaries
within and between countries.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.410
These changes have contributed
to a substantial improvement

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.140
in the financial strength of the
core financial intermediaries

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.840
and in the resilience of the
financial system of the United

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.430
States.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.310
Two questions that might
raise in your mind.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.880
One is, how could these
guys have been so wrong?

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.580
And secondly, how was it
that the fact that they

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.370
were so wrong was
actually no obstacle--

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.570
to put it mildly-- to their
subsequent advancement?

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.040
It was Bernanke who succeeded
Greenspan as chairman

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.685
of the Federal Reserve.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:30.664
Kohn, whom I began with, who was
then appointed as his deputy.

00:16:30.664 --> 00:16:34.610
And the third speaker I
talked about-- Tim Geithner--

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.400
became US Treasury Secretary
when Barack Obama became

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.190
president of the United States.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.580
One thing you certainly
learn from that--

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.010
and it's relevant to
understanding finance--

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.920
is what another economist
called the unimportance of being

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.420
right in large bureaucracies.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.840
So that's one question
you should raise.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.040
But the other question is,
why were they so wrong?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.200
And they were so wrong
because they actually

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.650
misunderstood the nature
of the risk process

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.239
which they were facing.

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:16.390
Now a French economist
called Michel Albert actually

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.450
was an academic
economist who became

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.050
chairman of one of France's
large insurance companies--

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.780
wrote a paper in
which he described

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.380
two origins of the world
insurance industry.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.730
The first was this one.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.640
This is an image of
Edward Lloyd's coffee

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.150
shop in the city of London.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.730
And in the 18th
century, English gents

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.390
would gather in
Lloyd's coffee shop

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.250
and take bets with each
other on all kinds of things.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.270
They would bet on the
longevity of King George

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.790
I and other grandees.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.990
But one of the things
they liked to bet on

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.300
was actually the
movement of tides

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.020
and the movement of ships.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.110
And this developed in due course
into a marine insurance market.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.990
And you will know that
Lloyd's of London,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.140
which is the institution that
developed out of Lloyd's coffee

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.780
shop, is actually still a leader
in world marine insurance.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.240
The other origin of
the insurance industry

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.810
was here up in
Switzerland, where

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.960
Swiss peasants-- Swiss
villagers-- would

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.200
gather together and agree if
any of their animals died,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.630
the village would club
together to buy a new one.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.400
There were two ways then
in which insurance started.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.310
One was as the result of
people gambling with each other

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.490
on uncertain events.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.940
And the other was mutualization,
socialization of risks

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.600
so that we manage them
collectively rather than

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.120
managing them individually.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.890
And that contrast
between risk trading

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:00.120
as insurance and risk
trading as gambling

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.180
remains important today.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.750
It became very important.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.100
And this is relevant to how
the financial crisis developed.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.684
In the 1990s, when
there was a-- one

00:19:09.684 --> 00:19:11.100
of the financial
innovations I was

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.080
describing that was invented
was something called the credit

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.630
default swap.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.200
And the credit default
swap was essentially

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.800
an insurance policy for a loan.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.630
If you took out a credit
default swap, that

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.240
meant you would pay or get
paid a certain amount of money

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.460
if a particular loan
was defaulted on.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.810
Now the International Securities
and Derivatives Association

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.250
asked the London QC Mr.
Potts whether this activity

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.370
was gambling or whether
it was insurance.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.420
And you can see that
if it was gambling,

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.680
it would be subject to
the kind of regulation

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.280
and tax we impose on gambling.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.120
But if it was
insurance, it would

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.400
be subject to the
kind of regulation

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.320
and tax we impose on
the insurance industry.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.592
Which was it?

00:19:59.592 --> 00:20:03.050
Well, any of you who have ever
consulted lawyers in London

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.420
will know that you will stand
a very high chance of getting

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.300
the opinion you want when you
ask this kind of question.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.750
And the opinion that is wanted
and the opinion they got

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.600
was that it was neither.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.800
It wasn't gambling, so
it couldn't be regulated

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.070
as if it were a gamble.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.660
And it wasn't
insurance either, so it

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.750
wasn't subject to
insurance regulation.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.130
That left the question
of what it was,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.880
but we can perhaps leave
that for a little longer

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.640
in this talk.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.480
And that was important
to the development--

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.860
to the explosive
development, in fact--

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.200
of this market in credit default
swaps over the next decade

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.790
or so.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.560
And most of these
contracts were actually

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.640
written in London because
of this rather benign

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.570
interpretation of English law.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.580
But by 2006--

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.170
Oh, right.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:56.670
Sorry.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.360
I should have mentioned that.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.920
If you want to-- no, we'll
leave that for a moment.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.640
We'll go back to
our Swiss villagers.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.900
What was going on in
the credit default

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:23.990
swap market was pretty clearly--
by 2006-- not mutualization

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.920
of this kind.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.470
It was actually gambling.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:33.620
So there are two mistakes that
these guys at Jackson Hole

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.290
were actually making.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.000
The first was that they
thought they were looking

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.510
at mutualization-- risk
sharing, risks spreading--

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.830
that was actually
designed to reduce risk,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.500
when actually it was
people taking bets

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.130
with each other on what
would happen to packages

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.605
of [INAUDIBLE] mortgages
in the United States.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.770
The second mistake
that they were making

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.040
was a much more
fundamental one, which

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.730
was that the kind of risks
they were talking about

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.820
weren't the kind of risks
that bother ordinary people

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.650
in everyday life.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.660
What bothers ordinary
people are risks

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.550
that are to do with
illness and mortality.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.730
They're risks that are
to do with redundancy

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.160
and relationship breakdown.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.890
They're risks now that are to do
with accident and catastrophe.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.000
And as it happened,
just as they were having

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.390
their conference
at Jackson Hole,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.690
Hurricane Katrina was
blowing into New Orleans.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.740
That is actually
the kind of risk

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.490
that actually matters to people.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.260
And it wasn't the
kind of risk that

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.590
was being talked
about at Jackson Hole.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.590
The risk that was being
talked about at Jackson Hole

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.520
was almost entirely a
risk that had already

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.750
been generated within the
financial system itself

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:58.120
by the kind of transaction
which I've been describing.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.510
So that by 2006 what we had had
got to in this kind of market

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.540
was a world in which essentially
what we had was gambling.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.480
Some of you may have read one or
two of the Michael Lewis books.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.890
There was a recent
one which has partly

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.990
a description of the
high-frequency trading and data

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.480
link from New York to Chicago
I was talking about earlier.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.210
But an earlier book was
called "The Big Short."

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.510
And "The Big Short" is about
one of the most successful hedge

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.950
funds in the course of
the financial crisis--

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.960
a hedge fund which bet against
a batch of subprime mortgages

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.130
in what was called the Abacus
transaction facilitated

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.410
by Goldman Sachs.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.560
And this is the
guy who in the end

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.400
became the fall guy for
that particular exercise--

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.240
a guy called
"Fabulous Fab" Tourre.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.520
And this is him writing
to his girlfriend.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.770
"I had some input
into the creation

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.550
of this product,
which, by the way,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.580
is the product of pure
intellectual masturbation,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.080
the kind of thing which you
invent telling yourself, well,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.570
what if we created a
thing that has absolutely

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.870
no purpose, which is absolutely
conceptual and highly

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.140
theoretical, and which
nobody knows how to price?"

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.260
Well, what you do is you
sell it to a hedge fund

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.630
manager on the one
hand and you sell it

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.030
to a group of dumb
bankers on the other.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.750
And that was exactly
what happened.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.470
That was actually
"The Big Short."

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.400
And that was where Mr.
Potts opinion actually

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.730
took us by 2008.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.700
The key point I'm
making is to say

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.170
that instead of managing risks
effectively, what we have done

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.330
is created, in
effect, a large casino

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.120
for very substantial gambling
of this particular kind.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.860
This is not about
risk management

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.590
in any real sense at all.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.160
It is the activity we were
talking about earlier when

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.460
we talked about passing round
bits of paper to each other,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.830
believing we were all
making profits doing so.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.900
So that's where we are.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.440
What should actually
be done about it?

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.320
Well, when I talk to
non-financial audiences,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.140
like this one, what most people
think is wanted, is surely

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.820
we need more regulation
of the financial sector.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.500
I think that's wrong.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.120
I think regulation is, in
large part, part of the problem

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.630
rather than part
of the solution.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.390
In a funny way,
Mr. Potts was right

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.090
when he said these things--
these credit default swaps

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.660
we were looking at were
neither gambling nor insurance.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.390
Because the reason
credit default swaps

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:49.070
had come into existence
was to exploit the fact

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.590
that the complicated ways in
which we regulate insurance

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.450
companies are very different
from the complicated ways

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.500
in which we regulate banks.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.620
So if you could dress up a
loan to make it look more

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.960
like an insurance
policy, you didn't

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.200
have to provide as much
capital as you would have

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.370
if it had been simply a loan.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.850
That was the purpose of it.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.960
Although, by the time
Fab Tourre was here,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.300
it was simply a form of
very large-scale gambling.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.440
I think we need not
to focus on writing

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.390
evermore complicated rulebooks
for the financial service

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.990
sector, which is what we've
been doing since 2008,

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.740
I think we need to address
two things-- the structure

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.750
of the industry and the
incentives of individuals

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.500
within it.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.620
And unless we focus on
these sorts of issues,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.880
we're not going to get either
meaningful reform, the kinds

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.420
of behavior from the financial
sector which we want,

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.540
or a financial sector
which actually meets

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.580
the needs of the real economy.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.730
What we need to do,
in short, is to try

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.580
and to create an industry in
which its profitability is

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.790
related to its capacity
to meet the needs of end

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.600
users of financial services--
the kinds of function

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.310
which I described
at the beginning

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.270
in terms of payment system,
wealth management, capital

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.130
allocation, and risk mitigation.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.160
And we need to address some
of the personal behavior

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.800
of individuals
within it as well.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.645
This is actually a rather more
senior member of Goldman Sachs

00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:29.680
[INAUDIBLE] being
interviewed in Congress

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.910
about the Abacus
transaction we were talking

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.486
about a minute ago. [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.190
I'd like to end by
what's actually,

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.910
in some ways, a
rather similar video,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.680
but it's quite a lot
older than that one.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:58.020
It comes from the great
wartime film "Casablanca."

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.890
I don't think I can top that in
ending this presentation today.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.136
Thank you very much.

00:28:03.136 --> 00:28:04.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.010
ROB LEWORTHY: So we have a
few minutes-- 10, 15 minutes--

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:12.870
for questions also.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.860
If you'd like to queue
behind the blue microphone

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.020
in the middle.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.880
Whilst you do that, I will
kick off with a question.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.980
How do we educate
the public in general

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.550
about these sorts of
really complicated

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.950
financial transactions
and goings-on?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:35.600
JOHN KAY: Well, a large part of
the story is you don't want to.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.270
Partly in the financial
system as it is at the moment,

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.730
if you don't understand
it, you shouldn't do it.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.780
But I don't know what's
under the bonnet of my car.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.720
I don't want to know what is
under the bonnet of my car.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.440
I actually want to
have enough faith

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.580
in the reputation of
the car manufacturer

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.760
to be able to trust in it.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.690
If I think of what
you guys in Google do,

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.460
I don't want to know what's
behind the Google algorithms.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.540
And I don't have to know what's
behind the Google algorithms.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.570
What I want to do
is see if they work.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.170
And if they work, I'll use them.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.700
And if they don't work, I won't.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.130
That's how the market operates
as it should properly.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.800
You have enough
confidence in producers

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.580
to actually buy products
you don't understand fully.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.400
And if you don't have that
confidence, you don't buy them

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.790
or you certainly don't buy
them from that supplier.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.790
It's not a matter, I think,
of educating the public

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.960
so that they can
penetrate all this.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.710
It's really a matter of
reducing the complexity

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.800
and restoring the reputation
of people in the industry

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.160
so that people can be more
confident in the financial

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.264
transactions which they make.

00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:46.430
ROB LEWORTHY: OK, thank you.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:47.694
We'll take questions now.

00:29:47.694 --> 00:29:48.360
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.780
Thanks very much for the talk.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.770
Given that this behavior
seems to repeat itself

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.020
over many, many years, the
people in those positions

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.280
are-- some of them are
not dumb, a lot of them

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.390
are very powerful-- what
hope is there, do you think,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.750
for us achieving the stability
that you showed in the '60s

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.290
and '70s given that these
people have an inherent interest

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.940
to do something that's in
contrast to most people's

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.455
interest?

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.080
JOHN KAY: It's a very
pointed question,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.080
because I think we all
understand the political power

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.520
of certain parts of the
financial services sector which

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.370
makes meaningful reform
very difficult to implement.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.950
And in the United States, the
problems of campaign financing

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.970
are such as to make
it almost impossible.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.610
I fear that the answer to
that is what will make reform

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:46.320
possible is the next crisis.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.360
And what, slightly
depressingly, I

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.160
hope I'm trying to write in
this book is a sort of manifesto

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.390
for politicians who are faced
with that next crisis, which

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.770
they will be at sometime.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.890
Because one of the things
that went wrong in 2008

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.850
was politicians were
faced with a crisis

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.630
and had no idea what to do.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.030
I've sometimes joked that
left-wing parties in Europe,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:15.030
which had been waiting for
100 years for capitalism

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.920
to collapse under its
own contradictions,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.250
were thrown into
panic by the prospect

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.930
that it actually might.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.680
But that is roughly
what happened.

00:31:26.995 --> 00:31:29.120
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to
know what kind of response

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.016
you've gotten from the financial
industry with this narrative.

00:31:35.216 --> 00:31:36.590
JOHN KAY: That's
very interesting

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.380
because it's a lot more
positive than you might expect.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.920
But the reason for
that is that the kind

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.930
of people in the
financial industry who

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.830
want me to talk to them
about this kind of thing

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.350
are actually the
people of whom there

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:55.495
are very many within the
industry who want to change it.

00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:57.370
That is, I've talked
over the last five years

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.310
to a lot of people, particularly
in the asset management

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.600
business, who are
people who would rather

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.870
like to see a different,
more useful financial sector

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.180
and who feel constrained
at the moment by a mixture

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.880
of the organizations
they work for,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.480
the regulation to
which they're subject,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.080
the expectations of their
clients and customers

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.240
to go on doing pretty much
what it is at the moment.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.080
But frankly, the Dick
Fulds of the world

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.710
are not people who
ask me to talk to them

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.410
and they're not
people I particularly

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.250
want to talk to myself.

00:32:36.837 --> 00:32:37.670
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.660
Thanks for a great talk.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.614
You mentioned not being in
big favor of regulation.

00:32:42.614 --> 00:32:44.530
But when other people
talk about this subject,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:48.440
they often reference
the end or the repeal

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.340
of the Glass-Steagall
Act and the combination

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.220
of investment banking
and retail banking

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.830
after the 1990s as a kind
of very important point

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.330
and something that
we should go back

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.413
to having that division
between investment banking

00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:03.890
and retail banking in
terms of regulatory setup

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.632
to make sure that
that's the case.

00:33:05.632 --> 00:33:06.590
Do you agree with that?

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.300
Or what's your take?

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.758
JOHN KAY: No, I do
agree with that.

00:33:08.758 --> 00:33:12.320
And I'm not against regulation.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.540
I'm against
regulation of the kind

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.440
we have at the moment, which
is the endlessly proliferating,

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.730
complex rulebook.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.030
So the Dodd-Frank legislation
in the United States

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.790
was 1,000 pages.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.260
And then you need tens
of thousands of pages

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.860
to implement that
particular legislation.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.770
What happened?

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.560
We had banking regulation
under what was called Basel I

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.100
and Basel II.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.390
And, of course, the response
when these things didn't work

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.620
was to invent Basel
III, which was even more

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.030
complicated than these.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.140
This is a game that
has no end to it.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.520
We're just chasing our tails.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.020
And since the people
who are regulated

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.540
are typically going to be
smarter than the regulators--

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.340
if only because they're
paid quite a lot more-- then

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.770
that is not going to succeed.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.710
That's why I would
like to go back

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.400
to the kind of
structural regulation

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.880
you describe in Glass-Steagall.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.440
What happened in
Glass-Steagall was

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.630
that it was introduced in
1933 and separated investment

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.600
banking from retail banking
so that the house of Morgan

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.550
was broken up into Morgan
Stanley, an investment bank, JP

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.670
Morgan, a retail bank.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.710
And I would like to go
further and say, what does

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.290
a modern investment bank do?

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.300
It issues securities.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.570
It gives corporate advice.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.020
It undertakes asset management.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.620
It makes markets in securities.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.810
And it trades on
its own account.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.184
And I just listed
these functions

00:34:45.184 --> 00:34:47.739
and I say there's actually
a conflict of interest

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.760
between each of these
functions and every other.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.980
So I would like to see an
industry structure that

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.900
has smaller, more specialized,
focused institutions that

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.270
were, as I described
earlier, trying

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.340
to deliver the kinds
of services that people

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.310
in the non-financial
economy want

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.490
and whose profitability
depends on that.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.740
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.710
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.860
You mentioned that
you want to focus

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.110
on the incentives
of the individual

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.690
in terms of reducing
this in future.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.560
In that vein, do
you think that there

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.800
should have been more
criminal charges leveled

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.840
against people involved
in the financial crisis?

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.015
JOHN KAY: Yes, I do.

00:35:30.015 --> 00:35:33.550
The reason there haven't been
many criminal charges is partly

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.260
to do with the politics
of the industry

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.260
which we've been talking about.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.490
And it's partly to do with
the difficulty of establishing

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.960
that people at the top
of the organization

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.720
actually knew what was going on.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.420
So that when we talked about
that Abacus transaction,

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.560
nobody went to jail for that.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.010
But Fab Tourre was fined
a modest part of his bonus

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.120
for his part in
that transaction.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.780
[INAUDIBLE] and the people
at the top of Goldman Sachs

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.180
didn't suffer anything at all.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.300
Goldman Sachs itself
paid a fine to the SEC,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.730
but that's just a certain
sort of blood money

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.190
really, almost a part of
the cost of doing business.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.910
I think that means
we have to introduce

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.620
stricter liability, which
means you don't actually

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.910
have to demonstrate that
the people at the top

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.120
of the organizations
knew about the wrongdoing

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.370
in their organization in
order to be able to make

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.180
charges and impose penalties.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.530
That's where I think we need to
go in order to make this work.

00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:42.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.430
You just mentioned that
more regulations was not

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.030
the answer for this kind
of white paper passing

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.220
around the room problem.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.820
And you said it was
more about incentives

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.890
and changing the whole setting
of the financial industry.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.570
Can you elaborate
on that and explain

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.945
what your thoughts are on how
we can actually solve that?

00:37:02.945 --> 00:37:04.460
Especially on the second point.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.260
JOHN KAY: Yeah.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.750
I think a lot of
the paper chasing

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.430
is the product of creating
these huge markets

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.660
and secondary assets.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.000
Now some of the way
of offsetting that

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.340
is for people to understand
that in the long run

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.620
this activity is not
terribly profitable.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.090
But a problem we
have there-- which

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.900
is why people gamble in
all kinds of markets--

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.010
is even if it's
not, people believe

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.150
it is going to be for them.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.230
And without changing
human nature,

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.090
there's probably no
way we can change that.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.350
But what we can do
is we can create

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.110
a world which is
much less dependent

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.490
on these secondary markets.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:50.570
What we think of as the modern
stock exchange is, to my mind,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.610
a creature of the 20th century.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.240
Stock markets came into
being in the 19th century--

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.780
in the first instance for
railways and railroads.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.220
The reason was you had very
capital intensive businesses,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.960
like railways and
railroads, and you

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.330
needed to raise these
large amounts of money

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.010
to finance them in
fairly small amounts

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.510
from very large
numbers of people.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.810
And that model was then
developed for breweries,

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.600
for automobile plants,
for petrochemical plants,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.350
and so on over the next century.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.400
But modern business
isn't like that anymore,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.786
and modern finance isn't
like that anymore either.

00:38:32.786 --> 00:38:37.480
Modern business isn't like that
because companies like this one

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.290
are actually cash
generative by the time

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.072
they're even large enough
to obtain a stock market

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:46.500
quotation.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.070
Why is Google a listed company?

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.560
It's a rather interesting
case of a listed company

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.240
in at least two respects.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:01.950
One is it came to market not
to raise capital for investment

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.320
in its business in
the way in which

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.310
these traditional companies did.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.420
It came to market-- if
there was any reason for it

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.710
at all-- to provide a
liquidity event for employees

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.570
and early stage investors in
Google so that they could get

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.030
some value out of
their investment

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.610
either personally or
financially in the business.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.820
There's a paradox there
that the stock market is now

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.080
a way of getting
money out of companies

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.570
rather than a way of putting
money into companies.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.840
And the second way in
which Google is interesting

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.560
is, of course, the
extent to which

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.180
it has multiple share classes
to enable the founders to keep

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.880
control of the business
even though it's

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.280
majority owned by other people.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.110
And the final aspect
of that is to say

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.160
that we don't, in the
main, collect savings

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.360
in small amounts from widely
dispersed individuals anymore.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.540
Our savings are very
largely institutionalized

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.250
through mutual funds,
pension funds, and the like.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:07.930
And that means we can have
much more direct relationships

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:11.330
between asset managers and
the companies in which money

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.740
is invested.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.070
And I think we could and should.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:20.860
And that would be a more stable
way of creating and maintaining

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.350
the kind of structure that there
is in this company where you

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.580
actually have a group
of investors who

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.280
are happy to sustain the
kind of founder control

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.840
which is characteristic
of the business,

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.860
but would also allow them
to change it if that starts

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.045
to look wrong for the future
development of the business.

00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:43.544
AUDIENCE: So are you saying
that the financial sector should

00:40:43.544 --> 00:40:47.060
get inspiration from
Google and how we work?

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.410
JOHN KAY: Well, I
think looking at Google

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.380
and Google's relationship
with the financial sector

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.010
is quite an instructive way
about thinking about the issues

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.620
of this business.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.550
Because one other
important aspect of it

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.600
is that a company like
Google doesn't need to own--

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.170
and mostly doesn't
own-- the assets which

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.450
are used in the businesses
because their office

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:18.090
blocks, their computers,
servers, and so on-- I

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.110
don't know in the particular
case of Google how many of them

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.070
it does own-- but
actually the majority

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.020
of these modern
knowledge businesses,

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.300
very few of the
assets in the business

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.340
are actually owned by
the company concerned.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.010
I was quite amused to discover
that that flagship Apple

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.830
store on Regent Street
is actually owned jointly

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:45.670
by the queen and the Norwegian
government pension funds.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.936
ROB LEWORTHY: We'll take the
last two questions together.

00:41:48.936 --> 00:41:49.731
AUDIENCE: Together?

00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:50.522
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:41:50.522 --> 00:41:52.480
AUDIENCE: Should we speak
at the same time, or?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.200
So my question is--

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.030
JOHN KAY: I think it's me who
was to take them together.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.560
AUDIENCE: So in the last
US presidential election,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.820
it was pretty interesting when
Mitt Romney disclosed his tax

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.760
rate, which was, I think, around
12%, because most of his income

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.560
is obviously from capital
and securities and investment

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.070
income.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.690
If you're a steel
worker in Pittsburgh

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.762
and you pay 25% or 30%, it's
obviously pretty disturbing.

00:42:17.762 --> 00:42:19.470
So what do you think
should governments--

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.970
my question is, how do
you think governments

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:28.475
should tax capital income
versus income from labor?

00:42:35.172 --> 00:42:37.590
JOHN KAY: I think what's
wrong in the United States

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.440
there is-- and I suspect
the main reason Romney paid

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.920
as little tax as he
does is not actually

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.260
to do with lower tax
rates on capital income

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.590
than on labor income,
but to do with the fact

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:56.490
that there are many more devices
for avoiding tax in the capital

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:01.100
income sphere than there are
in the labor income sphere.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.460
And I would like to do
quite a lot about that.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.500
I think I probably
should stop there

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.390
in terms of talking about
this particular issue

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.592
in this particular building.

00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:14.038
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.545
AUDIENCE: Fair point.

00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:19.275
ROB LEWORTHY: Last
question then.

00:43:19.275 --> 00:43:21.800
AUDIENCE: So I suppose,
I think, it's clear

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.610
that there's lots
of things wrong

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.610
and that you'd like to
change and lots of people

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.484
would like to change.

00:43:26.484 --> 00:43:31.390
But as you alluded to, there's
not the political strength

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.170
to do them, partly
because there's

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.390
so much money in the city
and in Wall Street that stops

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.900
politicians from doing that.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.760
And I suppose that
strength would have

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.220
to come from us, the people.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.120
So I wonder, is
there a need for us

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.960
to be educated, like
Rob said, to demand that

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.860
from our politicians?

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.318
Because otherwise I feel like
that asymmetry of information

00:43:53.318 --> 00:43:55.030
of bankers saying,
we know what's

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.380
best, don't get involved, will
stop us from ever changing.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.326
So do you think that's
the reason we need--

00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:00.950
JOHN KAY: Yeah.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.640
I think you're right, when we
have a load of this unfocused,

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.500
as it were, public anger.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.110
I remember going to
St Paul's churchyard

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.480
when the Occupy
people were in it.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.480
And I saw a sign--
a banner-- saying,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.372
ban high-frequency trading.

00:44:15.372 --> 00:44:16.830
And I thought, ha,
at least there's

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.540
somebody here who knows
what he's talking about.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.440
But it turned out
that there was nobody

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.830
who knew what the banner was
about actually in St Paul's

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:26.750
churchyard.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.330
So we actually have
to give some focus

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.390
to that particular activity.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:40.680
And the big fear I have is that
if democratic politicians can't

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.620
give a focus and a channel to
that public anger, what we get

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.870
is what we're seeing
at the moment, which

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:51.310
is people who will support
crazy guys from whatever parts

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:56.650
of the political spectrum
whose main attribute

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.470
and the only thing
they have in common

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:02.980
is that they don't look like
conventional politicians.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.590
So in a way the rise of Donald
Trump in the United States

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:08.870
and Jeremy Corbyn
in this country--

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:12.720
although they could hardly be
more different individuals--

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.150
are different aspects
of the same phenomenon.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.620
And I think it's a very
disturbing phenomenon

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.430
and one where it
is likely to end--

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.290
may end up as it has
ended up before with some

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:26.750
of these crazy guys
actually taking power.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.380
That's what we need to avoid
in order to stop ending things

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.850
on a really depressing note.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:33.500
ROB LEWORTHY: Please join
me in thanking John Kay.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500
Thank you so much, John.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.644
[APPLAUSE]
