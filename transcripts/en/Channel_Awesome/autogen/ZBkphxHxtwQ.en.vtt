00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
Jinora is basically going in and pulling
 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
Jinora is basically going in and pulling
raava<00:18:17.240><c> out</c><00:18:17.570><c> no</c><00:18:17.990><c> I</c><00:18:18.020><c> think</c><00:18:18.140><c> core</c><00:18:18.470><c> core</c><00:18:19.100><c> goes</c><00:18:19.309><c> and</c>

raava out no I think core core goes and
 

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.169 align:start position:0%
raava out no I think core core goes and
pulls<00:18:19.670><c> her</c><00:18:19.820><c> out</c><00:18:19.880><c> but</c><00:18:20.800><c> she</c><00:18:21.800><c> comes</c><00:18:21.980><c> in</c><00:18:22.220><c> and</c><00:18:22.490><c> glows</c>

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:23.179 align:start position:0%
pulls her out but she comes in and glows
 

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:26.049 align:start position:0%
pulls her out but she comes in and glows

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:50.729 align:start position:0%
finally at the point where I've made
 

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.940 align:start position:0%
finally at the point where I've made
that<00:23:51.090><c> connection</c><00:23:51.509><c> but</c><00:23:51.840><c> I</c><00:23:51.989><c> don't</c><00:23:52.229><c> have</c><00:23:52.529><c> two</c>

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:52.950 align:start position:0%
that connection but I don't have two
 

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.619 align:start position:0%
that connection but I don't have two
seasons<00:23:53.519><c> previous</c><00:23:53.789><c> where</c><00:23:54.179><c> that</c><00:23:54.299><c> was</c><00:23:54.450><c> done</c>

00:23:54.619 --> 00:23:54.629 align:start position:0%
seasons previous where that was done
 

00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:58.009 align:start position:0%
seasons previous where that was done
perfectly<00:23:54.929><c> um</c><00:23:55.909><c> in</c><00:23:56.909><c> my</c><00:23:57.239><c> opinion</c><00:23:57.629><c> overall</c><00:23:57.929><c> I</c>

00:23:58.009 --> 00:23:58.019 align:start position:0%
perfectly um in my opinion overall I
 

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.779 align:start position:0%
perfectly um in my opinion overall I
think<00:23:58.080><c> season</c><00:23:58.559><c> one</c><00:23:58.739><c> did</c><00:23:58.979><c> it</c><00:23:59.099><c> better</c><00:23:59.429><c> and</c><00:23:59.669><c> there</c>

00:23:59.779 --> 00:23:59.789 align:start position:0%
think season one did it better and there
 

00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
think season one did it better and there
were<00:23:59.879><c> chunks</c><00:24:00.179><c> of</c><00:24:00.479><c> season</c><00:24:00.840><c> two</c><00:24:00.960><c> that</c><00:24:00.989><c> touched</c>

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
were chunks of season two that touched
 

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
were chunks of season two that touched
upon<00:24:01.649><c> it</c><00:24:02.009><c> but</c><00:24:02.609><c> not</c><00:24:02.789><c> until</c><00:24:03.059><c> right</c><00:24:03.299><c> near</c><00:24:03.599><c> the</c><00:24:03.809><c> end</c>

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
upon it but not until right near the end
 

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.659 align:start position:0%
upon it but not until right near the end
so<00:24:04.349><c> it's</c><00:24:04.559><c> like</c><00:24:04.710><c> we've</c><00:24:05.009><c> been</c><00:24:05.159><c> sitting</c><00:24:05.429><c> here</c>

00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
so it's like we've been sitting here
 

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:08.089 align:start position:0%
so it's like we've been sitting here
complaining<00:24:05.820><c> about</c><00:24:06.299><c> these</c><00:24:07.289><c> things</c><00:24:07.649><c> because</c>

complaining about these things because
 

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:09.589 align:start position:0%
complaining about these things because

00:24:09.589 --> 00:24:09.599 align:start position:0%
the characters have been inconsistent

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970 align:start position:0%
all over the map you know basically just
 

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.349 align:start position:0%
all over the map you know basically just
kind<00:24:14.970><c> of</c><00:24:15.090><c> just</c><00:24:15.330><c> bad</c><00:24:16.049><c> writing</c><00:24:16.440><c> um</c><00:24:16.970><c> you</c><00:24:17.970><c> know</c><00:24:18.090><c> but</c>

00:24:18.349 --> 00:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
kind of just bad writing um you know but
 

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:19.489 align:start position:0%
kind of just bad writing um you know but
when<00:24:18.479><c> you</c><00:24:18.570><c> have</c><00:24:18.809><c> characters</c><00:24:19.289><c> that</c><00:24:19.409><c> are</c>

00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:19.499 align:start position:0%
when you have characters that are
 

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
when you have characters that are
strongly<00:24:19.830><c> written</c><00:24:20.340><c> you</c><00:24:20.460><c> have</c><00:24:20.669><c> a</c><00:24:20.700><c> progression</c>

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.210 align:start position:0%
strongly written you have a progression
 

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.450 align:start position:0%
strongly written you have a progression
and<00:24:21.690><c> it</c><00:24:21.869><c> feels</c><00:24:22.200><c> natural</c><00:24:22.679><c> the</c><00:24:23.070><c> caroler</c>

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
and it feels natural the caroler
 

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.060 align:start position:0%
and it feels natural the caroler
characters<00:24:23.970><c> feel</c><00:24:24.629><c> organic</c><00:24:25.440><c> like</c><00:24:25.679><c> they're</c><00:24:25.919><c> not</c>

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
characters feel organic like they're not
 

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.269 align:start position:0%
characters feel organic like they're not
doing<00:24:26.489><c> something</c><00:24:26.639><c> out</c><00:24:27.029><c> of</c><00:24:27.090><c> character</c><00:24:28.279><c> you</c>

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
doing something out of character you
 

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
doing something out of character you
know<00:24:29.429><c> it</c><00:24:29.729><c> makes</c><00:24:29.940><c> the</c><00:24:30.179><c> payoff</c><00:24:30.599><c> so</c><00:24:30.929><c> much</c><00:24:31.080><c> more</c>

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:31.289 align:start position:0%
know it makes the payoff so much more
 

00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:33.109 align:start position:0%
know it makes the payoff so much more
better<00:24:31.649><c> the</c><00:24:32.039><c> only</c><00:24:32.159><c> thing</c><00:24:32.460><c> I</c><00:24:32.549><c> can</c><00:24:32.729><c> figure</c><00:24:32.909><c> is</c>

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
better the only thing I can figure is
 

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:35.989 align:start position:0%
better the only thing I can figure is
that<00:24:33.359><c> maybe</c><00:24:34.139><c> because</c><00:24:34.499><c> the</c><00:24:34.889><c> side</c><00:24:35.309><c> characters</c>

00:24:35.989 --> 00:24:35.999 align:start position:0%
that maybe because the side characters
 

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:37.909 align:start position:0%
that maybe because the side characters
in<00:24:36.210><c> this</c><00:24:36.359><c> season</c><00:24:36.779><c> were</c><00:24:37.019><c> so</c><00:24:37.320><c> strong</c><00:24:37.649><c> and</c><00:24:37.889><c> so</c>

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
in this season were so strong and so
 

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.940 align:start position:0%
in this season were so strong and so
entertaining<00:24:38.759><c> that</c><00:24:39.570><c> maybe</c><00:24:40.259><c> they</c><00:24:40.529><c> got</c><00:24:40.710><c> too</c>

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:40.950 align:start position:0%
entertaining that maybe they got too
 

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.529 align:start position:0%
entertaining that maybe they got too
distracted<00:24:41.549><c> by</c><00:24:41.580><c> them</c><00:24:41.879><c> maybe</c><00:24:42.029><c> the</c><00:24:42.239><c> fact</c><00:24:42.419><c> that</c>

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
distracted by them maybe the fact that
 

00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:46.460 align:start position:0%
distracted by them maybe the fact that
still<00:24:42.840><c> had</c><00:24:42.929><c> to</c><00:24:42.989><c> be</c><00:24:43.109><c> a</c><00:24:43.139><c> 13-episode</c><00:24:44.330><c> season</c><00:24:45.470><c> it</c>

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:46.470 align:start position:0%
still had to be a 13-episode season it
 

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.009 align:start position:0%
still had to be a 13-episode season it
maybe<00:24:47.149><c> they</c><00:24:48.149><c> just</c><00:24:48.299><c> felt</c><00:24:48.509><c> they</c><00:24:48.599><c> had</c><00:24:48.629><c> to</c><00:24:48.720><c> squeeze</c>

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:49.019 align:start position:0%
maybe they just felt they had to squeeze
 

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:50.690 align:start position:0%
maybe they just felt they had to squeeze

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
in too much stuff when really they could
 

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.339 align:start position:0%
in too much stuff when really they could

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:52.349 align:start position:0%
just cut through stuff here's the weird
 

00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:54.289 align:start position:0%
just cut through stuff here's the weird
