00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
Settle down. I do want to draw your
attention to the fact that the final

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.280
exam schedule is out.
It has been out for about a week.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.420
And the 3.091 final will be on
Wednesday of finals week,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.560
which puts it on the morning of the
15th of December.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.710
It will be a three-hour
extravaganza, a celebration of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.850
learning where you all come to show
you what you have mastered.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:01:03.766
And it is going to be just a grand,
grand time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it will be over in the Johnson
Athletic Center.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I urge you to take a look at the
final exam schedule and make your

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
travel plans, as soon as you know
what your last obligation is.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Because things are going to get
booked, and it is going to be harder

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and harder to get out of here,
certainly to get out at a decent

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
price. Last day we looked at
Electron Domain Theory which allowed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
us to predict the shapes of
molecules. And this is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:21.570
taken from the book.
This is Table 4.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.710
. And I have highlighted in orange.
We worked through some of these

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.850
molecules last day,
the SF6, BrF5, ICl4-.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.990
And then we looked at the series
CH4, SF4, ICl4-,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.140
and we saw how by counting the
number of electron domains and then

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.280
partitioning them into bonding
versus nonbonding domains we could

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.420
proceed in a systematic manner
towards the deduction of what the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:10.806
molecular shape should be.
So that was a productive day.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.100
And I urge you to understand what
is going on in Table 4.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.500
. You can expect that you will be
tested on that at the end of October.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.900
You will have an aid sheet so you
will probably want to know how to

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.300
work through this document here.
Today I wanted to continue this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.000
treatment of covalent compounds.
And specifically I wanted to talk

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
broadly about how we determine state
of aggregation.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In other words,
how do we determine whether

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
something is going to be a solid or
a liquid or a gas?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We have already seen that ionic
compounds, by their nature,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because they have unsaturated bonds
and they continue to allow more ions

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to glom onto the initial starting
point results in a large aggregate,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
tightly bound, leads to crystal
formation.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:56.150
The crystal is the regularity,
but definitely solid formation.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.300
And when you are trying to answer
the question is something a solid or

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.460
a liquid or a gas under certain
conditions, this is the subliminal

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.610
message. You have to compare the
cohesive forces versus the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.760
disruptive forces.
So the cohesive forces are the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.920
binding forces and the disruptive
forces typically are

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.120
thermal in origin.
We have to compare the binding

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.370
energy of the substance to the
general thermal energy.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.620
And that is shown here.
Binding energy, then that gets back

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.870
to the nature.
If it is an ionic compound,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.120
this binding energy is that Madelung
bearing crystal lattice energy,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.370
and it is very negative. For sodium
chloride it is about 787 kilojoules

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.620
per mole. Whereas,
the thermal energy in this room is

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.870
about a 40th of an electron volt.
That is small. Sodium chloride is

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.850
a crystal at room temperature.
Now I want to turn to covalent

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.570
compounds and ask the same question.
What is the state of aggregation?

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.280
But there is a fork in the road here.
There are two types of covalent

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.990
compounds. We saw,
as is shown up here on the slide,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.710
the results when we have just the
single molecules.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.420
But we also saw, at the end of last
lecture, it is also possible to talk

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.140
about covalent networks.
We looked at diamond and we looked

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.720
at graphite.
Now, in the case of diamond and

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.160
graphite, we are in a situation that
is similar to ionic solids.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.610
In other words, we have large
aggregates because the sp3

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.050
hybridization allows for carbon to
bond to carbon to bond to carbon to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.490
bond to carbon.
And so you end up with a large

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.940
aggregate. In fact,
it is an ordered aggregate.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.380
It is a crystal. Diamond is a
crystal, just as sodium chloride is

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.830
a crystal, but both of them are
large aggregates.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.270
And we saw also that the binding
energy in diamond is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.870
very, very strong.
Very strongly negative.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.620
And so, therefore, it trumps the
thermal energy of the system.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.370
So these are solids at room
temperature. How about molecules?

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.120
That's what I want to focus on
today. What is the nature of

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.870
binding in molecular systems?
And specifically let's just take

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.620
one of the molecules we looked at
last day. We looked at sulfur

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.370
hexafluoride. And I told you,
sulfur hexafluoride is a gas at room

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.120
temperature, even though this thing
has a very, very high

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:36.773
molecular weight.
The question we are really asking is

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
what are the forces that would cause
sulfur hexafluoride to bind to

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
itself? And so far what we have
been looking at,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
electron domain theory,
doesn't answer this question at all.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Electron domain theory treats what
is going on inside the molecule.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:52.660
It treats intramolecular bonding.
This is between sulfur and fluorine.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.990
And this is a very strong reaction
and is referred to as a primary bond

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.330
because it is the first bond that
forms. If I look at the world from

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.660
the vantage point of sulfur,
the first bond sulfur encounters is

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.990
this primary bond to its neighboring
flourines. But now I want to ask

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.330
how does this molecule,
which we know is net neutral,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.870
bond to another one like it?
That now means we have to shift,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.620
so state of aggregation is not
determined by this at all.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.370
State of aggregation is determined
by intermolecular forces.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:49.120
And they are different. What we
want to do is look at the

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.660
intermolecular forces.
And, for that,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.990
we are going to go through this
catalog. That's last day.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.330
This is what we are going to do.
We are going to go through this

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.660
catalog. I am going to show you
four different types of

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.990
intermolecular forces,
and I am going to go about them

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.330
systematically.
The first one is dipole-dipole

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:23.660
interactions.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:24.660
And, clearly, this interaction
occurs only between polar molecules.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:36.986
Involves polar molecules.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:38.220
These molecules have a net dipole
moment. We could model them as

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.440
dipoles. And so if this is,
for example, an isolated molecule of

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.660
hydrogen chloride,
we know we have a strong covalent

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.880
bond within the molecule and we know
the shape of the molecule.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.530
It is linear.
But how does this hydrogen chloride

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.610
bond to another hydrogen chloride?
Well, we can see that this is delta

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.690
minus, this is delta plus,
and so this delta minus end is

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.760
attracted to the delta plus end of
an adjacent molecule and so on and

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.840
so on. So this is a dipole-dipole
interaction that,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.920
when the temperature is low enough,
the thermal energy will not disrupt

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:39.840
the bonds that are forming by this
dipole-dipole interaction.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:31.270
So it is operative at low
temperature. And these are all weak

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.540
interactions. Everything I am going
to talk about today is weak by an

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.810
order of magnitude in comparison to
the primary reactions.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:47.080
If we compare ionic bonding and
primary covalent bonding with this

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.360
sort of thing,
this is down at around on the order

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.710
of about 10 kilojoules per mole.
Whereas, up here we are talking

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.140
about hundreds of kilojoules per
mole. These are very weak,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.570
which means that at room temperature
HCl is a gas, sodium chloride and

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.990
diamond are solids.
And the energy in a dipole-dipole

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.420
interaction, I am not going to give
you the full formula,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.850
but I will just give you what it is
proportional to.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.280
Clearly, it is going to be
proportional to the strength

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.390
of the dipole.
Stronger dipoles will bond more

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.190
tightly than weaker dipoles.
And, in fact, it goes as the fourth

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.990
power of the dipole moment.
If mu is the dipole moment,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.790
stronger dipole moments give much,
much stronger interactions than

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.590
weaker dipole moments.
And a dipole moment is proportional

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.390
to what? It is proportional to the
charge and the separation.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.190
If I have more charge separated by
a greater distance,

00:09:50.190 --> 00:10:09.246
I construct a greater dipole,
a dipole of greater strength.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:10:00.550
And in the denominator we have the
cube root of the interdipole

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:06.110
separation. Really,
what we want is very strong dipoles

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:11.660
spaced closely together to give us
the strongest reaction.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.220
The example HCl, I have used this
in some of my own research.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.390
This thing has a melting point --
HCl has a melting point minus 115

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:30.190
degrees C, and the boiling point at
atmospheric pressure is minus 85

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:36.990
degrees C. If we go down below
minus 115 degrees,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:43.790
see, the thermal energy is low
enough that at temperatures below

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:50.590
this value this weak interaction
dominates and we have solid HCl.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.660
Second form of interaction --
And these are all cataloged in

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.990
Chapter 8 of your book,
this one here is a little bit

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.330
premature, but all the books do it
so I will just,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.660
for completeness,
go through it. It is really

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.990
involving solutions.
This one was HCl to HCl.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.330
It is answering the question under
what circumstances is HCl,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.660
solid, liquid or gas? This one here
is called dipole-induced dipole.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.990
This is really two different
species. You can see in the cartoon

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.330
that the left has HCl,
hydrogen chloride, and the right has

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:41.060
argon.
So this is bonding between two

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
different types of species.
For example, if I were to mix HCl,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
which a gas at room temperature.
Argon is a gas at room temperature.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I mix two gases at room temperature,
I have a gas. But at low enough

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
temperatures, I will get a liquid.
And, at low enough temperatures yet,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I will get a solid.
It will be essentially a solid

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
alloy of HCl molecules
and argon atoms.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:55.450
What holds that together?
Whenever you see a solid,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.900
you must conclude that there are
forces that bind the species

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.360
together. Things don't just sit
there because they are lazy.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.810
They are bound. What are the
forces that could bind a condensed

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.270
form of argon and HCl together?
And the answer is dipole-induced

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:23.440
dipole interactions.
This is a bit of a departure,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.330
but it will come in handy in a
little bit. This is present in

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:37.220
solutions of what?
You need one polar and nonpolar

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:44.110
species. They could be atoms or
they could be molecules,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:59.886
it doesn't matter. So how does this
work?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:56.570
Well, here is the nonpolar molecule.
This is argon, helium or one such

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:02.140
methane. Nonpolar.
So it has uniform distribution,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.710
by definition. If it is nonpolar
there is no net dipole.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:13.280
Here is the nonpolar entity,
nonpolar species. If I bring up a

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.850
dipole in close proximity,
what can happen is the following.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:24.420
This negative end of the dipole
interacts with the electron cloud in

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:41.840
the nonpolar species so
as to cause repulsion.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:33.830
This cloud, it's in motion,
the electrons are not potted,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.660
and so the presence of this negative
end of the dipole actually causes

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.490
the electrons to flee.
We get a maldistribution in the

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.330
electrons. And,
in fact, this end becomes a little

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.160
bit electron lean,
electron deficient,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:14:07.920
and the other end becomes electron
rich.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.500
What started off minding its own
business with this symmetric

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.000
distribution of electrons in the
presence of the dipole takes on a

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.500
dipole moment itself.
So this dipole is induced by the

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.000
presence of the permanent dipole.
And now we have some bonding. This

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.500
negative end here now is in a
position to be attracted to the

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.000
positive end of a permanent dipole
and so on and so on.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:25.330
This is how the system operates.
And we know that the energy of the

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.660
dipole-induced dipole interaction
goes as one over the square of the

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.990
interpolar separation.
This is one over the square of the

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:41.330
interpolar separation.
Whereas, here it is one over the

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.660
cube of the interpolar separation.
And, furthermore, we can talk about

00:14:46.660 --> 00:15:04.386
how susceptible elements
are to this induction.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:56.300
I can give you two different
elements. Suppose I have argon,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.610
and next to it I will put helium.
They both have inert gas electron

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.920
configurations,
but helium is small and has a few

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.230
electrons. Argon is large and has
many electrons.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.530
Which of these two,
argon or helium is more susceptible

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.840
to this electron displacement?
You see that it is argon because

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.110
argon is larger. It's squishier.
It is softer. This is hard.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:29.330
This is like a baseball. This is
like a Nerf ball.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:35.550
It can be easily distorted in terms
of its charge.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:41.770
And we call this distortion of
electrical charge polarization.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:16:00.073
Polarization is the official term
for electrical charge displacement.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And so we can quantify the ease with
which electrons are displaced within

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000
a chemical entity by a quantity
called polarizability.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And give it the symbol alpha.
And this is a measure of ease of

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
electron displacement.
And, clearly, polarizability is

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:25.790
affected by --
Now watch the fonts here.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.390
This is alpha. And then I want to
say alpha is proportional to,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.990
I don't know how you differentiate
the two. Alpha is proportional to

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.590
the number of electrons.
In other words, the more electrons

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.190
the more there are to move.
If I only have a couple of

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.790
electrons and I have a couple of
protons, those electrons are more

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.390
tightly bound.
They are less flexible.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:17:06.713
So the number of electrons and also
the size.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
For equal numbers of electrons,
a larger entity will be softer and

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
squishier than a smaller entity.
So polarizability scales with

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
electron number and with size.
We reason that helium is going to

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
be low polarizability.
Whereas, argon will be high

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
polarizability.
Because we have a lot of electrons,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
they have to, by necessity, you know
what the filling sequence is.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:25.140
The more electrons you have,
those last electrons are farther out,

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.280
so the positive charge in the
nucleus has a weaker hold on them.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.420
Therefore, while they are bound,
they are a little bit friskier.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.560
They don't sit in their place.
They move around.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.710
Now, let's get back to homonuclear
species. This is induced

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.850
dipole-induced dipole.
That is the third type of

00:17:45.850 --> 00:18:04.500
interaction. Induced dipole-induced
dipole.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:56.440
This is a really fascinating one.
It puzzled people for a long time.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.880
And it is dominant in nonpolar
molecules. Dominant in nonpolar

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.330
everything. It is dominant in
nonpolar species,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:15.770
atoms and molecules.
And here are some examples.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:21.060
Let's go back. Here is argon.
Now, if you look on your Periodic

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.190
Table, argon has a melting point of
84 Kelvin. And it has a boiling

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.330
point of 87 Kelvin.
And I told you, whenever you see a

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.460
solid, that you have to conclude
that it is held together by some

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.590
force. Let's imagine that we are at
liquid nitrogen temperature.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.730
We take some argon out of an argon
gas cylinder and we flow it through

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.860
a tube. And that tube is immersed
in liquid nitrogen.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:19:05.186
Liquid nitrogen is 77 Kelvin.
Well, that is below 84.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:55.160
The argon is going to solidify.
It is going to deposit on the walls

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.330
of the tube. And after a while I
will have argon ice.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.490
I am sitting there and looking at
argon ice. What binds argon to

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.660
argon? Well, it is not ionic.
It is not primary covalent. It is

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.830
not dipole-dipole.
They are all the same.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:33.260
What could possibly bind argon to
argon?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:27.180
Was it just adhesion because it is
sticky? Why? Well,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:33.360
the answer was given to us by a
German scientist by the name of

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.540
Fritz London. And London said I
think I can explain this.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:45.720
He looked back over here at
dipole-dipole and said we have

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.900
already come to the conclusion that
electrons are in motion

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:57.810
and are not stationary.
He said imagine if we could zoom in

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.450
here with a femtosecond camera and
take a snapshot.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:09.090
Instead of having a uniform
distribution of electrons,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.720
suppose at this instant in time
there is a slight excess of electron

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.360
density here at around 2:00.
Therefore, conservation of charge

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:38.986
dictates that there must be a slight
electron deficiency at 8:00.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:31.400
Well, if this is the case,
what is the consequence for the

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:49.200
adjacent argon?
Well, this adjacent argon says if

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.200
this is electron deficient it is
going to pull electrons in this

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:47.600
argon and make the bottom right here
electron rich leaving the top left

00:20:47.600 --> 00:21:07.000
electron deficient which then causes
"she told her and he told him", etc.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:58.840
So what is the result here?
The result is we have dipoles.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.690
Time averaged, it is nonpolar, but
it is always dipolar.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:10.530
And this is a tiny, tiny dipole.
He called this the time fluctuating

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:16.380
dipole. And it is present in all
systems. Even a sodium ion has an

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.230
electron cloud that is in motion,
and we don't see this in sodium

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:28.070
because the action of this in sodium
is dwarfed by the Coulombic force

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:34.160
which is a thousand times stronger.
But this is the only game in town.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.490
When you are at 77 Kelvin there is
nothing left so this is dominant.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:46.830
And the force that comes out of
this, this attractive force has been

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.580
termed the London Dispersion Force.
And the London Dispersion Force is a

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.740
very weak force.
And, as you would expect,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.910
it is proportional to the
polarizability.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.080
Elements that have big electron
clouds that are weakly held are

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.240
going to be more mobile than small
atoms that have small electron

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.410
clouds that are tightly held.
The London Dispersion energy goes

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.930
as the square of polarizability.
And, as you would expect,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.790
it is a very weak force analogous to
the repulsive force.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.660
We are talking about
electron-electron repulsion.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.530
Where did you see that before?
You saw that in the Coulombic

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.390
derivation with the Madelung
Constant. That is the Born Exponent.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.260
It is a very high number because
this is a very weak force.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.130
If this is the interspecies
separation, this goes as r to the

00:22:46.130 --> 00:23:05.393
6th, which makes sense.
It is sort of Born-like.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:56.360
Now, this actually has another name.
This is not a secondary bond for

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.720
argon. This is the only bond for
argon, so this is a primary bond.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:09.080
As a primary bond, some people call
this a Van der Waals bond.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.450
It is a time fluctuating dipole
which leads to a London Dispersion

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:21.810
Force resulting in a Van der Waals
bond, which for some systems

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:27.770
is the primary.
And it is not that I cannot spell

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:33.330
Van der Waals.
He was a Dutchman,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.880
and that is how you spell Van der
Waals. Here is the situation.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.440
This is the primary bonding in
argon. Go to your Periodic Table

00:23:44.440 --> 00:24:02.480
and look up iodine.
It exists as the diatomic molecule.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
It has a melting point of plus 114
degrees C and has a boiling point of

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
184 degrees C.
Iodine, at room temperature,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
is a deep purple crystal. What
holds iodine together?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
You're looking at it going,
I know, I am going to go back to

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
that Table 4.3 and will tell you
about iodine-iodine.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.610
I am going to write the Lewis
structure. That is wrong.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.220
That has nothing to do with it.
How does this iodine bond to

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.840
another iodine?
Well, what is the catalog?

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.460
Is there a net charge? No.
Is there a local dipole? This is a

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.070
homonuclear molecule that is 100%
covalent. What's left?

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.690
You have electron clouds here
around the two iodines.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.700
Iodine is big.
It is huge. First of all,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.110
there are lots of electrons.
And they have a giant corral to run

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.520
around. And so they are running
around all over the place.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.930
And, at any given moment, the right
side might be a little bit

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.350
electron-excessive and the left side
might be a little bit

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.760
electron-deficient.
Net neutral of course.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.170
And then that is what causes the
next iodine and the next iodine and

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.580
the next iodine.
This is the way you describe.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:35.026
How about this one? Methane. We
saw methane.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:22.620
How do I form solid methane?
When you look at Jupiter you are

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.240
seeing solid methane.
Do you ever sit there and think,

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.870
how is that solid methane held
together? I bet you never thought

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.490
about that. Well,
I am inviting you. Think about it.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.120
How does this methane bond to this
methane? I can see everybody go I

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.740
know, carbon, hydrogen.
It is a polar bond. I've got it,

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.370
it's a polar bond. And you proudly
trot out your electronegativities

00:25:44.370 --> 00:26:03.673
and you tell me what the
percent ionicity is.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:53.380
And I go no, no.
That is wrong. It has nothing to

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.760
do with it. I am asking about
foreign policy and you are talking

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.150
about some state budget.
I want foreign policy. How do they

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:09.530
negotiate with one another?
Well, what is the list? Net charge?

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.920
No, they are neutral.
Dipole? No, they are symmetric.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:20.300
What is left? Solid methane is
held together by Van der Waals bonds,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.790
London Dispersion Force.
Remember that the next time you look

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:31.390
up at the sky and you see Jupiter.
It is solid methane. Here is a

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.990
good example of this in compound.
These are three different

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:42.590
hydrocarbons. It is just carbon and
hydrogen. Here is propane,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:48.190
octane, eicosane. Look, it is just
CH2, CH2, CH2 with methyl terminals.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.060
So they are net neutral.
There is no dipole moment.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.190
They are symmetric molecules.
And you all know what propane is.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.330
It is a gas at room temperature.
It is used as a low-grade fuel,

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.460
boils at minus 42. Octane is the
principle constituent of gasoline,

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.590
which we know is a liquid at room
temperature. And eicosane is a

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.730
solid. It looks like paraffin.
Three different molecules, all

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.860
nonpolar. How do I describe the
fact that propane is a gas,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:36.520
octane is a liquid and eicosane is a
solid?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Right here. Polarizability,
which is proportional to the number

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
of electrons inside.
As these molecules get bigger,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
the electrons have a bigger corral
to run around in.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
It is sort of like a small tank
gives rise to small waves and a big

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
tank gives rise to big waves.
And that is what you are seeing.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Big waves mean bonds. Small waves
means the thermal forces present at

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
room temperature disrupt.
That is a good one.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:54.400
I really like that.
That's a vivid one.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:14.466
Actually, this is out of your book.
This is the whole series. I just

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.200
chose a few extremes.
Here is methane, ethane,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:28:07.600
propane, butane, on and on and on.
And as the molecule weight

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:26.000
increases the boiling point
increases. Why?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:16.400
Because the polarizability is
increasing. But I don't want

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.790
anybody telling me that the reason
something has a higher boiling point

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:25.330
is it has a higher molecular weight.
That is not expository.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.990
It is not mass. It is about
polarizability,

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.660
because mass alone will not get you
the time-fluctuating dipole.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.330
That is what is shown up here.
And now the fourth one. The fourth

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:57.660
type of secondary bonding
is hydrogen bonding.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:52.420
And it occurs between,

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:57.280
as the name implies, hydrogen and
only the most electronegative

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.140
elements. And that is fluorine,
oxygen and nitrogen owing to their

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.990
high average valence electron energy.
There is something peculiar here

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.850
about the combination of high
average valence electron energy and

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.710
the lightest element.
And here is what I want you to

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.570
first be reminded of.
I am showing here that average

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.850
valence electron energy in order.
And we see fluorine has the highest

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.570
of the active.
I know neon has a higher,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.280
but neon doesn't participate in
chemical reactions to speak of.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.990
I know there are subtle differences
in the electronegativity scales.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.710
One of them has fluorine at 3.98.
This has it at 4.19. It is a

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.420
self-consistent set.
So what do we see? Here we are up

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.140
at around 20 electron volts for
average valence electron energy,

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.140
and then it tapers off.
Something magical happens at around

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.420
18 electron volts.
What happens? When we put hydrogen

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.710
in the presence of something that is
that strongly electronegative,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.990
so let's work with the most powerful
example, fluorine.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.280
Hydrogen donates its electron to
the covalent bond.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.570
Fluorine donates one of its seven
valence electrons.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.850
And here are the other six.
And we know because fluorine is

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:36.966
strongly electronegative.
This bond is very polar,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
and we can designate the fluorine
end as delta negative and the

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
hydrogen end as delta plus.
And let's look at this in greater

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
detail. When we start pulling hard
on the electron associated with

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
hydrogen, what is left?
It is not an atom that has its

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
protons in the nucleus and n minus
one electrons.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
In the case of hydrogen,
it only had the one electron.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
And when you pull that electron
hard, what you are leaving is

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
something that is essentially
a proton.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.500
If, hydrogen is denuded of its
electron, it is a proton.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.000
The proton is very special because
the proton has a charge of plus one

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.500
but it has a volume that is tiny,
tiny, tiny. So the charge density

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.000
is very, very high.
Now let's bring up another HF.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Here is a second HF.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
We know that dipole-dipole
interactions happen.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
That was category number one.
So let's start with a simple

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
dipole-dipole interaction.
The negative end of the left HF

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
molecule sidles up to the positive
end of the right HF molecule.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Then the magic happens. You see
this nonbonding domain sitting here

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
on the right side?
Those nonbonding electrons are

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
dangling way, way out there.
And here is this hydrogen over here.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:52.610
And its electron is being pulled so
hard by the fluorine on the right,

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.220
I mean this hydrogen hardly gets
visitation rights to see this

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.840
electron. Here are these two
electrons sitting over here,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.460
and hydrogen is looking over there
and said I hardly get any time with

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.070
my electron. But there are these
two lone pair electrons sitting

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.690
there. And so can you imagine that
there is a force that is set up

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:35.246
between this lone pair of electrons?
Because this fluorine,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
because it has so many electrons,
tends to neglect its electrons. It

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
does not pay close attention.
If you come from a big family,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
you don't get as much attention as
if you were an only child.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Fluorine has electrons all around.
If two kind of stray off, fluorine

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
doesn't care. That is what is
happening. Here is hydrogen that

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
does not have the full impact of its
single electron.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Here are two electrons dangling way,
way out. This is a recipe

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:52.140
for attraction.
And that is exactly what happens.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.420
And so a weak force is established
between this nonbonding pair and

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.710
hydrogen, when hydrogen is found in
a molecule where there is this very,

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.990
very strong pull on its lone
electron. The hydrogen bond is

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.280
established in this following manner.
And this is a very important bond

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.570
because it is found in compounds
involving hydrogen fluorine,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.850
hydrogen oxygen, hydrogen nitrogen.
And let me show you what the

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.540
manifestation of this is.
Here is, first of all,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.640
a cartoon from your book that shows
this weak force.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.740
You see the hydrogen where its
electron has been pulled.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.840
In this case, they are showing
water so this is hydrogen-oxygen.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.940
The electron of hydrogen has been
pulled towards oxygen.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.040
And this distance is about 1
angstrom and this is distance is

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.140
about 1and ¾ angstroms.
So it is greater. I am not

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.240
suggesting that this is a double
bond off the hydrogen,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.340
but it is not something to be
ignored. It is very,

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.440
very strong. And, in fact,
it is about twice as strong as the

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.750
next strongest force here.
It is about two to four times the

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.250
intensity of a dipole-dipole
interaction, so it makes a huge

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.750
difference. And let me demonstrate
that with data.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.250
This is a plot that I inked in.
This is out of your book. It shows

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.750
the series that I am going to show,
but I kind of like this one because

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:10.250
I had a chance to color.
As you know, that is very

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.750
therapeutic for me so I needed to do
this. First thing I want do is I

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.250
want to go across the groups and
show you the impact of

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:21.260
hydrogen bonding.
I used colors of the T,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.790
so let's start with Green Line here.
The Green Line is group 14. And

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:30.330
what do we find?
Here is methane,

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.860
silane, germane, stannane.
The four tetrahydrides, if you will,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.390
of carbon, silicon,
germanium and tin. And what do you

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:43.930
find? As the size of the molecule
increases, its number of electrons

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:48.460
increases, its polarizability
increases. Therefore,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:35:07.586
its induced dipole-induced dipole
interaction increases.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:56.750
And, therefore,
the greater the atomic mass the

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:16.600
greater the boiling point.
Everything makes sense. Now,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:35:04.250
let's go to the next one. The next
one I am going to go over is,

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:24.233
this is group 14, so what I want to
do is go to group 15.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:11.750
That's the Blue Line.
The Blue Line is up here.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:31.133
This is stibnite. This is the
antimony compound.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:19.250
This is arsine, which is the
trihydride of arsenic,

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:39.566
which is used in CVD and precursor
to making gallium arsenide.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
They use this over here in Building
13. Occasionally,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
you will hear the sirens wailing and
people have to evacuate the building.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
It is usually a gas leak of this
stuff. It's good the sirens go off.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
It could be worse if they didn't.
And then we have phosphine.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
This is following the same trend.
As the size of the molecule shrinks,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
the polarizability shrinks.
Therefore, the Van der Waals bond

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:51.150
weakens. By this analogy --
Plus, these are dipole interactions.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.460
These are all trigonal pyramids.
Its sp3 hybridization with a lone

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.760
pair, so these all have a net dipole
moment. And the dipole is getting

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.070
stronger and stronger according to
this formula. And everything is

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:08.380
going great. All of a sudden
ammonia has got this abnormally high

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.690
boiling point.
What is going on?

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:31.446
Well, in the case of ammonia,
it is not just --

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:21.660
Here is ammonia.
It is not just ammonia with its net

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.330
dipole moment that is sticking to
other ammonias.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.990
What is happening in the case of
ammonia is when another ammonia gets

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.660
in the vicinity hydrogen bonds are
forming. And those hydrogen bonds

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.330
swamp everything.
And, therefore, they give strength

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.990
to the system that trumps the
thermal energy and thereby raises

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:49.660
the boiling point of ammonia to
values that are higher than

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.870
arsine and phosphine.
Let's go to Group 16.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.620
We start with hydrogen telluride,
hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.370
fitting the pattern.
Smaller molecules, lower

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.120
polarizability,
smaller dipole moments,

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.870
everything is fine. Then we get to
H2O and it is up at 100 degrees C

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.620
which is higher than even hydrogen
telluride. Why?

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.370
Because the hydrogen bonding is
present in water.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.120
It is not present in the compounds
of hydrogen and any of the other

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.230
members of this homologous series.
If it were not for hydrogen bonding,

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.690
water would not boil at 100 degrees
C, it would not melt at zero degrees

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:33.150
C, and this conversation would take
on a very different character.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.610
We wouldn't exist. So we need
hydrogen bonding.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.070
Lastly, let's look at HI.
This is Group 17. These are just

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:46.530
simple linear molecules.
Hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide,

00:37:46.530 --> 00:38:06.193
hydrogen chloride. There is our
prototypical hydrogen chloride.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
We are just getting bigger and
bigger dipoles,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
higher and higher boiling points.
Finally, we get down to HF which

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
should be the tiniest.
It should have the weakest

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
interaction. And we have a very,
very abnormally high boiling point

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
because hydrogen bonding is
operative. You can see hydrogen

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
bonding and the impact that it has
on boiling point and properties.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And we will return to this when we
talk about conformality in polymers,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:23.070
in nylons in particular.
And certainly when we get to

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.210
biochemistry because our proteins
consist of, among other things,

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.350
hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen.
And those hydrogen bonds help hold

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.490
the system together.
At this point, just to summarize,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.640
we have seen three types of primary
bonding. We have seen ionic bonding,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.780
covalent bonding and,
in certain instances, Van der Waals

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.920
bonding. And things seem to be
working fairly well, but

00:38:47.920 --> 00:39:07.306
then there is data.
And here is some data that I want

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
you to look at.
These are data of electrical

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
conductivity. And up here we have
metals, silver at 10 to the 7th

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Siemens per centimeter,
copper at 10 to the 7th Siemens per

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
centimeter. I mentioned last day
that graphite has some delocalized

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
electrons. It is 10 to the 4th
Siemens per centimeter.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And then we get down to the
insulators. I said diamond was a

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
good insulator. It is
10 to the minus 11th.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:24.280
There is aluminum oxide,
a good ionic compound. And here is

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.570
PTFE, Teflon, 10 to the minus 16th.
The first thing that you notice is

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:32.850
look at the range.
I mean if you look at the range on

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:37.140
the Periodic Table,
look at the range of something like

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.420
density. Lithium has a density of 0.
3, and you have osmium that is

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.710
around 22. It is a range of about
40. Look at this.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:40:05.553
10 to the 7th, 10 to the minus 16th.
A range of 10 to the 23rd.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:53.330
Secondly, what do we know about the
compounds we have seen so far?

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:56.660
Ionic compounds, conductors or
insulators? We know they are

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.990
insulators. They have tightly bond
electrons in stable octet

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:03.320
configurations,
so that is not going to help us.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.660
Covalent compounds. Well, the
network ones are like diamond,

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.990
very, very good insulators. Van der
Waals compounds,

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.330
let's look at that.
How about argon? Do you think

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.660
argon is going to be a good
conductor of electrons?

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:35.853
No way. It has inert gas
configuration.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:24.280
Those are the three types of primary
bonding. And I cannot explain how

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.570
three-quarters of the Periodic Table
has this abnormally high value of

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.850
electrical conductivity.
It sounds to me like we need to

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:37.140
come up with yet another form of
bonding. And the answer is metallic

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.420
bonding. Why is it metallic bonding?
Because it is practiced in metals.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.710
Let's look at metallic bonding.
The need for metallic bonding was

00:40:45.710 --> 00:41:05.153
brought on by the observation of
electrical conductivity.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.500
If we are going to be true to form
in 3.091, we have to look at the

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:45.000
electronic structure.
And the first model that attempted

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.500
to account for the high observed
value of electrical conductivity was

00:40:52.500 --> 00:41:00.000
enunciated in 1900 by a German
physicist by the name of Paul Drude.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:28.570
What he said was he could model a
metal as a mixture of positive

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:37.140
nuclei plus the inner shell
electrons, which he called this

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:45.710
whole mix of the positive nuclei and
all the inner shell electrons,

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:52.720
he called that the atomic core.
And then the valence electrons,

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:58.180
he said, were separate. You have
the atomic core plus valence

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:03.630
electrons which he assumed were free.
That is to say they could move

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:09.080
about the material.
In other words, they were not

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:14.540
associated with any single atom.
We call them delocalized. I think

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:31.480
last day I used the
term delocalized.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:25.800
And we will come back to that in a
bit. This is,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.590
in essence, modeling the metal as a
solid consisting of cores and the

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:37.390
electrons freely moving,
much in the same way as a gas.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:43.190
This was termed the free electron
gas model. In other words,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:43:01.380
a gas of free electrons. And with
this they had some success.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:53.130
They were able to account for such
things as the heat capacity of

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.260
solids. The heat capacity of solids
they could model.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.390
That was good. And I think there
was something else they were able to

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.530
do. But, by and large,
this did not stand up because it was

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:09.660
not quantitative.
If it is not quantitative,

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.790
what does that mean right off the
bat? No Nobel prize.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.930
You got it. No Nobel prize for
Paul Drude. No quantitative,

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.570
no Nobel prize.
We will just put this here.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:27.710
"No Nobel." And it is true.
The people that made really

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:32.850
important insights but they were not
quantitative, no Nobel.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:37.990
So it is not quantitative because
it cannot be tested.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:43.140
And the second thing is it was not
discriminating.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.280
In other words,
if you said assume that something is

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:53.420
metallic, then you continue with the
atomic core and the gas

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.250
of free electrons.
But that is like saying silver is a

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.750
metal and this is how a metal
behaves. But what about the earlier

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.250
question? Why is silver a metal and
diamond not acting as a metal?

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:11.750
Doesn't diamond have a set of
positive nuclei with inner shell

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:16.250
electrons? Why do you choose to
have the valence electrons of silver

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.750
moving around but the valence
electrons of diamond

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:25.410
not moving around?
Well, we know a little bit that he

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:30.240
didn't know because we have the
benefit of Linus Pauling and the

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.080
understanding of covalent bonding.
But, even so, he could not help

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.910
classify insulators and metals.
And so that did not work. We had

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:44.740
to wait almost 30 years for the next
installment. And so when we return

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:49.580
next day we will look at the next
installment of the attempt to

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.150
explain metallic bonding.
And what happens in the 30 years

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.460
between 1900 and 1930?
The quantum revolution.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.760
Clearly, in 1900, in respect of
Professor Drude,

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.070
absent quantum mechanics,
there was not much else they could

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.380
have done. But the next people are
going to stand on the shoulders of

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.690
people who gave us quantum mechanics
and explain why we have metals as we

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:34.913
do. Let's take a look at a few
things before we leave.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:23.850
The unit of conductivity is the
Siemens named after Charles Williams

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.710
Siemens who was quite an inventor.
He was born in Germany but spent

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.560
most of his life in the UK.
He gave us the open-hearth furnace

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.420
which dominated steel-making for a
century, laid the first

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.280
trans-Atlantic telegraphy cable in
1985, and something dear to my heart

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.140
was an early proponent of electric
traction for automobiles,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:46:02.346
no internal combustion engine.
Siemens is this.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
And so the unit of Siemens is the
reciprocal of the ohm,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
which when I was your age actually
was called the mho.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
That is ohm spelled backwards.
This is electrical engineering.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
That is supposed to be funny, but
obviously the SI commission decided

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
mho just does not cut it.
We are going to give it a proper

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
name with a proper recognition.
And, oddly enough, Ohm, whose unit

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
is the reciprocal of the Siemens,
was also a professor in Germany.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:19.470
But, when he enunciated his law in
1827, the linearity between

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.940
resistance and the voltage required
to drive a particular current,

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:28.410
he was so badly ridiculed at his
university that he resigned his

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:32.880
position. As I told you in the past,
scientific change does not come

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.350
easily. I know Professor Ballinger
talked to you a little bit about

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:41.820
Midgley. I want to talk to you
about one other invention of

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.290
Midgley's and refer back to all of
these shapes of molecules.

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.760
I call him sp3 Midgley because most
of his work that we know today

00:46:50.760 --> 00:47:10.786
involved sp3 hybridized molecules.
And I know Professor Ballinger

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
talked about Freon which was a
refrigerant. Midgley at one point

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
joined the Dayton Engineering
Company, which is DELCO,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
which eventually was bought by
General Motors.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
And in 1921 he discovered this
anti-knock agent for gasoline called

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
tetraethyl lead.
You know the structure is 6s2p2.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
You can hybridize this to give us
6sp3. And there are four unpaired

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:23.130
electrons there.
And then we can take the ethyl

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.390
radical and put four of those on.
And so this gets diluted in the

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:31.660
gasoline and goes through the
combustion process.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.930
And what it does is actually
reduces the potency of gasoline.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:40.190
If the potency of gasoline is too
high, when the fuel first goes into

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.460
the combustion chamber and then the
piston compresses,

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.730
remember everything is hot from the
previous combustion,

00:47:48.730 --> 00:48:07.326
the chamber could explode of its own
accord.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:57.130
And, if it does so,
it with ram the piston up.

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:01.260
Everything is supposed to be moving
synchronously.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.390
What you want to do is put
something in the gasoline to delay

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:09.530
the combustion until the spark plug
fires. The sad thing is that there

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:13.660
was a superior chemical known
already back in 1920 which was ethyl

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.790
alcohol. If ethyl alcohol had been
used, we wouldn't have all the lead

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:21.930
in the environment that we have
thanks to the use of leaded gasoline

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:26.080
for about 50 years.
Anyway. This is tetraethyl lead,

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.240
and this was an invention of Midgley.
Now, in the 1970s along came

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.410
catalytic converters which we have
to this day. And these are precious

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:38.580
metal catalysts,
platinum, palladium and rhodium.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.740
But when tetraethyl lead burns the
carbon forms CO2,

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.910
the hydrogen forms H2O and the lead
forms lead dioxide. And lead

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:50.850
dioxide is volatile.
And it goes with the exhaust gases.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:54.570
And it will pass over the catalyst.
And the catalyst's job is to break

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.280
bonds. And so it breaks the
lead-oxygen bond and reduces it to

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.990
lead. And now the lead alloy is
with the catalyst.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:05.710
Now you have platinum alloying with
lead. What do you think the

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.420
catalytic activity of lead is?
Considering the difference in cost,

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.140
I am willing to wager that if lead
had any catalytic value we wouldn't

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.120
be using platinum.
So when the lead alloys with the

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.370
catalyst, it poisons the catalyst.
Hence in the ‘70s the advent of

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.620
lead-free fuel.
All of these things came together

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.870
as a result of the need to deal with
the absence of the tetraethyl lead

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:34.120
necessitated by the onset of
catalytic converters.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.370
Again you see where the sp3
hybridization comes into play in a

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:42.620
chemical that was used for about two
generations. When it came along,

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.870
people thought it was fantastic to
stabilize internal combustion

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.250
engines.
In the end it was dismissed for its

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.750
toxicity to the environment.
The same thing happened with Freon

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.250
12, dismissed after two generations
for its toxicity to the environment.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:04.750
Midgley died about 30 years ago.
He doesn't know any of this.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.550
OK. We will see you Friday.
