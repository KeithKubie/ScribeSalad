00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:01.577
- [Voiceover] Answer
the following questions

00:00:01.577 --> 00:00:03.899
about the solubility of calcium hydroxide,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.955
and they give us the solubility product.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.056
Write a balanced chemical equation

00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:10.796
for the dissolution of
solid calcium hydroxide

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:12.363
in pure water.

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:16.550
So we're going to start
off with calcium hydroxide.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.480
And it is solid,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.825
and it is going to be in equilibrium.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:23.915
When it's dissolved, you have calcium ions

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.296
that have a positive two charge.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:28.478
Writing aqueous here since it's dissolved

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.718
in our solution, a solution of water,

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.749
and then plus you have
your hydroxide ions,

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.733
also dissolved in the water.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.670
For every calcium, you
have two hydroxides.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.948
We see that we are balanced,

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:42.295
one calcium, one calcium,

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.708
two hydroxides, two hydroxides.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:47.634
All right, let's do the next part.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:51.408
Calculate the molar solubility
of calcium hydroxide,

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:53.375
not in pure water, but in a solution

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.752
that already has a concentration

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:57.098
of another salt, calcium nitrate.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.896
It's a .1 molar concentration,

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.973
.10 molar concentration
of calcium nitrate,

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:03.936
which you might recognize

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.794
is a very soluble salt.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.394
It's very soluble, it's a nitrate salt,

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:12.597
which are very soluble.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:13.492
So how do we think about this?

00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:15.837
How do we think about the molar solubility

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:17.276
of calcium hydroxide?

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.412
How much incremental calcium

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.316
can be dissolved when you already

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:22.558
have some calcium?

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:24.555
And for whatever the
concentration of calcium

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:25.438
that gets dissolved, you're gonna have

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:28.712
twice the concentration of
hydroxide that gets dissolved.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:31.637
You might have guessed,
or intuited, or have known

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:34.970
that this will involve
the solubility product.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.616
So the solubility product

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:39.799
is equal to the concentration

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.018
of the product of the concentrations

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.096
of the two things that
actually get dissolved.

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.395
So you have your calcium ions

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.075
and you have your hydroxide ions,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.014
hydroxide ions,

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:52.141
and since you two have moles of this

00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:53.905
for every mole of the calcium,

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.448
we square it just like that.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.238
Now some of you might be saying,

00:01:57.238 --> 00:01:58.584
hey, this looks kind of like

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.826
an equilibrium constant,

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.464
but if we were dealing with
an equilibrium constant,

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:04.041
we would divide by the concentration

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.422
of the reactants.

00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:09.939
And we could have done an
equilibrium constant here,

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.448
used an equilibrium constant,

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:13.608
but the concentration of the reactant,

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:15.511
this is in its solid state.

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.405
If we imagine what's
happening right over here,

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:18.565
we have a block,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:19.505
you can imagine having a block

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.934
of solid calcium hydroxide here

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.015
inside the water,

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.676
and we've been saturated.

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:27.659
So we've saturated as
much of the ions as we can

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.076
into our solution.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:31.955
And so every time you have
some calcium hydroxide

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.116
that gets dissolved,

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:35.195
you have an equal amount that forms

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.076
from the solution.

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:40.233
And so if you were doing
a equilibrium constant,

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.077
you would divide by the concentration

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:45.179
of the solid calcium hydroxide.

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.557
We're not used to thinking
about concentrations

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:49.187
of solids in terms of molarity

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.290
and things like that,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.149
but that's going to be constant

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.786
because if there's any
of the calcium hydroxide

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.944
that gets dissolved, well
the volume goes down,

00:02:55.944 --> 00:02:58.951
and if any gets formed,
the volume goes up.

00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:00.971
So the concentration stays constant.

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.235
The convention is you multiply both sides

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:05.488
by that to get a solubility product,

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:07.311
and that's where the
solubility product comes from.

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:09.435
I'll do another video that goes into much

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:10.573
more depth than that.

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:12.722
But anyway, how do we use this?

00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:14.779
Well, we already have,

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.056
let me write this down,

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:18.343
we already have some calcium ions.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:22.523
So we already have

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:27.523
0.10 molar calcium ions dissolved.

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:32.624
I don't even have to
write dissolved there.

00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:35.422
We already have that in the solution.

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:37.912
We are going to add

00:03:40.077 --> 00:03:43.316
x molar, I guess I could say,

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:48.316
calcium ions through dissolving

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.528
the calcium hydroxide.

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:00.954
And that means that we
would have two x molar

00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:04.158
concentration, I could write it this way,

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:07.090
concentration of

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.158
hydroxide

00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:13.632
because for every,
whatever the concentration

00:04:13.632 --> 00:04:15.117
of calcium ions, you're gonna have twice

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:16.371
the concentration of hydroxide

00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:17.857
because for every calcium molecule,

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.470
you're gonna have two hydroxide molecules.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.738
So how do we use that

00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:24.453
with this solubility product?

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:27.588
Well, you already have
this right over here,

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:32.000
you already have 0.10 already,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.101
and then you're going to add x.

00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:36.061
So that's that right over there.

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:37.663
I think this notation that I wrote here

00:04:37.663 --> 00:04:39.196
might be a little bit confusing.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.356
So bear with me.

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:44.537
So maybe not putting the brackets there

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.512
will make it a little
bit easier to understand

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:49.388
because there's clearly already

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.699
a concentration.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.939
All right, so this is going
to be the concentration

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.019
of calcium ions,

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.832
the ones that you already had

00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:57.132
plus the ones that you add.

00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:00.070
And then your concentration of hydroxide,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.719
well, that's going to be two x.

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:02.531
For every calcium you add,

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.551
you're gonna add twice as many hydroxides.

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:06.920
And of course, you square that.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.253
That�s going to be equal
to the solubility product,

00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:13.351
which they tell us is
1.3 times 10 to the -6th.

00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:18.351
So we have 1.3 times 10 to the -6th.

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:20.992
Now if you try to solve this outright,

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:22.292
it's going to get quite complicated.

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:23.761
You're gonna end up,

00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.103
this is going to be four x squared,

00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:26.159
and you multiply it times this,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.379
you're gonna get an x squared term,

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.284
and then you�re getting
an extra third term.

00:05:29.284 --> 00:05:30.967
Not that easy to solve.

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:33.137
A simplifying assumption that we make

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.205
when we solve these, especially because

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:37.318
this nitrate salt is so soluble,

00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:40.616
much more soluble than this salt

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:43.240
right over here, this hydroxide salt,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.632
and so you can assume this is,

00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:46.572
this part right over here

00:05:46.572 --> 00:05:49.335
is approximately 0.1

00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:54.335
since x is much smaller than 0.10.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.254
That's the assumption you make.

00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:58.054
You have to know that okay,

00:05:58.054 --> 00:05:58.994
well first of all, this is going to be

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:00.562
hard to solve the way it is,

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:02.860
but then the fact that we're adding

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.417
a much less soluble thing

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:08.596
to something that is nowhere close

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:13.415
to saturation, this is a
very high concentration.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.517
We can go back fill to see

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.154
if we make this assumption,

00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:17.617
whatever we solve for x,

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:19.004
if it gets us still pretty close

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.751
to this solubility product.

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.435
So if we make that assumption,

00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:25.779
we get 1.3 times 10 to the -6th

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.099
is equal to 0.10

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.854
times four x squared,

00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:35.081
or we could get x squared

00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.020
is equal to 1.3

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.319
times 10 to the -6th

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.662
divided by 0.10,

00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:45.716
and then times four,

00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:48.185
or we could say divided by

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:56.121
0.40, or we could say that x

00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.094
is going to be the square root of this.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.532
So x is going to be equal to,

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:02.715
let's get a calculator out,

00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:06.384
so we have 1.3 EE

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.124
times 10 to the -6th

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:12.387
divided by .4

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:13.582
is equal to that,

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:15.706
and now we want to take
the square root of that.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:17.262
And let's see, we're dealing

00:07:17.262 --> 00:07:19.108
with how many significant figures

00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:20.141
are over here?

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.069
Well looks like it's about two.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.077
So 0018.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:27.275
So approximately,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:30.472
let me write that a little bit neater,

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:35.472
approximately 0.0018 molar.

00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:38.916
Let me see if that's,

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.384
is that what I got?

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:44.384
Yeah, .0018 molar.

00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:45.863
And so that's our answer.

00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:47.465
If you want to feel better about it,

00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:49.264
you can substitute this back

00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:53.119
into our original equation here

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:54.779
and say, okay, this does still get me

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:56.289
something close to 1.3

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:59.086
times 10 to the -6th.

00:07:59.086 --> 00:07:59.864
And if you try that,

00:07:59.864 --> 00:08:03.464
you will see that that
is actually the case.

00:08:03.464 --> 00:08:05.727
Now let's do this last part.

00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:07.143
In the box below,

00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:09.349
complete the particle
representation diagram

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:11.648
that includes four water molecules

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:13.328
with proper orientation

00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:15.285
around the calcium ions.

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:16.376
Well, the water molecules we know

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:17.571
are polar.

00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.896
If this is the oxygen here

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:19.790
and this is a hydrogen,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.135
this is a hydrogen,

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.191
we have our lone pairs of electrons here.

00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:25.385
So you have a partially
negative charge there,

00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:26.975
and you have partially positive charges

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:29.564
at the hydrogens that get
their electrons hogged,

00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:32.292
and so you're gonna orient it.

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:34.127
So they just want us to draw four.

00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:35.787
So the oxygen end is going

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:39.294
to be oriented towards
the positive calcium

00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:42.033
because you have a
partially negative charge

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:44.262
being attracted to the positive charge.

00:08:44.262 --> 00:08:45.748
So that's one,

00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:48.565
that is two,

00:08:48.565 --> 00:08:51.128
that is three,

00:08:51.128 --> 00:08:52.569
and that is four.

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:55.725
They told us to draw only
four right over there.

00:08:55.725 --> 00:08:56.573
If you want to be clear,

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.246
you can say those are oxygens

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.430
right over there,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.783
and these are the
hydrogens right over here.

00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:05.431
The hydrogens have a partially,

00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.823
that end of the molecule has
a partially positive charge

00:09:07.823 --> 00:09:08.613
so it's going to be repelled

00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:09.913
from the calcium ion,

00:09:09.913 --> 00:09:12.386
and then the other side
that has the lone pairs,

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.023
well, that's gonna have a
partially negative charge

00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:14.870
so it's going to be attracted

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.763
to the positive charge.

00:09:16.763 --> 00:09:18.162
And there you go.
