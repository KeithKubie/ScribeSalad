00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.680
PROFESSOR: Time to learn.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.980
Time to get back to business
here in 3.091.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.500
So let's do the announcements
first. Tomorrow quiz one,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.640
based on homework one.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.310
Ten minutes.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.130
Bring your Periodic Table,
your table of constants,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.280
something to write with
and a calculator.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.330
There's about a dozen or so
copies of the text on reserve

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.305
at the Hayden Library.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:51.740
I want you to be
aware of that.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.350
Now some of you approached me
last day and said is it true

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.580
that we have to memorize
the Periodic Table?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.830
Yes.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.400
But not the whole
Periodic Table.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.340
I know some of you are going
to say, well that's so 19th

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.490
century, rote learning
and so on.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.710
To which I say, you're wrong.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.950
Every educated person should
know that potassium lies under

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.290
sodium, which lies
under lithium.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.180
And you are going to
be educated whether

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.550
you like it or not.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.840
But this is a lot to learn and
so we're just going to look at

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.280
the main block.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.816
We're not going to ask you to
memorize the lanthanides,

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.870
actinides and the
super heavies.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.230
We'll leave that out.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.420
So it's quite straightforward.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.730
We've been doing this
for many years.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.670
This is from 2004.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.870
And it's not that hard.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.420
I give you the blank here.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.570
And I even put the numbers
on for you.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.620
And all you have to do
is add the two-letter

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.680
or one-letter symbol.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840
You don't have to give me the
full name of the element.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.805
You don't have to get
me its density or

00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:52.080
its electron affinity.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.490
You've just got to put
argon, in there.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.980
Ar.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.160
That's all you've got
to put in there.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.420
OK?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.740
And every year people grouse
when I announce this.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.930
But you'll find out that you'll
breeze through it.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.080
You'll have 10 minutes.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.920
This will be on September 24.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.460
So next week there will be
two minor celebrations.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.540
One on Tuesday and
one on Thursday.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.290
So it's going to be a
very festive week.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.350
And people blast through it.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.220
It's one mark off for every
error down to zero.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.960
We don't give negative scores.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.200
And people just go
right through it.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.160
And then they urge me
to make sure that in

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.400
future years I victimi--

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.250
I mean I ask students
to continue this.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.100
People are very proud of the
fact they know the S, P, and D

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.090
blocks of the Periodic
Table by memory.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.580
But I don't want to neglect,
disrespect the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.310
lanthanides and actinides.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.060
So we're going to have
two contests.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.420
Mnemonics to help remember
the names of the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.700
lanthanides and actinides.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.850
That's tricky to remember.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.590
So these are mnemonics
contests.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.460
So here are some examples.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.650
Here's one, see lanthanum,
cerium, praseodymium,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.440
neodymium and so
on, all right?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.040
Obviously this one came from
industry because of the slur

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.430
against the Academy.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.910
Obviously, somebody in industry
has no idea how hard

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.770
we work here.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.560
And plus, look at this: "to
dramatically help".

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.010
This gigantic split
infinitive.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.213
Clearly, clearly someone
from industry.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.142
Here's another one that would
help you memorize, I think.

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:38.410
Now, this is obviously not
referring to 3.091.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.730
It must be referring
to some other

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.636
chemistry professor here.

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:43.490
I'll let that go unchallenged.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.570
Now, occasionally people
ratchet up.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.020
And this was about six, seven
years ago, a young man by the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.120
name of Blake Stacey, who was
aware of the fact that there

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.560
are 14 lanthanide elements
because there

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.750
are fourteen F electrons.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.570
And an Elizabethan sonnet
has 14 lines.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.500
And so he took Sonnet 57 by
Shakespeare in reference to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.250
the fact that lanthanum
is element 57.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.120
And he wrote this in reference
to Sonnet 57.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.690
And, of course, he knew he was
going to win when he made

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.520
samarium the word smelting,
and being the chemical

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.420
metallurgist I am, he had
me at the fifth line.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.040
Actually, I showed this to
Professor Sonenberg in

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.760
Humanities, and she said,
actually, this is pretty good.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.900
That's one of those times you
look at and say, you wouldn't

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.100
see this at Harvard.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.200
So now I'm going to
show you one.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.360
Sometimes people ratchet up.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.980
A couple of years ago,
there was a video.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.150
So let's take a look
at that one.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.720
PROFESSOR: And she goes through
various poses as a

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.040
superhero of different
elemental value.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.140
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.800
PROFESSOR: But we don't
have that much time.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.680
So anyways, September
25, 5:00 p.m.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.340
Eastern Daylight Time.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.940
Submit your entry, whether it's
the big canisters of the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.120
Hollywood footage or
whether it's just a

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.090
14-line mnemonic device.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.700
And the prizes--

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.090
it's a contest, there
are prizes--

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.680
I have ties and scarves from the
American Chemical Society.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.810
PROFESSOR: What are
you laughing at?

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.170
These things!

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.730
Now look at me!

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.850
This is going to be stylish.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.490
They're black.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.540
They've got elements from the
Periodic Table on them.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.410
Very hot.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.110
Very hot.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.030
They're black.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.540
They look great.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.390
And we're going to present
them on the Friday of the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.700
parents' weekend because the
parents eat this stuff up.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.010
So now I think it's time to
get back to learning.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.280
So last day we ended with the
stoichiometry, and I showed

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.290
you the Kroll process,
how to make titanium.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.220
So the question that we never
got to was how do we tell that

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.980
magnesium has a higher affinity
for chlorine than

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.010
titanium does?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.130
How do we know that magnesium
is going to reduce titanium

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.490
tetrachloride to a sponge?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.290
So for that we have to
look inside the atom.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.590
We have to look inside
the atom.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.510
So that's what we're going
to start doing today.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.400
And we're going to begin,
as often we will,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.390
with a history lesson.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.680
So let's go back for a status
report around the end of the

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.650
19th century.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.740
So what did we know towards the
end of the 19th century?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.460
The atom is electrically
neutral.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.802
The negative charge is
carried by electrons.

00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:57.350
We knew that there was some
carrier of negative charge.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.850
We knew further that this
electron is very, very tiny.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.870
Small mass.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.580
And so if it has a very small
mass, then by difference, then

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.560
the bulk of the mass of atom
must be contained in the

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.330
positive charge.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.860
So now the question is, what is
the spatial distribution of

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.930
charge inside an atom?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.440
You might say, well why do
we want to know that?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.930
Well, we're trying to get a
physical model of the atom so

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.980
that then we can start to
address the question of

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.410
chemical reactivity.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.130
So we have got to know where all
the players are before we

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.370
can attribute action to them.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.720
So let's now take a look
at models of the atom.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.330
For the first modern model
of the atom we go to J.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.570
J.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.820
Thompson.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.710
J.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.940
J.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.590
Thompson, he was a professor of
physics and director of the

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.566
Cavendish lab at Cambridge
University.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.170
The other Cambridge.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.480
Cambridge University.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.620
And this Cavendish Lab was named
after Henry Cavendish.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.640
The same one who is credited
with the discovery

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.060
of hydrogen in 1766.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.500
He never married, and when he
died he bequeathed this

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.920
fortune to Cambridge University,
and they took that

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.060
money and established a physics
laboratory, which is

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.110
still in operation
to this day.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.380
So what did J.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:39.570
J.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.430
Thompson tell us?

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.580
He said the electrons were
distributed throughout a

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.360
uniformly charged positive
sphere of atomic dimensions.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.410
So that's the text.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.500
Now let's make this cartoon,
because that makes more sense.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.920
Visualize it a little
bit better.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.320
So it looks a little
bit like this.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.350
So here's a sphere of
atomic dimension.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.570
Electrons are these tiny little
things distributed

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.130
throughout the positive
sphere.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.570
And this is massive because
the electrons have

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.940
very, very low mass.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.530
And just to be clear, there
are no protons.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.660
No protons.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.740
So this isn't positive.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.440
It's a positive chargeness.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.240
It's just a big positive blur.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.140
And then the little
electrons inside.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:12.010
So the electrons are negative,
and they're tiny and low-mass,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.260
and they're mobile.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.450
He didn't say much about how
they move, but you can imagine

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.870
that they move, and maybe
they even spin.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.540
And so on.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.820
And this was known as the
Plum Pudding Model.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.550
There's a big cultural
bias here.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.610
So even though I grew up in
British Canada, I never had

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.950
this stuff.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.540
But my understanding is plum
pudding is this dish that's

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.620
served at holidays and
Christmas-time.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.660
So the custard is the charge,
the positive charge.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.010
And these little bits of fruit
are the electrons.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.650
And they're throughout.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.970
At Christmas-time, they
might even put

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:52.930
little charms in here.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.910
Like a little wishbone or
something for good luck.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.510
And you pull it out and all
that kind of stuff.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.080
Yeah that's merry,
old England.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.370
So this is the Plum
Pudding Model.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.080
And that's what was in place.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.150
By the way, we've been using
the term electron, but J.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.880
J.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.630
did not like the
term electron.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.090
Actually, he won his Nobel
Prize for the-- quote,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.160
unquote-- the discovery
of the electron.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.800
Just as Cavendish didn't
discover hydrogen, he

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.020
characterized it.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.270
J.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:21.460
J.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.560
Thompson characterized
the electron.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.630
What did he in particular
characterize?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.890
He characterized the
charge-to-mass ratio.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.930
He made the first quantitative
measure of the charge-to-mass

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.180
ratio of the electron.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.210
But he never used the
term, electron.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.550
He called it the corpuscle.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.190
He called it the corpuscle of
electrical charge, whereas

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.700
this is really sort of
an elementary charge.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.970
The corpuscle.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:05.500
And fortunately there was
another British chemist. In

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.070
fact, he was an electrochemist.
His name was

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:13.230
John Stoney, who, while I think
that Thompson was a

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.420
brilliant man, I wasn't crazy
about his literary choices.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.420
And it was Stoney who said,
let's call the term electron,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.050
coming from the Greek term,
elektra, which is the Greek

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.040
word for amber.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.810
And you know if you rub amber,
you'll build up static

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.880
charge, and so on.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.730
That's where we got
the electron from.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.000
So that looks pretty good.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.450
So that's our theory.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.670
And what happens next?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.130
Well, what happens next is that
we've got to put this

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.530
theory to the test. And the
person who puts the theory to

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.285
the test is a man by the name
of Ernest Rutherford.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.350
Rutherford was an interesting
character.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.530
He came from New Zealand and
he was born on a farm.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.990
It was a family with
12 children.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.580
You notice Mendeleyev came from
a family of 14, this guy

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.750
comes from a family of 12.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.680
So you learn how to survive.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.170
He worked on a farm so he was
very handy, and that came in

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.010
to play as his career
progressed.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.080
He was a brilliant
experimentalist. He was able

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.870
to do experiments where
others failed.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:32.400
And he did this experiment where
he was a professor of

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:42.840
physics at Victoria University
in Manchester in the UK.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.570
Now, he came out of New Zealand,
got a scholarship to

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.920
study at Cambridge University.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.340
And he was actually a research
student for J.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.540
J.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.530
Thompson.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.720
And he conducted his thesis
research under J.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.500
J.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.250
and during that time his thesis
research was about the

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.125
properties of charged
particles.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.200
And they were very interested
in gases and radioactive

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.500
elements, ionizing radiation,
the whole thing.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.070
The Cavendish lab was a
beehive of activity.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.670
And what he did under his PhD
was he understood both the

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.080
alpha particle and the
beta particle.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.100
First, he identified
what they are.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.040
The alpha particle
was determined to

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.780
be the helium nucleus.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.700
So this is helium that's lost
both of its electrons.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.000
So it's just protons and
neutrons in the nucleus.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.930
Completely naked.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.050
No electrons.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.380
And then the beta particle,
which other people in physics

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.240
had been referring to this
mysterious beta particle, he

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.850
made the connection
between the beta

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.080
particle and the electron.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.220
So the same electron that's over
here and attributed to

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.580
the negative charge within the
nucleus is also a free

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.060
particle that can go
through space.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.190
And these are taken
from your reading.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:15.360
And you can see that if you send
the particle beam through

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.120
a charged plate, the negative
plate here being the lower

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.830
plate, the positive particle,
which in this case is the

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.940
alpha particle, will bend down
towards the negative plate.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.740
And the negative particle, being
the free electron, is

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.680
bent in the opposite
direction.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.710
So these are the kinds of
experiments they would do.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.730
And they also looked
at their ability to

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.600
penetrate different media.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:46.905
So when it comes to their
ability to penetrate solids,

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.500
they differentiate themselves.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.760
So they alpha particle
is quite poor

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.020
at penetrating solids.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.230
So you see in the cartoon there,
the alpha particle is

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.600
stopped even by that little
sheet of paper.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.610
So it doesn't do so well here,
whereas the beta particle, the

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.760
electron, can go zooming right
through the paper and is

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.040
stopped by the lead.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.860
And then over here they were
also studying their ability to

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.690
ionize gases.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.190
So if you take a gas and you
bombard it with alpha

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.230
particles, will you get
a lot of ionization?

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.150
Yes or no, et cetera.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.830
And what they found was that it
was a complementary, that

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.150
the alpha particle is pretty
good at ionizing gases,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.900
whereas the beta particle is
poor at ionizing gases, and in

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.680
fact, is stopped.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.220
This is why, if you
have an electron

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.320
beam you need a vacuum.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.380
Otherwise, the electron will
be dissipated in very, very

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.440
short order.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.130
So after doing this
work with J.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.660
J., he got a teaching job
in Canada at McGill

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.770
University up north.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.530
And while he was there he
continued to do work on the

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.510
origin of alpha particles and
won the Nobel Prize for his

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.800
work while he was at McGill.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:01.380
And so when he determined that
the alpha particle origin in

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:13.720
the decomposition, the
disintegration of elements.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.300
And believe it or not, in this
work back in 1906, 1907, he

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.530
was already anticipating nuclear
fission because he was

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.080
saying that if you put thorium
or polonium into a tube, you

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.610
can expect that it will
emit alpha particles.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.150
Well, conservation of mass
says they have got to be

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.080
coming from somewhere.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.450
And if they're not coming from
out here, they have got to be

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.620
coming from inside.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.670
This was brilliant work.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.930
This is Rutherford, young man
in Montreal, gets the Nobel

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.730
Prize in 1908.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.930
And then he goes to Victoria
University, and he sets up

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.640
this experiment.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.760
Critical experiment.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.940
I mean, imagine this guy.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.550
I mean, he's already got
the Nobel Prize.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.670
He could just put his feet up.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.590
No, he keeps going.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.610
So this is the experiment.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.740
It's called the
Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.650
experiment.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.340
Because Rutherford was the
brains behind it and Geiger

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.060
and Marsden were the
guys in the lab.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.390
And so here's the experiment.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.670
So what he's going to do is he's
going to put this model

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.370
to the test. We're going
to see if this model

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.690
makes sense or not.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.270
So he's got a gold foil-- now
they used different elements,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.430
but ultimately they loved gold
because gold, first of all, is

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.800
noble and it doesn't oxide.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.830
So it's pure, even in
atmospheric oxygen.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.450
And secondly, we've known
since antiquity we can

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.030
physically deform gold and
make it into something

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.830
sub-paper thin.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.610
So that's what they did.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.670
They beat this thing
down to 600

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.990
nanometers thick, 0.6 micron.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.610
And they used alpha
particles here.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.840
Radium, polonium, thorium as
the source in the lead

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.890
container and so on.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.330
And this stream of alpha
particles comes zooming out at

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.450
energies of 7.68 million
electron volts per particle.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.930
So this is like a cannon with
a pumpkin in front of it.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.610
And they're going to shoot
these at the foil.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.280
So what's the purpose here?

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.610
They want to see what's
going on.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.230
And if you imagine that we are
shooting alpha particles,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.410
which are positive, and I've
got a wall here of all of

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.250
these nuclei that are
essentially positive

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.780
chargeness, uniformly
distributed with these tiny,

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.980
tiny little electrons of almost
no mass, you'd expect

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.090
that most of these particles are
just going to go zooming

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.350
on through.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.800
Beyond a certain thickness,
I might start seeing some

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.650
attenuation.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.010
But if I get the gold film
really thin, I should just go

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.820
blasting these all through.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.510
Well, what they find
is, two things.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.260
First of all, most of the
particles do go through.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.450
When they go through, they're
deflected a little bit.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.870
They don't just go through,
they are deflected.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.220
And most of them are deflected
through low angles.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.020
But a small number of them are
deflected through high angles.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.190
They almost go straight
back at the source.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.790
So if you've got that set of
data, that doesn't support

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.480
this model.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.950
This model cannot be sustained
in the light of those data.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.180
It's a very important
experiment.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.560
By the way, how do they
count these things?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.420
Well, Geiger is the
same guy who give

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.620
us the Geiger counter.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.320
Geiger was a technician that
worked for Rutherford.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.710
And he developed this screen,
they called it a

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.650
scintillation screen.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.590
It was coated with
zinc sulfide.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.050
And so when alpha particles
bounced and they hit the

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.560
screen, they would excite
electrons in the screen and

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.690
then cause a scintilla,
a spark.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.230
And then what you do is you just
get a graduate student or

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.340
some other source of abundant,
cheap labor-- and you have a

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.340
whole bunch of graduate students
sitting here-- and

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.700
they count.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.980
That's how it was done in
good old days, 1909.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.190
And so they counted what
the distribution was.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.206
So that's the experiment.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.500
So this is taken
from your book.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.370
So this what you'd expect.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.520
And this is what they saw.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.850
So this is small angles and
this is large angles.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.280
Theaters of the angle here.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.530
Now Marsden, who's the third?

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.310
There's a third person.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.980
Marsden.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.180
Marsden's not too different
from you.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.120
Marsden was about 20 years
old at the time.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.565
He dropped out of school and
then he came to Rutherford,

00:21:26.565 --> 00:21:28.640
and he said, I'm looking
for a job.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.590
In those days, you couldn't
return to college.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.260
If you dropped out, finished.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.910
You had to stay all
the way through.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.380
Once you dropped out, they
slam the door behind you.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.620
But Rutherford, he
was different.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.090
He looked at people
on the basis of

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.570
their intrinsic value.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.220
He didn't care about title.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.640
And so he said to Marsden,
OK, you want to do

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.630
something for me?

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:54.240
Here's your question, I like you
to imagine an alternative

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.880
model of the atom.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.460
And here's the alternative
model of the atom.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.380
What Rutherford said was,
suppose instead, if this is

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.360
the dimension of the atom,
instead of having positive

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.020
charge uniformly distributed,
he said, what if we have

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.340
positive charge concentrated at
one point and then out here

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.730
we have the negative charge?

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.230
So here's the positive charge.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.525
And here's a whole bunch
of negative charge.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.480
And now here's the next one.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.800
And here's the next one.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.780
And so on.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.820
And now we're going to shoot
these helium nuclei.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.130
See what's in between here?

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.500
This is a void, taking
from Democritus.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.750
And so now if I shoot the
positive helium nuclei here,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.910
if they get close
to this positive

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.090
charge they'll be deflected.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.190
If they don't get close to the
positive charge, they just go

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.020
right through.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.180
And once in awhile they get
almost on axis, in which case

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.600
they fling back.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.900
This model would be consistent
with the data set I just

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.850
showed you.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.290
And then to go further, he says
to Marsden, I'm going to

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.140
tell you what the distribution
of high-angle scattering was,

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:15.320
you tell me what is the ratio
between the radius of the

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.550
nucleus, where the positive
charge is to the-- excuse me,

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.520
I'm showing you the diameter, so
this is the diameter of the

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.570
nucleus versus the diameter
of the atom.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.310
What would be the ratio
of the two?

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.910
I mean, it's gold, so I know
I got 79 plus here.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.580
And I've got 2 plus.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.880
And I've got a 79 plus.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.720
What would be the size of the
sphere of 79 plus that would

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.250
deflect something of 2 plus
through this angle?

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.160
So that's Marsden.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.210
It's not bad for a kid that's
been out of school for a

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:48.820
couple of years.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.090
That's his problem.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:51.650
So he did.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.580
He did the calculation.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.710
He did the calculation and
Marsden figured out that the

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:07.440
radius of the nucleus to the
radius of the atom is on the

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.840
order of about 1 to 10,000.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.390
That means most of the
gold foil is void.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.030
Most of the gold foil
is nothing.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.160
And you've got all this
mass, highly dense,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.400
concentrated here.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.270
So this is the Rutherford model,
which was called the

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.520
nuclear model.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.230
This was proposed by Rutherford
because it has such

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.580
a thing is a nucleus.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.570
He coined the term, nucleus.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.500
So that's a big step forward
from this thing here.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.220
So you'd think that the physics

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.510
community would be ecstatic.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.570
That now we've got a model that
squares with the data.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.810
Well, what do you think the
reaction to Rutherford's

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.660
announcement was?

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.660
Condemnation.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.140
Derision.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.080
People didn't like it.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.840
They laughed at him.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.600
They said, well,
this is crazy.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.610
There's a couple of problems
with this.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:20.270
So strong negative reaction
to Rutherford's model.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.450
And here the two major
objections that people posed.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.600
First of all, they talked
about nuclear collapse.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:35.530
They said if you've got a system
of negative particles

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.580
revolving around a positive
nucleus, electrostatic forces

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.800
are going to cause them to
be drawn to one another.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.520
What's going to keep the
electrons from collapsing into

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.060
the nucleus?

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.410
That was the first objection.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.800
Coulombic attraction.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.780
Coulombic, electrostatic,
same thing.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.710
If you want to use a man's
name, Coulombic.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.740
If you don't want to use a man's
name, electrostatic.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:05.930
Coulombic attraction between
plus and minus.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.560
And the second one was, OK,
suppose for some reason we

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.810
don't understand that the
electron doesn't collapse, it

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.530
stays in orbit, it's still
not going to work.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.350
Because you run out of energy.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.320
If you take a charged particle,
a charged particle

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.000
that accelerates consumes
energy.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.560
Acceleration, as you know, can
mean either change in speed or

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.910
change in direction.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.660
So if the electron is revolving
at a constant speed,

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.530
it has to change direction;
otherwise, it will

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.040
fly out of the room.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.160
So changing direction means
acceleration, which means what

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.410
keeps the energy in
the electron?

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.970
Why doesn't the electron
just run out of

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.080
energy and just stop?

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.120
Even if you can prevent
it from collapsing,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.000
it will just stop.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.905
So this is the problem
of energy deficit.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.760
Energy deficit.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.110
Well, what powers
the electron?

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.405
What powers the accelerating
electron?

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.540
So that's a problem.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.960
So now the story continues.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.680
The next chapter is 1912.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.130
Because this is 1911.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.420
In 1912, a young Danish
businessman by the name of

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.590
Niels Bohr.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.770
Niels Bohr just finished his PhD
in Copenhagen and he got a

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.700
fellowship from the Carlsburg
Brewery Foundation.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.540
Carlsburg Brewery put up
money for science.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.310
So he won a Carlsburg
fellowship.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.790
And he was a young physicist.
And he knew that in the UK

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.700
there was a controversy brewing
between the model of

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.350
Rutherford and the model of J.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.550
J.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.320
Thompson.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.190
So he says, you know what
I'm going to do?

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.710
I've got a year, I got money.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.250
I'm going to spend six
months with J.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.430
J.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.790
Thompson, I'm going to spend
six months with Ernest

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.580
Rutherford.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.110
And that's what he did.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.910
So he goes and he spends
six months at the

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.180
Cavendish lab with J.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:08.890
J.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.660
and then he goes up to
Manchester and he spends three

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.150
months at Manchester
with Rutherford.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.280
Why didn't he spend
six months?

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.920
Because he got a job offer and
he went back to Copenhagen to

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.170
start his teaching duties.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.090
And what he did is
he developed a

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.240
quantitative model for us.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.310
He developed a quantitative
model.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.540
And that's all part of what I
showed you the other day.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.050
We recognize patterns.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.760
That's what the Rutherford,
Geiger, Marsden

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.660
experiment gave us.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.320
The pattern of the distribution
of alpha particle

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.380
deflections.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.380
So now we need to develop a
quantitative model that will

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.370
explain the observations, and
if it's a really good model,

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.770
it will make predictions that,
again, can be tested by

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.360
experiment.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.640
So we ratchet back and forth
between experiment, model.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.670
Experiment, model.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:10.520
So he proposes the model,
not with J.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.210
J., because J.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.720
J., I don't know what
he did there.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.890
This is where he wants
to propose the model.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.140
Quantitative model.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.950
To Rutherford's atom.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.890
Let's take a look at what
we've got there.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.830
Now, big lesson here.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.500
How do you announce a model?

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.870
You don't put an ad
in the newspaper.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.630
This is the scientific
literature.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.830
This is not Google.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.980
This is not Wikipedia.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.830
This is a primary source.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.660
This is how science
is communicated.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.010
So this is a journal.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.180
It's called Philosophical
Magazine

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.760
and Journal of Science.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.790
It goes all the way
back to the 1600s.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.860
In fact, when I was a freshman
at the University of Toronto

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.360
we had copies of Phil
Mag going back all

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.980
the way to the 1600s.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.810
And these were not facsimiles,
these were real copies.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.920
And I was in the stacks and I
was reading something by--

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.280
I don't know--

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.310
Lord Kelvin, you know late
1800s, and I said gee, well,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.470
if I've got Lord Kelvin, then
maybe I can go over here to

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.580
the early 1800s and read Humphry
Davy and, gee, if can

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.260
keep going, and going and I
pull out a leather-bound

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:30.320
edition of Phil Mag from the
1660s, and I open the book and

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.530
there's a paper about gravity
by Isaac Newton.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.510
And that's how science
is communicated.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.490
So I urge you to go
to the library and

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.610
read primary sources.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.280
Most of this stuff is
available online.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.100
You can just sit at
your desk and you

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.520
can zoom in to history.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.860
So this is Phil Mag and
this is London,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.630
Edinburgh and dublin.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.490
See this is 1913, so Ireland
was not a free state yet.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.680
So Dublin was a British city.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.420
London, Edinburgh, Dublin.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.920
There's a close-up of it.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.990
July 1913, On the Constitution
of Atoms and Molecules by

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.430
Niels Bohr, Doctor of
Philosophy, Copenhagen.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.030
And it was communicated by
Professor Ernest Rutherford,

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:20.910
FRS, Fellow of the
Royal Society.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.260
So, let's read.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.960
It's in English.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.080
In order to explain results of
experiments on scattering of

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.160
alpha rays by matter, Professor
Rutherford has given

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.790
a theory of the structure
of atoms. You

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.930
see the dagger here?

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.790
Down here, Ernest Rutherford,
Phil Mag, duh-duh-duh-duh.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.810
There's a citation.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.900
See, attribution.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.330
According to this theory, the
atoms consist of a positively

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.660
charged nucleus surrounded by
a system of electrons kept

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.270
together by attractive forces
from the nucleus.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.440
That's what keeps them from
just fleeing anywhere, and

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.720
they don't go in,
but they vwomp.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.060
The total negative charge of the
electrons is equal to the

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.450
positive charge of
the nucleus.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:04.140
Further, the nucleus is assumed
to be the seat of the

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.810
essential part of the mass of
the atom and have linear

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.600
dimensions exceedingly small
compared with the linear

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.330
dimensions of the whole atom.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.700
This is beautifully written.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.216
Clear.

00:32:16.216 --> 00:32:19.320
It's textbook quality and it's
written by a man whose native

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.980
language isn't even English.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.050
Read the literature.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.530
The number of electrons in
an atom is deduced to be

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.380
approximately equal to half
the atomic weight.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.470
Great interest is to be
attributed to this atom model.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.240
You have to know a little
bit about Bohr.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.530
Bohr used this phrase, great
interest. That was his way of

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.720
saying, embroiled
in controversy.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.240
If someone said something that
he didn't agree with, instead

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.400
of saying, I think that's
nonsense, he say, very

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.290
interesting.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.140
Very interesting.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.120
So great interest is to be
attributed to this atom model.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.650
That means people are in pitched
battle on both sides.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.810
For as Rutherford has shown,
the assumption of the

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.030
existence of nuclei as those
in question seems to be

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.510
necessary in order to account
for the results of experiments

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.720
on large-angle scattering
of the alpha rays.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.970
Another footnote: Geiger
and Marsden.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:13.110
Geiger and Marsden published
their results in this journal.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.480
In an attempt to explain some of
the properties of matter on

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.800
the basis of this atom model,
we meet, however, with

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.590
difficulties of a serious
nature arising from the

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.870
apparent instability of the
system of electrons.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.950
Difficulties purposely avoided
in atom models previously

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.540
considered.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.240
For instance, in the one
proposed by Sir J.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.510
J.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.240
Thompson, which is to say, mmm,
you know, it's curious.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.040
You condemn the Rutherford
model because he's got

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.930
electrons in motion, which means
they're accelerating in

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.100
energy deficit.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.100
But in the Plum Pudding Model,
the electrons are

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.090
in motion, and J.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:51.310
J.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.140
Thompson is silent about it.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.770
So this is a very aimed
barb right at J.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:56.990
J.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.500
Thompson done elegantly.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.490
With this elegant slap
in the face.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.950
You know this is how
scientists do it.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.140
They don't go, oh you're
ugly , and your

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.390
mother dresses you funny.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.860
Instead they write things like
this, difficulties purposely

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.660
avoided in atom models
previously

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.440
considered for instance.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.360
So this is sort of yeah,
how about you, huh?

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.680
But anyway, we can
go on and on.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.150
But down here, the result of
the discussion of these

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.990
questions seems to be a general
acknowledgment of the

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:30.090
inadequacy of classical
electrodynamics in describing

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.560
the behavior of systems
of atomic size.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.310
So he's saying that you can't
use classical electrodynamics

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.256
down to subatomic dimensions.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.340
He's saying that those models,
any more than you can use

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:50.240
planetary models down to human
dimensions, this, in many

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.300
respects, is foretelling
nanotechnology.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.890
He's saying the properties we
know, of how things behave in

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:04.930
the Newtonian world are not
necessarily valid at atomic

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.376
dimensions.

00:35:06.376 --> 00:35:08.320
This is very important stuff.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.780
Anyway, so what I did is I went
through the paper and

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.140
I've reduced the content of
the paper to these things

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.210
called postulates.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.380
So Rutherford's atom
is correct.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.940
That's the first thing.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.660
Classical electromagnetic theory
not applicable to the

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.340
orbiting electron.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.080
And you're going to get-- the
PDF and all this is going to

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.170
be posted, so don't feel like
you have to be a super

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.260
stenographer here.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.310
Newtonian mechanics
is applicable to

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.350
the orbiting electron.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.370
So you can see, wait a minute
it's sort of like cafeteria

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.360
physics here.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.640
Electrodynamics doesn't
apply, Newtonian

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.930
mechanics does apply.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.670
And the answer is, yeah.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.770
That's what we're going
to do here.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.410
We'll build a model and we're
going to try these ideas out.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.140
And if they're crazy,
how are we going to

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.160
know they're crazy?

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.330
Because there's going to
be data that refute.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.360
But if we get data that supports
all this, then

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.650
there's only one conclusion.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:02.460
This thing makes sense
up to a point.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.860
The energy of the electron is
conserved in the system.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.610
It's bond is kinetic
plus potential.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.970
The quantization through
angular momentum.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.630
And lastly, the Planck-Einstein
relation

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.220
applying to electron
transition.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.570
So now I'm going to take all
this and I'm going to write

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:17.820
out the model for you.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.540
Now, I don't want you
to say, oh, he's

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.460
going to derive something.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.870
Do we have to know
derivations?

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.090
This is the only time
I'm going to derive

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.080
something for you.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.610
The reason is, it teaches
the model.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.640
It teaches how the
model is based on

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.890
assumptions and so on.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.880
But I don't expect you to
memorize things because that's

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.190
not the way things work.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:39.280
So let's go starting with
this point here.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:48.790
This point here is
Bohr model atom.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.430
So it's Bohr's representation
of the Rutherford model.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.500
We can call it a nuclear model
or a planetary model.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.580
Because you've got orbiting
electrons.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.890
Now, first important point.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.810
The Bohr model is the
simplest model.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.900
It works for a one
electron system.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.870
So he has a single electron.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.420
Planetary model, single
electron.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.105
And this orbits the
positive nucleus.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:24.655
So you might say, one electron,

00:37:24.655 --> 00:37:25.420
well, what's that mean?

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.710
Well, obviously it means
atomic hydrogen.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.250
But it could mean helium plus.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.260
That's a one electron system.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.040
It could mean lithium 2 plus.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.270
It could mean roentgenium
110 plus.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.710
That's a one electron system.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.630
And this is all gas.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.650
Gas phase.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.420
No solids here.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.740
Gas phase.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.330
So it's an isolated nucleus with
one electron around it.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.770
That's how we're
going to begin.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.430
And here's what it looks like.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:59.140
I'm going to put the nucleus,
first of all not to scale,

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:04.020
because we're not going
to draw 10,000 to 1.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:12.750
Over here is the nucleus
with z positive charge.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.020
And then out here is the
electron in orbit.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.160
This is the lone electron
in orbit.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.390
And this distance is r.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.760
The distance from the nucleus.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.680
You're going to say, well,
is that from the

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.570
outside or the inside?

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.630
It's 10,000 to 1; it
doesn't matter.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.880
Forget about it.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.960
So now let's use this concept.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.360
We're going to say it's a
conservative system and so the

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.920
energy of the system is
simply going to be the

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.770
energy of the electron.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.270
You might say, well, why
don't you consider the

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.770
energy of the nucleus?

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.530
Because the nucleus is,
relatively speaking,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.020
stationary.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.710
To use Rutherford's colorful
language, he says when an

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.190
elephant has fleas, it's the
fleas that do the jumping.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.710
So you don't care about
that energy of the

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.830
nucleus in this case.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.120
So the energy of the
electron is the

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.020
kinetic plus the potential.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.950
So the kinetic energy, we're
saying it's 1/2 mv squared

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.580
because it's Newtonian
mechanics apply.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.480
See number 3.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.090
So that's 1/2 mv squared,
where v is the velocity.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.500
So that's the kinetic,
and then what's

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.430
the potential energy?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.830
The potential energy here
is electrostatic.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.270
Because that's the energy that's
stored here is due to

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.200
the Coulombic forces
between them.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.520
So that's going to be q1,
q2 over 4 pi epsilon

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.610
0 divided by r.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.830
So what I'm going to do here, we
have to just for convention

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.090
I'm going to always choose that
q1 in my derivation, q1

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.700
will be the charge on the
nucleus. so q1 will equal z,

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.200
which is the proton
number here, times

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.260
the elementary charge.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.270
Remember e is the elementary
charge.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:03.690
It's not the charge
on the electron.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:07.060
So sometimes I use the
word e with a minus

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.680
sign, meaning the electron.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.170
But this is e meaning the
elementary charge.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:16.000
z times e and then q2, which is
the charge on the electron,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.800
is minus the elementary
charge e.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.020
So we're always going to
have minus e out here.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.270
What varies is z.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.600
And so we're going to make
some substitutions.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.250
So this is going to be what?

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.850
It's going to be 1/2 mass of the
electron times velocity of

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.070
the electron squared.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:40.030
And now q1 is ze and
q2 is minus z, so

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.880
that's minus ze squared.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:49.350
And then that'll be over
4 pi epsilon 0 r.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.990
And I'm going to call this
thing equation 1.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:41:00.620
And by the way you can find
all of this information by

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.100
looking at your table
of constants.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.210
So see, epsilon 0
sitting here.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.840
Permittivity of vacuum.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.730
There it is, 8.85 times 10 to
the minus 12 farads per meter.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.930
Elementary charge 1.6 times 10
to the minus 19 Coulombs.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:19.770
Electron mass, 9.1 times 10 to
the minus 31 kilograms. And

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.070
what's this 4 pi epsilon
0 doing here?

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.320
Well we know this is going
to give us joules.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.540
And this is going to
give us joules.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.240
And the epsilon 0 is the
factor that renders

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.730
electrostatic units on
to the same plane

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.850
as mechanical units.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.150
If I plug in-- this is going to
be Coulombs, it's Coulombs

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.330
squared, and this is going to be
meters, and now this things

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.050
is farads per meter.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.350
And I got farads per meter
times meters divided by

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:47.120
Coulombs squared.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.660
I don't care.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.340
This, with impunity is joules.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.510
Because this is an
energy unit.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.170
And this is Systeme
Internationale.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:00.950
And this is kilograms times
meters per second, meters per

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:06.040
second and how many apples
in a bushel and--

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.020
forget it!

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.630
Put this in kilograms. Put this
in in meters per second.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.990
With impunity, it's in joules.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.710
So that's what that
thing does there.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:15.030
Alright.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.650
Good.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.720
So let's keep going.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.620
Postulate 3.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.600
Newtonian mechanics applies
to orbiting electrons.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.680
So orbiting electron, it's
in a stationary orbit.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.440
So that's the thing.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:37.130
So postulate 3 implies that the
sum of the forces acting

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.360
on the electron must be 0.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.330
This is a force balance,
right?

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.650
If the forces are out of
balance, the electrons are

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.320
either going to move closer to
the nucleus or move farther

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.700
from the nucleus.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.010
So that's equal to, again--

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:57.470
it's a sum of a dynamic force
and a Coulombic force, or

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.950
electrostatic.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.990
Here I just noticed a
nice parity here.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:05.230
So these are technical terms,
but we can give them human

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.920
terms. So the dynamic force,
there's a Newtonian force,

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.160
this is a Newtonian force and
this is a Coulombic force,

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.290
after the two people that are
associated with the ideas.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.760
Charges interaction
are Coulombic,

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.750
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.080
So now lets substitute in.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.700
So we know that if you've got
something orbiting, something

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.730
tethered, then the dynamic force
on that, that pulls the

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:36.080
object away on a tether
is mv squared over r.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:45.660
And the electrostatic is q1 q2
over 4 pi epsilon 0 r squared.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.920
Force goes as 1 over
r squared.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.620
Energy goes as 1 over r.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.620
How do you know?

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.590
Well, one way to think about it
is, you know energy is the

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.210
result of a force moving
through a distance.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.680
You say, I'm working really
hard, and I say I don't see

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.300
any force moving through
a distance.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.270
That's a joke.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.840
So here's energy.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.370
So force.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.760
So if this is 1 over r squared,
the integral of 1

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.700
over r squared is
minus 1 over r.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.080
If you get these backwards, you
integrate 1 over r, you're

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.660
going to get natural log of
r, which makes no sense.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.190
That's one way.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.650
Or the other way is, you
can just remember.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.420
So anyways we're going to
plug into those values.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.340
And what do we get?

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.160
What we get there is this.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.780
We get mv squared over r.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.190
q1 is z times e.
q2 is minus z.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:40.506
So it's minus ze squared over
4 pi epsilon 0 r squared.

00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:42.626
And I'm going to call
this equation 2.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.950
So now we keep going.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:55.160
Next one, energy quantized
through its angular momentum.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.190
This is really critical.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.330
This is the major breakthrough
by Bohr.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.210
Now what do we mean
by quantization?

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.640
I told you that in 1909,
Millikan had figured out that

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.960
electrical charge
is quantized.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.910
Now quantization had already
been annunciated by

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.880
Max Planck in 1909.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.090
You see, the classical theory
of radiation gave this

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.110
prediction for intensity as
a function of wavelength.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.400
They called this the
explosion, the

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.490
collapse of the theory.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:27.020
As you go to low wavelength,
the intensity

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.420
goes without abatement.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.100
But these are the spectra
that were measured.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.590
Depending on the temperature
of the gas, you get this

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.360
distribution.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.150
So how to get the distribution
to turn around at lower values

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:40.040
of wavelength?

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.070
And in order to do that, Planck
suggested that light is

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.370
composed of energy packets,
or quanta.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:52.590
That light is a stream of
individual energy bits.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.460
And the elementary unit of
electromagnetic radiation is

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.490
the photon.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.780
And you can say, well I don't
understand, where

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.000
goes he get that from?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.270
That's not the way to
think about it.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.340
Say, if you make
this assumption

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.900
you get these curves.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.180
And then figure out
what it means.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.535
You can't make everything
anthropomorphic.

00:46:10.535 --> 00:46:14.630
If this were the case, and
furthermore if the energy of

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:18.700
one of these quanta was related
to its frequency--

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.790
and wavelength and frequency
are inversely related--

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:25.020
then the proportionality
constant is h, which we now

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.170
have designated the Planck
constant in honor of Planck,

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:30.200
then you get this.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.270
People grew to accept it.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.430
1900, he gets a Nobel
Prize for it.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.040
La de da!

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.710
But who knows what
light is anyways.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.220
It has no mass, it's
kind of mysterious.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.040
1900, the whole concept of
action at a distance was

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.470
strange to people.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:49.330
The notion that something could
affect you, from me,

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.490
without physical contact,
this was a new idea.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.970
We take it for granted,
but this was very new.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.190
So it's kind of mysterious,
they said, OK, he's a

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.330
physicist, who knows?

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.780
And it worked!

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.350
But it's light.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:08.920
Now what Bohr is going to say
is the electron moving in

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.180
orbit, he says, I'm going to
apply the same concept of

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.130
quantization to the electron
moving in orbit.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.120
Well, that's different.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:30.750
And using this value he gives
us mvr, which is the angular

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:36.900
momentum is quantized
n h over 2 pi.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.890
h is the Planck Constant
and n is an integer.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.330
1, 2 3 4, et cetera.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.450
So this is the quantum condition
and this will be

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:46.690
equation 3.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.510
And I have three equations and
three unknowns, and what I'm

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.430
going to do next day is come
back and show you the solution

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:58.260
of the equations and how they
give us a set of equations

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.850
that allow us to compare
with data.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.490
So let's jump to the thing.

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.010
And by the way the Planck
constant is there.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.110
Now Niels Bohr eventually
won the Nobel Prize.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:10.490
He was widely revered.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.470
He achieved the stature on
a par with Einstein.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.340
If you go to Denmark, it's still
not part of the European

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.050
Union, you can still get the 500
Kroner note if you change

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:19.960
a 100-dollar bill there.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.550
And there's Niels Bohr
with this pipe.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.700
And you can see the concept
of things rotating

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.400
around it an so on.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.040
There's a young Niels Bohr.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.900
This is Bohr with Werner
Heisenberg.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.630
Heisenberg was a post-doc who
worked with Bohr in 1925 and

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.650
annunciated the Uncertainty
Principle, which we will study

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.450
a few lectures from now.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:45.900
This is a chemical conference
sponsored by

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.420
chemical company Solvay.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.140
Brussels 1930, there's
Bohr and Einstein.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.330
They loved hats.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.450
This is the Hamburg,
this is Borsalino.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.160
Here's Bohr mixing it
up with royalty.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.835
This is a young Queen Elizabeth
of England.

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.190
There's Prince Phillip.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.720
This is the royalty
Danish family.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.500
Bohr loved music and here
is with Louis Armstrong

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.960
undoubtedly talking about the
resonant structures within the

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.330
tube here and how to
get the various

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.580
harmonics and overtones.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.580
Now last thing, a little
bit about hydrogen.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.860
We've been studying hydrogen
here, the one electron atom.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.120
But there are isotopes
of hydrogen.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.480
The original was discovered
by Henry Cavendish.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.350
There is one form of hydrogen
that has a neutron in addition

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:36.050
to the proton.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.880
That's the deuterium, from
which we can get

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.170
heavy water, D2O.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.800
This was discovered here
in New York at Columbia

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.010
University by Harold Urey.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:49.220
And then lastly, there's a
second isotope of hydrogen

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.430
that consists of two neutrons
and a proton.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.930
That's tritium and it was
discovered at the Cavendish

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.280
lab by Ernest Rutherford.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.030
He was active right
up to his death.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.380
In fact, it is argued that
Rutherford did his best work

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.330
after he got the Nobel Prize.

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.550
Your book is showing this.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.360
It's nice to follow.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.630
We started with Dalton and now
we're here and then later, in

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.430
another week or so, we'll
be down here.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.230
And here's the sort of the
intellectual road map that

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.060
takes you to modern
atomic theory.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.950
So with that I'll dismiss
the class and

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.910
we'll see you on Wednesday.
