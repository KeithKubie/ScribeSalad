1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,630
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and
I am Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,640
This is Radiolab and today is inheritance.

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,240
What you can move on to the next
generation and what you can't.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,800
Now the Sweden story from
our last segment, us both
feel a little strange. Yeah.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,900
Because while you might have
a lot of influence, you know,

6
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:20,060
genetically speaking over
your kids and their kids,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,950
you don't seem to have a lot of control.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,090
So we're going to leave you with a
story from our producer, Pat Walters,

9
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:31,091
about one woman's radicle even troubling
attempt to regain that control all they

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,850
come on in again, a few months ago,

11
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,960
pat made his way down to North Carolina
to a small suburb outside of Charlotte

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,690
to visit this family. Me and
mom is the one I'd come to see.

13
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:46,300
She and I snuck away from the
children into our office. Right.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,090
This is nice and quiet.
Um, well I guess, um,

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,450
I was thinking we could just start
at the beginning. What year was it?

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,850
Where were you? Oh, okay. Um,

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,640
1989. So this is Barbara, Barbara Harris.

18
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:06,310
I'm the founder and director
of project prevention.

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,460
And in 1989 when the story
we're telling now started,

20
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:13,300
she was living in California, in
Orange County, and I was a waitress.

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,650
I worked for IOP for over 30 years
and she was a mom to six sons.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,980
She and her husband. Really Harris.
What did he do for a living?

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,580
Surgical technician. Six boys is
a lot of boys, but at that point,

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,900
just two of the six boys were
living at home, Brian and Rodney,

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,530
and they were seven and eight at the time.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,310
And Barbara found herself returning
to a thought she'd kind of always had.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,700
She started to wish again that
she could have a daughter. Yeah.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,990
And by this point,

29
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:42,070
she's 37 years old and I knew the only
way I was going to get a daughter was if

30
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:45,070
I went and became a foster
parent and asked for one

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:46,810
[inaudible].

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,660
So she did. She filled out the forms,

33
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:54,220
went through all the training that we
had to do and first day fingerprinted and

34
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,390
had a background check done

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,860
[inaudible]

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,720
and then they waited for the call.

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,310
I already knew that if I
ever got a little girl,

38
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,420
I was going to name her destiny.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,150
[inaudible]

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,960
and um, that summer it was, um,

41
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,530
July they got the call, I
had asked for a newborn.

42
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,540
So when the social worker
called me, she said,

43
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,290
I have this cute little baby girl
for you, but she's eight months old.

44
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,200
Is that too old? And I said, no,
no, that's okay. She said, well,

45
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:25,000
she's just beautiful. And she
has lips that like a baby doll.

46
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,530
That's what I remember her saying.

47
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,820
So Barbara and her son got in the car
and drove across town to the foster home

48
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,880
where destiny had been living for
the past eight months since birth.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,310
We went to the foster home and went in.

50
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:39,350
The lady knew why we were there
and destiny was in the other room,

51
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,110
might sleeping or something, I'm not sure.

52
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,590
So we talked to her for a little
while and at a certain point,

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,180
the social worker pulls out a
stack of papers with a child.

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,390
They give you a whole folder full of
information and tells you all about them.

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,890
And she told Barbara, there's something
you need to know about this baby.

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,570
And she is born and tested
positive for PCP, crack and heroin.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,633
And um,

58
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,900
doctors would later explained to Barbara
that Destiny's mom had been addicted to

59
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,010
drugs while she was pregnant.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,820
And the psychologist who gave destiny
her first checkup told Barbara that she

61
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,210
was delayed and she was always going
to be delayed because of her prenatal

62
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,450
neglect. Did that scare
you at all as like, I mean,

63
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:23,590
that would seems like a thing that
would be kind of frightening. No,

64
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,650
it didn't scare me because she says as
soon as she saw destiny and sat her in my

65
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,850
lap with her little dress on
and her little curly hair,

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,730
she just knew this is my daughter.

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,330
A couple of days later I had
already bonded with her so much.

68
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,980
It was as if I gave birth to her.
Honestly, I think it never seemed, yeah,

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,630
like she was anything but my
real mom, if that makes sense.

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,730
This of course is destiny.

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,820
She's 22 now and she's never even
met her birth mom. No, I knew,

72
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,070
Barbara says they've reached out to her
many times, but they never heard back.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
And Dessie says she doesn't
really care. I mean at all.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,090
I got these jeans from somewhere,

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,650
but I kinda feel like she was a surrogate.

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,570
Like she carried me for my real mom.
That's how I've always looked at it.

77
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,390
You know, my mom needed a girl
and she got one. It's just,

78
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,224
that's just how I've always been.

79
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,480
And even though they look basically
nothing alike, I mean, for one thing,

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,310
barber's white and Destiny's black,

81
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,900
they both say that they actually often
forget that they're not biologically

82
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:35,250
related. They told me a bunch of
these stories. One of them involving,

83
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,510
well,

84
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,320
yes. So I don't have the
biggest boobies in the world.

85
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,320
You can't see that on the radio. But Hey,
it's a fact of life. And destiny says,

86
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,540
one day she and her mom were in
the car and her mom said, she said,

87
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,430
I don't know. You know, maybe. I mean,
maybe they'll grow picker like minor,

88
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,970
bigger and you know, and
then she goes, oh wait,

89
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,130
I didn't give birth to you.
That doesn't matter. Nevermind.

90
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,070
You're stuck with small boobies.
Okay. Now I just had to accept it,

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,870
but we're getting ahead of ourselves
here because given that really sets the

92
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,704
story in motion,

93
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,260
the set of events happened a few months
after Barbara had brought destiny home

94
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,710
when they got another call from the
social worker saying that same mother,

95
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,310
Destiny's birth mother had
given birth to another child.

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,650
Yeah. The social worker called and told
me the mother had given birth birth.

97
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:30,060
Mother's name was actually the same
as me. So Barbara Really? Yeah,

98
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,320
she has the same name as me.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,210
So she'd tell me Barbara had had
another baby and a boy did we want it.

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
So I went to the hospital
and picked him up.

101
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,490
And you picked him up right
from the hospital? Yeah.

102
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,040
And as soon as she got
there to pick him up,

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,900
she could tell that something was wrong.

104
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,100
He wasn't little happy baby because
when a woman uses heroin while she's

105
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,520
pregnant, the fetus gets hooked on it too.

106
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,950
Two for Isaiah being born
with like just cut off

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,800
and he was going to
withdraw light bothered him.

108
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,550
Noise bothered him as it beat
it out. This is Smitty again,

109
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,210
projectile vomiting because
he couldn't hold formula down.

110
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,170
He'd fall asleep and just wake up
screaming and he was just [inaudible],

111
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,890
you know, most babies, Ocala peaceful.

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,940
He was never a really peaceful and
day after day, literally for months,

113
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,440
Isaiah would sleep and he would
scream. That was it. It was just,

114
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,170
no baby should have to come
into the world like that.

115
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,330
And nobody has a right to do
that to a baby. But a year later,

116
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,560
the social worker called again saying the
mother had given birth to a baby girl.

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,920
Did we want her? This is the same
birth mother. Yeah. And again, Barbara,

118
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,520
thanks. Come on. But if
this little girl is here,

119
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,970
she should be with her brother and
sister and so she should be with me.

120
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,580
And I called my husband
again at work and said,

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,460
they want to know if we want to
take the baby and he's a barber.

122
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:55,910
I'm not buying a school bus because we
had already had to upgrade from a car to

123
00:06:55,911 --> 00:07:00,260
a van from a condo to a
home. And so I said, okay,

124
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:05,080
well this'll be the last one. We'll
just get one more. But a year later, no,

125
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,060
she gets another call, another little boy.

126
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,160
That's how we ended up with four of them.

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,380
These are four kids from
the same birth mother?

128
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,950
Yeah. Wow.

129
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,790
So by now it's 1994 and
Barbara is thinking,

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,330
I just don't get it. You know,
like how did this happen?

131
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,830
How was this woman allowed right

132
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,280
to walk into the hospital and drop off a
damaged baby and just walk away with no

133
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:29,970
consequences over and over
again. How dare you do this?

134
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,330
The way she sought the state, the
federal government, somebody should say,

135
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,320
you're not doing this.

136
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,020
You're not leaving this hospital
unless you have longterm birth control.

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,900
Barbara tried to get a law
passed requiring just that,

138
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,910
but it failed and when I found out
the bill didn't pass, I just thought,

139
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,700
I have to come up with something else.
I have to be creative. And she says,

140
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,630
one day this idea just came
to her. She was thinking,

141
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,190
everybody's motivated by money.

142
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,870
So

143
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,570
can I offer these women money to
use birth control? In other words,

144
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,070
could I pay women who have drug
problems to stop having babies?

145
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,330
I decided to have a press conference
in my front yard to announce what I was

146
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:15,900
doing and my naive mind, I didn't
have a clue what a big deal this was.

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,460
[inaudible]

148
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,110
the story exploded. Barbara Harris,

149
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,480
his solution is simpler than
anything else out there.

150
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,380
Instantly she's offering
$200 $100 200 bucks.

151
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,410
It's 300 down to any drug addicted woman
who will agree to have no more babies

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,170
and I'm going to go out into the streets
and offer addicted women money to use

153
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,620
birth control. This could
mean sterilization. It
could mean getting an IUD

154
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,370
if she gives the woman a choice.
If you've already had a kid,

155
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,740
you can be sterilized and if you haven't,

156
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,240
you can choose to have an IUD or an
implant put in which will last for several

157
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,780
years late. And when you say
they can choose to be sterilized,

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,730
do you mean permanent? Yeah,
permanent like tubes tied.

159
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,100
Sounds bizarre, but it's a
solution here. It says her program,

160
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,780
children requiring a caring community
or crack crack and prevent thousands of

161
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,510
unwanted births to drug addicted women.
I'd like to everybody to meet please.

162
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,610
Yeah.

163
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,150
Barbara Harris, please welcome Brian.

164
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,730
As Barbara made the rounds on the
daytime talk shows the reaction was split

165
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,800
right down the middle and the one hand,

166
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,340
she says immediately check
started arriving. This is 25.

167
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,680
This is 50 from all over the country.

168
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,150
This is 750 and 200 all over the
political spectrum from Hollywood,

169
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:25,250
lefties to social conservatives

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
together pledge more than $150,000 to her

171
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,520
program. And that number, by the
way, has grown a lot. That 1 million.

172
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,730
Uh, yeah. Over the past five years.
If you look at our tax return. Wow.

173
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,550
But along with the support came attacks,

174
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,430
particularly as drug addicted women began
to sign up. Barbara Harris says she's,

175
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,820
I convinced more than a
dozen women, 14 women,

176
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,480
25 women have accepted her offer to
be sterilized in return for money.

177
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:51,931
Right away.

178
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:56,430
People accused her of targeting women at
their weakest moment and enabling their

179
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,100
drug abuse. You know what they're
going to go do with that money.

180
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,510
You get them $200 each, but they can
spend on crack if that's their choice,

181
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,890
but the babies don't have a choice.

182
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,250
Barbara started finding herself on
panels with women who'd use drugs during

183
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:12,570
their pregnancies and that's when things
would start to get out of control.

184
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,130
They should all be sterilized.

185
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,270
Sterilize, like you said,

186
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,600
were like you said when you ran
your advice and like she is,

187
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,810
I didn't say I'm God. She
asked my opinion. Okay,

188
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,260
this lady right here is still taking
drugs and try and be pregnant again.

189
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,030
First hear about this. What
goes through your mind?

190
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,280
I think I was really horrified and
terrified. That's Lynn Paltrow.

191
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm executive director and founder of
national advocates for pregnant women.

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,920
Lynn has become one of Barbara's
fiercest critics and full disclosure,

193
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,230
she's Robert Sister's partner. Well, her,

194
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,740
her explanation is that these
women are having in her terms,

195
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:57,700
litters of damage, babies and society
forever will be responsible for them.

196
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,240
She said letters in this magazine
Article Barbara Even said, quote,

197
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,320
we don't allow dogs to breed.
We spay them. We knew drew them.

198
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,190
Yeah. I'm not saying that
these women are dogs,

199
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,550
but they're not acting anymore
responsible than a dog in heat.

200
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,620
Are there people whose drug use is so
out of control? They can't parent. Yes,

201
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,860
but creating an assumption that there is
a class of people who don't deserve to

202
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:24,140
procreate, who aren't worthy.

203
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,460
Appropriating the human race leads you
down a path that is is we should have

204
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:32,540
great concern about that path is
basically called eugenics. Well,

205
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,560
I named Hitler thought that if you
were Jewish that you had given up

206
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,800
the right to be mother and he
sterilized people as well. Well,

207
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,200
I just want to eliminate drug addicted
babies from being born. I mean,

208
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,570
I don't think that puts me in
the same category as Hitler.

209
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,630
What's the worst thing you've been
called by one of your critics?

210
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,800
Probably Racist.

211
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,720
I'm married to a black man,
so that was just funny to me.

212
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,500
And according to Barbara, the majority
of the women she pays are white.

213
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,390
Do you think like Badass Barbara about
some of the things that she'd said?

214
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,790
Because to be totally honest,
they kind of turned my stomach. I,

215
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,090
I like you. I get the sense that like
you have, there's a lot of warmth in you.

216
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:14,650
You're obviously a great mom,
but that feels cold to me.

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,100
I was just pissed I where
they identify children now,

218
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,220
babies I had seen and all the people that
have called me and tell me about their

219
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,600
babies that were damaged.

220
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,130
I had everybody's abuse on my back and
I didn't care how he said it or how we

221
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:28,461
did it.

222
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:32,180
Just don't have any more children because
at that point I didn't really know any

223
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:35,690
of them so I didn't see them
as people. I just saw them as

224
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,700
child abusers might be a mixture,

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,640
but she says she doesn't
feel that way anymore.

226
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,350
After I've gotten to
know so many other women,

227
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,020
Barbara has this drawer in your desk and
Ms. Harrison staffer filled with dozens

228
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,550
of letters from women that she's paid.

229
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,170
I want to thank you for your support
and kindness as always. She said,

230
00:12:57,171 --> 00:13:00,590
thank you so much for the gift. I
bought my son an excavator track,

231
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,780
remote control and some summer outfits.

232
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,050
This is from 2000 to whom it may
concern. I have been doing very good.

233
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,640
I just got got to see them,

234
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:14,840
my eight year old son and I'm so proud
and I have four years clean and I

235
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,980
anyways, God bless you
sincerely, Jennifer [inaudible],

236
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,600
have you ever had someone call or write
you and say that they regret their

237
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,670
decision? No,

238
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,640
I've only had somebody call and say they
regret that they didn't stay on birth

239
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:35,410
control, which I find kind of
hard to believe. But then again,

240
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,460
I must've read at least a hundred news
articles as I was reporting this story

241
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,570
and I didn't find a single case of
someone saying that they regretted what

242
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,404
they'd done.

243
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,630
How many women have you paid?

244
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,040
We have paid,

245
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,750
um, 4,266

246
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,150
that's a lot of people.
That's a lot of people. Yeah.

247
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,210
She actually emailed me afterwards and
adjusted that number down a couple.

248
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:10,520
A hundred and so in the end, I mean,
where do you come down on this? Right.

249
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,770
I ended up finding myself
really conflicted about it. The,

250
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:20,670
the, the like I agree with Lynn that this
program does perpetuate a stereotype.

251
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,570
Tell me what your image of a drug
using pregnant woman is. Who are they?

252
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,530
It'd be wrong to assume the
women Barbara talks about on TV.

253
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,930
It means women don't just have one and
two babies. They have six seven, eight,

254
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,000
10 14 yeah.

255
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,400
All these women who have so many babies
and never tried to seek drug treatment,

256
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,460
it would be wrong to think that they
represent all women who use drugs while

257
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:38,940
they're pregnant.

258
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,890
The women who I've worked with who've had
a history of drug problems aren't like

259
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:47,520
the examples that she gives. These
are women who love their children,

260
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,600
who sought help

261
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,880
and she says oftentimes the women who
want help a really hard time finding it

262
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,980
and Barbara is not offering that.
She's not offering treatment,

263
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,450
not offering counseling. And
there are programs that do that.

264
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,510
But I said this to Linde,

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,630
despite all the things that
troubled me about Barbara's program,

266
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,400
I feel like what she's
trying to do is to stop it.

267
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,740
To stop a kid from getting born
into a childhood that's gonna suck.

268
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,090
The fact that

269
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,740
that you're motivated by a, a
really beautiful, important, um,

270
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,640
value that we want healthy kids doesn't
mean the mechanism you're using is going

271
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,653
to end up helping those

272
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,540
kids. Because the truth is you have no
idea how these kids are gonna turn out.

273
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,750
Yeah. Like nobody's arguing that women
should do drugs when they're pregnant.

274
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,880
That is a bad way to start a kid's life.

275
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,930
But that's just the
beginning of the kid's life.

276
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,080
So much can happen after
that. Once you, you,

277
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,630
and for me, this whole story
really shifted, right? You at USC,

278
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,930
when they started spending
some time with destiny,

279
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Barbara is 22 year old daughter. You
know, as you can see, I like to talk,

280
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,750
even though Destiny's mom was doing all
sorts of drugs during her pregnancy and

281
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:08,380
the doctor's told Barbara that destiny
was going to be mentally and physically

282
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:12,550
delayed, not feeling the way
I'm supposed to. She just isn't.

283
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,750
Could you just tell us like what you
are doing now? You're finishing college,

284
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,230
right? Yes. I'm almost done.
I'm graduating in December

285
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,390
and right now I'm student
teaching, so that's fun. But

286
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,210
the moment I really felt like whoa was
when we started talking about the little

287
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,044
baby that we

288
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,700
carrying in the background of
everything. That's my little girl.

289
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,580
She's 20 months old.
She'll be two in January.

290
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,840
And so her name is Kalia
and she's a complete nut.

291
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,340
I don't know where she gets that
from. Oh hell yeah. She keeps me busy.

292
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,450
Were you planning to have clear?
Nope. She was an apes kid.

293
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,740
She was totally new schedule. We'll
just be honest. We just didn't think I,

294
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,110
I just didn't think, you know, you know,

295
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:00,710
they say it only takes one time
while Yep. That is so true.

296
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,920
One time and a month later. So yeah,

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,470
it's embarrassing. But I believe
everything happens for a reason.

298
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,060
And I think that no, I didn't plan on it,

299
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,810
but I wouldn't take her back for
anything because she made me better.

300
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,100
I want her to be able to look
back on her life one day.

301
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:30,050
Maybe when she's getting interviewed,
I dunno. And be able to say that,

302
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:30,471
yes,

303
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:35,471
my mom was there for me 100% without a
doubt and I'm going to have straight A's

304
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,180
and I'm making it work and I'm going
to graduate with honors and one day I'm

305
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:44,390
going to be able to tell her,
look, I did this. You can do this.

306
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:48,860
Like push yourself and
you got it. That's really,

307
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,363
I mean you're just,

308
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
you're saying a lot of things
that are really impressive

309
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,430
to her. Like I matter, like
I make a difference to her.

310
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,750
Okay. All right. We can stop.

311
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,910
So we did stop and I packed up
my stuff. It's pretty much done.

312
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,630
And Barbara and destiny walked
me out to my carb. Kalia came to,

313
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,870
they had a little basketball for her.

314
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,760
Oh madness here.

315
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,040
And at a certain point I
noticed like over my shoulder,

316
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,640
Barbara is crouched down and she's got
her phone out and she's taking a picture

317
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,790
of this just perfect little scene
and you could get a here already,

318
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,280
you're going to kick it and do it.

319
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,040
I just felt like I was in one of
those moments that like, look,

320
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,940
I'm gonna contains everything that's
good about us as people. You can do it,

321
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,560
buddy, you're watching this.

322
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:52,561
I couldn't help but think that Destiny's
very existence is probably the most

323
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,940
interesting argument against
what Barbara is doing.

324
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,640
I can it back because if Barbara
had gotten to Destiny's birth mom,

325
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,320
destiny CLIA this moment,

326
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,240
none of it would exist.

327
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,390
Yeah, and I told destiny I was thinking
about this and asked her about it.

328
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,200
My situation turned out positive.

329
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,420
I mean as far as you know,

330
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,790
positives can go like I
think I hit the Jackpot.

331
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,410
A lot of times that's not the case
and you just had to have to weigh it.

332
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:39,400
Like is it worth it? Like I could've
turned out like some of the other kids.

333
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,100
Destiny says before she was born,
her mom had four other girls.

334
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,860
These were kids that didn't
end up with Barbara. Yeah.

335
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,400
Three of them ended up in other foster
homes and seem to have done pretty well.

336
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,230
But one of them,

337
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,970
okay, well one of them don't
really know what happened to her.

338
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,260
She's somewhere, but it's not
good. From what we've heard

339
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,130
last they heard she was
living on the streets in La

340
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,100
and that could've very easily
have been one of us. Yeah. I mean,

341
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,000
yes I might get a great
family but I might not.

342
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,790
And the question that was stuck
in my head right then was like,

343
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,410
if you could choose between being born
knowing that your life might end up like

344
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:24,280
that and not like it is now
or not been born at all,

345
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,313
what would you have done?

346
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,880
Um, not been born at all.

347
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,350
I wouldn't want to put it up to chance
because what kind of life is that?

348
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,910
You mean that I didn't mean that.

349
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,330
Yeah, I'll check the side. I know I've
been joking a lot in this interview,

350
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:46,150
but I mean I, with all that I am,

351
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,080
let's see. She wants to see it.

352
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,363
Okay.

353
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,130
Add the back together.
What's she saying there?

354
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,750
Taylor swift's never came
back. She say never ever.

355
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,480
No baby. Be careful just saying. Okay.

356
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,870
Do you want to say bye?

357
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,840
Hi. Okay. Bye. Say Bye.

358
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,100
Aw, you blew him a kiss.
That was nice. Okay. That was

359
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,470
okay. Still

360
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,230
remind me this destiny has, uh,

361
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,440
what three brothers and sisters
that also were raised with her?

362
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,230
Two brothers and one sister.
What happened to them?

363
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,910
Isaiah is in college and
Taylor and Brandon W I met
them at Barbara's house and

364
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,980
they, they seemed to be, uh, to be fine.

365
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,500
And what about the four kids
that weren't raised with Barbara?

366
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,330
Do you know anything about the other,
the other four? I just a little there.

367
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:58,010
There were four girls and Barbara and
destiny told me that a few years ago they

368
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:03,011
found three of them and they all either
were in college or had finished college.

369
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,120
So then the one that's in trouble, it's
just one of one, two, one of eight.

370
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,210
Yeah, one of eight. So I guess
you could say to yourself,

371
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:15,500
seven out of eight of these kids did it.
Right. [inaudible] that's interesting.

372
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,240
I mean, that's, that's a different
kind of arts, but it's, yeah.
