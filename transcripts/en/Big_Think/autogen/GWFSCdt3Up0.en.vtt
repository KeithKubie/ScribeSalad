00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.890
 
so um with my project basically it was

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
so um with my project basically it was
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.680
so um with my project basically it was
focusing on alertness and I think I like

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
focusing on alertness and I think I like
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.090
focusing on alertness and I think I like
the student the tired student who's

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
the student the tired student who's
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800
the student the tired student who's
trying to stay awake in class or while

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
trying to stay awake in class or while
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.120
trying to stay awake in class or while
driving trying to stay awake or the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
driving trying to stay awake or the
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.250
driving trying to stay awake or the
tired worker and how do you increase

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
tired worker and how do you increase
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.830
tired worker and how do you increase
alertness so I was looking at different

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
alertness so I was looking at different
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.359
alertness so I was looking at different
ways to increase alertness and there's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
ways to increase alertness and there's
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.240
ways to increase alertness and there's
caffeine but caffeine is generally shown

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
caffeine but caffeine is generally shown
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.740
caffeine but caffeine is generally shown
to have negative side effects I think

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
to have negative side effects I think
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.619
to have negative side effects I think
that it's 500 milligrams taken daily can

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629
that it's 500 milligrams taken daily can
 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.990
that it's 500 milligrams taken daily can
increase heart rate blood pressure etc

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
increase heart rate blood pressure etc
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.140
increase heart rate blood pressure etc
so that's not necessarily like the ideal

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150
so that's not necessarily like the ideal
 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.810
so that's not necessarily like the ideal
solution for increasing awareness and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
solution for increasing awareness and
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.759
solution for increasing awareness and
also it's known to be addictive and have

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769
also it's known to be addictive and have
 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.649
also it's known to be addictive and have
like diminishing returns so then I

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659
like diminishing returns so then I
 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.869
like diminishing returns so then I
looked at there's no feedback devices

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
looked at there's no feedback devices
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.399
looked at there's no feedback devices
and there's something called the peak

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409
and there's something called the peak
 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.799
and there's something called the peak
achievement trainer and it's a neuro

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
achievement trainer and it's a neuro
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360
achievement trainer and it's a neuro
feedback device that supposedly works

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
feedback device that supposedly works
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.240
feedback device that supposedly works
very well at regulating alertness

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
very well at regulating alertness
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670
very well at regulating alertness
increasing or decreasing it but that's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
increasing or decreasing it but that's
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.649
increasing or decreasing it but that's
very expensive at several thousand

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659
very expensive at several thousand
 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.820

while I came across an article about

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
while I came across an article about
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.290
while I came across an article about
active acupressure and it's in Eastern

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300
active acupressure and it's in Eastern
 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
active acupressure and it's in Eastern
theories it's been said maybe to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
theories it's been said maybe to
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.860

regulate learners acupressure is
basically been said to allies I said

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
basically been said to allies I said
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.400
basically been said to allies I said
it's a mainly for pain relief but

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410
it's a mainly for pain relief but
 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.170
it's a mainly for pain relief but
there's a lot of anecdotes of that I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
there's a lot of anecdotes of that I
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.530
there's a lot of anecdotes of that I
acupressure can just regulate a whole

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
acupressure can just regulate a whole
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630
acupressure can just regulate a whole
bunch of body rhythms so there wasn't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
bunch of body rhythms so there wasn't
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.970
bunch of body rhythms so there wasn't
too much research on it as I dug deeper

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980
too much research on it as I dug deeper
 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.800
too much research on it as I dug deeper
I found one research article pretty

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
I found one research article pretty
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350
I found one research article pretty
recently university of michigan and they

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
recently university of michigan and they
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.980
recently university of michigan and they
had subjects applier acupressure for one

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
had subjects applier acupressure for one
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.650
had subjects applier acupressure for one
day stimulation versus relaxation and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660
day stimulation versus relaxation and
 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.810
day stimulation versus relaxation and
and subjects that applied acupressure to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
and subjects that applied acupressure to
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330
and subjects that applied acupressure to
or no stimulation areas so that they

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
or no stimulation areas so that they
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.560
or no stimulation areas so that they
were more alert during what was supposed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
were more alert during what was supposed
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.200
were more alert during what was supposed
to be a boring lecture so that was a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
to be a boring lecture so that was a
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.410
to be a boring lecture so that was a
positive sign for acupressure

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420
 
 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.370
 
wanted to take a more quantitative

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
wanted to take a more quantitative
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.580
wanted to take a more quantitative
analysis than a self rating system so i

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590
analysis than a self rating system so i
 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.200
analysis than a self rating system so i
developed we're known as enumeration

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210
developed we're known as enumeration
 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.109
developed we're known as enumeration
tasks and during these tasks um there's

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119
tasks and during these tasks um there's
 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.109
tasks and during these tasks um there's
a black screen and every 10 seconds 12

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119
a black screen and every 10 seconds 12
 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.059
a black screen and every 10 seconds 12
12 white squares flash on the monitor

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069
12 white squares flash on the monitor
 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.180
12 white squares flash on the monitor
and then after that they flash 4.3

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
and then after that they flash 4.3
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.770
and then after that they flash 4.3
seconds and after that there's a point

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
seconds and after that there's a point
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600
seconds and after that there's a point
one second white screen just to clear

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610
one second white screen just to clear
 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.300
one second white screen just to clear
the image from the retina and this is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
the image from the retina and this is
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.770
the image from the retina and this is
and if subjects would write down how

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
and if subjects would write down how
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.300
and if subjects would write down how
many squares they saw so this is to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
many squares they saw so this is to
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.710
many squares they saw so this is to
determine what's known as like

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
determine what's known as like
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.589
determine what's known as like
magnocellular process saying it's um

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599
magnocellular process saying it's um
 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.750
magnocellular process saying it's um
basically the quick visual reflexes that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
basically the quick visual reflexes that
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.650
basically the quick visual reflexes that
one has so that was I did that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660
one has so that was I did that
 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.620
one has so that was I did that
enumeration task and then after 10 more

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630
enumeration task and then after 10 more
 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.850
enumeration task and then after 10 more
seconds and other set of white squares

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860
seconds and other set of white squares
 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830
seconds and other set of white squares
of flash and this would repeat until all

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840
of flash and this would repeat until all
 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.809
of flash and this would repeat until all
combinations of from 1 to 12 white

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819
combinations of from 1 to 12 white
 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.140
combinations of from 1 to 12 white
squares flashed and I had 36 subjects

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
squares flashed and I had 36 subjects
 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.630
squares flashed and I had 36 subjects
take this test and then I would score

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
take this test and then I would score
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.100
take this test and then I would score
the subjects based on how many the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
the subjects based on how many the
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.140
the subjects based on how many the
outright put an X and columns where they

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
outright put an X and columns where they
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.820
outright put an X and columns where they
were incorrect on like a data

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830
were incorrect on like a data
 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.699
were incorrect on like a data
acquisition table and then I gave them a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
acquisition table and then I gave them a
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650
acquisition table and then I gave them a
total score so then this enabled me to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
total score so then this enabled me to
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.000
total score so then this enabled me to
make three subject groups where I was

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010
make three subject groups where I was
 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830
make three subject groups where I was
able to pair them so that each subject

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
able to pair them so that each subject
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930
able to pair them so that each subject
group had the same initial scores in

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
group had the same initial scores in
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.490
group had the same initial scores in
terms of visual attention like the same

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
terms of visual attention like the same
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.319
terms of visual attention like the same
number of correct and also I was able to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329
number of correct and also I was able to
 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.449
number of correct and also I was able to
pair them so there was like six miles 60

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
pair them so there was like six miles 60
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.340
pair them so there was like six miles 60
miles in each group so I had three

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350
miles in each group so I had three
 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.960
miles in each group so I had three
groups one that was intended to a by

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
groups one that was intended to a by
 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.970
groups one that was intended to a by
stimulation acupressure one for

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980
stimulation acupressure one for
 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.590
stimulation acupressure one for
relaxation acupressure and one for now

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600
relaxation acupressure and one for now
 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.020
relaxation acupressure and one for now
acupressure and as I said the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
acupressure and as I said the
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.060
acupressure and as I said the
stimulation acupressure or the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
stimulation acupressure or the
 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.610
stimulation acupressure or the
relaxation acupressure it's a slow firma

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620
relaxation acupressure it's a slow firma
 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.890
relaxation acupressure it's a slow firma
sashing with the these two fingers at a

90-degree angle to the target area for
three minutes and those five areas

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290
three minutes and those five areas
 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.979
three minutes and those five areas
that's 15 minutes each day it's not too

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
that's 15 minutes each day it's not too
 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.110
that's 15 minutes each day it's not too
much of a time commitment but definitely

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120
much of a time commitment but definitely
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.180
much of a time commitment but definitely
a time feeling with that I appreciate

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190
a time feeling with that I appreciate
 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.199
a time feeling with that I appreciate
from the subjects and after the subjects

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209
from the subjects and after the subjects
 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.150
from the subjects and after the subjects
did this for 14 days I give all the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160
did this for 14 days I give all the
 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.580
did this for 14 days I give all the
subjects the same not the same another

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
subjects the same not the same another
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.870
subjects the same not the same another
enumeration test they all had the same

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
enumeration test they all had the same
 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.910
enumeration test they all had the same
one but it was a different one and then

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920
one but it was a different one and then
 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.470
one but it was a different one and then
after another 14 days I gave them a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480
after another 14 days I gave them a
 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.500
after another 14 days I gave them a
third enumeration jesc so during these

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
third enumeration jesc so during these
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.270
third enumeration jesc so during these
tasks in the stimulation acupressure

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
tasks in the stimulation acupressure
 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.479
tasks in the stimulation acupressure
group the score is increased between day

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489
group the score is increased between day
 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.340
group the score is increased between day
0 and 14 there was a statistically

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350
0 and 14 there was a statistically
 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.379
0 and 14 there was a statistically
significant difference and then again

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
significant difference and then again
 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.110
significant difference and then again
between fort de 1428 and it was the same

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120
between fort de 1428 and it was the same
 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.370
between fort de 1428 and it was the same
with the relaxation group there was a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380
with the relaxation group there was a
 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.930
with the relaxation group there was a
statistically significant decrease

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940
statistically significant decrease
 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.479
statistically significant decrease
between days here on day 14 and then

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
between days here on day 14 and then
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.090
between days here on day 14 and then
another between day 14 and 28 so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100
another between day 14 and 28 so
 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.420
another between day 14 and 28 so
this was good also there was the largest

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430
this was good also there was the largest
 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.820
this was good also there was the largest
difference between the first set days

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830
difference between the first set days
 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.270
difference between the first set days
around 14 then between day 14 28 and

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280
around 14 then between day 14 28 and
 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.620
around 14 then between day 14 28 and
this kind of makes sense because if

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
this kind of makes sense because if
 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.800
this kind of makes sense because if
you're training with snow it's the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810
you're training with snow it's the
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.300
you're training with snow it's the
reticular activating system is which

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310
reticular activating system is which
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.280
reticular activating system is which
believes to UM regulate one's attention

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290
believes to UM regulate one's attention
 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.000
believes to UM regulate one's attention
and it's located in the midbrain and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010
and it's located in the midbrain and
 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.850
and it's located in the midbrain and
it's it's mainly in charge of regulating

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860
it's it's mainly in charge of regulating
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.140
it's it's mainly in charge of regulating
which of the thousands of stimuli per

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150
which of the thousands of stimuli per
 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.970
which of the thousands of stimuli per
second we process so if you're listening

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980
second we process so if you're listening
 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.280
second we process so if you're listening
to this interview my voice will be one

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290
to this interview my voice will be one
 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.930
to this interview my voice will be one
of them see my image will be one of them

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940
of them see my image will be one of them
 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.750
of them see my image will be one of them
but there's thousands of things that you

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760
but there's thousands of things that you
 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.940
but there's thousands of things that you
don't even notice so like that's how

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950
don't even notice so like that's how
 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.470
don't even notice so like that's how
when like your name is called at a party

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480
when like your name is called at a party
 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.820
when like your name is called at a party
you might you might notice that because

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
you might you might notice that because
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.140
you might you might notice that because
you're training your reticular

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150
you're training your reticular
 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.940
you're training your reticular
activating system to to know this

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950
activating system to to know this
 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.190
activating system to to know this
particular stimuli as thousands of them

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200
particular stimuli as thousands of them
 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.500
particular stimuli as thousands of them
are being processed so the theory behind

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510
are being processed so the theory behind
 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.540
are being processed so the theory behind
this is that since the reticular

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550
this is that since the reticular
 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.870
this is that since the reticular
activating system controls what we can

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880
activating system controls what we can
 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.990
activating system controls what we can
process your training it to respond to

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000
process your training it to respond to
 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.790
process your training it to respond to
the acupressure so it will make sense

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800
the acupressure so it will make sense
 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.320
the acupressure so it will make sense
that there will be the largest response

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330
that there will be the largest response
 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.910
that there will be the largest response
initially and then that continued

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920
initially and then that continued
 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.710
initially and then that continued
response that with decrease also in

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720
response that with decrease also in
 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.180
response that with decrease also in
terms of like neuronal connections

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190
terms of like neuronal connections
 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.040
terms of like neuronal connections
you're going to make connections at

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050
you're going to make connections at
 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.100
you're going to make connections at
first rapidly and then connections in

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110
first rapidly and then connections in
 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.930
first rapidly and then connections in
the same location would occur less

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940
the same location would occur less
 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.230
the same location would occur less
rapidly but still continue to affair so

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240
rapidly but still continue to affair so
 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.880
rapidly but still continue to affair so
that's kind of why I had that trend so

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890
that's kind of why I had that trend so
 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.940
that's kind of why I had that trend so
then I analyzed the data Trent and I did

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950
then I analyzed the data Trent and I did
 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.220
then I analyzed the data Trent and I did
what's like known as regression analysis

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230
what's like known as regression analysis
 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.500
what's like known as regression analysis
to kind of see how visual tension scores

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510
to kind of see how visual tension scores
 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.390
to kind of see how visual tension scores
changed over time so they had a 28-day

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400
changed over time so they had a 28-day
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.870
changed over time so they had a 28-day
analysis and I generally found that

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880
analysis and I generally found that
 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.970
analysis and I generally found that
because of that more more increase in

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980
because of that more more increase in
 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.830
because of that more more increase in
the first 14 days there was a general

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840
the first 14 days there was a general
 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.230
the first 14 days there was a general
natural logarithmic rate of increase in

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
natural logarithmic rate of increase in
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.240
natural logarithmic rate of increase in
the stimulation group and a natural

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250
the stimulation group and a natural
 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.590
the stimulation group and a natural
logarithmic rate of decrease in the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600
logarithmic rate of decrease in the
 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.250
logarithmic rate of decrease in the
relaxation group so um so yeah that was

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260
relaxation group so um so yeah that was
 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.480
relaxation group so um so yeah that was
my results in terms of how acupressure

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490
my results in terms of how acupressure
 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.030
my results in terms of how acupressure
effects visual attention skills the type

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040
effects visual attention skills the type
 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.000
effects visual attention skills the type
of measurement of alertness and also how

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010
of measurement of alertness and also how
 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.130
of measurement of alertness and also how
it affects it over time so I was glad

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140
it affects it over time so I was glad
 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.470
it affects it over time so I was glad
that my hypothesis was supported in

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480
that my hypothesis was supported in
 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.860
that my hypothesis was supported in
terms of that and you know it has

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870
terms of that and you know it has
 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.620
terms of that and you know it has
positive implications for lots of groups

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630
positive implications for lots of groups
 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.570
positive implications for lots of groups
and so in the future I'd definitely be

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580
and so in the future I'd definitely be
 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.120
and so in the future I'd definitely be
interested in looking more into using it

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130
interested in looking more into using it
 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.210
interested in looking more into using it
for patients recovering from strokes for

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220
for patients recovering from strokes for
 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.040
for patients recovering from strokes for

to there's all types of applications

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699
to there's all types of applications
 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.470
to there's all types of applications
that that make it
