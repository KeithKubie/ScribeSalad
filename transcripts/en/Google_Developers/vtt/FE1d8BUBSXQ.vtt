TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.620
And welcome to "The
Developer Show."

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.700
This is your tl;dr.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.610
Add immersive audio experiences
to your virtual reality apps

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.310
with spatial audio,
now available

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.560
in the Cardboard SDKs
for Unity and Android.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.000
Learn how you can use Google

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.700
in this post by
Laurence Moroney,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.200
the third in a
series about using

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.630
Google Sign in on Android.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.200
You can now generate
and distribute

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.590
promo codes to current and
new users on Google Play,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.570
to drive engagement
with your app.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.530
Use them to reward loyal
users, encourage app reviews,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.230
and attract new customers.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.960
There's a brand new set of
Android development patterns

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.997
coming soon.

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:45.580
The goal of the
series is to highlight

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.270
the fundamental components
and best practices that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.329
can make the biggest
difference in your app.

Learn where your game players
get stuck, what virtual goods

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.810
they buy, or how
to tailor the game

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.790
for both casual and
hardcore players,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.810
by using Google's Web
Scale Analytics services.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.020
This post shows you how.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.840

helpful written content

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.090

by engineers for engineers.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.130
That's you.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.000
will guarantee you'll
get hired within six

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.130
months of graduating, or they'll
refund 100% of your tuition.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.480
What are you waiting for?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.990
It's time to start
that career today.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.190
And you know what?

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.720
Sebastian Thrun and Peter
Lubbers are in the other room

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.800
right now, doing a Twitter
Q&amp;A. Do you want to crash it?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.745
I know I do.

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:47.750
HEATHER FAISON: So
right now, we're

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.280
having our first
#devtraining Twitter chat.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.030
I let everyone know
that they can jump in.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.364
They can ask questions.

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.030
So now I'm going to
put in question one.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.920
Technology is a
global opportunity.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.859
What does this mean for
potential developers?

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
Sebastian, I actually

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.275
have a question for
you, around this,

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:08.690
because you started
Udacity as a passion,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.871
to change how people learn.

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:10.746
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yes.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:11.850
And as an accident,
I should say.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.391
It wasn't really a
plan, to start it.

00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:17.250
We just put a class online that
collected 160,000 students.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.760
And then I decided, wow,
that's quite amazing.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.190
Like we had a soldier in
Afghanistan who, overnight,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.440
tried to take
classes, or a mother

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.390
who was raising two
children and was

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.990
desperate about getting some
sort of self accomplishment.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.520
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And
seeing those people,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.320
and comparing them to
my Stanford students,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.222
my Stanford students don't
need me as much as some

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.430
of these people in the world.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.330
MAARTEN: My name is Maarten.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.570
FEBRIA: My name is Febria.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.390
MARIO: I have always
wanted to do the degree,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.530
but I could not afford
moving out of my home city.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.029
PATRICK: I decided to change
paths and become a programmer.

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.570
MOYINOLUWA: I've
been learning online

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.959
for as long as I can remember.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:53.750
HEATHER FAISON: OK.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.560
Next question.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.630
There's so much momentum
around @Tech right now.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.607
Why is this movement
such a big deal?

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:00.940
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So I think,
as the Nanodegree agreement

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.400
matures, and as we're placing
more and more people in jobs,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.030
I think students will
ask the question,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.510
should I pay $300 a
month and get a job?

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.850
Or should I pay $3,000
a month and get no job?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.354
So in Silicon
Valley, what really

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:14.520
matters is, what can you do?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.650
So if you have a fantastic
portfolio, for example,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.604
that you bid at
Udacity and Google,

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:20.770
they might be synonymous
with a good college degree.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.580
In fact, I know
startup companies

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.830
who just pay zero attention
to the college and 100%

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.330
to the work you've
done in the past.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.080
Is there anything
else that you want

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080
to say to our developer
audience about Udacity

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.580
or your favorite
thing in the world?

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.550
What is your favorite
thing in the world?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.880

in the developer community so

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.379
much.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.690
You guys are forward looking.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.800
You understand where
the future is going.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.900
You are part of the
fastest growing technology

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.330
in the universe, ever,
which is called Android.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.440
And keep it up.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.210
Keep learning.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.080
Stay humble and hungry.

cable's broken.
