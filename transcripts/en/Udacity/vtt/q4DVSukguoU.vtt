00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.050
As far as going from analysis to design and

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.870
process there, here's three things that you should consider.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.848
First off, I would suggest treating the entire system itself as an object.

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:19.414
And that any of the objects which you are actually going to have

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:25.527
in your program would be attributes of that overall system object.

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.560
Second is we just men, mentioned.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.630
It may be the case that we're going to have to decide how to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.330
deal with associations and invariants.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.772
And third, as you'll see a little bit later in this lesson.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.884
Although you're going to have in your OO design,

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:45.925
classes that were originally specified during your object oriented analysis,

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:50.550
you're also going to have some addition, additional classes.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930
And we want to look at what are the circumstances that would lead you to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.280
having some additional classes.
