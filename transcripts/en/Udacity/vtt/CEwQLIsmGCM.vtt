00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.490
I broke this course into four
stages that built on one another.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.710
You'll start in the wrapping stage
where you'll be learning the syntax

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.670
of constructing promises.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.970
A promise constructor in and
of itself isn't super useful.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.740
So from there, you'll be learning how
to react the resolution of the promise.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.840
If all goes well, you'll want to then
off the promise, or if something breaks,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.130
you'll want to catch the error, these
are the thening and the catching stages.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.650
You'll spend the whole second
lesson in the chaining stage

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.050
where you'll learn how to create
long sequences of asynchronous work.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.100
It's also worth going over
some promise vocabulary.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.040
I'm stealing these definitions from Jake
Archibald who wrote a fantastic guide on

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.350
promises that you can find
in the instructor notes.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.910
There are four states
a promise can have.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.590
You'll pick up these terms pretty
quickly, but I recommend jotting them

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.660
down on a piece of paper to help out
as you're going through the course.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.160
Here they are.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.880
The first one is fulfilled, and
that means that the action related to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.220
the promise succeeded,
this state is also known as resolved.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.380
Then there is rejected,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.070
this means that the action
related to the promise failed.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.800
The next one is pending,
which means that the promise has not yet

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.600
fulfilled or rejected.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.780
And then finally, there's settled,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.140
which means that the promise has
either fulfilled or rejected.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.430
Okay, now that you've got
the terms behind promises and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.790
you know where we're going in
the course, it's time to examine how and

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.320
when promises are executed.
