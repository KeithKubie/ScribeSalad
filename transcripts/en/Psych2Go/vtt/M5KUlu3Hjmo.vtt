To get a free book, and two audible originals

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.980
And a 30-day trial.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.715
Do you ever wonder

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.545
about how you turned out the way you are? Or why some

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:19.925
adults are more uptight than others while

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:22.565
others are fun and delightful? As cliche

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:25.575
as it sounds, it all comes back to your childhood.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.355
Depending on the households we grew up in, some of us

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.355
may cringe at the thought while others may look starry-eyed

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.865
as they grow nostalgic. Before we begin

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:36.495
with this video, we want to remind you that it's never

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.605
too late to change your future. Even if

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.645
certain past events put you in a stronger likelihood of outcomes.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.045
Here are 8 ways your childhood

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:45.725
affects your lifestyle.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:46.995
1) If your parents

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.375
were highly strict, you may grow up to be codependent.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.455
Did you have an overbearing mother who picked out every outift

00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:55.635
for you? Or an inflexible father who made you

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.605
practise more sports instead of hanging out with your friends?

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.725
Even if they mean well, or believe that they are doing what's best for

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.695
you, helicopter parenting has harmful side-effects.

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.475
A big one being that you are more likely to grow up

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:10.235
codependent. As an adult, you might rely

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.915
on your partner to take care of the chores or have trouble

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:14.800
adapting to work life.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.155
2) If your parents have a broken marriage, it changes your romantic demands.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:21.455
It's like Pam said from the office, when you're

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.405
a kid, you assume your parents are soulmates. But

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:25.525
unfortunately,

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:27.115
this isn't always the case.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.075
Divorce rates are sky-rocketing in America, now up to

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:31.935
40-50% of married

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:34.715
couples are more likely to end up in a divorce.

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:37.955
If your parents separated, especially if the event happened during

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.685
your early childhood, studies show that you're prone to having

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.745
higher demands when it comes to romantic relationships.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.585
You may expect your partner to show a higher degree

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:49.265
of morality, loyalty and compassion

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:51.100
so you can trust them better.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.645
3) If your parents micromanaged you, you're more likely to develop

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:57.675
depression. OK, we've talked about codependency,

00:01:57.675 --> 00:01:59.975
but depression is also a damaging

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.405
side-effect of authoritarian parenting.

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:05.055
When you grow up with parents who do all the

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.675
decision making for you, it makes you assume that you're not

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.355
competent enough to problem solve on your own.

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:13.335
Instead of listening to you and nurturing you to learn from your

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:16.285
mistakes, they often force decisions onto you.

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:18.015
Even ones that make you unhappy.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:20.945
This can lead to feelings of worthlessness, and low self-esteem

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.400
which follow you into adulthood,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.360
manifesting into depression.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.700
4) If your parents watched TV with you when you were a toddler

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.675
instead of reading to you, it can suppress

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:33.185
your communication skills. We always see

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.220
those commercials of mothers reading to their babies, but this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.200
advertisment actually has value! It turns

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.955
out that if your parents expose you to more television

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.705
as a toddler instead of flipping through books, this can

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.365
hinder your communication skills. Studies

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:50.245
have shown that when a mother and child watch TV together,

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:53.085
the mother makes fewer comments to the child whereas

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.340
if she reads to her child, it promotes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.780
the child to ask questions, and a higher response rate from the mother.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.140
5) If you copied your parents a lot,

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.935
you're more likely to be open to other cultures.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:07.355
Did you often imitate your parents growing up? Even if

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.875
the actions didn't always make sense, you knew that

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.915
they had some sort of purpose. Researchers had an adult show

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:15.385
a child how to open a box with sticks.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:17.725
Even though it's more practical to use their fingers,

00:03:17.725 --> 00:03:20.915
when children imitate the behaviours of their parents, their more

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:23.915
likely to adapt to cultural norms. That's because

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:26.725
culture beliefs and customs may not always been seen

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:29.685
as practical and can even be outdated, but when the individual

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:31.500
is open to learning them,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.620
they also have the ability to be more culturally aware.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.815
6) If you were spanked as a child, you may become sneakier

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.660
as an adult. In some countries, it is now illegal

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.320
to spank your child because it's seen as physical abuse.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.740
Depending on the severity of spanking, it has harmful

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:49.485
side-effects ranging from academic problems

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:52.655
to health ones, such as dying at a younger age of cancer,

00:03:52.655 --> 00:03:55.435
heart diseases and respiratory diseases.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.165
But, did you know that you also more prone to being

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.795
a sneaky adult? Author Daniel Pink

00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:03.015
states that trying to influence a child's behaviour

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:05.985
by offering rewards and punishment does not always result

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:08.995
in the desired behaviour. In fact, children

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:12.015
who were spanked may work harder to avoid being punished.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:14.465
7) If your parents have a drug or alcohol

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:17.445
addiction, you're susceptible to perfectionism.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:20.155
Do you know someone who is serious, has a good work ethic,

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.135
and is bit of a perfectionist?

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:25.215
Chances are they might have grown up being a parent to their own

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:27.985
parents. When a child has parents who are alcoholics

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.965
or drug addicts, they never had the

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:32.525
opportunites to let loose and have fun.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.005
Instead, they had to grow up faster than the

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:38.285
other children and take care of household responsibilities.

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:40.935
On the other hand, some children may adopt the habits

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.420
of their parents which can

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.200
manifest into depression, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.160
8) If you have a close relationship

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.995
with your father, you're more likely to enter

00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:53.845
healthier relationships. We've all probably

00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:56.235
heard of the term "Daddy Issues" when someone

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.255
grew up without a father around. Unfortunately, research

00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:01.795
only continues to show it's true.

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:02.685
One study

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:05.645
examined the quality of father-child relationships among 3

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.995
groups. Orphans, children of divorced

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:10.525
parents, and children in stable families.

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:12.215
Results showed that the children,

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:14.515
whether they were male or female, with the close

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:17.525
relationship with their father was more common than those who didn't.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.835
When we are able to love our

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:22.575
parents and learn to be patient with them, we are more likely

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:25.445
to do the same for our romantic partners.

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:28.445

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:31.515
