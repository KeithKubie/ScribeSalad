00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.760
Every movie and TV fan knows that these days,
avoiding spoilers is becoming harder and harder.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.560
But what happens when it isn't a poster, trailer,
or even early screening that hints at or spoils

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.020
major plot beats - but scenes in the movie
itself?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.840
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Spoilers
Hidden in Popular Movies.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.040
Back to the Future
It's nearly impossible to spoil this time-travel

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.460
trilogy, since the fun isn't in knowing whether
Marty and Doc change history, but actually

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.460
doing it.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.590
Still, fans could have predicted that sending
Marty back to the future wouldn't go smoothly.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.890
The paper cut-out of Harold Lloyd hanging
from a clock tower in "Safety Last!" hints

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.500
at the film’s climax in the opening minute.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.710
Tangled
The baby Rapunzel doesn't spend much time

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.780
at home before being kidnapped, but it wasn't
the tragedy it seemed.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.050
You could say her trauma was destiny at work:
just take a look at the mobile in her crib.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.140
There's a sign of her pet lizard Pascal, a
Rubber Duck for the tavern she visits on the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.630
run, the horse Maximus, and more, all giving
hints at her coming adventure.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.340
The Prestige
Everyone who's seen the movie knows that director

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.850
Christopher Nolan left plenty of hints to
the twist ending of The Prestige - but did

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.000
you realize he also let the secret slip to
his biggest rival magician?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.250
Viewers get the spoiler through narration.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.300
You might think it's referring to the two
stars, but when you realize Christian Bale

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.020
was actually playing twins, the line gives
the entire twist away in the first scenes.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.360
Frozen
It broke every Disney fan's heart when they

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.020
found out Prince Hans was really a villain
in disguise.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.810
His plan was a subtle one, but fans missed
one of the biggest clues that he wasn't as

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.170
innocent as he seemed.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.610
When soldiers corner and try to kill Queen
Elsa, Hans comes to the rescue, but accidentally

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.080
knocks down a chandelier which almost kills
her anyway.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.000
But look closer: Hans spots the crossbow,
then takes a quick look at the chandelier

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.260
before jumping into action.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.020
He made it seem like an accident, but his
plan to take Elsa out was clear for those

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.700
who caught it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.410
Guardians of the Galaxy
Star-Lord has a knack for nicknames when it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.440
comes to his alien partners, and goes deep
into his childhood for Groot, the walking

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.080
tree.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.270
Most fans will get the reference to Shel Silverstein's
childrens’ book "The Giving Tree", but if

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.970
they remembered the story, they might realize
how closely it follows Groot's journey.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.410
He grows flowers to help his friends, loses
his branches, and eventually sacrifices his

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.460
entire body for the boy he loves.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.890
But just like in the book, the tree was happy.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.570
Captain America: The First Avenger
Double meanings and foreshadowing are often

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.920
used to throw a wink to the audience, but
nobody could have guessed that Captain America's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.940
big screen solo movie would launch him into
the future, ready to lead the Avengers into

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.940
action.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.720
Well, there was one person who knew that his
and Steve's path was going to send them into

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750
the next century.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.450
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective
The surprise ending to this detective story

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.690
is played for a ton of laughs, with the revelation
that police lieutenant Lois Einhorn was Ray

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.030
Finkle in a previous life.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.110
The jokes at her expense are all pretty childish,
and so was one of the biggest hints at her

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.590
true identity, revealed through a few pieces
of fruit on her desk.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.960
Looper
The hero of this film winds up doing everything

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.100
he can to prevent a telekinetic young boy
from becoming a horrible crime lord in the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.840
future, going by the name of 'The Rainmaker.'

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.040
Although he succeeds, the name is never explained...
but it IS hinted at.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.690
Before the protagonist even arrives at the
boy's farmhouse, audiences get a look at a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.400
futuristic flying drone used to water the
surrounding crops.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.740
If they realized this "rain-maker" was the
key, they could've gotten the twist a whole

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.930
lot sooner.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.300
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Keeping the events of the Harry Potter series

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.120
under wraps was a major priority for author
JK Rowling.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.569
But one of the story's biggest surprises was
hinted at in just the third movie.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.070
When Harry is injured during a Quidditch match,
he wakes up to his friends, with the Weasley

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.800
twins defending him with a threat.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.440
They couldn't have known it then, but that
same fate would fall on Albus Dumbledore,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.850
thrown from the Astronomy Tower to his death
three movies later.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.020
Casino Royale
Directors often use symbols to clue the audience

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.770
in on their characters, but using them to
spoil the movie in the opening credits isn't

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.770
as common.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.940
In Casino Royale's credits, Vesper Lynd's
character is revealed as both the Queen of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.830
Hearts and the Queen of Spades.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.520
For those who know their suits, that means
she's a symbol of love, and a symbol of bad

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.190
luck or betrayal - revealing her character's
double-cross, setting in motion multiple sequels.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.220
Those are all the details, twists or plot
points spoiled in major films, but which clues

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.220
have we missed?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.090
