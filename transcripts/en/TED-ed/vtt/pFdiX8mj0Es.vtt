00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:09.984
On September 6, 1522,

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:13.454
the "Victoria" sailed into harbor
in southern Spain.

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:17.163
The battered vessel and its 18
sailors were all that remained

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.823
of a fleet that had departed
three years before.

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:23.379
Yet her voyage was considered a success

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.949
for the "Victoria" had achieved
something unprecedented:

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.859
the first circumnavigation
of the globe.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.359
But this story really begins in 1494,

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.110
two years after Columbus's voyage
on behalf of Spain.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.540
Columbus's discovery had prompted
the Catholic Spanish rulers

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.470
to turn to the Pope to preempt
any claims by Portugal to the new lands.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.030
The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing
an imaginary line on the world map.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.991
Spain had the right to claim territories
west of the divide,

00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.330
and Portugal to the east.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.679
Spain and Portugal, the two major
seafaring super powers at the time,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.521
agreed to these terms in what came
to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:13.320
At the time, these nations had their
eyes on the same prize:

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.730
trade routes to the Spice Islands
in today's Indonesia.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.170
The spices found there,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.620
which were used as seasonings,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.880
food preservatives,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.511
and aphrodisiacs,

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.461
were worth many times 
their weight in gold.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.551
But because of Portugal's control
over eastern sea routes,

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.206
Spain's only viable option
was to sail west.

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:37.432
So when a Portuguese defector
named Ferdinand Magellan

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:41.143
claimed that a westward route
to the Spice Islands existed,

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:44.781
King Charles made him captain
of a Spanish armada,

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:48.191
and gave him all the resources 
he would need.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.652
Along with a share 
in the voyage's profits,

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:54.953
he granted Magellan five ships
and about 260 men.

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:57.941
The crew included a young slave
named Enrique,

00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:01.381
captured by Magellan on a previous
journey to Malacca,

00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.381
and Antonio Pigafetta,

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:06.513
a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure.

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:11.062
On September 20, 1519, 
the fleet weighed anchor

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:13.516
and headed southwest.

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:16.101
After making landfall 
in what is now Brazil,

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:20.455
it proceeded along the coast,
exploring any water way leading inland.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:25.322
They were looking for the fabled passage
linking east and west.

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.099
As the weather worsened,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.402
the Spaniards resentment
at having a Portuguese captain escalated.

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.882
A full-blown mutiny soon erupted,

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:37.621
which Magellan crushed 
with unspeakable cruelty.

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.582
But his problems were only just beginning.

00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:45.373
During a reconnaissance mission, 
the "Santiago" was wrecked by a storm.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.613
Then while exploring a narrow waterway,

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:51.973
the captain of the "San Antonio" took
the first opportunity to slip away

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:54.203
and sail back home.

00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:55.763
Magellan pressed forward,

00:02:55.763 --> 00:03:00.583
and on October 21, he started exploring
a navigable sea way.

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.764
27 freezing days later,

00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:06.372
the three remaining ships emerged
from what we now call

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:10.293
the Strait of Magellan
into the Mar Pacifico.

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:14.443
The fleet never expected the new ocean
to be so vast.

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:20.183
After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors
had succumbed to scurvy and famine.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:22.004
When they finally reached land again,

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:26.864
Enrique, the young slave, proved
able to communicate with the natives.

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:28.814
Their goal couldn't be far.

00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:34.645
Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly
received by Rajah Humabon of Cebu.

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:36.793
So when the ruler asked him to help subdue

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:40.155
and convert 
the rebellious chief of Mactan,

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.700
the captain readily agreed.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.749
The adventure would be his last.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.005
Overconfident and severely outnumbered,
Magellan's force was overwhelmed,

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:53.111
and the native's bamboo spears
ended the captain's life.

00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.159
Yet the voyage had to continue.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.570
Magellan's will specified that Enrique
should be freed,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.522
but the expedition still needed
an interpreter.

00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:02.920
With his freedom at stake,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.770
Enrique is believed to have plotted
with the Rajah

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.181
to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed
at a feast on the beach.

00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.581
Enrique was never heard from again,

00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:15.479
but if he ever made it back to Malacca,

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:21.380
he may have been the first person
to actually circumnavigate the globe.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.212
Meanwhile, the survivors 
burned the Concepcion

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:25.900
and proceeded onward.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.011
They finally reached the Spice Islands
in November of 1521

00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.971
and loaded up on precious cargo.

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.651
But they still had to return to Spain.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.652
The "Trinidad" sank shortly after being
captured by the Portuguese.

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:44.599
The "Victoria" continued west,
piloted by Juan SebastiÃ¡n Elcano,

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.692
one of the pardoned mutineers.

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:51.171
Against all odds, the small vessel
made it back to Spain

00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:54.661
with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon,

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.772
enough to cover the expedition
and turn a profit.

00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.291
An obsessive chronicler,

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:03.552
Pigafetta described the lands
and people they encountered.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:05.391
With the help of a humble slave,

00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:08.142
he also compiled 
the world's first phrase book

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:09.895
of native languages.

00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:13.502
His journal is the reason we can
tell this story.

00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:15.792
Magellan's legacy lingers.

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:19.987
He had galaxies and space programs
named after him.

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.789
Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.209
with a coat of arms and his face
on currency and stamps.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.149
United by fate, the survivors

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:31.829
and the hundreds 
who sacrificed their lives

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.630
challenged conventional wisdom

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.730
and completed a historic journey
once thought impossible.
