00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.310
Have you ever been in a crowd and a fight
starts?

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.870
Or seen a video of people being brutalized
while bystanders mill around?

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.979
Why don't we step in and help!?

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:14.120
What's wrong with people?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.470
In 1964, Kitty Genovese was raped and murdered
in New York City, people nearby who were aware

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.361
the crime was being committed did nothing
-- psychologists called this the Bystander

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.390
Effect.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.609
According to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, two-thirds of all violent crime victimizations

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:33.809
had a bystander.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
The news constantly cycles cell phone videos
of fights, arrests, shootings, brutalization,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.829
and they occasionally feature bystanders just
milling around!

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.079
Bystander in full effect!

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.460
What's going on here?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.559
Psychologists have found humans in groups
are less likely to come to the aid of someone

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.949
in need, even if they would have jumped to
a rescue when alone.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.379
In one 2014 study, 5-year-olds refrained from
helping a "confused" experimenter when in

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.809
a group, but readily assisted when alone.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.840
Other studies have shown this extends to online
environments too!

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.890
But still, what the heck?

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.831
Shouldn't we want to help people all the time?

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:14.840
Bystander effect seems to be a combination
of two things: Pluralistic Ignorance, and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.500
Diffusion of Responsibility.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.780
Pluralistic Ignorance is the idea that without
ever saying anything to other members of the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.870
group we assume everyone is on the same page.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.490
When other people DON'T act, we assume everyone
has decided it's fine.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.030
We are social group animals, not solitary
ones, and thus, we look to those around us

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.670
for the social prompts.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.460
Diffusion of Responsibility says that we are
less likely to take responsibility when others

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.410
are present; because the responsibility is
now spread across everyone.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.320
This is multiplied in emergency situations:
where we have to act quickly and make decisions

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.470
without being able to talk them out.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.150
It seems comical to shout shouldn't someone
do something?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.200
But that's how our minds work!

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.190
We've diffused the responsibility to the group,
and what we want to do is ambiguous!

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.490
Thus no one makes a decision and we all become
victims of the bystander effect.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.020
A 1969 experiment in American Scientist, put
people in a room and asked them to fill out

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.420
a questionnaire; then, researchers slowly
pumped smoke into the room.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.859
When alone, 75 percent of the subjects noticed
the smoke, and calmly went to report it.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.030
But, when other researchers were in the room
pretending to be subjects (who wouldn't react

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.030
no matter what happened) only 10 percent of
the people reported the smoke, even when it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.950
was SO THICK they couldn't see their questionnaire!

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.349
Security cameras have been found to reduce
the strength of the bystander effect because

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.129
we want to perform a good deed for this imagined
audience; but that doesn't translate to cell

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.129
phone cameras.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.909
A clinical psychologist told Boston Magazine,
“We tend to get reinforced for [recording

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:43.909
fights with our cameras].

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.700
It can show up on the news, or get a million
hits on YouTube," or increase social status

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.730
with your friends.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.870
Plus, the footage may help an authority bring
the right person to justice, or solve the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.529
issue later, which reinforces personal recordings
further!

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.999
Is there a cure for the bystander effect?

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:03.999
Yes!

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.340
Someone just has to act.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.219
If someone jumps in the pool to save a splashing
kid; takes charge and tells someone to call

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.469
911 after an injury; or steps in to stop a
fight… responsibility isn't diffused any

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.430
longer, and Pluralistic Ignorance is broken.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.670
It is easy to think you'd do something different
when watching a video at home by yourself,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.540
but standing with other people in the moment
complicates things intensely.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.090
People who do act are called active bystanders,
and according to Psychology Today, they "tend

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.719
to have heightened concern for the welfare
of others, greater feelings of social responsibility

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.120
and a greater commitment to moral values."

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.499
As an Eagle Scout, I was taught to step in
and help, as were emergency responders, veterans,

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.859
and others in our society; but it's never
easy to overcome our instincts and evolved

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:49.989
social responses.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.901
Psychology can get nebulous on the best of
days, and while this is heavily studied, the

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.370
exact reasons we do this are still unclear.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:23.520
As always, more research is needed.
