00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270
oh

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.350
Dang

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.280
Hey What's up guys welcome back to the shop i'm here again with nate Today we're gonna be showing you how to take common parts

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.090
From The hardware store and Build an Air-powered T-Shirt cannon Let's Jump Right in

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
Nate is our newest and finest Addition to the team i brought Him on Board Because he's Helped me with a lot of cool projects

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.470
In the past?

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.340
Like The Giant squirt gun that We did That Was 4 Feet Tall 7 Feet wide he also Helped with decorating These T-Shirt cannons and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.550
we did for Cvx live

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.109
Shooting T-Shirts Out Into the audience he also worked with Devin Graham on his Mario Kart in real life video where he built red turtle

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.160
Shells and Turned them into

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.820
Remote-control Racers That Go Up to 60 miles an hour and he might show you how to do that in a future video

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.640
Now the materials for This project are Very Simple you Just Run down to your local hardware store and pick Up some Abs fittings we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.020
Have a Two-Foot length of 3-Inch Abs a Two-Foot length of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440
a 2 foot length of 2 inchAbs

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.380
Adapter From three inch to two inch we have 2

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.079
Three inch couplings and a three inch to one and a Half inch Adapter if You take a close look at These Adapters you can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.579
See they've got a beveled edge on the inside but if you flip them over That's where the Tubes slide in and make a Tight

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.738
fit That's Just gonna make It look a Little more aesthetically Pleasing

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.779
Now in Addition to the Abs Fittings we're also gonna Bring in some PvC That's gonna Work the valve and

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.819
Give us a Place to pressurize it with bike Pump these are the parts That you're gonna Need the first adapter we're using is this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.820
One and a Half inch to

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.349
3/4 inch slip Two Threaded Adapter That's gonna Fit into the Abs and from that all The rest of the parts are Threaded we're using

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.930
Six 3/4 inch Threaded Closed Nipples a 3/4 inch coupling to three-quarter inch 90 degree elbows a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.590
3/4 inch tee and end cap and a 3/4 inch ball valve

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.549
Purpose of the end cap is to let us pressurize the system and if you want

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.999
To use a bike Pump you can Just use schrader valve Which we Picked up at the auto parts store

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.229
Or you can use a pneumatic quick connect Adapter so you can Fill It with an air hose

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.680
So now that we've got all our Pieces

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.439
Collected and Put Together There's two Things We Need to do first of all We Need to cut our Tubes to size and then we're

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.179
gonna glue most of these Pieces Together using Black Abs cement and some Green Abs 2 Pvc glue

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.819
Quick update Guys we made our cuts and Here's where we're at the 3-Inch Tube is Now 16 inches long

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.399
The Smaller Tube Is 2 Inches short and That's going to give a Little Room for our proto cutty plug to bounce Around inside

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.180
We also assembled all of The

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.299
Pvc parts We've Painted This Part of a Handle Yellow and The rest of its can Be painted all Black Just to make it look

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300
Good

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.069
When you're painting PVC you want to make sure that you first do a light Dust coat Over the Whole surface

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.640
That Will Let The Next Layers of Paint Bond to the plastic Really well

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.760
otherwise It Has a Tendency to beat Up and not be a smooth coating

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.260
Now while nate is working on painting The PVC components Black I'm gonna be working on making a Proto Putty plug with this one-inch piece

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.100
of scrap That we Cut off the three inch tubing

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.650
Essentially we're Just gonna pack This Thing Full of proto putty make sure it's smooth on the top of the bottom and that Should Work

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.650
Perfectly for our prototype Lug

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.869
We Got The Handle all painted and the proto putty is setting That's going to be curing for there five or ten minutes and while

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.420
It is we're going to move on to assembling The body of the cannon?

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.768
Now to assemble the body of the cannon we're going to do it in three different parts we're gonna take the larger Tube and stick

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.529
It right Down inside of a Coupling first and glue That Together we're gonna take the smaller Tube and the smaller coupling we're gonna make

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.539
sure that the Beveled side is Faced down on the table and then we're gonna glue the tube it down inside the center of That

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.339
Pushing It All The Way down flat Now we're going to take the smaller coupling we're gonna set It down the table so the beveled

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.829
Side Is facing Up we're gonna take our 3-Inch coupling glue it up and we're gonna press it down until everything Goes completely Flat

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.809
Against the bottom before we Go any Further Let's take the smaller Tube and Rub It Around in circles on a piece of Sandpaper

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.190
Help Smooth Down That Edge and make a Little Bit Better Seal When the proto putty Makes Contact

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.309
And of Course This we're Just going Abs to Abs we're Just using the black Abs glue for this

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.139
Perfect okay

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.509
All these Pieces Went Together Beautifully and Now we've Got the inside Tube the outside team we're going to take the inside one we're going

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.900
to place it Facedown

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.209
Gonna Take The outside one glue it up and we're going to come straight down over top and press that Down?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400
So it's nice and. Flush on the bottom as well

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.549
Our protocol Puck is completely took This Thing Out of The Abs ring

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.290
Dusted It with a Little Bit of Baby powder and then Wiped It all down with a Paper towel to get a Nice clean and

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.899
Smooth Now the side that Was sitting down on the countertop is the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.999
Smoothest Edge we want to take that we want to put It down inside of the three-inch Abs tubing and Push it all The Way

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.970
Down so It makes Contact with a Two inch Tube inside

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.010
That's going to block off The 2 inch Tube inside and allow uS to pressurize the system so now the only Things left to do

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.679
Are glue on the back Attach the handle and decorate it

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.169
Moment of truth 1 2 3 commit

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.470
boom There it is

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.770
so here we Have it Guys our t-Shirt cannon is Fully assembled Fully decorated and Pretty Much Ready for pressure testing and This is the

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.710
Basic Idea of How it works

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.379
You hook Up something Like an Air hose or a bike Pump to this valve here and as long as This valve is Closed it

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.520
Will Push the air up inside this chamber Now the proto putty plug will shift Upwards

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.830
Block The Tube on the inside and the rest of the air Wall

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.679
Shimmy Around The Plug and fill Up This large chamber on the inside when that pressurized up to 60 to 80

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.700
Psi it's held in place until you release This valve Because the instant this valve gets Turned open Any air behind the proto putty plug

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.279
Rushes Out Forcing The plug to slam down to the bottom and all the remaining air to shove Out the center of The tube this

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.260
Happens Very Very quickly and it's Very Very powerful now if you want to go the extra mile with Your decorations you can do something

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.319
Like What nate did putting a Crown on this one Make This Crown i laid the pattern over some Aluminum Foil tape and cut it

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.670
Out with an exacto knife Which i think is crazy Because Who'd cut that Out with an exacto knife It Does look Pretty Good though

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.279
You Gotta Admit so this point our t-Shirt cans are Ready for

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.559
pressurizing and you can Get Really Fancy With How you fold Your shirts or You could Just Shove them down the barrel you know pack

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.880
Them down tight with a stick and then release The Handle and They're gonna Fly anywhere Between 40 to 60 psi

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.960
These Things are gonna Work really Really Well

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.150
Quick shout-Out to my friend Been with Nighthawk and light for being The inspiration behind this project with His

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.179
Coaxial potato Cannon Of Which i put a Link down in the description

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.200
so before we wrap Up let's take These Things outside and show you what they can do

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.140
Alright so this is what It looks like set to 20 psi

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.859
Woohoo that good 10 to 15 feet and this is What It looks like at 60 oh?

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.010
Dang That Was awesome it's on the roof it's on the roof

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.720
There you go

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.139
Wow we Caught it Nice Positioning

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.589
So there you have it Guys That's how to take common parts From The hardware store and Turn them into a fully

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.739
Functional Air Powered T-Shirt cannon You can use them to shoot T-Shirts

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.899
Nerf Darts or anything Else That You can fit down the barrel hey thanks for Joining Us for this project if We look for the

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.900
Next One talk to you then oh?

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.810
Dude that Flies 80 feet 80 Feet

And You trust your TV a lot more Than i trust mine

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.769
something That's interesting about This Teflon tape is that if you pull it Sideways and

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.140
Stretch Crazy Amounts

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:24.749
One interesting side note is if you take One of The little Nerf Darts They fit down the barrel a Little Bit to perfectly

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.080
Dang House far
