00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.515
- [Instructor] In this
video we're going to talk

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:04.052
about what is one of the darkest chapters

00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:06.537
in human history, the Holocaust,

00:00:06.537 --> 00:00:10.397
which involved the massacre
of roughly 6 million Jews

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:13.665
and as many as 11 million
civilians in total.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:16.399
In order to understand the Holocaust,

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.874
we're going to start at World War I.

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:23.118
Even prior to World War
I, there were massacres,

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:26.827
especially of Jews, in places
like the Russian empire.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:29.271
The term pogrom is a Russian word

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.733
meaning these violent riots or attacks

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.643
on people for their ethnicity.

00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:36.354
There were several
through the 19th century.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:39.506
But they go back even
before that word was coined

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.857
as early as the first crusades.

00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:44.330
Famously in the Rhineland,
many of the Jewish people

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.466
were killed and attacked.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:50.164
You had a solid thread of antisemitism

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:51.922
throughout much of Europe,

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:55.289
including Germany and Eastern Europe

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.622
as we get up to and through World War I.

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:01.774
As we've talked about in other videos,

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:04.514
the central powers lose World War I

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:06.882
and the Treaty of Versailles places a lot

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:09.041
of the blame on Germany.

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:11.683
The national pride of
Germany has been shattered.

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.831
They have lost this war.

00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.618
They have lost territory.

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:17.314
Their economy is in shambles.

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:19.694
They're paying reparations.

00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:21.690
It is in that context

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.703
that the National Socialist Party forms

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:28.870
officially in 1920, coming out
of the German Workers Party.

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.464
They focused on ideas of national identity

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:36.581
and from the start were
against ethnic groups,

00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:39.043
blaming their problems,
including the loss of World War I

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:41.620
often on these ethnic groups.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.643
In 1921, Hitler, who had
fought during World War I

00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:46.670
and based on some of his writings

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.201
seemed to have found a lot
of meaning during the war,

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.069
he becomes the National
Socialist Party leader.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.531
National Socialist, it gets abbreviated

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.364
as Nazi, National Socialist
Party, Nazi Party.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.013
In 1923, Hitler tries
to begin an overthrow

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:04.986
of the government.

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:08.085
But his putsch, his coup, is unsuccessful

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:10.135
and he is imprisoned.

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.520
It is while in prison that he writes

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.574
down his belief system that
eventually gets published

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:19.741
upon his release in 1925
under the title Mein Kampf,

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:25.495
which can be translated as
my struggle or my battle.

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:27.898
This is just an excerpt from Mein Kampf.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.451
"If we pass all the causes of
the German collapse in review,

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.185
"the ultimate and most
decisive remains the failure

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:36.814
"to recognize the racial problem

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:39.067
"and especially the Jewish menace.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:42.434
"The defeats on the
battlefield in August, 1918,"

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:44.767
so he's referring the end of World War I,

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.066
"Would have been child's play to bear.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.800
"They stood in no
proportion to the victories

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.344
"of our people.

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:54.572
"It was not they that
caused our downfall, no.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:57.689
"It was brought about by
that power which prepared

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.592
"these defeats by systematically,
over many decades,

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:04.417
"robbing our people of the
political and moral instincts

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.337
"and forces which alone
make nations capable

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:09.671
"and hence worthy of existence."

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.411
He's blaming Germany's
defeat in World War I

00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:14.808
on a relatively small ethnic group.

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.718
So, as you can see, a very twisted mind,

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.790
very twisted thinking.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.072
"The lost purity of the blood alone

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:23.899
"destroys inner happiness forever,"

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.586
so he's very caught up
with these ideas of purity,

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.582
"Plunges man into the abyss for all time,

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:32.391
"and the consequences can
never more be eliminated

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.308
"from body and spirit."

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.293
Over time, what starts
off as this fringe leader

00:03:39.293 --> 00:03:42.672
of a fringe party, as we go into the 20s

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:45.302
and as the German economy gets even worse

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:46.910
and there's hyperinflation,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.174
more and more people start
to throw their support

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.008
behind these extremists.

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:54.543
And as we go into the 30s,
the National Socialist Party

00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:57.980
is actually able to get
reasonable representation

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.861
in the German parliament.

00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.611
In 1933, the president of Germany

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:06.378
appoints Hitler to be chancellor,

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:08.932
which is the equivalent
of being prime minister

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:13.234
despite the Nazis not having
a majority in parliament.

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:15.759
This is the official
beginning of what the Nazis

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.400
will call the Third Reich.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.188
Reich translates as realm.

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:22.388
They considered the First Reich

00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:24.199
to be the holy Roman Empire.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.396
They refer to the Second
Reich as the German Empire

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:30.353
after the holy Roman Empire up

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.779
and through World War I.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.979
They don't consider the Weimar Republic,

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.889
which they hate, the Third Reich.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.194
They consider that the interim Reich.

00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:41.858
And they consider
themselves the Third Reich,

00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:45.533
the heir to the German Empire
and the holy Roman Empire.

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.017
Once Hitler and the Nazis get power,

00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:50.496
they really get a strangle hold on it.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:53.590
They start persecuting
their political opponents

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.986
both, outside the party,
and inside the party.

00:04:56.986 --> 00:05:01.671
They also start to take
action on these twisted ideas

00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:03.982
Hitler expressed in Mein Kampf.

00:05:03.982 --> 00:05:08.065
In 1935, they're able to
pass the Nuremberg Laws,

00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:12.370
which strips German Jews
of their citizenship.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.115
It forbids intermarrying
between non-Jewish Germans

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.386
and Jews.

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:20.596
This is only one of many
steps that will continue

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:25.048
to demean the rights of
Jews inside of Germany.

00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:29.594
In 1938, you have what is
known as Kristallnacht,

00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:31.544
or the night of broken glass.

00:05:31.544 --> 00:05:33.872
Hundred of synagogues are burned.

00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:36.357
Thousands of Jewish
businesses are destroyed

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:39.642
and many Jews are killed in that night.

00:05:39.642 --> 00:05:42.411
Then as we get into 1939,

00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:45.337
Hitlers' armies famously invade Poland

00:05:45.337 --> 00:05:47.891
beginning what many historians consider

00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:50.004
to be the start of World War II.

00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:53.354
What would eventually be
known as the Holocaust

00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:55.854
goes into full effect in 1941.

00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:00.612
Jews are sometimes
executed in the streets,

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:03.375
in their homes, many of them are captured

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:05.796
and sent to concentration camps.

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:08.519
To get a sense of the
scale of this operation,

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.339
we have this excerpt from
Michael Berenbaum's book,

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.970
The World Must Know.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.901
"The policy of extermination
involved every level

00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:20.489
"of German society and
marshaled the entire apparatus

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:22.364
"of the German bureaucracy.

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:25.231
"Parish churches and the
Interior Ministry supplied

00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:28.871
"the birth records that
defined and isolated Jews.

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:30.961
"The post office delivered
the notifications

00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:34.833
"of definition, expropriation,
denaturalization,

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.371
"and deportation.

00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:39.291
"The Finance Ministry
confiscated Jewish wealth

00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.655
"and property.

00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:43.355
"German industrial and commercial firms

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:46.472
"fired Jewish workers,
officers, and board members,

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.583
"even disenfranchising
Jewish stockholders.

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.439
"The universities refused
to admit Jewish students,

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.976
"denied degrees to those already enrolled,

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:57.176
"and dismissed Jewish faculty.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:06:59.208
"government transportation bureaus handled

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.124
"the billing arrangements
with the railroads

00:07:01.124 --> 00:07:04.705
"for the trains that carried
Jews to their death."

00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:06.482
The point that's being
made here is this could not

00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:10.992
be done just with Hitler and
some of his close associates.

00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:13.906
To kill millions of people on this scale,

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:16.408
you needed and entire apparatus.

00:07:16.408 --> 00:07:19.415
And hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of people

00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:22.184
were involved in some way.

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:24.994
At least several hundreds
of thousands of people

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:29.161
within Germany must have been
aware of what was happening.

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:33.452
Needless to say, the death
toll was considerable.

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:35.478
This here is a visual depiction

00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:38.543
of the percentage of the Jewish population

00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:40.841
that was killed in various regions.

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.825
As you can see, 80 to 90
percent of the Jewish population

00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:46.408
in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland,

00:07:46.408 --> 00:07:49.787
was killed during the Holocaust.

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:53.200
In the territories occupied
by Germany in Russia

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.107
during World War II, almost
as many had been killed.

00:07:57.107 --> 00:08:01.274
In France, Italy, 1/5 to 1/4
of the population was killed.

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.031
To put things more in human terms,

00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:08.450
this is a picture of children
who were in Auschwitz,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.376
one of the most infamous
concentration camps.

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:13.629
You can see their names, their ages,

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:16.294
and then when they were killed.

00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:19.045
Historians believe five
to six million Jews

00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:20.340
were killed during the Holocaust

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.150
including a million and a half children.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.004
This was 2/3 of the Jewish
population of Europe.

00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:29.303
But the Holocaust went further.

00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:31.561
It's believed that over
10 million civilians

00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:33.895
were killed during the Holocaust.

00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:36.867
Over three million prisoners
of war were killed.

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:39.595
And other people including
several hundred thousand Romani,

00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:41.383
often referred to as Gypsies.

00:08:41.383 --> 00:08:43.688
Several hundred thousand
people with disabilities,

00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:45.929
many thousands of homosexuals

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:50.248
were all put to death
during the Holocaust.

00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:52.349
We've covered a lot of world history.

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:54.776
A lot of it, unfortunately,
has a lot of death,

00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:57.696
a lot of destruction and
sometimes targeting people

00:08:57.696 --> 00:08:59.124
for their ethnicity.

00:08:59.124 --> 00:09:01.788
But never, in world history,
have we seen something

00:09:01.788 --> 00:09:03.280
at this scale.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.316
Because it seemed to be
a relatively new concept,

00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:08.720
a term was coined, genocide.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.518
It was coined by Raphael Lemkin who,

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:15.603
as a Holocaust survivor, had
49 members of his family killed

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:17.270
during the Holocaust.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.232
It means killing of a people.

00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:22.482
Geno, coming from a people or a family,

00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:24.415
and cide, killing.

00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:26.000
But maybe even more interesting

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.206
than the word definition itself,

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:30.980
is thinking about why
this actually happened.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.870
Maybe even more importantly,
how society can avoid it.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.373
I'll leave you with that question.

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:39.078
What do you think was the
reason why this happened?

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.413
And do you think we have a risk

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.847
of that happening in the future?

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.606
And how can we prevent it?
