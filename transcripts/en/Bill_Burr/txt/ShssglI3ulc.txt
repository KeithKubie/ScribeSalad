Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay. Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning pod no it isn't it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       and ahhh

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       I'm just checking in on you. Come. I can't fucking hear myself. What am I going to plug this in right here? Can I hear myself? There we go. Now I can hear myself. You know Katie and myself, it's, I go, I was talking with about, with Dean del Ray last night outside of the comedy store. He was talking to me about how you know, you know in Quinn's singers get old. They can't, you know, they can't sing the way they used to, right. Jesus, this is going to be a long way. You know, like I was watching Christopher Cross last night, you know my wife, I came home and it was cranking, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       sailing, sailing away. Go away to, well no, the boat, whatever the fuck he says, cause that rat rack the whale. Right manner do we might listen to that shit. [inaudible] such a lower walk. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       Shit. So she was sitting there talking. Ah, fuck it. I'll just keep going on this thing and I'll get back to Dana, no matter. She kept talking about, she goes, what kind of like fucking music is this? She's like, is this like sort of uh, you know, she was saying it was sorta disc away. I'm like, there really isn't. It's sort of post disco. What'd you call that? Adult contemporary, you know, cuzzo raw nuts

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       because I ran man I like to wear and then girls would go to low world

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       and there was have like the fucking like really like, uh, like the session musicians they like so good. It's, it just doesn't sound like it's even alive. I know, it's weird. I liked the music, but just some of the shit, like the drummer was amazing on those fucking, it's just too slick, you know? I Dunno what the fuck it is. But anyways, I was talking to Dean and m we were talking about, I hate when people like bitch, when a singer gets old and then he can't sing the way used to and it's just like, well, yeah, because back in the day they used to sing like Robert blankets a ton of shit. It's like, dude, you go sing the fucking immigrant song every night for fucking a two year tour. You, you're done. Right? If you watched it. But it might not saying he can't sing now, but I mean, what do you want from the guy? He's out there drinking boozy smoking cigarettes and he's fucking singing every goddamn night as opposed to these modern day people who learn from the other guys the same way. No drummer drives a Rolls Royce into a swimming pool anymore. Right? Did I almost say swimming pool? Swimming Pool, right. Nobody drowns in their own vomit anymore. It happens every once in awhile. It fucking happens. But you know, you'll learn. It's like when I came in, um, when I came into this business, I saw a bunch of comics from the 80s that didn't pay. And, and fucking

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       senate all up their nose and they had their wages garnished and it was like they were on punishment for like 10 years. So my, my wave of comics, you know, stayed away from the blow when the booze and that type of shit. And then what was funny, I got about 15 years into this shit and I noticed that people started partying again. You know, just cause I, they probably looked at us like we were sitting there like we were part of the Osman family, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:03:29       So then another thing that they say is all wowed. You see so and so man, he got old. Oh Wow. She got old. And that always bugs me. So say, well what do, what the fuck happened to you? You're not losing your looks. They look at that. You say that enough. And now look at all these fucking celebrities. So walking around, they get in their fucking lips inflated to get net Goddamn Botox, you know, inject it in their face so they can be like laminated had that nice shiny face because nothing says youth, like a shiny unmoving face. Right. I don't know. I don't know how the hell I got into that. Um, I am going to go see a, a, I'm going to go to a rock concert tomorrow night. I'm going to UNMUTE, I don't even know what the kids call them nowadays. Um, I'm going to go see mute math tomorrow night.

Speaker 3:          00:04:16       Very excited about that. Um, it makes me feel like I'm somewhat not an old guy to be going to this thing. And a, I'm so old, I can't even like classify what their music is because uh, I had, I was hanging with Dean last night, a couple of other people, couple other oldies like myself. We were all just coming to the realization that rock music is, it's dead. It's just, it's dead and there's nothing we could do. And it's, you know, it's not coming back. And if somebody tries to bring it back, there'll be considered retro. Right. Am I out of my fucking mind? But it's, it's over. So last time you saw somebody playing a guitar,

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       I don't mean some Flamenco fucking shit or doing your acoustic version of a, of a rap song. I don't fucking mean that. I mean like just somebody, uh, I dunno. I know there's a lot of people scratching their heads going, well, what about all that death metal and all that shit? I of course, I'm, I'm not, I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about any, anything I've just talking about. Basically, I'm just an old man wondering where the hair metal went 30 years after it died. 36 years, maybe after it fucking died. I'm just an old man rambling on a podcast. Don't judge me. Huh? What about you? What are you doing right now? You sit in a traffic, right? You're a little fucking car. Drive over a puddle and the fucking water comes up through the floorboards. You're judging me. You take, I haven't been there.

Speaker 3:          00:05:43       I'm fucking with you. Um, so last night the show is Dean del Ray. Just a sick fucking show. I'm Dave Attell popped in who wants again, every time I see that guy performed, stand up, it's just, I talked to Bart Nick as like, as ever not going to be the best. Um, and there's no way for me to say what he says or I'll say burn his jokes. But he was just like, he's one of those guys that he has me dying laughing and half to half a set. I mean the dying laughing or I'm just standing there just, just watching them, just shaking my head like, how the fuck do you come up with that stuff? Um, so what am, I guess what I'm saying here is, um, I like Christopher Cross and if you have a chance, go see David. Tell, I think that that was the purpose of the first six minutes, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       Is that what it is? I'm not Jesus Christ. Oh Geez. I didn't tell you this man. Like, um, I was traveling a lot and I was, I was eating really poorly my last trip there, uh, when I was in a Foxwoods, right? Got The town early, visited, visited a friend of mine who unfortunately was in the hospital but is now out. And um, you know, so I was eating like shit that day and then I fucking went up to fox woods and I ordered room service. Then I lied to myself that I was going to work out it on Sunday when I could've worked out. I went to the Yukon game with Versie Versie hooked me up with the ticket, the gentleman that he is, and I went there and I ate like shit. So, uh, you know, you combine eating like shit and then getting on a plane for six hours and not drinking enough water and then all of a sudden, you know, the train's not coming out of the station.

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       So, you know, one day the train doesn't come and it's like, God maybe will come the next day. It doesn't come the next day. And then the third day, uh, you know, I'm like, what the fuck? The train never comes again. Then the, uh, the station dies. So, uh, I started thinking I got to go to fucking, you know, I gotta go to Wolf Stall, right. All that shit. But then I just got all paranoid and I was just like, you know something, the thing about the corporations is that they don't want to just get you, they want to get you hooked and they wanna head you keep coming back. So I got, I really started thinking about it going like, well wait a minute. If I go down and I take this stuff, they'll probably be something in there, in the little pill that tells my digestive track to just stand down.

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       Yeah, we don't need you anymore. Don't worry. We got it all right. Daddy's home. He's going to take care of everything and then I'm going to become hooked on these fucking pills and then I'm going to be one of those guys you see have any eat blueberries every morning for fucking breakfast trying to turn his system around. Not realizing that he's fucking himself far cause he went, you know, fucking himself over because he uh, he's eating them fucking pills every day. Right. It's going up getting them fucking pills. Right. So or freckles uses his brain. It's like there's no way that Julius Caesar had never had a problem taking a shit. And I know that there was no cvs pharmacy for him to go to. So I just looked up natural, a natural cures and woo. I found one that worked for all freckles. I know this is gross, but it's a really important thing.

Speaker 3:          00:09:10       I went out, okay, it's a teaspoon of olive oil and then you squeeze some lemon in it. You do it with the on an empty stomach and you fucking, you know, you do a shot of it in the morning. And the only thing I can compare it to as far as how well it works, you guys ever watch gas monkey garage and they get some old fucking car and they haven't turned over the engine and well, all right, so what do they do? They take off the fucking, the air filter housing, all that shit and they got that shit. They sprayed into the carburetor, they open the butterfly and they have it wide open. They go, I give it a shot and the guy turns it over here. The fuck thanks. Starts right up. That's basically what I did,

Speaker 4:          00:09:47       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       teaspoon of olive oil and some lemon. You do a shot of that on an empty stomach. I mean, you, you fucking aren't good. You're all good. You're on fucking grease rails for the rest of the day. I stand by it. I'm Bill Barr and I fucking, uh, I stand by this and I approve of this message. Oh my God. Just what nobody wanted. Or at least I didn't want. It's down to Hillary and Donald fucking Trump on fucking believable. How to, how did we get here?

Speaker 4:          00:10:24       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       You know what? Cause me unbelievable. No. Who Do fucking before. Those are going to be my two choices. I'm not doing it. You know what I mean? Even though I didn't agree with everything that Bernie Sanders wanted to do, uh, I have to vote for a guy that went outside the usual fucking places to get his money for his campaign. Just to fucking encourage somebody else to do that. And I really can't stand when people say that that's a waste of a vote. I don't think it is because I think each time, each election, a guy like that gets a little bit farther and I actually think it's great that, uh, that the Democrats and Republicans, the best that they can come up with at this point is Hillary Clinton and fucking Donald Trump. I mean, Jesus, Holy Shit, this is fucking, I don't really think there's a lesser of two evil here. I just, it's

Speaker 4:          00:11:26       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:26       You have it sitting on the last row of a plane, you know, and they serve in the breakfast and it's just like, all right, your choices today. All right. Ham and cheese omelet or a bucket is shit with Granola, right? You're like, ah, fucking, and they go and you're like, oh, fuck it. I'm going with the fucking ham and cheese omelet. There's no choice here. Let's see. That's not even a choice, right. We to have a limited selection of the breakfasts is so we, if when we get to you what she want is not available at Amelia, like I'm fucked and you just sitting there is every row women and she just see the go. How do you see anything? Ham and cheese alley and a ham and cheese omelet. Okay. And if you say ham and cheese Omelet, you know, every once in awhile there's some martyr that goes here.

Speaker 3:          00:12:13       Take the bucket of Shit. Right. Um, and then by the time it gets to you, you know, they're all gone. Even her to say, I'm sorry sir. I'm sorry man. We don't have any more and cheese I'm with. I understand. I understand you're upset, but I don't choose how many ham and cheese omelet throw on this flight. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Well please go to American airlines.com/ org.net and I air your grievances there and our robot, we'll get back to you. Right? So then they come up to you and of course just, you just have to go. You're all we have left is the bucket of shit. Would you like that with the Granola? The granola kind of takes the edge off of the shit. Would that be okay? And you still have to sit there and be like,

Speaker 4:          00:12:57       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:12:57       you just drag her through it even though it's not her fault. You know, you don't have what happened to ham and cheese omelet.

Speaker 4:          00:13:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       You don't have any of that. Just started curiosity. Do you ever started the back row and work your way to the front just to kind of even it out? You know, you never do that. How come you always start up front and work your way back to that poor excuse for a of a kitchen? Why do you do that? You know what I mean? So I thought that this was all coach evidentaly. There isn't evidentaly is the ham and cheese. Sarah, why are you being hostile? Nine 11 safe. The terrorists save the chairs, fight the terrorists. Um, so anyways, uh, how the fuck did I get into that? What was I talking about?

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       I know I was talking about, Oh yeah, the fucking, all the election is, I got so lost in doing that. I didn't remember when I was talking about, yeah, that's basically what we're left with were basically sitting on in the last row, middle seat right next to the bathroom on a DC nine, you know, we can't even look out the window and the engine is just blocking it. And if you like me, you heard of this story, the one time the engine failed on the tarmac, thank God, but a piece of it flew through the fuselage and into this woman's head and killed her. That's what I always think about. But you know what, I also, I also do, it's because, uh, you know, I didn't really look it up. Somebody just said it to me. But last night I did look something up because someone was trying to tell me that some comedian actually in American comedian went to Dubai and had a little bit of coke in there, fucking suitcase that they forgot about God caught with it and got automatic 10 years. Um, and I'm just like, really? I go walk an American comic. And they were like, yeah, yeah, dude, American comic guys fucked. Nobody had a name. No nothing. And I looked it up and for the life of me, I can't find it. You know what I did find was that there was this fucking half Iranian and half Swedish male model who got busted with some sick amount of coke. Somehow got a life sentence. They didn't kill him, but they, um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:12       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:15:12       They did kind of reduce it down to 10 years. So he's got 10 years. So he made a rap song in jail, like date. Remember that Gay Shane who was with j Lo and Puffy, I'm going way back to the 1990s when people still watch music videos. Maybe it was the year 2000. Right. And uh, what's his face used to do a, the TV show. Oh God, what was it called? Carson Daly used to do that show, the top 40 fucking videos, whatever the fuck it was called. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       during that time, right in members shine did the fucking, he did, he made a song over the Rikers island phone. This guy did the same fucking thing. And I got to admit like, yeah, I dunno. I, I didn't, I didn't have sympathy for the guy, which is weird. It's odd for me. I was just, you know what it was cause he was acting like Pete rose. It was still all about him. He was like, I didn't have any drugs in my system. I was blah blah. It's like, yeah, but you were going to distribute the shit. Your Cantonese didn't give a fuck what happened. And those people, you're trying to make some money. You knew what the fine was. You rolled the dice and you fucking lost what kind of an asshole goes anywhere in Asia with drugs, you're Outta your fucking mind. You're out of your fucking mind. You're done. It's fucking over. They have a zero tolerance. The only thing they do is make the drugs and ship it over here for some fucking reason. That's what I don't get. If you get caught with drugs over there yet, completely fucked. But God damn it, they will make some in a minute. Right. Well I guess that's Afghanistan.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       Afghanistan is kind of the wild west, right? Do you think the fact that we've been at war with them for almost a decade and a half, you'd think that I would fucking know a little something about them. I don't. What do I know about those guys? What was the number one band in Afghanistan? You know what I mean? I love to hear what the fuck they would sing above. Man, that must be amazing. You know, just rebelling against your parents.

Spent an lonely independence day on August 15th at a Sikh temple in Kabul or he had to, had taken refuge after his Afghan visa expired. Well, how the fuck do you let that happen, Mr Your Jam Hash who came to Afghanistan on the promise of a job as a security guard in an American military base for $800 every month had been swindled out of 150,000 rupees or 2,300 bucks by his employment agent in India. I thought, oh, I'll tell you it's filthy. You know, after paying the money and waiting here for three months to 28 year old, found out that there was no job and was left with just enough money for his phone in his cigarette. Oh my God. Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       Do People in like Asia just laugh at American movies like our ideas of what trouble is? Can you imagine that? Can you imagine? Somebody just said, hey, you want a job in Afghanistan? And you go, yeah, I'll fucking do that. I feel like there's a lot of American military right now nodding their heads like, yeah, we know what that's like. Yeah. You get there to start with. They promised. Absolutely. Um, you show up, you think you're going to be a hero and then they tell you you got to buy your own uniform. Um, after paying the money way, there was no fucking job. He's got enough money for phone and cigarettes. Wow. Dude, that is just, that is next level evil. The Indian embassy in Kabul said that as of mid August, 70 distressed Indians. That's the way they put it. Right. Like posttraumatic Stress Syndrome instead of the classic George Carlin Bit bit shell shocked.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       Right. Who was similarity? Similarity. A banded and were sent back to India. Oh, they sent back, I'll thank God last year they were 160. Oh, so I see what this evil guy goes. He goes, well look, then we fucked them over and then they get freaked out. But then they just go to the embassy and then they pay for it, you know, fuck you on paying my taxes. These guys will be all right. And then they justify it right. Then they go out and they by themselves, you know, some shiny shoes and a car. The Afghans, Sikhs had given many of the Indians refuge in their temple and Kaboodle, uh, describe them as mostly poor folk who had taken loans and sold off land to pay commission to fraudulent employment agents. They came with the hope of earning double the money paid for low skilled jobs in India. Do do you know when I landed, landed in Dubai when I connected there with no cocaine in my fucking

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       suitcase? Do you know that? Somebody told me that, you know, there's basically the slave labor camps that totaled, that built Dubai and uh, a lot of them were people from India and they get promised, yeah, you come over here, you know, the, the, the poorest of the poor. Come over here. You're going to make like fucking nine zillion dollars. You're going to have a play station. And then when you go back, you know, whatever, you can bring your family over here and all that, and they show up in, the first thing they do is they confiscate their fucking passports. And these people just be, they can't leave and they just become slaves. And a, the number one cause of death is like suicide. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       Controversy at the Oscars. I want, I want to play a plumber. American troubles. Um, fucking unbelievable. Unfucking believable man. Well, I'm glad this person got back. Jesus Christ. Like that's the type of shit, you know, you remember that show arrested abroad. I remember back in the day on the, uh, the LP and Anthony Program, the tragically now gone, Opie and Anthony Program, one of the great radio shows of all fucking time. I remember we were talking about that and we were watching that are arrested abroad, which just makes you never want to travel outside of the United States again. Or WHO's kidding? Who, you know, they made it really fucking racial. It was just like, you're white. Stay in the white zone. You can go to England, you can go to Canada, do not go south of San Diego or you are on your own. Right. But at the end of the day, as much as these people were like fucking, you know, in jail, they always, you know, most of them did something extremely fucking stupid where, you know, the, they went out and bought platform shoes and hollow them out and put a bunch of fucking, you know, heroin in there and a couple of baggies of coke up their ass.

Speaker 3:          00:25:50       And it's just like, do you never saw midnight express? If you can find that clip. I remember a long time ago we kept riffing on that. That Irish guy would just go, you know, when he got busted, he just, he can, I just kept thinking, what have I done and what he had done. You fucking, you fucked yourself over yet. Dope.

Speaker 5:          00:26:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       I Dunno. I Dunno. How fucked up is your life that like, that's your option

Speaker 3:          00:26:17       you'd like, that sounds good. Like, I mean, thank God I, I just out of sheer dumb fucking luck landed in the skin I have in the country. I mean, like I really got, I got dealt the, you know, a fucking and ace in a tent. I really did. I've totally lucked out. You know what I mean? If somebody ever came up to me was just like, Hey, do you want to put some heroin in your ass and try to make it across the border? It's just, it's, it's an emphatic, definite in a final answer. Answer. No, no, I'm good. I'm fucking good. Don't need to do that. You know, dude, I would go back to having a fucking paper like I did in the third grade right through freshman year. To be honest with you. I would actually do that job again, you know, get a nice workout in the morning. If I didn't live in a fucking city, I would be a paper boy in a fucking second is fucking great. You got up before everybody else. It was really peaceful, quiet. Fucking birds were chirping. Yeah, you had to deal with the weather, but that's what made you fucking man. You know, you put on your pod show, right? You put on your thick socks,

Speaker 3:          00:27:26       fucking nostrils freezer together. Oh God, it was brutal. I never did. Was nothing fucking better than when back when they were actually four seasons on the east coast when the springtime came and you got up in the morning and you didn't have to wear a jacket. I cannot even describe to you how fucking unbelievable that was. Um, and the same way the ominous feeling is when it first started getting cold and you're like, oh fuck, here comes another one. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       I told you this story before and I had this bike, this fucking, it was basically one of those beach bikes with white wall tires. I was always a sucker for fucking white walls. And I, I sort of pointed at the bike making fun of it. My Dad loved it and he grew up in the fifties, right? Oh yeah. We got big tires, right? They had those big fucking peewee Herman bikes. So I bought the bike and everybody was laughing at me. All my friends had these, you know, pre like fucking, uh, we're all those fucking BMX bikes. It was pretty BMX. It was all, everything was all about showing the Apollo three speed. They only have these cool bikes. And I had this giant Fucking Pre pee wee Herman peewee Herman fucking bike. And I remember one time my older brother took it and everyone was laughing and he wrote it down the driveway as fast as he could in the tires was so big and thick that when he fucking locked him up, it actually made the sound of a car and went like, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:52       And then everybody thought that bike was cool and then they, they would, you know, that's how I, I ended up fitting in. People come all over, look at that stupid fucking bike and all I had to do is lock 'em up once. And then they laughed and thought it was called and it was all right. You know, they look past my orange hair and my freckles and that's the way I was 1976. Um, anyways, yeah, I would do that job in a fucking second. Somewhere along the line it became an adult's job. And it was a combination of when, you know, we finally addressed the fact that there was a sexual predators out there. And then also the show's made, you feel like there was one behind every fucking tree. MMM. So anyways, yeah. So that went out to fund any of the old economy went to shit and it became an adult's job. But anyways, let me read the, uh, let me read the fucking, well the hell is, let me do the live reads. Hey. Oh, sailing away. Come on, come on. Come over here and sing some Christopher Cross. Oh, I'll do the Christopher Cross part. You do the, you do the, uh, the, your ma, your boy that Michael McDonald do that part right. All right, good. So Bri, Bri like to win.

Speaker 6:          00:30:50       Oh yeah. I can't find a, it was mostly annoyed. Much as you hate that you do it all the time now. Yeah. That was the most annoying. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:31:02       stop doing that. That was a magic Johnson son, Ajay, Ajay. And when he was talking about him, I'm not saying he's a bad person, but like he's just like, are you going up? Because people just walk around and get excited about sunglasses and shoes and shit. It's just like, that's the big fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          00:31:21       The material. Oh, Rad. The materialism when people are like, yeah, I was on his lay. Yeah. Hello.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       No, it's fun. It's like gross. Look, I respect somebody that has style. Yeah. Like when we watch it, come on, come over there. The microphone. When you, you take Chappelle show's block party, right? Yes. Great fucking film. Yeah. So we watched that and when a Lauren Hill came out, right. Oh my God. Yeah. Crazy. Exactly. Great stuff. But she has sit around talking about her shoes, everything. Then she goes out and crushes it and syncs as fucking suck. Okay. But for someone to just sit there, it just sit there and talking or it'd be excited about blazers. It fucking sock garters and shit. It's just, I don't know. And then keep you like, just like your days all we're going to go out and go shop for five fucking hours. I don't understand B. What? I said I love it. Hey by the weight, you know something I'm going to fucking, I'm going to handle the garage. Okay. Cause you know no, cause you keep pooper when the whole thing, I understand what yeah. You know something. If it was a common error, if was a common area, you would be excited. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:32:27       You think I'm not interested in having a little gym here at the House. I think that's a great idea. Who wouldn't want to have their own little gym so they don't have to go out to work out.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       Okay. Now did you guys hear what she just said? How did she describe it? Twice. Little. Oh, you little gym. Yeah. You guys. Yeah, you will sell events used to have that bit whose joke is that was will sylvan insane. I see in you your little Mercedes with your little Rolex taking me down. I'm not taking you down. I'm just telling you, you know, you're calm. Tone is like when a pilot just goes through turbulence and even he's scared, but he doesn't want to scare you. So he just speaks in that

Speaker 6:          00:33:04       I really hate when you reference yourself. I really hate when you reference your own. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. It's who I am. I don't know. But to reference your own self is like so annoying. And so

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       because I'm gonna Redo the garage. I don't give a fuck. Buh Buh, Buh, Buh better. Cause you're bald. Fucking help me out. No, you bought, pumped me up.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       All right, let's get into the, uh, the advertising for this week. First of all, if you think you're going to be this, I'm building a man's Jim. This is going to be out there with like, like fucking uh, Ooh. You had a baby girl. Fucking risk weights. Your pink fucking getting shaped girl waits. It's not going to be that. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:33:48       it's like itching to be the band. That's crazy. You gave her her allergy pills.

Speaker 3:          00:33:53       No, I actually forgot to. Did you really? Can you come over to the mic so people don't have to lean forward into their dashboard? Is it driving here?

Speaker 6:          00:34:00       People can hear it. You're the only one who screams into the microphone. Like completely defeating the purpose of why a microphone exists.

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       I'm the only one who was screaming into a microphone. No, but all right then anyway. Oh yeah. So what I found, what I want here is a rogue fitness. Gee, it would be nice if rogue fitness would trade some equipments if for some free advertising.

Speaker 6:          00:34:28       The WHO said that? Our ml three w fold back while Mont Rack. Say it again. The rogue r m l three w fold back wall mount rack made in the USA.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       This is what's great. It can fold back into the wall. So if you have a small garage like me that's built for a fucking, you know, 1928 model t Ford. If there was one, some gear heads we urge suitable to continue in 1927. I don't care. I don't make them. Um, what's great is it has a pull up bar on it. It's got, you can, you can move the thing up and you can do squats. Nobody does their legs from my generation's all about the upper body weight doing today. Chairs to buy the, I can try. Yeah, we got to do your legs, dude. I walk around all the time.

Speaker 6:          00:35:13       Why? Why? Why do certain guys have like these little chicken legs and these huge upper bodies? What is that about? Is that like that's a deliberate style, like they're doing that on purpose?

Speaker 3:          00:35:23       No. What it is is when you walk up to the sink and you flex in the mirror you have from your waist down is below the vanity. So you can't see out of proportion you are. But yeah, and plus legs. It's not sexy. It's not fun. It's hard. It's work every, any. Do you go to any fucking gym in the world? If you want to go bench press, if there's two people in there, there's only gonna be two benches and they're both going to be occupied. That's all guys do. Every guy, there's a zillion exercises, but every guy goes over the bench press. What are you putting up? A little bullet. 25. I'll be full. Good Times, right? But all that other shit. There's very few people that actually, when you go to the gym have like a proportion by the ladies are all about the squats and everything because that's your, that's your problem areas. It's the biggest part of your body as the legs. Yeah. And actually if you build up your thighs, you build that. That's the biggest muscle in allegedly burns enough fat. And I could get rid of my see belly here. See belly, good belly. I was trying to be a gentleman.

Speaker 5:          00:36:23       Nothing.

You let me handle it and I'll let you know how it is. And when I walk around and I'm shredded and I'm proportioned, you're going to be like, you know what? God Damn it. I was wrong. Are you going to put it? And I'll say I forgive you. Oh, are you going to put up a mirror somewhere so you can watch yourself while you shred? See what? See what she's doing? You a little Jimmy. You can put a mirror up. I'll be right back. You're scared. You're scared of what I'm going to become. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       I talked about the Oscars the last time. What did you talk about? I, I was talking to how

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       white people fucking crushed it again this year. Oh, I mean, I don't really have, are you allowed to be proud as a white male, heterosexual and your faces other people? Sure. Uh, I don't, I actually don't have anything else to contribute to stuff. You don't have anything else to contribute? I wrapped up the podcast dead. Sorry. I know I got all excited and I realized I got nothing. No, I thought I talked Chris Rock's monologue was fucking tremendous. I thought he had dressed in, I thought it was, we was well balanced in the end. He's like, yeah, we're just looking for an opportunity. He can't, he can't get mad at that. You know, it is funny watching adults wanting to win a trophy belt. That is funny to me.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Cry. Um, anyway, to be nominated for an Oscar that wouldn't you? What's that? What have you liked? Just crush it in a movie. And there was talk of like at the studio and stuff of you being nominated and they wanted you to do a campaign and all that kind of stuff that I would like to be the guy that everybody says should've got nominated and then didn't. So then everybody feels bad for you, but you don't have to campaign or go to the shelf. That's the sweet spot in here. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. You don't wanna be the guy that gets fucking nominated and then you've got to sit there with the camera on your face as the guy with the fucking good. What's that? What's that fucking kettle? Kettle drum. Right. Like the Timpani. It's just like, they're not going to give it to me.

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       Look at me. I'm a balding fractal. Fuck. Right. And then they give it to the guy with the square jar. Then he goes up there and I sit there going, oh gosh, such a low word of goals. We're killing this. Um, was funny fucking 12 minutes ago, the first 58 times we did it. Yeah. That's what I would like to be. All right. You want to be the guy that people said get fucked over because then people feel like you're still there. You like the underground band? Yeah. Yeah. Keep pulling your eyebrows up. Like, I haven't figured out this fucking business. I have all these dudes who get nominated. The next thing you know they're fucking doing crest commercials and they sit in court side on the fucking game and then people get annoyed because they start seeing and when they shouldn't be seeing them and then you're just fucking everywhere and it's just like, there's a hole in the ozone layer.

Speaker 3:          00:43:46       Hey Guy from this fucking movie. What do you think about who I fit? The constituents and you. It's like, why am I listening to this guy from the reboot of Brady bunch talking about what we should do in Afghanistan? And then you jumped the shark and you're done. You want to be the guy that people are going like, he got fucked man, that movie so much fucking better, but blah, blah blah, blah, blah. Yeah, you wanna you wanna beat chest underneath it so people know who you are. So they still show up to see your Dick and shit jokes, but you're not overly exposed. I like your philosophy,

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       not the, I, there's nothing else that I agree with. You what I, I seriously do. I'm not joking. You've probably said that like three times in the 12 years that I've known. You said what? I agree with you. I agree with two. I have nothing to add. Yeah, but I don't like it. Okay. This is like when Vince Vaughn was on Jimmy Fallon and knew Jimmy was trying to get in his head when they were going to play a, what's in the box? The best fucking bets they call what's in the box? What's in the bar? I got to go a lie. I don't know the liars box. Yeah, dude, that was a clinic. That was a clinic that Vince Vaughn put on there. Alright, I'm a, I'm out of time here, right? Enjoy the rest of the podcasts. I'll talk to you on Monday. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:45:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:45:42       all right, here's the sexuality situation. Everybody. Um, hey bill, I need your advice on something. Uh, this is a nut. This is not about a breakup dating are gold diggers, but I think your advice could help me, could help me out on an extremely awkward position. I'm 19 and I'm home from college for this. I'm a, I've been home for about a month and I live in North Carolina, but go to college in Arizona. Dude, good move Arizona with all those fucking whores out there. Come into class and like bikini tops and you're out there with the acute and cute southern drawl. How much asks are you getting? Well, let's find out. Shall We? Okay. While I was away at college, I have opened up to new ideas such as politics, politics, religion, and about my sexuality and my bias at, and I am bisexual. At the beginning of summer, I started hanging out with my old friends from high school, one of which was gays. We had messed around in high school, but nothing serious. What does that mean? You flicked his balls a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       Sorry. The fucking joke is there. I'm going to do it. All right. Come on. Take it like a man like everybody else. Okay. Everybody gets trashed on this. Here we go. So this summer he and I were hanging out at my house and nobody was home. We started and we started to drinking. Oh Gee. She's playing some music. Why Mca? And he started to smoke some weed man. Then after about two hours, we decided to do the dirty Jesus Christ. Okay. Here we go. Slugging away through here. Halfway through US getting it on. My mom walks into the room and catches us in the act.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       Wow. Now talk about the needle going off the fucking record. She started yelling at me, swatting me with the mail she had just gotten, I'm surprised she didn't turn the hose on. You kick my friend out of the house. Then banned him from ever coming over again and started screaming about the Bible and a bunch of religious shit. By the way, this all happened when I was in a, in a panic trying to get some clothes. Oh my God, Dude. What a way to come out. Only thing was missing was a giant neon. I'm gay. Sign hanging over your, wow. That's a fucking situation there, Huh. Ever since then, my mom and dad had been forcing me to go to a few religious nutjobs that is supposed to convert me from bisexual to heterosexual. That's hilarious. You know like you going to convert a truck from two wheel drive, the four wheel drive, like it's that fucking easy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       This is a huge pain in the ass because one, there are churches on every corner in North Carolina and two, I don't want to change. So you shouldn't, dude, you can't. You are who you fucking are and they're going to have to accept it. Also, my parents had been treating me differently now and it's really weird and awkward every time we talk. So I guess my question is how do I deal with this through this is might be outside the mother realm of my lack of extra expertise here. Do I tell them that I don't want to go to some religious fat fuck who was a Jesus Freak and whose stomach is as long as his vowels? Oh, you got that southern draw. You can't be suck in data. Um, or should I just pretend to be straight until the end of summer, then go back to living the life I want to live at college.

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       Also. How do I keep saying with people telling me that I am living my life wrong and that God is judging me? I hope that wasn't too sad, dude. It's a fucking epic story. Thank you for sharing. Sharon it here. Um, all right. This is a deal to you. You need new friends. You need to keep the friends that accept you for who you are and the ones who aren't. You just got to phase them out. Your parents were, your parents will come around, you know, they get to come around cause you're, you're their son. All right? Stereotypically, probably your mom before your dad or whatever, but I don't know, maybe they will. Maybe they won't. But what the fuck are you going to do? You know, you are who you are. You've got to go be who you're going to be. And uh, as far as the tough it out for the summer, that that's up, that's up to you. That's up to you. If you're going to keep going back. I mean, if I was going to keep going back to some shit that I wanted, didn't want to go to, I would just, I would have fun with it. I would just act like a fucking moron and I would keep acting like I was almost cured. And then at the last second be like, but don't you think

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       John Travolta's cute? Oh, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. I'm just fuck with the guy who just have a good time. If he can't get out of it, if you don't want to, you know, fight, you know, if you don't want to be like Hitler and try and fight on three fronts and ended up in a fucking bunker, uh, maybe just start with the, get some new fucking friends. Uh, that's it, dude. That's brutal, man. That's brutal. But, uh, you'll get through it. You'll get through it and you'll find some fucking people, you know? I don't know. It's weird. In a weird way. Everybody does that beyond that shit. You know, as a comedian, I never fit in anywhere. Everywhere I went, like when I fucking had jobs and they would be sitting there and I had my little Michael J. Fox fucking suit and tie on like thinking that, that this is what I was going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       And everybody was going in for some fucking meeting. I'd never gave a fuck. And I never, I just felt, always felt like an outsider until the day I walked into a comedy club. And I basically found people who were the same kind of weird that I was. So they didn't seem weird to me. A bit of middle of the Comedians were all out of our fucking minds. So that's what you have to do in a gay way. You just got to go find some heterosexuals who were accepting of you and go get some gay friends and uh, you know, you're going to have a great life and you're going to have abs until you're 60, evidently. Cause that's how it works with gay people.

Speaker 5:          00:51:47       Fuck up

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       video. You are, and that's it. All right,

Speaker 5:          00:51:51       there you go. [inaudible] [inaudible] MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       all right, sisters a through c. Here we go. Tired of giving advice to guys with psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with STDs? Well, I got something a bit lighter, a few here. Uh, kind of like the cores lite version of your typical advice. Thank you. And is perfect for the middle of the summer. Like kick my feedback on this one. So I know this lady who I've been friends with uh, for awhile now and banged one time, she's the oldest of three sisters, so we all call her sister a about two years I made out with sister be in a club, not my initiative. Um, and ended up having sex with her the same night. Jesus Christ. Dude, I went out with her. Do, do they have like that thing on the back of their SUV where they have the stick figures of the entire family and you just slowly keep axing them out in the family.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       Doesn't understand if somebody's trying to kill my daughters now I'm just trying to fuck all of them, sir. Well, that's a relief. All right. Um, anyways, I went out with her for awhile. Oh, this is sister B. And it was surprisingly not awkward when we were hanging out all together, even though everyone knew the situation. Jesus Christ, what southern state are you in, sir? Um, I'll go fuck yourself people down south. That was funny. No, I'm some months later sister be left me for one of her, one of my friends and got over it quickly enough bone. You got over it quickly enough. And nowadays I'm still in contact with sister a and B since I'm not the kind of guy that holds a grudge for that kind of stuff. Well there you go. It's very immature, which means you really didn't give a fuck about either one of them. So why are you going to be all upset? You know, like you own their pussy once you fucking, I hate when, I hate when guys do that. Anyways, recently senses to see, started talking to me more frequently after talking for a bit. She said she could pose for me since I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10 all the fucking way I might add, oh, you fucking creep. You fucking creep. You fucking creep.

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       So she was attend the whole time. So basically you're in a holding pattern banging her oldest sisters waiting until this girl was of age so he could fucking painter Jesus Christ. I got I, you know, I might have to stand up and applaud this one. This guy has taken it to another level. This is a fucking epic situation here. So you can see. Here's my question. Does that proposition mean anything? Do you need my advice? I need advice from you. How do you fuck every girl in the same family? Jesus Christ. This is like, you know, Long. There's been an expense since has been a triple crown winner in horse racing. The last time someone won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the breeders' Cup. Is that what it is or is that a soccer match? I don't fucking know. I don't own a fucking horse since the late seventies I would guarantee that it's been since the late seventies since somebody has booze bank three.

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       I think a lot can do two in one family, but to get all fucking three, two, three, two is a respectable three is it? No, it's beyond respectable. Two. Three. Okay. Everybody knows three is in the sporting world too. That, that's a fucking dynasty. Okay. You just put yourself in there with fucking Bill Russell. You put yourself in there with, with, with the fucking, uh, Magic Johnson Lakers. You know, I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers. You know when you go out and you get Phil Jackson and fucking shack that, that's that new ship that the kids like. I don't like that shit. Um, either way, dude, you're talking fucking dynasty. Wait, magic never won three in a row, but he had the Celtics to fuck with and they went three out of four years. Give me a fucking break. Um, so here's Michael Jordan. There we go. So here's my question. Does that proposition mean anything?

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       Is it a trap? Should I try to bang her? Should I try and bang her too and get a third strike or keep my dick in my pants and avoid a potential shit storm? And if yes, do you have any tips, special tips on this special situation? All my friends are telling me to do so, but I thought I'd ask them. We'll refine mine like yourselves before I did a move. Dude, you're looking at me like, dude, you're beyond me right now. Okay. This is like Bull Durham. I'm, I'm fucking Kevin Costner. Um, I'm, I'm a lifer. Okay. You're, you're going up to the show hidden brand new balls every fucking day. I will. You tell me. Okay. I never banked to girls in one fucking family. You know, I was psyched if I was able to tag a couple of friends and we were all hanging out at a bar one night and you get that feeling like I fucked both of you and you both knew it and you both loved it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       I hope. Please, please tell me you liked it. Did you like it was I okay? Um, dude, I think you gotta do it. You gotta do it. You know, you, you've been above board the whole time. Sister [inaudible] sister be, they all fucking knew everything right now I understand this is a little delicate. Okay. He's trying to snip the last wire here. This is the kid sister is, is it going to blow up in your fucking face? Uh, it's worth it, dude. It's worth it. It's worth losing a couple of limbs and you nose on this one. You got to do it to fuck. You know, dude, what the fuck she says to you? I, yeah, you're a painter all let me take my clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat. That's not art too. That's foreplay. Give me a fucking break. It'd be one thing if you're in a classroom of people, it's just you and she's standing there naked. Dude. That's like one of the two. Have they ever done that porn senate? That scenario in a porno Jesus Christ, you might've found a new angle to. That's phenomenal. That is fucking phenomenal, dude. You gotta do it. You got to do with the John Elway. We're tired when he only got one. He came back for another, right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       You got to do it to w two. That's like when Bush fucking the first Bush. He stopped and he didn't get to sit down. You got to go all the way on this one, man. All right? You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking apocalypse now. You just, you just, you just the fact you left the program, all right? And I don't care how mad these girls get to do. You are at the precipice of becoming an absolute fucking legend Ledge who, who can, who, who's gonna be able to top that dude? There are celebrities who've had orgies that had five on ones and all that type of Shit, okay? But I guarantee you, they never fucked three fucking girls in the same family when they weren't famous, not famous. You're doing this shit with the gift of Gab. Whatever the fuck you doing do you do this?

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       You got to write a book. You got to write a book that's for, you know, that's used to collection of the most amazing pussy getting stories ever that you can somehow confirm, all right? And it has to be none of that bullshit. The second you get famous, he get money. That doesn't count, all right? That's garbage time, okay? They put the fucking second team in there and you just fucking Titone layups. That's bullshit. I'm talking about just regular dudes. You talk yourself into it through the year, you're a fucking legend. You gotta do it. All right. There's my halftime speech. I'm going to quote Joe Barton. Nick quoting John Madden today is going to be the greatest day of your life, but only if you win.

Speaker 5:          01:01:30       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       the way I think it's time. I think we're about 17 minutes in. I think it's about time. I patted myself on the back. How bout that? Download speed last week. Huh? How about that? I didn't hear any complaining. You know, hundreds and hundreds of people bitch, Moan and fuck. Woo. Right? So I finally fixed the Goddamn problem and what do I get? I get like five tweets going, hey, I really appreciate it. You know what happened in the rest of you? Because you went on to bitch about something else. You don't like the photo on my fucking page. You know, you have to stop and thinking about, you know, maybe finding out what you're really upset about Jesus Christ. Could I use that advice? Huh? Um, all right, let's talk about something in the news. Shall we, you know, I think they, they should have to fucking sing the news the way they do in the Catholic church. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       there was a guy who got attacked by two monkeys in South Africa. He decided he was going to go down there and try to rehabilitate some chimpanzees that had been abused and they turn around and drag them for two kilometers and kicked the shit out of him. What a dumb fuck. Why would you fly across the world to get your fucking ass kicked? Did you guys hear about the student South Africa,

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       Texas student attacked by chimp improves. Thank God he improves this poor fucking bastard. He's a ranger, right? He loves animals. This is the thing about animal lovers. You got to realize that once you go past a certain level of domestic animal and you start getting into the wild, no matter how much you love them, they're not going to love you back. Wild animals are like that. Dick, you shouldn't have gone out with, you know that person who cheated on you, that person who just doesn't have your back. Wild animals do not have your back. You dog has your back, you cat borderline. Cats kind of have that creepy vibe that if shit went bad, they decide what the, the intruder, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:03:54       Fish. They just don't have any fucking say. They're like a Stepford wife, you know? That's why dogs are the best. They, it's they truly fucking love you. My dog fucking loves me, will be on a walk and all of a sudden she just look up me. It's almost like she's smiling. You know how fucking warped, why sound? She's probably just panting and it looks like she's smiling and he's probably going like, why does he have this fucking rope around my neck? This doesn't make any sense to me. If I really wanted to, I could rip his fucking face off, but in my world, I'm so in love with my dog and look, she's smiling, but that's not bad when you just have a dog. I think people who fucking, you know, fuck with animals for awhile, wild animals, they start thinking like, oh, look at the Cheetah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Oh, she's play a Gig and all of a sudden grow off. This fucking launches itself that you all right. I believe that we came from monkeys. I believe that we came from the apes. I believe something else. So there's three in a row in this sound smooth. Um, but I by no means think that, uh, that those fucking things like us, I don't give a shit if I teach at sign language and the chimps sitting at going in sign language. Hey, I think you're a cool guy there. Freckled face count. You know that there's no fucking way I'm ever going on the other side of the God damn cage. This poor bastard was on the other, he was on the other side of the cage. He just got too close.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       That's how fucking insane a wild animal is. Chimpanzees, they say have the strength of six, six men. This dude got attacked by two chimps that would be like getting attacked by a flash mob. Okay. 12 fucking people. They just grabbed this motherfucker by his ankles. They reached underneath. I mean, I don't what kind of bullshit cage they had was like a compound, you know? So they put up that, that, that cheap wire shit, when you don't want to rabbit to come in and eat your lettuce right in your garden. Like they put that shit up. So this fucking guy is sitting there, you know, as they go doing that shit and he's like, what are you guys join the show me where you're telling me right? And he's trying to sign to him. You guys want to play Frisbee, right? And they sitting there talking to each other going just two more inches, two more inches.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       Look at this dumb mother fucker and wants to play Frisbee. Right? They reach underneath, grab them by his fucking ankles. Strength. The 12 men, they fucking pull them right underneath that goddamn thing. Like when you go to Quiznos and they stick your sub right through that poor excuse for a fucking a brick oven yanked fucker right underneath. Oh my God. And then they dragged them for like another fucking two kilometers, however fucking far that is. I don't know. In my world. That's a, what's that about? A mile and a quarter. Cause I know like 40 kilometers, like 60 kilometers is like 40 miles an hour. Who gives a fuck? They dragged this son of a bitch basically through the length of every football stadium in the NFL and I can guarantee you it wasn't the nice turf that those guys play on. This was the natural habitat.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       Like I can't imagine the vice grip strength, those, those fucking things, man, they'll rip your foot off the rip your balls off, the rip your face off the rip it off. Like you open a fucking Goddamn thing, a yogurt goddamn ice cream when you just take the lid off, they do that to your face. What the fuck are you doing near these goddamn things? You know Jesus fucking Christ. I would have to tranquilize had guns and I would be wearing one of those fucking, you know those suits you wear when you think you're going to get bitten by a shark, that chain link shit, there's no fucking way. There's no way fucking catcher's mask welded to my face. I'm not going anywhere in here. And not only that, these aren't just regular fucking chimps that have been swinging around eating bananas occasionally eating another monkey alive, right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       This isn't that shit. These are ones that were abused. They were already fucked with. Okay. And having adopted a fucking abused dog and the Goddamn Skitzo Shit that that thing does, I can't fucking imagine a goddamn schizophrenia fucking ate two of them straight to 12 God, they are men and you're going to walk near the cage trying to sign, hey, how about the weather frank or whatever she fucking human name. You gave him your at you already a fuck and God bless you, your heart's in the right place. Fortunately this kid doesn't seem like he had any damage like that, but like this dude was so in shock, like they were finally able to just like stitch him up and stabilize him and evidently he's not in critical condition and it doesn't seem like, it seems like he still has his balls, his feet and his face, which is incredible.

Speaker 1:          01:08:50       But they say, you know, he has bite marks and a and fractures plural. Oh my God, just treating you like a fucking rag doll. That is the most horrifying shit in the world to meet. Nature is the most horrifying shit I would rather have. Oh, let's see. You know what? The human equivalent, someone has to come into my house with a fucking chainsaw. I can deal with the Goddamn, I could deal with the machete. All right. I could deal with that. Chainsaws that, that's hardcore. I could fuck a machete. I could deal with, I think I could fucking do the, the, the sugar ray Leonard, you know, stick my face out and then pull it back when he took a swing and then fucking try to take both of your legs out.

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       Ah, only hardcore boxing fans got that one. Um, but the, I mean if you were in a room with the chimp and that thing goes fucking ape shit, no pun intended. That thing is on the floor. It's up on the ceiling. It's across the room. It's like, it's like a comet and you're sitting there dealing with human speed do. That's why we got the brains that we have. This why was so much smarter. We have to be because we're so fucking slow. You know what I mean? You ever see the white guy who gets dunked on in those highlight films? You know that fucking guy that they bring off the bench when the teams either up by 30 or down by 30 that guy, that's what we are in nature. Even the fucking athletic humans yet you know when nowhere near just take like a how fast a fucking snake is a fucking pit viper, viper, righteous, nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       Fucking, you don't eat your bit and that thing has left, left the fucking building before you even did, before that signal from your fucking leg going, hey, we just got bit by a Goddamn pit viper even reaches your brain. That snake is already leaving and then you go and then the real is, and as the realization that you got bit hits you, you are, you're already collapsing. Why the fuck would you go out there? You know, I don't know. We had to be that fucking smart. I can't imagine that the Goddamn fear back in the fucking day, you're walking around with a bunch of Goddamn neanderthals and whatever. Niana talls I guess I suppose to say I sit in the Andrew Thall my entire life, but it's Neanderthal, I guess. And what else was it? There was two tribes. One of them died off. There was the enter talls and then there was the fucking crow magnums. And I forget what the fuck we are. One of them, one and the other ones, the other one of them's was a little bit smarter and the other ones were a little dumber and dumber ones died off. All right. And some people have a little bit of that Crow Magnum or Neanderthal in them, you know, because you know that people they fuck right. It's gotta be the dumbest education of podcasts you've, you'll ever gonna fucking here.

Speaker 5:          01:11:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       I just totally lost my train of thought. What the fuck was I talking about? Oh, Niana toss. Right. So I can't imagine just fucking walking around. Did you ever see that shit when they did that whole thing on chrome Madigan's in neanderthals, like one of them was like fucking slower, like the fucking white dude in the NBA and one of them was a little bit quicker, a little bit smarter. So they fucking did this shit where like when they would show him like taking down some prehistoric bison, like the fucking little smarter ones, you know, they could fucking, you know that that Shit, they could slip a punch, they could throw a goddamn spear. They could do, they could do it from a fucking distance. Like this fucking jackass. He wasn't, he was too close to the Goddamn cage. The fucking Chromatin is whatever. The dumber ones they would like fucking day would just brute strength.

Speaker 1:          01:12:46       They would fucking run and try to tackle the thing and someone would, you know, separate their shoulder, a break and elbow and there's nobody around a set that shit. Every step in your fucking non-existence shoes, your big stupid prehistoric foot. It's just shoving that pain shoot through your body. I edged. Can't imagine, I can't imagine sitting there looking out of a cave in everything is that much faster than me and I don't have a fucking door. I don't have a gun. He just must be just sitting here like any, can't really communicate to the other person because language hasn't been developed yet, so you just haven't that. What the fuck? Look on your face. That was probably one of the first phrases invented like, are you shitting me or the killer? Can you fucking believe this? I Dunno, but God bless that dude. You're an animal lover. I totally know where you're coming from, but for the love of fucking God, those things are not your friends.

Speaker 5:          01:13:45       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       I Dunno. Start p nine dx in and stay away from that fucking cage. Jesus Christ. Can you imagine that I am getting dragged away by two fucking abused chimps. Then you know God damn well he saw that fucking Oprah won't episode. That woman came on with no face. I know he was fucking thinking of that shit. I hate those motherfuckers. You know what? As I like gorillas. I hate chimpanzees and I hate those little monkeys, the little motherfuckers that throw their shit at you. I can't stand those fuckers. And I hate chimpanzees. I always hated those motherfuckers. I didn't know why. And now I know why. That was my inner fucking whatever the fuck caveman telling me. Get the fuck out. Go back to the cave. Stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       I don't trust them. I don't, I don't trust those fucking things. You have to go to the zoo and you just fucking, you just your eyes meet with like a lion. Just that fucking look on their face when they, they, they should. I've said this before, it's like the same look like when a hooker looks at you like it's, it's the real deal. You know, this isn't some fucking bullshit. Flirting, playing hard to get, get a couple of drinks out of you. It's, yeah, you got 20 bucks, I will suck a dick. What? You know, lions got that same look on their face. Like, yeah, if you know, if you weren't in that fucking armored vehicle or on the other side of this, yeah. If I was hungry, I would eat you. And uh, no matter how much you screened, I wouldn't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          01:15:24       It'll actually excite me more to rip your fucking head off. There's no way. There's no way. There's no fucking way. That's why I watch all those animals. Thanks, man. I'm fascinated, and I, and I, I appreciate all those people that put themselves in harm's way because there's no other way to really gauge how strong an animal is until you see it slap around a human being. Like, I can't watch too fucking grizzly bears wrestle and slap each other. They're, they're in the same weight class. You know what I mean? If I see him bitch slap a human being, then I'm and watched the guys heads spin around a couple of, I was like, wow. All right, I get that. I can now gauge that. Let's like, yeah, like, like a kilometers versus miles. All right. I think we killed that subject.
