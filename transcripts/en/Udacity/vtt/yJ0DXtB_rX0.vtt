00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.340
I'm here with Stuart Frye,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.730
who's the Vice President
of Content here at Udacity.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.140
Stuart, thank you so much for
talking to us today.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.878
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:06.450
&gt;&gt; So Stuart's going to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.980
talk to us a bit about the business
side of educational technology.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.740
I know many people are interested in
seeing if they can develop something

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.475
they could spin off into a startup.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:17.080
Also Stuart, for any of our students who
are interested in going into the startup

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.630
world or into the ed tech world,
on the business side of things,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.990
what should they know about what
it's like to work in this space?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; I think it's,
one of the most interesting and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.860
exciting places to start a new business
or launch an innovation right now, but

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.330
it's also a very complex place
to think about, as a market.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.920
Education's one of the places where you
have multiple users and your end user is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.462
not always the person who is making the
purchase decisions about the product.

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:49.115
So if we think about the spectrum
of education from preschool up to

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:49.967
higher ed.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:56.662
You have parents, you have teachers, you
have students, you have administrators,

00:00:56.662 --> 00:01:02.075
and the different products that
are being launched across K-12 and

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:06.589
higher ed are targeted in some
way at a mix of those people.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:10.066
And identifying who are your end users,
who are your gatekeepers,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.153
and who are making the ultimate purchase
decisions can be one of the most complex

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:18.057
set of decisions you make about your
business model, as well as the features

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:21.730
and functionality you're going to
design the product around.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I agree completely.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.479
I think that, especially as an educator
myself, I'll always think about

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.490
the student as my consumer, but that's
not the person you end up selling to.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.330
That's the person that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.044
ends up using your tool- [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:34.664
&gt;&gt; And oftentimes what they would think
about your tool is not the ultimate

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:36.666
issue, learning can be frustrating.

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.414
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; It's the only domain I know of where

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:41.290
frustrating your end user can sometimes
actually be part of the goal.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.580
&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.780
&gt;&gt; So I know that some of our
students have project ideas already,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.825
some of them are probably looking for
ideas.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:48.330
They know,
they want to go into this space, but

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.890
they don't know exactly what to do.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.340
So are there any open issues,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.600
open problems that you think
would be worth tackling?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think as you
think about problems to solve

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.490
in the education space,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.060
I think your solutions are going to
fall into a couple of categories.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.400
One is a content category, so,
that's where Udacity plays, right?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.200
We are creating content that
we're making available as part of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.109
an online Master's degree program or
as part of our nano degree programs.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.080
In addition to content, there are tools.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.720
So tools either for students,
maybe it makes students more productive,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.680
a better way to take notes,
develop projects, tools for

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.470
teachers, a better way to discover new
content, track data, analyze students.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.650
And I think between content and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.220
tools, you need to think about which
area your solution lies best in.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.940
Also, always encourage
entrepreneurs to think about

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.850
a problem you've faced immediately.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.850
So, if you haven't spent any time
in a classroom as an educator,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.540
you might think about tackling
a problem that students face,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.430
because you have spent
time as a student.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.030
On the other hand David, you've spent
a ton of time as an educator and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.020
you probably have a long list of
problems that you'd like solved.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.630
So I would start there when you think
about coming up with a solution or

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.580
a business idea.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense, I think in
some ways when you're designing for

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.120
yourself as a customer.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.870
It's a good place to start,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.870
although you never want to design
your entire project that way,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.250
because you don't want to design
something that's great for you, but

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.550
doesn't work for anybody else.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.370
&gt;&gt; Right and I think that emphasizes
the importance of user testing.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.490
At the very earliest stages,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.310
I mean any ed tech idea that you
have should start as wire frames,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.760
pencil sketches, balsamic, mock ups
that you get out in front of people.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.660
See how they react.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.860
Test an idea very early and
often rather than, to your point,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.760
designing an end solution that works
perfectly for you as an individual, but

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.770
doesn't have product
market fit more broadly.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.738
So let's say it's the end of
the semester, a day after the final

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:52.743
project is due and now students
are wondering, what do I do next?

00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:55.987
What do you think the first step that
they should take when the semester's

00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:59.409
over, to maybe scale their project up
and do a business or startup should be?

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.100
&gt;&gt; Oh wow, yeah so,
this gets back to user testing.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.430
I would identify 20 people that could
be the end user of your product,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.860
and go out and
get some version of it in their hands.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.830
And when I say a version of it,
I do mean it could be a wire frame,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.079
it could be a mock up,
it could be a prototype in Photoshop, or

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.220
you could have written some code and
built out a very simple working version.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.701
But step one is to get it out in front
of people, because I guarantee you,

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.726
your solution will change and
evolve over time.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:33.260
And the more quickly you can get
input beyond your own, the better.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.420
And finding those people to test
with isn't always easy, but

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.070
I think within the context you have,
I mean you're on a university or

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.310
you're surrounded by a community
of students, at least.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.240
Virtually you can find
a lot of people quickly.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that because
we're in this community and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.580
because I think a lot of the projects
that our students develop will

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.888
actually be targeted at the OS program,
because it's what they experience.

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:57.410
You've got 3,000 people sitting around,
experiencing the same thing that you're

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.750
experiencing, who might be
willing to test it out.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.520
&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.370
&gt;&gt; I can also share that for
the NSF iCore project,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.630
which seeks to turn academic
research into real world businesses,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.150
one of the first things they ask
all their participants to do is

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.990
find 100 customers in one month, and
talk to all of them for half an hour.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.777
&gt;&gt; Wow,
do they have to be paying customers?

00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:17.436
&gt;&gt; I don't think, no,
not paying customers yet, but

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:18.426
100 potential customers.

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:19.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.052
&gt;&gt; So for this it would be,
talk to 100 parents, students, teachers,

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:24.639
principals, get the the full
range of perspectives on that.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.282
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And

00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:27.830
they really value that
side of things as well.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.357
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:32.800
&gt;&gt; Anything last to share with our
student about working in this field?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.490
&gt;&gt; I think we often say that,
there are two big fields that have yet

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.950
to be disrupted by technology,
education, and healthcare.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.100
Two pretty important ones, right?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.540
I would say that disruption is a word
that's often overused and misused.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.480
But when you boil down some of
the key tenets that Clay Christensen

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.210
talks about when it comes
to disruptive technologies.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.970
One of those tenets that I
personally find most exciting,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.780
I think offers the most promise
to powerful solutions in

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.340
education technology is non consumption.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.790
If you think about the fact that,
in the United States,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.750
only one in three adults
has a four year degree.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.800
And internationally, only about 7% of
people end up with an advanced degree.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.470
The number of people,
that the things you build, could impact.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.520
If you go over and after those
people who are least well served by

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.510
the existing system today, the non
consumer of quality education today,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.160
people who can't benefit from
the system as it's built.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.340
That's a huge number of people and
it's a massive impact.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.200
So look for those non consumers,
look for those opportunities to

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.258
help people who aren't being helped
today and you'll build great products.

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:48.347
&gt;&gt; That sounds like
part of the foundation,

00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:52.107
part of the philosophy behind this
program in general is finding people who

00:06:52.107 --> 00:06:55.329
may not be the underserved people
in some remote countries, but

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:58.730
people who currently can't access
quality higher education based

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.270
on geographic, or family, or-
&gt;&gt; Economic.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, constraints.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.060
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.250
&gt;&gt; Great.
Thank you so much for

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.190
talking to us today.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.910
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, thanks for having me,
hope anything I said is helpful and

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.360
I hope you build amazing things,
good luck.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.860
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
