Yeah. If I can guys one 90 yeah. But with a lot of energy. Yeah. It's interesting. Is it his age? I think it's probably good meals. Yeah. I think it's probably a good move though at his age. You know, I think he's back from UFC ultimate fighter one inside. We knew though, like on the show that he was the one they would go forever. We'd be with a house that I know he's just crazy. Tuesday ASM still very gotta stop. I mean when w when he beat Micky Gall that way I was, I was incredibly impressed when I'm like, this kid might test him. He didn't test him at all.
