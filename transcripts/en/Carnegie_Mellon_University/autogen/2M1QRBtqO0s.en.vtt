out what drugs we could use that we
 

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.420
out what drugs we could use that we
could expand and given much higher doses

the dose that was given before and this
 

00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:58.139
the dose that was given before and this
is a was a clue that this approach of

00:18:58.139 --> 00:18:58.149
is a was a clue that this approach of
 

00:18:58.149 --> 00:19:00.120
is a was a clue that this approach of
intensive treatment was going to be

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:00.130
intensive treatment was going to be
 

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.130
intensive treatment was going to be
something that people should start and

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.140
something that people should start and
 

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.730
something that people should start and
in fact right now this approach with

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:05.740
in fact right now this approach with
 

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.919
in fact right now this approach with
high-dose cytarabine is standard

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:07.929
high-dose cytarabine is standard
 

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.899
high-dose cytarabine is standard
treatment so I've had an opportunity to

treatment so I've had an opportunity to
 

00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:12.299
treatment so I've had an opportunity to
participate in developing something that

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:12.309
participate in developing something that
 

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:15.049

are I mentioned earlier that the way we
collect we used to collect bone marrow

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:41.650
collect we used to collect bone marrow
 

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.820
collect we used to collect bone marrow
was a very arduous process where an

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:44.830
was a very arduous process where an
 

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.160
was a very arduous process where an
individual you can see this person is

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.170
individual you can see this person is
 

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.640

and is put into the hip bone in the back

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.250
and is put into the hip bone in the back
 

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.030
and is put into the hip bone in the back
and then you can see that the needle is

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.040
and then you can see that the needle is
 

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.750
and then you can see that the needle is
directed through that bone into the area

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760
directed through that bone into the area
 

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.110
directed through that bone into the area
where it's sucked out with the syringe

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120
where it's sucked out with the syringe
 

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.660
where it's sucked out with the syringe
and it's relatively uncomfortable to

can see the arrow they leave the bone

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880
can see the arrow they leave the bone
 

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.490
can see the arrow they leave the bone
marrow they go into the blood vessel and

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:47.500
marrow they go into the blood vessel and
 

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.799
marrow they go into the blood vessel and
we collect them using automated

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:49.809
we collect them using automated
 

00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:51.750
we collect them using automated
instruments and don't have to put people

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760
instruments and don't have to put people
 

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.510
instruments and don't have to put people
to sleep and as a result of that we can

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520
to sleep and as a result of that we can
 

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.490
to sleep and as a result of that we can
actually collect much more bone marrow

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:56.500
actually collect much more bone marrow
 

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.390
actually collect much more bone marrow
cells so this is sort of the the

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400

where have we gone why we gotten so much

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679
where have we gone why we gotten so much
 

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.190
where have we gone why we gotten so much

show you we are able to make it safer

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559
show you we are able to make it safer
 

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.560
show you we are able to make it safer

illness pardon me the other area that we
 

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.870
illness pardon me the other area that we
have spent a lot of time improving is in

have spent a lot of time improving is in
 

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.450
have spent a lot of time improving is in
the area of a low genetic transplant so

if we took somebody who did not have the
 

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.230
if we took somebody who did not have the
same bone marrow type and gave them gave

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240
same bone marrow type and gave them gave
 

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.030

wouldn't grow would be rejected so you

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440
wouldn't grow would be rejected so you
 

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.070

need some kind of matching and has to be

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080
need some kind of matching and has to be

the same these are cells from a normal

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:10.540
the same these are cells from a normal
 

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.840
the same these are cells from a normal
donor that's an advantage and these

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:12.850
donor that's an advantage and these
 

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.170
donor that's an advantage and these
cells from the normal person have the

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:16.180
cells from the normal person have the
 

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.170
cells from the normal person have the
ability to recognize and kill cancer

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:19.180
ability to recognize and kill cancer
 

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.510
ability to recognize and kill cancer
cells which is something that is lacking

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520
cells which is something that is lacking
 

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.940
cells which is something that is lacking
in a person who gets cells from

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:23.950
in a person who gets cells from
 

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.770
in a person who gets cells from
themselves the autologous or they

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:25.780
themselves the autologous or they
 

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.300
themselves the autologous or they
wouldn't it had cancer develop in the

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.310
wouldn't it had cancer develop in the
 

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.490
wouldn't it had cancer develop in the
first place so there's advantages of

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:29.500
first place so there's advantages of
 

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.740
first place so there's advantages of
using another person but the

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:31.750
using another person but the
 

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.020
using another person but the
disadvantages not only made these cells

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.030
disadvantages not only made these cells
 

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.300
disadvantages not only made these cells
from the normal person attack the cancer

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:36.310
from the normal person attack the cancer
 

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.000
from the normal person attack the cancer
but they might recognize that person's

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.010
but they might recognize that person's
 

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.880
but they might recognize that person's
liver or intestines or skin is being

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:41.890
liver or intestines or skin is being
 

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.860
liver or intestines or skin is being
different and caused an attack that is

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:43.870
different and caused an attack that is
 

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.290
different and caused an attack that is
known as graft versus host disease

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:46.300
known as graft versus host disease
 

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.990
known as graft versus host disease
that's shown here on this slide graft

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000
that's shown here on this slide graft
 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.240
that's shown here on this slide graft
meaning the cells from the other person

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.250
meaning the cells from the other person
 

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.520
meaning the cells from the other person
host is the recipient and this is a

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:53.530
host is the recipient and this is a
 

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.430
host is the recipient and this is a
problem so how do we know somebody's a

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440
problem so how do we know somebody's a
 

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.830
problem so how do we know somebody's a
match well this court this cartoon and

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840
match well this court this cartoon and
 

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.410
match well this court this cartoon and
the cartoon and the next slide show that

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:01.420
the cartoon and the next slide show that
 

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.220
the cartoon and the next slide show that
the bone marrow type much like red blood

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.230
the bone marrow type much like red blood
 

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.740
the bone marrow type much like red blood
cell type or other things the ABO

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:07.750
cell type or other things the ABO
 

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.150
cell type or other things the ABO
example that I gave you is inherent

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:10.160
example that I gave you is inherent
 

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.840
example that I gave you is inherent
so on this cartoon the round circles are

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:13.850
so on this cartoon the round circles are
 

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.180
so on this cartoon the round circles are
females and the square circles are men

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:16.190
females and the square circles are men
 

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.420
females and the square circles are men
so here we have a man and a woman that

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:19.430
so here we have a man and a woman that
 

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.050
so here we have a man and a woman that
have three children and these long

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.060
have three children and these long
 

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.510
have three children and these long
addresses I've made color-coded so you

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:25.520
addresses I've made color-coded so you
 

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.580
addresses I've made color-coded so you
can see the difference this is how we

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:27.590
can see the difference this is how we
 

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.610
can see the difference this is how we
talk about the bone marrow type it's a

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:30.620
talk about the bone marrow type it's a
 

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.860
talk about the bone marrow type it's a
very complicated system that you can see

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:32.870
very complicated system that you can see
 

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.740
very complicated system that you can see
from this cartoon that mom and dad come

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:35.750
from this cartoon that mom and dad come
 

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.890
from this cartoon that mom and dad come
together and each parent gives one gene

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:38.900
together and each parent gives one gene
 

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.410
together and each parent gives one gene
to each of their children so each

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:41.420
to each of their children so each
 

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.720
to each of their children so each
everybody has two genes and in this case

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:43.730
everybody has two genes and in this case
 

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.510
everybody has two genes and in this case
the mom gives the red gene to her

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:46.520
the mom gives the red gene to her
 

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.510
the mom gives the red gene to her
daughter and the red gene to the son

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:49.520
daughter and the red gene to the son
 

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.180
daughter and the red gene to the son
while dad gives the green gene to the

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.190
while dad gives the green gene to the
 

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.450
while dad gives the green gene to the
same a daughter and son and there is a

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.460
same a daughter and son and there is a
 

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.550
same a daughter and son and there is a
match you can see that light up and this

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:57.560
match you can see that light up and this
 

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.640
match you can see that light up and this
brother over here Oh is not affected

00:31:59.640 --> 00:31:59.650
brother over here Oh is not affected
 

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.380
brother over here Oh is not affected
doesn't match but that doesn't matter so

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:02.390
doesn't match but that doesn't matter so
 

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.450
doesn't match but that doesn't matter so
we have a good situation we can do a

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:04.460
we have a good situation we can do a
 

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.610
we have a good situation we can do a
transplant between the brother and the

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:06.620
transplant between the brother and the
 

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.790
transplant between the brother and the
patient on the other hand here's a

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:09.800
patient on the other hand here's a
 

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.610
patient on the other hand here's a
situation where they don't match up

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:11.620
situation where they don't match up
 

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.930
situation where they don't match up
where you can see that mom and dad's

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:13.940
where you can see that mom and dad's
 

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.710
where you can see that mom and dad's
genetic situation was such that the two

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720
genetic situation was such that the two
 

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.020
genetic situation was such that the two
brothers match each other but the

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.030
brothers match each other but the
 

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.970
brothers match each other but the
patient is left out in the cold what

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:21.980
patient is left out in the cold what
 

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.560
patient is left out in the cold what
does that mean well I've already told

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:23.570
does that mean well I've already told
 

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.110
does that mean well I've already told
you that there's many many people in the

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120
you that there's many many people in the
 

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.630
you that there's many many people in the
world who may have the same bone marrow

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640
world who may have the same bone marrow
 

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.460
world who may have the same bone marrow
type as you the problem is it's like

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:30.470
type as you the problem is it's like
 

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.620

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.420
filled and they're stuck to each other
we can collect these cells and then use

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:33.430
we can collect these cells and then use
 

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.960
we can collect these cells and then use
them for treatment what do they do they

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:36.970
them for treatment what do they do they
 

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.550
them for treatment what do they do they
nurture the bone marrow and this is

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560
nurture the bone marrow and this is
 

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.680

basically this is what the cells look

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:49.840
basically this is what the cells look
 

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.770
basically this is what the cells look
like growing if you add the bone marrow

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:52.780
like growing if you add the bone marrow
 

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.990

is called cobblestone and they look

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:02.140
is called cobblestone and they look
 

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.010
is called cobblestone and they look
similar to what's in the street and they

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:05.020
similar to what's in the street and they
 

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.210
similar to what's in the street and they
also have immunosuppressive properties

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220
also have immunosuppressive properties
 

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.010
also have immunosuppressive properties
this is the first time this has been

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.020
this is the first time this has been
 

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.400
this is the first time this has been
done in humans as a paper that I wrote

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:13.410

possible in this first in human study
 

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.050
possible in this first in human study
and subsequently we have gone on and use

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:37.060
and subsequently we have gone on and use
 

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.860
and subsequently we have gone on and use
these cells as part of our therapeutic

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:39.870

the patients and families we could never
 

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.859
the patients and families we could never
have made so much progress in the

00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:40.869
have made so much progress in the
 

00:45:40.869 --> 00:45:42.690
have made so much progress in the

who were willing to go through a lot of
 

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.200
who were willing to go through a lot of
these very difficult times and now

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.210
these very difficult times and now
 

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.330
these very difficult times and now
everybody's seeing the benefits of this

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.340
everybody's seeing the benefits of this
 

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.150
everybody's seeing the benefits of this
kind of thing and a lot of the data also

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160
kind of thing and a lot of the data also
 

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.810
kind of thing and a lot of the data also
his who have been have been that I've

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:00.820
his who have been have been that I've
 

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.970
his who have been have been that I've
shown have been generated at other

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:02.980
shown have been generated at other
 

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.730
shown have been generated at other
centers and building and so this is a

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:05.740
centers and building and so this is a
 

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.099
centers and building and so this is a
famous quote from Sir Isaac Newton who

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:08.109
famous quote from Sir Isaac Newton who
 

00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:10.620
famous quote from Sir Isaac Newton who
said if I have seen farther than others

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:10.630
said if I have seen farther than others
 

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.599
said if I have seen farther than others
it is because I was standing on the

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:12.609
it is because I was standing on the
 

00:46:12.609 --> 00:46:14.400
it is because I was standing on the
shoulders of giants so I think that's

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:14.410
shoulders of giants so I think that's
 

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.140
shoulders of giants so I think that's
something that's very important but

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.150
something that's very important but
 

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.109
something that's very important but
again I wanted to conclude by coming

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119
again I wanted to conclude by coming
 

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:21.570
again I wanted to conclude by coming
back to my point about Carnegie Mellon

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:21.580
back to my point about Carnegie Mellon
 

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.150
back to my point about Carnegie Mellon
the we can do showing the logo here I

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160
the we can do showing the logo here I
 

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.440
the we can do showing the logo here I
want to thank from the bottom of my

from placenta fluid if there's a lot of

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:33.840
from placenta fluid if there's a lot of
 

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.230
from placenta fluid if there's a lot of
different issues and a lot of commercial

ventures have actually sprung up trying
 

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.180
ventures have actually sprung up trying
to grow up these cells for marketing and

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:41.190
to grow up these cells for marketing and
 

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.100
to grow up these cells for marketing and
there's companies that have catchy names

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.110
there's companies that have catchy names
 

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.590
there's companies that have catchy names
that are actually doing this I you know

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:45.600
that are actually doing this I you know
 

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.560
that are actually doing this I you know
I think it's it's an exciting area I

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:48.570
I think it's it's an exciting area I
 

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.750
I think it's it's an exciting area I
don't know what the best recipe is we

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760
don't know what the best recipe is we
 

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.460
don't know what the best recipe is we
like to use bone marrow and that's in

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:52.470
like to use bone marrow and that's in
 

00:48:52.470 --> 00:49:05.510
like to use bone marrow and that's in
fact what we tend to do yes probability

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520
fact what we tend to do yes probability
 

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.779
fact what we tend to do yes probability
of that means

00:49:06.779 --> 00:49:06.789
of that means
 

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:09.689
of that means
so I'll repeat your question your

00:49:09.689 --> 00:49:09.699
so I'll repeat your question your
 

00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:11.519
so I'll repeat your question your
question is if the first bone marrow

00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:11.529
question is if the first bone marrow
 

00:49:11.529 --> 00:49:13.289
question is if the first bone marrow
transplant doesn't work can you do

00:49:13.289 --> 00:49:13.299
transplant doesn't work can you do
 

00:49:13.299 --> 00:49:15.329
transplant doesn't work can you do
another bone marrow transplant so the

00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:15.339
another bone marrow transplant so the
 

00:49:15.339 --> 00:49:18.479
another bone marrow transplant so the
long answer is number one why didn't the

00:49:18.479 --> 00:49:18.489
long answer is number one why didn't the
 

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:20.849
long answer is number one why didn't the
first bone in our transplant work did

not be able to do a second transplant

00:49:39.809 --> 00:49:39.819
not be able to do a second transplant
 

00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:42.269

now if it's your own bone marrow that

00:49:42.269 --> 00:49:42.279
now if it's your own bone marrow that

you're donating where you got a cancer
 

00:49:45.429 --> 00:49:47.429
you're donating where you got a cancer
but it's under control you can collect

00:49:47.429 --> 00:49:47.439
but it's under control you can collect
 

00:49:47.439 --> 00:49:50.219
but it's under control you can collect
the cells you're relying with your own

00:49:50.219 --> 00:49:50.229
the cells you're relying with your own
 

00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:53.849

cells on chemotherapy in massive dose to

00:49:53.849 --> 00:49:53.859
cells on chemotherapy in massive dose to
 

00:49:53.859 --> 00:49:56.069
cells on chemotherapy in massive dose to
get rid of the cancer it doesn't always

00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079
get rid of the cancer it doesn't always
 

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:59.069

work so some people who have had bone

00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079
work so some people who have had bone
 

00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:00.929
work so some people who have had bone
marrow transplant using their own cells

00:50:00.929 --> 00:50:00.939
marrow transplant using their own cells
 

00:50:00.939 --> 00:50:03.719
marrow transplant using their own cells
are now a candidate to get a bone marrow

00:50:03.719 --> 00:50:03.729
are now a candidate to get a bone marrow
 

00:50:03.729 --> 00:50:06.479
are now a candidate to get a bone marrow
transplant from with someone else's

00:50:06.479 --> 00:50:06.489
transplant from with someone else's
 

00:50:06.489 --> 00:50:08.249
transplant from with someone else's
cells whether it's a brother or sister

00:50:08.249 --> 00:50:08.259
cells whether it's a brother or sister
 

00:50:08.259 --> 00:50:10.259
cells whether it's a brother or sister
or someone in the community and large

or someone in the community and large
 

00:50:10.269 --> 00:50:12.749
or someone in the community and large
and that in fact is done somewhat

00:50:12.749 --> 00:50:12.759
and that in fact is done somewhat
 

00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:15.569
and that in fact is done somewhat
frequently so that's a fairly common

00:50:15.569 --> 00:50:15.579
frequently so that's a fairly common
 

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.809
frequently so that's a fairly common
that's called a tandem transplant when a

00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:18.819
that's called a tandem transplant when a
 

00:50:18.819 --> 00:50:21.419
that's called a tandem transplant when a
person has had a bone marrow transplant

00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:21.429
person has had a bone marrow transplant
 

00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:23.789
person has had a bone marrow transplant
that has not worked after getting an

00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799
that has not worked after getting an
 

00:50:23.799 --> 00:50:25.979
that has not worked after getting an
allogeneic transplant that is from

00:50:25.979 --> 00:50:25.989
allogeneic transplant that is from
 

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:28.079
allogeneic transplant that is from
brother or sister the likelihood of then

00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:28.089
brother or sister the likelihood of then
 

00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:30.209
brother or sister the likelihood of then
being able to get another transplant is

00:50:30.209 --> 00:50:30.219
being able to get another transplant is
 

00:50:30.219 --> 00:50:33.599
being able to get another transplant is
less common it can be done sometimes

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:33.609
less common it can be done sometimes
 

00:50:33.609 --> 00:50:36.089
less common it can be done sometimes
another donor can be used but i would

00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:36.099
another donor can be used but i would
 

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:38.459
another donor can be used but i would
say on average i would say maybe of all

00:50:38.459 --> 00:50:38.469
say on average i would say maybe of all
 

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:40.769
say on average i would say maybe of all
the cases it's a five percent so yeah it

00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:40.779
the cases it's a five percent so yeah it
 

00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:42.599
the cases it's a five percent so yeah it
can be done but you have to understand

00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:42.609
can be done but you have to understand
 

00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:44.219
can be done but you have to understand
why the first transplant was not a

00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:44.229
why the first transplant was not a
 

00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:48.469
why the first transplant was not a
success other questions

00:50:48.469 --> 00:50:48.479
