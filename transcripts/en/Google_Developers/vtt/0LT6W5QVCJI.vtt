00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.030
So welcome to the Polymer
State of the Union.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm not sure how familiar you
are with State of the Unions.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.280
I'll try and make this
a lot more interesting.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.210
But you may all--
like half of you

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.970
may have to stand
up and give standing

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.580
ovations like every
couple of minutes.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.420
So I hope you warmed
up, did some squats,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.220
that kind of thing.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.520
Should be good.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.816
So just a little bit about me.

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:22.940
My name is Matthew McNulty.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.226
I lead the Polymer
team here at Google.

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.350
My Twitter handle is there.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.330
It's mattsmcnulty.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.030
Feel free to stalk me.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.580
There's a lot of
young British women

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.610
who think I'm an
actor over there.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.770
So they stalk me, and
they are similarly bored.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.260
So feel free to join them.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.760
For the sake of
this talk, I'm going

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.093
to assume that most of you
know something about Polymer,

00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:44.779
as well as web components, and
you paid attention to Dimitri.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.320
Just in case, I'm going to spend
just a minute or two talking

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.260
about what Polymer is.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.130
Whoops, wrong button.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.350
So Polymer a library that helps
you build elements and apps out

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.197
of web components.

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.280
So this sounds like a lot
of JavaScript frameworks

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.120
out there.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.270
But Polymer is
different, in that it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.440
uses web components, what
Dimitri was talking about,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.830
this cutting edge
set of standards.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820
This lets it do less work
to achieve better results

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.380
than what came before, and
frees up framework authors

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.610
to concentrate on
making great apps.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.090
So how great can apps be?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.479
It turns out, with
Polymer, very great.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.270
So it's easy to say,
but let's take a look.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.020
So first, I'm going
to show you a mail app

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.780
that one engineer wrote
in just two weeks.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.230
So granted, it was
Eric Beidleman.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.330
He's pretty awesome.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.550
But still, it was one
dev in just two weeks.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.120
And I get to a demo on a
screen that's really far away.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.620
All right.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.730
So first off, let me make
this clear, this is not Gmail.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.910
This is just a sample app
that we wrote in Polymer,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.520
but it does is the
Gmail API and Google

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.300
sign in and
authentication-- which

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.560
I can sort of see my mouse.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.900
And no one email me at
those other email addresses.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.050
Forget you saw them.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.970
So the Gmail API and in
the sign in authentication

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.340
API are just part of more
than 250 different APIs

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.710
that Google makes public.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.000
So the Google Web
Components project,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.940
which is a project we
started, turn those APIs

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.790
into web components.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.699
It's at googlewebcomponents.org,
I believe.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.060
Imagining some of these
APIs can be a pain,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.500
but Web Components
reduces the boilerplate,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.362
and makes it so they're
really simple to use

00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:19.820
and really simple to integrate
into an app like this really

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.640
quickly.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.750
So let me find my cursor again.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.087
There it is.

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:26.920
So here we have an app
that's really, really

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.940
close to the native Gmail app.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.240
You can see, if
I scroll it, it's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.940
got a really cool
material design,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.470
[INAUDIBLE] scroll thing.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.590
I can also select items.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.200
It's got some ink
effects there, undo it.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.300
It's got an app drawer.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.750
This stuff is pulling this
profile data from Google+.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.300
It's profiling the tags.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.910
It's pulling the tags
from the Gmail API.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.400
This is all a real
app with real data.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.620
And it's even responsive.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.405
I can bring it really big
and it adjusts automatically.

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:00.844
It still has all the
really cool effects.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.260
So anyway, you can
swipe messages,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.370
you can do swipe to delete.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.974
Undo it.

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:06.390
And it all just
works really well.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.930
And this just uses the web
platform, uses Web Components

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.850
and uses Polymer.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:15.670
Let me get back here.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.340
All right.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.670
So now we see what we can do
with Polymer and part of what

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.260
makes it different.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.220
But let's dig into it
just a little bit more

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.000
and see what makes it unique.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.080
So we make a big
deal out of the fact

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.430
that Polymer is a library
and not a framework.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.210
This goes back to
using Web Components

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.260
and really using the platform.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.960
So a long time ago, web apps
are written in HTML and using

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.760
built-in tags, like
button and form.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430
So Polymer returns
to that world,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.255
but this time with
custom elements.

00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.340
And with Polymer,
developers write HTML,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.490
but the framework is DOM.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.580
We don't build our
own framework on top.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.110
Polymer is just a
really thin layer

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.554
on top of that new and
improved web platform.

00:03:56.554 --> 00:03:57.970
So that's created
at a high level,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.652
but what does it actually do?

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.110
So the first thing it does is
it sugars the primitives that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.870
make up web components.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.180
So why does this new
hotness that Dimitri just

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.886
danced around and talked
about need sugaring?

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.510
It's because, like
all good primitives,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.637
web components are
really low level.

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.970
And that makes them really
flexible and really powerful,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.230
but not quite as
easy as they can be.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.260
And Polymer helps that out.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.036
So Polymer also
reduces boilerplate,

00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:23.410
keeping your code
limited to just

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.250
what's unique in
your application.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.480
And it adds a declarative
syntax to Web Components.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.855
This is in the
spec, but no one's

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.557
implemented it yet,
including Chrome.

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:33.265
And this allows you
to develop in markup,

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:35.510
which makes it really simple.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.140
And most importantly,
Polymer has an opinion.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.260
It's how we think elements
and applications built

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.980
with Web Components
should be built.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.260
So here's Dimitri again.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.540
This is an actual picture of
him working on Web Components.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.690
I definitely didn't
Photoshop this yesterday.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.255
It's definitely
not my wallpaper.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.247
So this is just a
little history lesson.

00:05:05.247 --> 00:05:06.830
The state of the
art, for a long time,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.350
has been JavaScript developers
building their own platforms

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.690
on top of the web,
because the web

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.980
platform wasn't good enough.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.220
But now with Web
Components, it is.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.120
And Polymer is the
next step in that story

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.630
that Dimitri was
telling earlier.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.040
It's the experiment to prove
that Web Components are

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.140
awesome, to use his term.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.100
So experiments have results.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.550
How have we been doing?

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.500
So Polymer has a lot of
really great features

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.270
for making building
web apps easier.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.500
So developers love them.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.310
We've had a million unique
visitors to Polymer.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.800
We're in the midst of holding
a bunch of education events

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.080
around the world,
called Polytechnics.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.260
119 of them so far.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.330
And 85% of the
participants say they're

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.640
going to use Polymer
in the next project.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.529
So in our little report card
here, I'm completely biased,

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.070
but I think we get
an A for that one.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.710
So grading yourself is
the best kind of grading,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.290
in case you don't know that.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.810
So how about productivity?

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.630
So Polymer lets developers
build applications

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.590
faster and with less code.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.580
So Quickoffice is
a user of Polymer.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.850
And they removed
10,000 lines of code

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.044
when they moved to Polymer
for their document rendering.

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:16.460
And again, the Mail app I
showed earlier, written by Eric,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.270
came from one
developer in two weeks,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.660
to build a really polished,
really nice web app.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.636
So let's give that
one another biased A.

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:27.760
We've also got a lot of
elements the developers can

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.960
use as is for their apps.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.870
You saw some of those
in the Gmail app.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.120
These are built with Polymer,
but they're not Polymer.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.462
They're a separate thing.

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:35.670
We have a few different sets.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.260
We have core elements,
we have paper elements

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.810
for functional and UI elements.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.440
And we expect there to
be a lot more of these.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.860
And you saw, paper elements are
our material design elements.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.600
And material design was this
really awesome effort inside

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.550
of Google, because the Polymer
team, the Android team,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.400
and the team that works on
the iOS framework for iOS apps

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.880
at Google, all worked
together side by side

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.000
on the same project.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.884
It was equal partners
across it all.

00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:02.800
So as you can see from
the demo I did earlier,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.570
developers can build awesome
experiences with these.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.980
So working on
perfect GPA so far.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.900
Mom's going to be really proud.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.510
So how about performance?

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.470
So Topeka, this really cool quiz
app we showed earlier at I/O,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.300
the Polymer Mail app
I was just showing,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.402
and our sample apps work great.

00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:25.580
But to be honest,
performance is inconsistent.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.562
The things take tuning.

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:29.520
And they're especially
inconsistent on browsers

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.290
that don't yet support native
web components, like Safari.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.340
So developers have told
us that mobile Safari is

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.192
super important for the mobile
web, they can't just ignore it.

00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:40.150
But getting quality
performance on that browser

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.890
is really challenging.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.520
So there's our perfect GPA.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.520
So I'm going to give that
a "Needs Improvement."

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.056
Mom's going to be pretty mad.

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:52.430
But we're progressive optimists
here on the Polymer team,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.180
so we're going to rephrase
that to "Maximum Improvement

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.700
Opportunity."

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.470
I was going to do an
acorn, because it's

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.990
the furthest from
a tree, but that

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.900
was going to get a
little too weird.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.232
So how about payload
and complexity?

00:08:06.232 --> 00:08:07.940
So these things go
together really often.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.490
So Polymer itself
is pretty lean.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.450
It's 123K, it's a 66K gzipped.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.480
For an app in like a
fully featured framework,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.744
that's pretty great.

00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:19.160
But for a single element, which
is what Web Component says

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.484
you can mix and match on
the page, not so much.

00:08:22.484 --> 00:08:24.650
And Polymer is supposed to
be able to do less, which

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.316
means it should be
smaller, because it's

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:28.490
built on Web Components.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.976
And in terms of complexity,
Polymer is pretty complex.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.809
It can be difficult to
know what's going on,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.299
if you want to look
under the surface

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.340
and see what's happening.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.817
And again, for an
app, that's OK.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:39.150
But for mixing and matching
all these different elements

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.878
from different
vendors, not as much.

00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:43.669
So I think we have to
admit we have another

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.270
"Maximum Opportunity
for Improvement" here.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.990
So let's look at the
whole report card.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.260
So ergonomics, productivity,
and expressiveness are A's.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.780
A for awesome, as
Dimitri would say.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.309
And performance and payload
need some improvement.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.350
So this illustrates an
issue we've had all along.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.680
Polymer has dueling goals.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.640
Be this experiment that pushes
the platform forward and lives

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.950
on the edge, but also be
something production worthy

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.899
that developers can depend on.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:15.440
So we've done a great job with
at former, note all those A's.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.910
But the latter is clearly
a work in progress.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.480
But the experiment's over now.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.474
Native features are
shipped in Chrome.

00:09:22.474 --> 00:09:24.390
Polymer is fully feature
enough to build apps,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.906
like I showed you.

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:28.110
And we started out with
no native features at all

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.460
when we started this project
two years ago, and almost

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.925
no knowledge about how all
this stuff would work together.

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:35.150
And now that's changed.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.960
So now it's time to make
Polymer production ready.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.570
So in the last
month, we've begun

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.440
to take a hard look at
every aspect of Polymer.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.370
So we've learned a
ton we can put use

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.135
to making Polymer better.

00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:51.470
We looked at each
and every feature

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.842
and tried to hammer it down into
a leaner, less complex shape,

00:09:54.842 --> 00:09:57.300
without sacrificing the really
great features that everyone

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.430
loves.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.990
So we made a bunch
of improvements

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.150
and we're ready to tell
you about them today.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.630
So first, we've
refactored Polymer

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.030
into a series of layers.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.780
So core features are really
fast and really lean.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.836
Advanced features that are
more costly are opt-in.

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:13.830
And we strived for
the 80/20 Rule.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.540
So try to accommodate
all the common use cases

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.480
and let the rest opt-in
to more advanced features.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.860
So that's the first change.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.370
Another change is we've greatly
simplified our data binding

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:24.879
system.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:26.670
So like everything
else, we've optimized it

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.450
for performance and simplicity.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.537
So most properties don't
require two-way binding,

00:10:31.537 --> 00:10:32.620
so we've made that opt-in.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.986
So if you think of
an Ajax request,

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.360
there's a zillion things you
can set, but really only one

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.040
response that you want
to actually listen to.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.480
So we've made that opt-in.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.170
Polymer has always had
implicit types for properties,

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.840
but we've made
that explicit now.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.540
And change notification uses
events for interoperability

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.966
across elements from
different frameworks.

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:56.840
And another thing we're
doing is specifically

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.230
geared up browsers that
have not implemented

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.750
Shadow DOM and the
rest of Web Components.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.630
So this change is specific
to them and not Chrome.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.020
So we have a Shadow DOM
Polyfill, it's awesome.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.130
It's this feat of engineering.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.920
It's spec compliant, but
it's also pretty intrusive.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.284
And because it's a pretty
big feature, it's pretty big.

00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:17.450
So instead, we're going to
take the tack of building

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.594
a shim-style layer that just
polyfills what Polymer needs.

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:24.010
And the existing
polyfill is going

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.700
to live on for generic
non-Polymer Web Component's

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.271
code, and that's
the third change.

00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:31.770
So those are the
high level changes,

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.510
but what are the
results of this effort?

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.310
So it's still pretty early.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.374
Performance testing is
a really tricky art.

00:11:38.374 --> 00:11:39.790
But we have some
results to share.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.100
So the first thing we
tested was startup time.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.530
So how long we can go
from launch until the app

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.030
is ready to use.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.290
So first on Chrome.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.340
So I've always wanted
an excuse to use that.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.980
So like a medium complexity app
starts about five times faster

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.450
on Chrome than it was before.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.980
So that's a huge speedup.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.160
On Safari, the story is
a little bit different.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.105
So the same steps starts up
eight times faster on Safari.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.980
So that's more of an
improvement than Chrome,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.360
but we have more
to do on Safari.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360
So Chrome is still
faster, because it

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.450
has the native features.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.975
But the penalty is reduced to
as small as we could make it.

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:23.600
All right, so it's
way faster, but what

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.060
about payload and complexity?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.090
So we've reduced payload
87%, so it's 15K now.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.510
And that's 6K gzipped.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.030
And this is with the same
features and the same use

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.080
cases.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080
So we're not quite done.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.038
These numbers are going
to change a little bit.

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:49.120
My team wants me
to emphasize that.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.700
But you can get an
idea, about now,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.200
about how we sped
things up so much.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.280
We went really, really
simple and down to the metal.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.029
And so, to be honest,
it surprised even us

00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:58.170
that we could do this
without a major disruption

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.820
to the feature set.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.570
But it's fun and easy
to say these things.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.980
So let's look at
actual evidence.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.550
Let's go to the videotape.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.125
So this is showing Pica,
which is a newsreader demo.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.310
It kind of does
RSS feed reading,

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.080
which we've had for
a really long time.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.350
And we've got two versions
of it running on a Nexus 9.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.865
On the left, you've
got the new Polymer.

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:18.740
On the right, we've got
the existing Polymer.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.516
It's the same app.

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:23.030
So that actually went
early, didn't it?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.470
So let's see the difference.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.044
Bling, bloop.

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.600
So here's the same
thing on an iPad Air.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.156
It gets better.

00:13:46.156 --> 00:13:47.280
So here's a synthetic test.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.660
This is like a medium complexity
list, a lot a list data

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.010
and a lot of data, actually,
here on our Nexus 9.

00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:04.710
And now here's the
same thing on an iPad.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:11.790
And, no, it didn't freeze.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.220
All right.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.470
So let's take a look at
our report card again.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.340
So we stayed after
school, we worked hard.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.040
And Mom's much happier now.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.250
We've improved precisely
where we've needed it,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.740
and we haven't touched the
features that developers love.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.830
Of course, nothing like is free.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.130
So there are some breaking
changes, especially when

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.480
it comes to data binding
in certain cases.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.920
But it's really not that scary.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.810
It will not require a rewrite.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.370
So elements might
not have to change

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.530
at all, individual
elements you've made.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.114
Larger apps might need a
few days to a week to adapt,

00:14:52.114 --> 00:14:53.530
but it kind of
depends on the app.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.140
Some apps may not have
to change really, at all.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.030
So basically, about a few
minor version numbers worth of

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.781
changes, but all at once.

00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.530
So to make sure people
realize that, we're

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.370
changing the version
number to 0.8,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.550
both to show they
were closer to 1.0

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.420
and we're 0.3
better than before.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.290
Glad people got sort of
"Spinal Tap" reference there.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.395
So I've got a few other
things to talk about, too.

00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:21.320
We've covered what
Polymer is already,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.120
and I do that every single talk.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.810
And all of us do that every
single talk, and people still

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.630
get really confused
about it-- even people

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.660
that work on Web Components.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.460
So Polymer web components
are pretty big, new things.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.660
And some people think Polymer
is just the polyfills.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.770
Some people think Polymer is
the material design elements.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.190
We'd kind of like
to clear that up.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.236
So the polyfills that
Polymer uses are agnostic.

00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:43.610
They work with
any other library.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.210
Brick uses them today.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.930
These are Web
Components polyfills,

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.270
not Polymer polyfills, and
they're generally useful.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.630
These polyfills are not Polymer.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.045
We wrote them, but they're
not part of Polymer itself.

00:15:58.045 --> 00:15:59.920
So we're going to move
them away from Polymer

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.270
into webcomponents.org
so other library authors

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.890
or developers can use them
without any confusion at all.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.579
And the community can improve
them independent of Polymer.

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:10.370
So we wrote them, but
we want everyone else

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.790
to be able to use them until
the day we can happily get rid

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.873
of them, because everyone
supports Web Components.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.100
So elements, they're
made with Polymer,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.830
but like I said before,
they're not Polymer.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.230
Polymer is a material
design, but we

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.074
make a set of material
design elements.

00:16:27.074 --> 00:16:28.490
So we're going to
take them, we're

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.240
going to move them to their
own part of the website.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.100
And I think we're
eventually going

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.920
to give them their own identity
and put them somewhere else.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.036
But for right now, they're kind
of separated out from Polymer.

00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:38.660
And what's left is
the core of Polymer,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.850
that 15K, or that 6K gzipped.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.654
And now that core
is production-track.

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:45.070
So that means no
more fuzzy labels

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.210
that mean nothing,
an actual roadmap.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.820
That's still a little fuzzy.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.620
So 0.8 is in preview today.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.610
So it's live today as a
branch of Polymer, itself.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.090
It's still really,
really, early.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.620
It lacks docs, like completely.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.292
It's still missing a
couple of features.

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:04.000
But you can take a
look, if you're brave.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.458
We like to do
everything in public,

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.470
so we've got it sitting there.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.460
0.9 we're going to call "beta,"
it will be early next year.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.161
And then 1.0 really
soon after that.

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:16.369
So the idea is, we're focused
on the core of Polymer,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.869
and we're going to put it out
in production as quickly as we

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.089
can.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.520
So even as an experiment,
until now, lots of people

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.150
are actually using Polymer.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.410
So we love early adopters
out there on the front lines

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.740
of the web platform with us.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.740
And I have a bunch of
them I'd like to show you.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.270
So first up is Salesforce.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.170
Salesforce is Polymer's BFF.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.720
So they're here somewhere.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.120
They really, really get Polymer.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.290
They've gotten Polymer from the
first time we put it out there.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.020
They're the people I
bring to the office

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.780
every time the team
needs a pick-me-up.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.460
And their mobile SDK
teams built this whole SDK

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.120
for their developers
to use Polymer

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.900
to build Salesforce apps.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.800
So they built a
whole SDK on Polymer,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.082
and they're shipping
that to their customers.

00:17:59.082 --> 00:18:01.570
And they've also built a
reference hybrid application

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.420
that runs across
multiple platforms

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.590
and has secure offline storage.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.494
And it uses Polymer,
as you can see here.

00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:09.910
So this is actually a product
that they shipped this week,

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.370
and blogged about,
I think, yesterday.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.700
So next up News Corp. News
Corp has this awesome team

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.110
using Polymer to experiment
with next-gen tools

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.990
for understanding, manipulating
data with components,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.414
and putting that data in
the hands of journalists.

00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:26.830
This is really,
really cool stuff,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.121
and it's at the cutting edge
of data-driven journalism.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.040
And now for some
Google products.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.720
So YouTube is using Polymer.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.980
So for some users, this
is going live this week.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.620
It's going to be
the Related Videos

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.530
list to one side for
a percentage users

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.196
they're going to get,
will be moved over

00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:43.749
to Polymer this week.

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:45.540
So Quickoffice, I
mentioned before, they've

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.720
got a rewrite coming of
their whole renderer.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.410
This uses Polymer, it's
shipping very, very soon.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.660
And it Radically
simplified their code base.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.380
So 10,000 fewer lines of
code to do the same thing.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.700
So Translate is also
developing their user interface

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.370
in Polymer.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.120
And you may not realize
this, but hundreds

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.110
of millions of people use
translate every single day.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.380
Google Play Music is
also using Polymer.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.784
And Santa Tracker.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.690
I'm actually happy that
got the most applause.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.750
So this is a great story.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.780
So I don't know if
you guys know this.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.370
1955, a Sears store
in Colorado Springs

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.810
put an ad in the
paper saying kids

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.800
could call and talk to Santa.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.390
And they put the
wrong number in,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.810
and they actually put the
precursor to NORAD's number in.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.794
So this colonel in NORAD
in Colorado Springs

00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:39.460
started getting phone
calls on Christmas

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.055
asking where Santa was.

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.430
And this colonel
actually happens

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.560
to be the grandfather
of a good friend of mine

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.710
who works at Google.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.610
And he started to
just actually give out

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.500
where Santa is to all the kids.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.420
And a tradition was born.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.200
So it's a really cool story.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.570
You should look into it.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.540
So the Santa Tracker
that's going to-- this

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.415
is the current one--
the Santa Tracker that's

00:20:01.415 --> 00:20:03.500
going to launch this
upcoming season uses Polymer.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.570
And its awesome.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:09.040
And for all your
Santa stalking needs.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.402
So there's a whole lot
more users of Polymer

00:20:11.402 --> 00:20:12.110
inside of Google.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.429
Really, too many
to actually list,

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:15.720
but there's a whole bunch more.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.740
So let's wrap up.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.250
So that was a lot of new stuff.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.340
So in summary, so the next
major version of Polymer

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.320
is coming shortly.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.680
It's out today.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.130
It's super, super fast, super,
super light, and really,

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.255
really, modular.

00:20:31.255 --> 00:20:33.880
And it's going to require really
minimal changes for developers

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.790
to adapt to.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.710
Everything you're doing
today still works.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.450
And Polymer is no
longer an experiment.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.276
So, hurray, it's a
production-track.

00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:45.671
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.650
And the polyfills are moving
over to webcomponents.org.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.130
That's already happening today.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:57.679
And lots of people are already
using Polymer, including Santa,

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:58.720
and you should join them.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.510
Rob's up next.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.710
He's going to dive
in a lot deeper.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.630
And so you can do
nothing, and Rob's

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.216
going to be here in a minute,
you don't even have to move.

00:21:09.216 --> 00:21:11.690
You can do something,
and follow us on polymer.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.590
And we're on GitHub.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.920
The name of the GitHub
project is Polymer.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.930
And come check us out, build
a project, and join the fun.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.830
Thanks.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.124
[APPLAUSE]
