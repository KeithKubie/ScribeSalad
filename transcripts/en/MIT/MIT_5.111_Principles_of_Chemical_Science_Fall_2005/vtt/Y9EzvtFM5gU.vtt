00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.524
Okay.
Today we are going to continue

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:21.995
where we left off with kinetics.
And so the topics we are going

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.951
to cover today,
we are going to talk about

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.413
radioactive decay,
which is an example of a first

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:31.885
order process.
Then we are going to talk about

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:33.891
second order integrated rate
laws.

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.662
Then we are going to something
that I love, which is to go back

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:41.432
and connect the first topic that
I taught in the second half of

00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:43.500
the semester,
chemical equilibrium,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.114
with kinetics.
So we are integrating all the

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:48.364
material from this half of the
course.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.527
And then we are going to start
talking about reaction

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:53.290
mechanisms.
And, on Wednesday,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.000
we will talk more about
reaction mechanisms.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.779
And so this will move you
closer to being able to do more

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:03.006
of the problems on Problem Set
10.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.785
Again, we are going to be in
kinetics for the rest of the

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:09.147
semester.
Other topics we will cover

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:12.319
after mechanism,
we will talk about temperature,

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.018
and we will talk about
catalysts as well.

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:19.000
Most of kinetics is in Chapter
13, but the little bit we are

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.306
going to do on radioactive decay
is in Chapter 17.

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:26.355
Just to review where we were on
Friday, we were talking about

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:30.000
half-life for a first-order
process.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.875
First-order half-life.
Half-life is just the time it

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.674
takes for half of the original
material to go away,

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:40.637
and its symbol is t one half.

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:44.664
Last time we took the first
order integrated rate law,

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:48.995
and we were able to solve for
an expression for half-life.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:52.946
And all we had to do is say all
right, by definition,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.593
when half of the original
material has gone away,

00:01:56.593 --> 00:02:01.000
then your t is equal to t a
half.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.011
It is the half-life.
And then the expression for the

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.865
original material,
so that is the concentration of

00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:12.247
A to the O, the original
material drops out.

00:02:12.247 --> 00:02:15.629
And we find that for a
half-life expression,

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.719
it is independent of a
concentration that you started

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.573
with, so it depends,
then, on the rate constant k.

00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:29.000
An example of a first order
process is radioactive decay.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.779
Radioactive decay,
the rate at which it happens is

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.790
independent of the number of
nuclei that surround the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.798
material.
That is another way of saying,

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:42.730
it is independent of the
concentration.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.049
This is a first-order process.
And so we can use the same

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.214
things we learned on Friday,
when we were talking about

00:02:51.214 --> 00:02:57.000
concentrations of material and
apply them to radioactive decay.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.096
So, because this is first-order
here, it is independent of the

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:06.190
surrounding nuclei,
we can apply these first-order

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.033
integrated rate laws that we
derived on Friday.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:13.292
Here were the ones we derived
on Friday.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:17.219
We found that the concentration
of a material A,

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.812
at some given time,
is equal to its original

00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:25.574
concentration times e to the
minus kt, where k is the rate

00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:31.184
constant and t is the time.
And we just looked at this

00:03:31.184 --> 00:03:36.392
again, that the half-life for a
first order process is equal to

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:41.601
0.6931 over that rate constant.
Now we can take these equations

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:46.222
and just rewrite them in terms
of nuclei, because we are

00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:51.010
talking about radioactive decay.
Instead of concentration,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.051
then, we are going to use this
term N, which is the number of

00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.235
nuclei.
We can put that in,

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:02.008
instead.
Now, we have a new expression,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.221
where N, the number of nuclei
at some given time,

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.903
is equal to N nought here,
the number of original nuclei

00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:10.644
in the sample,
e to the kt.

00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:13.790
And k is
a rate constant,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.874
but now it is called the decay
constant because we are talking

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.422
about radioactive decay.
But it is the same principle.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:24.301
It is just a slightly different
word for it.

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.447
And you have time.
So it is the same expression.

00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:32.000
Instead of concentration,
we have number of nuclei.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.273
Chemical kinetics is talking
about monitoring changes of

00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:42.164
concentration over time,
whereas nuclear kinetics is

00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:45.616
talking about measuring decay
events.

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:49.452
And so here,
we would be measuring with a

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:52.808
Geiger counter,
detecting radiation.

00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:57.986
Over here you are measuring
changes of concentration of

00:04:57.986 --> 00:05:02.409
material.
I just brought a Geiger counter

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.508
with me.
If we turn this on,

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:08.473
we can see if we have any
radioactivity in the room.

00:05:08.473 --> 00:05:12.904
The radiation will cause an
ionization and cause a current

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:16.169
flow, and the current flow
causes clicking.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.901
We will see how clean the
classroom is over here.

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.000
Can you hear it?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.493
It seems pretty good.
I will check over there later

00:05:33.493 --> 00:05:35.729
just to be sure that we are
free.

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.432
My lab uses X-rays to determine
structures of enzymes.

00:05:39.432 --> 00:05:43.414
We need this to check to make
sure we have no leaks in our

00:05:43.414 --> 00:05:46.209
X-ray generator,
that we are not exposing

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.655
anybody who comes by the
laboratory.

00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:52.148
That is how you could measure
whether there was any

00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:54.803
radioactivity,
and how it would change.

00:05:54.803 --> 00:05:57.528
And, if there is a lot of
radioactivity,

00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:02.000
then you start hearing the
clicks much faster.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.174
We can also talk about activity
of a sample.

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:09.475
And activity is abbreviated A
here.

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:15.106
And so the activity or the
decay rate is just the change in

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:19.766
the number of nuclei,
remember N is the number of

00:06:19.766 --> 00:06:24.330
nuclei, over time.
And so activity would then be

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.961
equal to the decay constant
times the number of nuclei that

00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.245
you have.
And because the activity would

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:38.812
be proportional to the number of
nuclei, you can also take the

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:41.358
expressions that we just looked
at.

00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:45.251
We just looked at this
expression, that the number of

00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:49.294
nuclei that you have at some
given time is equal to the

00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:53.336
number that you had originally
times e to the minus kt,

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:57.679
the decay constant times time.
You can also express that in

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:02.649
terms of activity.
Here we have the activity of

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:08.517
the sample at some given time is
equal to the original activity

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:11.545
that the sample had,
e to the kt,

00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:16.940
the decay constant times time.
You could use either one of

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.807
these, depending on what you are
given in a particular problem.

00:07:22.807 --> 00:07:27.350
In terms of units,
then, the SI unit for activity

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.892
is Bq, becquerel.
And this is equal to one

00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:34.811
radioactive disintegration per
second.

00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:38.597
And the older unit,
which you probably have heard

00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:42.461
of, is called the curie.
And one curie is equal to

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:45.301
3.7x10^10 disintegrations per
second.

00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:49.166
Does anybody know which curie
this is named after?

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.611
I heard some here and some
here.

00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:54.608
There are only two really
guesses here.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:59.026
It is actually Pierre Curie.
I always assumed,

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:02.045
until I looked this up
recently, that it would have

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:04.762
been Marie Curie.
After all, she was the first

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:08.384
woman to receive a Nobel Prize,
so I figured she could have a

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:10.498
unit named after here.
But, in fact,

00:08:10.498 --> 00:08:13.396
it was her husband that the
unit was named after.

00:08:13.396 --> 00:08:16.837
And she was involved in naming
the unit after her husband.

00:08:16.837 --> 00:08:20.339
And it was named after him
because of his untimely death in

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:23.358
1906, I think it was.
He was killed in some kind of

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:26.015
road accident.
And some people speculate that

00:08:26.015 --> 00:08:30.000
the effects of radiation were
already upon him.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.707
And he wasn't paying so much
attention.

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:35.985
Maybe it was the absent-minded
professor thing.

00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:38.978
I don't know.
Anyway, he ended up having an

00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:42.969
unfortunate accident and having
the unit named after him.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:47.030
He did share with his wife the
Nobel Prize before he died,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.092
but his wife went on to win a
second Nobel Prize after his

00:08:51.092 --> 00:08:53.301
death.
She got two Nobel Prizes,

00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:56.223
and he got one and a unit named
after him.

00:08:56.223 --> 00:09:00.000
Although, the unit is no longer
used.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.475
She probably got the better
deal in long-term history.

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:06.360
One thing I will mention is
that at the time,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.360
the reason why it was changed
is this is a pretty inconvenient

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.459
unit.
This is a really big number

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:14.295
right here.
And, at the time,

00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:17.114
they were deciding what this
unit should be,

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:20.721
it was pointed out that this
was kind of an inconvenient

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:23.213
number.
This is way more radiation than

00:09:23.213 --> 00:09:28.000
a normal sort of worker with
radiation would be handling.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.417
But Marie Curie put her foot
down, apparently,

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:35.822
and said that she didn't want
her husband's name associated

00:09:35.822 --> 00:09:40.455
with a unit that represented an
infinitesimally small quantity

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.658
of material.
As a consequence,

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:46.607
this is a large number that was
impractical and later

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:49.417
substituted.
The person that Marie and

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:53.974
Pierre Curie shared the Nobel
Prize with was Henry Becquerel.

00:09:53.974 --> 00:09:58.000
Apparently, his wife had no
objections.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.287
And so now a much smaller unit
is named after him.

00:10:01.287 --> 00:10:03.970
Whenever I talk about this,
I always ask,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.727
it makes me curious whether
there is a unit that is named

00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:10.142
after a woman.
As you go through MIT,

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:13.832
you might want to check with
your professors where these

00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:16.716
units came from.
And if you find one that is

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.333
named after a woman,
please let me know,

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:23.425
because I am not aware of any
and it is sort of a curiosity of

00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:26.981
mine if such a thing exists.
The current unit up here,

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:30.357
and this is the older unit.
Okay.

00:10:30.357 --> 00:10:34.714
We are not going to do much in
Chapter 17, but a little bit on

00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:38.000
some of the types.
This is just a table in your

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
book.
I didn't put it in your

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.428
handout, because I don't expect
you to really know any of this.

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:48.571
It will be presented in the
problem if you need to know it.

00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.857
But just to mention types of
radiation, alpha decays and beta

00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:54.214
decays.
Alpha decay,

00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:57.000
the particle that you are
talking about,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is equivalent to a helium four
nucleus.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.299
Beta decay equivalent to an
electron.

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:05.471
Sometimes you get a change in
mass.

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:08.537
Sometimes you get a change only
in atomic number.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.900
And the half-lives are very
different.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.733
Again, you don't need to know
this, but you will need to look

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:18.757
this up for some of the problems
that you do, what the half-life

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.801
is.
And this is right out of your

00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:23.037
book.
I think a few problems require

00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:26.806
you to go back to this table and
look up the half-life for a

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:32.795
particular material in question.
I am going to do an example of

00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:35.962
radioactive decay.
And, to do this,

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:41.180
I am going to turn to poetry
for this particular example.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.211
One of our chemistry grad
students, Mala Radhakrishnan,

00:11:46.211 --> 00:11:49.937
is also a poet.
And so this is one of her

00:11:49.937 --> 00:11:55.155
poems, Days of our Half-Lives.
And this is published in a

00:11:55.155 --> 00:12:00.000
collection of poetry all about
chemistry.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.003
She is now working on a
biochemistry book,

00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:09.471
if anybody is interested.
This is Chemistry for the Coach

00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:12.498
Potato.
Here poem has to do with

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:16.404
uranium-238.
And this is in your handout,

00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:20.700
this particular chart.
Here, alpha decays are

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.363
indicated by this yellow line,
and the beta decay is in the

00:12:26.363 --> 00:12:31.422
blue line here.
And so here is uranium-238 at

00:12:31.422 --> 00:12:34.764
the very top,
and this is all the various

00:12:34.764 --> 00:12:39.525
things that can happen to
uranium-238 as it goes through a

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:44.788
series of alpha and beta decays.
This is Days of Our Half-Lives.

00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:47.545
My dearest love,
I am writing you,

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:50.886
to tell you all that I have
been through.

00:12:50.886 --> 00:12:55.063
I have changed my whole
identity, but loved I can't

00:12:55.063 --> 00:12:58.154
pretend to be.
When I was uranium-238,

00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:03.000
you were on my case to start
losing weight.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.463
For five-billion years I'd hope
and I'd pray,

00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:09.139
and, finally,
I had an alpha decay.

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:12.524
Two protons,
two neutrons went right out the

00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:17.405
door, and now I was thorium-234.
But my nucleus was still unfit

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:20.632
for your eyes,
not positive enough for its

00:13:20.632 --> 00:13:22.600
large size.
But this time,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.323
my half-life was not very long,
because my will to change was

00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:31.741
really quite strong.
It took just a month,

00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:35.057
not even a millennium,
to beta decay into

00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:38.291
protactinium.
But you still rejected me,

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.944
right off the bat.
"Protactinium?

00:13:40.944 --> 00:13:45.339
Who's heard of that?" So a beta
decay I did once more,

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:48.241
to become uranium-234.
Myself again,

00:13:48.241 --> 00:13:52.055
but a new isotope.
You still weren't satisfied,

00:13:52.055 --> 00:13:55.371
but I still had hope.
Three alpha decays,

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.693
it was hard,
but I stayed on,

00:13:57.693 --> 00:14:00.512
through thorium again,
then radium,

00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:05.952
then radon.
I thought that I would finally

00:14:05.952 --> 00:14:09.593
please you.
My mass was a healthy 222.

00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:13.530
But you said,
"Although I like your mass,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.746
I don't want to be with a noble
gas!" You had a point,

00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:23.174
I was not reactive.
So in order to please you,

00:14:23.174 --> 00:14:27.799
I stayed proactive.
A few days later I found you

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:34.000
and said, "Two more alpha decays
and now I am lead!"

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.185
You shook your head.
You weren't too keen of my mass

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:41.550
number of 214.
I had a bad experience with

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.079
that mass before,
an unstable acetone walked

00:14:45.079 --> 00:14:48.443
right out the door.
So in order to change,

00:14:48.443 --> 00:14:51.644
I went away,
but all I could do was just

00:14:51.644 --> 00:14:55.009
beta decay.
My hopes and my dreams started

00:14:55.009 --> 00:15:01.000
to go under, because beta decays
do not change a mass number.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.025
To bismuth, then polonium,
I hoped and I beckoned,

00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.736
my half-life was 164
microseconds.

00:15:07.736 --> 00:15:11.433
And then I alpha decayed,
and then I was lead,

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:13.980
with a prize-worthy mass of
210.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.677
You've got to admit I was
getting quite tired,

00:15:17.677 --> 00:15:21.209
and my patience with you had
nearly expired.

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:24.824
You were more demanding than
any I had dated,

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:30.000
and much of my energy had
already been liberated.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.260
You still weren't happy,
but I had a fix.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.233
I really liked the number 206.
So I waited for years until the

00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:41.413
day which began with another
beta decay.

00:15:41.413 --> 00:15:44.836
And then one more.
And finally in the end I

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:47.364
alpha-ed to lead 206,
my friend.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:50.706
To change any further,
I wouldn't be able,

00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:53.641
no longer active,
but happily stable.

00:15:53.641 --> 00:16:00.000
It took me billions of years to
do, but look how I have changed.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.118
And all just for you.
And what did you say?

00:16:03.118 --> 00:16:07.574
I had gotten so old that you'd
rather be with a young lass of

00:16:07.574 --> 00:16:09.133
gold.
Well, I give up.

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:11.064
We are through,
my pumpkin.

00:16:11.064 --> 00:16:14.777
Shouldn't all my efforts be
countin' for something?

00:16:14.777 --> 00:16:19.455
Well, you won't be able to rule
me anymore, because I am leaving

00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:21.980
you, not for one atom but for
four.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.247
That is right.
While you were away diffusing,

00:16:25.247 --> 00:16:30.000
I met some chlorines that I
found quite amusing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.565
And we are going to form lead
Cl four and you won't

00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:38.902
be hearing from me anymore.
So over the years I have grown

00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:41.793
quite wise.
I have learned that love is

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:45.141
about compromise.
You still have half of your

00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:48.413
half-lives to give.
So now you go out there,

00:16:48.413 --> 00:16:51.000
it is your turn to give.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.213
Okay, so there is an example of
radioactive decay that brought

00:17:05.213 --> 00:17:09.230
us all the way up here to all
the way down here.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.564
All right.
Now let's actually look at an

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:15.811
example of how we might work a
problem.

00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:20.427
And if anyone else has any
poetry suggestions for other

00:17:20.427 --> 00:17:25.299
topics in freshman chemistry,
feel free to submit those as

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:26.153
well.
Okay.

00:17:26.153 --> 00:17:33.088
Now let's just work an example.
We want to find the original

00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:40.036
activity and the activity after
17 years, which is equivalent to

00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:45.110
5.4x10^8 seconds of 0.5 grams of
plutonium-239.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:51.066
And this is the half-life in
years and also in seconds.

00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:56.580
We can use this equation.
We want to find activity,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.944
and original activity.
And we need to know original

00:18:01.944 --> 00:18:04.652
number of nuclei and the decay
constant.

00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:08.333
But, before we can use that,
we have to find the decay

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:12.152
constant and the number of
nuclei to be able to find the

00:18:12.152 --> 00:18:15.138
original activity.
First, we can look at the

00:18:15.138 --> 00:18:19.097
number of original nuclei.
And so we were given that there

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:22.083
were 0.5 grams.
We can convert that with the

00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:25.069
atomic weight.
And here, you want to use the

00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:30.000
atomic weight that is given in
the form of that isotope.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.811
You don't need to look this up
in the Periodic Table.

00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:37.329
You just take that number,
which is given to you,

00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:41.214
and plug it in down here.
Then we need to convert with

00:18:41.214 --> 00:18:44.513
this number, which is what?
Avogadro's number.

00:18:44.513 --> 00:18:48.104
Convert the number of nuclei
that are in one mole.

00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:52.209
And so then we can get the
number of nuclei originally in

00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:55.141
this sample, in 0.5 grams of
this sample.

00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:59.443
That is 1.3x10^21 nuclei.
Then we can find k.

00:18:59.443 --> 00:19:02.558
How can we find k with what is
given here?

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.585
What do we know that is useful?
We know the half-life,

00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:08.941
right.
We can easily find k from

00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:13.575
half-life by the equation for a
first-order half-life process.

00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:16.463
That is just 0.6931 over the
half-life.

00:19:16.463 --> 00:19:20.946
And the only thing tricky here
is you want to make sure that

00:19:20.946 --> 00:19:24.745
you are going to have all your
units come out okay,

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:29.000
so either all in years or all
in seconds.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.491
If we plug in the second value
here, we can get our decay

00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:37.743
constant k in seconds,
9.1x10^-13 seconds to the minus

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.470
one.
Now we have a number of nuclei

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.363
originally present and the decay
constant, so we can calculate

00:19:45.363 --> 00:19:49.374
the original activity.
And so we can just plug that

00:19:49.374 --> 00:19:50.737
in.
And so we get,

00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:53.946
for our units,
we have nuclei per second.

00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:59.000
And one disintegration per
second is a becquerel.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.034
Nuclei per second is just a
becquerel.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:05.642
That is in Bq.
See, that is a more convenient

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:09.497
unit than the curie.
That is our original value.

00:20:09.497 --> 00:20:12.695
Now, if we want to know,
after 17 years,

00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:17.206
how much activity is left,
we can use this equation down

00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:20.158
here.
That the activity at some given

00:20:20.158 --> 00:20:25.079
time is equal to the activity
originally times e to the minus

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:30.000
kt, where that is the decay
constant and time.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.222
We can plug in our original
activity that we just

00:20:34.222 --> 00:20:39.413
calculated, put in our decay
constant which we calculated up

00:20:39.413 --> 00:20:44.340
here, and here we just have to
make sure we have the same

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.419
units.
Seventeen years was converted

00:20:47.419 --> 00:20:51.290
to number of seconds,
and we can put that in,

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.161
and we can solve,
and we get the same answer.

00:20:55.161 --> 00:21:00.000
To the significant figures,
it is the same.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.866
So no significant difference.
And this is one of the problems

00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:07.217
with materials that are
radioactive, is that they are

00:21:07.217 --> 00:21:10.504
around for a very long time.
And so one problem with

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:13.920
radioactive material is how are
you going to store it?

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.980
A lot of times the materials we
have to store things do not last

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.944
as long as the material we are
trying to store.

00:21:20.944 --> 00:21:24.488
This is a problem that every
once in a while gets talked

00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:29.000
about in the general media and
in political discussions.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.866
But here is an example that
these things are around for

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:34.871
quite a long time.
All right.

00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:38.164
I will just mention a use of
radioactive decay.

00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:41.959
A lot of people think of
radioactive materials and get

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:45.968
sort of frightened by them,
but they actually can be very

00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:49.190
useful and they can save lives
and make money.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.985
Here is an example from MIT.
This is a picture of Alan

00:21:52.985 --> 00:21:57.066
Davison, who has just retired
last year from the Chemistry

00:21:57.066 --> 00:22:01.110
Department.
And he paid attention to some

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.476
freshman chemistry stuff and
figured out a good way of making

00:22:05.476 --> 00:22:08.460
a material that could be used
for imaging.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.516
And so what he did,
he has this technetium.

00:22:11.516 --> 00:22:15.664
And he figured out how to put
it in a coordination complex

00:22:15.664 --> 00:22:20.248
that had just kind of the right
sort of properties that you want

00:22:20.248 --> 00:22:23.159
for imaging.
It wouldn't be in the system

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:27.453
very long, it wouldn't be too
harmful, but yet it would give

00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:31.828
you some good scans.
And so he paid attention to

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:35.823
metals in this d-block area that
we have been talking about.

00:22:35.823 --> 00:22:38.668
And he said,
how can I put this together in

00:22:38.668 --> 00:22:42.189
a coordination complex that
would have just the right

00:22:42.189 --> 00:22:44.695
properties?
He took one of these guys,

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:48.758
in gray, are some of the ones
that have been used in medicine

00:22:48.758 --> 00:22:52.483
that are not naturally occurring
in the body, and made a

00:22:52.483 --> 00:22:55.869
coordination complex.
And the ligands he chose were

00:22:55.869 --> 00:23:00.000
cyanide ligands to get the
desired properties.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.964
And this patent for Cardiolite
has made a lot of money,

00:23:03.964 --> 00:23:06.754
which is really putting it very
mildly.

00:23:06.754 --> 00:23:09.250
The patents,
there is money to MIT,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.627
to Alan Davison himself,
other people involved.

00:23:12.627 --> 00:23:16.592
And the Chemistry Department
has gotten money for this,

00:23:16.592 --> 00:23:18.941
too.
And over the last ten years,

00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:23.493
a lot of sort of discretionary
funds and scholarships and other

00:23:23.493 --> 00:23:29.000
things we have been able to do
has all been a result of this.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.047
Now the patent just expired on
this.

00:23:31.047 --> 00:23:34.556
We are looking for other people
who pay attention in freshman

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:37.305
chemistry to come up with some
basic principles,

00:23:37.305 --> 00:23:39.762
put it together,
and have a new patent that

00:23:39.762 --> 00:23:41.750
would allow us to kind of carry
on.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.441
We liked having all of this
extra money around.

00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:46.371
So you can be thinking about
that.

00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.360
Just sort of basic principles
here.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.466
And it has also saved a lot of
lives.

00:23:50.466 --> 00:23:54.150
They have moved on and tried to
use it now for imaging different

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.315
kinds of cancers and things like
that.

00:23:56.315 --> 00:24:00.000
It is really a pretty wonderful
material.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.296
All right.
Radioactivity can be difficult

00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:06.593
to store, but it also can be
very useful.

00:24:06.593 --> 00:24:11.620
That is first-order processes.
Radioactive decay is one of the

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.752
best examples of a first-order
process.

00:24:14.752 --> 00:24:17.472
Now let's talk about
second-order.

00:24:17.472 --> 00:24:22.417
And so what we are going to do
now is we are going to derive,

00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:27.115
as we did for the first-order
rate laws, some second-order

00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:31.776
integrated rate laws.
Here is second-order.

00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:35.161
We have a little equation,
2A going to B.

00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:39.646
And the rate expression,
disappearance of A over time.

00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:44.299
And the rate law would be equal
to k, the rate constant,

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:49.207
times the concentration of A.
And the order of the reaction

00:24:49.207 --> 00:24:51.661
is second.
It is second-order,

00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:54.707
so you know that that is a two
there.

00:24:54.707 --> 00:24:59.446
And, again, as we talked about
last time, what you see up

00:24:59.446 --> 00:25:05.447
there, you have A to the M.
This indicates the order of the

00:25:05.447 --> 00:25:09.236
reaction with respect to A.
This is second order.

00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:13.421
Now, as we did last time,
we are going to separate the

00:25:13.421 --> 00:25:16.263
terms.
We are going to take the terms

00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:20.131
that have to do with
concentration and put them on

00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:24.078
one side and put everything else
on the other side,

00:25:24.078 --> 00:25:28.421
including the time terms.
And so here we have rearranged

00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:32.432
things.
We have brought A squared over

00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:35.108
to one side.
We have dA over here.

00:25:35.108 --> 00:25:40.054
We have taken the negative sign
and dt and put it on the other

00:25:40.054 --> 00:25:43.540
side with k.
And so we have these separated.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.756
And now we can integrate.
Again, as we did last time,

00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:52.783
we are going to integrate from
some initial concentration of A,

00:25:52.783 --> 00:25:57.648
the original concentration of
A, to the concentration of A at

00:25:57.648 --> 00:26:01.722
time t.
And, on the other side,

00:26:01.722 --> 00:26:04.942
we are going to go from zero
time to time t.

00:26:04.942 --> 00:26:09.285
And so here is our expression.
And now we can take this and

00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:13.028
solve this expression.
There is just the expression

00:26:13.028 --> 00:26:15.649
again copied to the top of the
page.

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:18.794
We can solve this.
And we get, in brackets,

00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:23.212
one over the concentration of A
at time t minus one over the

00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:27.405
initial concentration of A,
the original concentration of

00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:31.000
A, all in brackets,
with a minus.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.223
And, on the other side,
we have minus kt,

00:26:34.223 --> 00:26:39.140
the rate constant and the time.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.928
Now we can rearrange
this expression.

00:26:42.928 --> 00:26:47.683
Now we want to arrange it such
that the concentration of the

00:26:47.683 --> 00:26:52.116
material at time t is on one
side, we have kt over here,

00:26:52.116 --> 00:26:56.629
and one over the original
concentration of A on the other

00:26:56.629 --> 00:27:00.384
side.
And you will see that this can

00:27:00.384 --> 00:27:03.723
be written in a format for a
straight line.

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:08.174
If we plot information about
how A changes with time and,

00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:12.069
again, with chemical kinetics,
it is all about how

00:27:12.069 --> 00:27:16.202
concentration of things change
with time versus time,

00:27:16.202 --> 00:27:20.733
we can get out information that
we want for a second-order

00:27:20.733 --> 00:27:23.833
equation.
Here is what a plot would look

00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:25.582
like.
You are plotting.

00:27:25.582 --> 00:27:30.722
You're collecting your data.
You are collecting changes of

00:27:30.722 --> 00:27:33.275
concentration of A,
so you are measuring the

00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:35.591
concentration of A at given time
points.

00:27:35.591 --> 00:27:37.492
And so you plot that versus
time.

00:27:37.492 --> 00:27:39.511
And you should get a straight
line.

00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:41.946
If you don't,
something is seriously wrong

00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:43.906
with something that you are
doing.

00:27:43.906 --> 00:27:45.925
So, you should get a straight
line.

00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:49.072
And so the intercept of the
line would be one over the

00:27:49.072 --> 00:27:52.101
initial concentration,
the original concentration of

00:27:52.101 --> 00:27:54.001
A.
And then the slope of the line

00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:57.386
is going to give you your rate
constant, which is what you

00:27:57.386 --> 00:28:03.014
usually want to know.
You want to be measuring rate

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:06.548
constants for particular
reactions.

00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:11.121
Now, let's talk about
second-order half-life.

00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:16.942
We will start with this second
order integrated rate law.

00:28:16.942 --> 00:28:21.827
And now half-life,
you are going to consider the

00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:29.000
time it takes for half of your
original material to go away.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.216
At this point,
when you are talking about

00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:35.592
second-order,
your A(t), your concentration

00:28:35.592 --> 00:28:39.050
of A at time t,
is half the concentration of

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.989
what you had originally here.
We can plug that in.

00:28:42.989 --> 00:28:47.814
The concentration at the time t
that you are interested in is

00:28:47.814 --> 00:28:52.155
now half of what you had to
start with by definition of

00:28:52.155 --> 00:28:55.452
half-life.
Your time now has sort of a new

00:28:55.452 --> 00:28:58.909
symbol by it.
It is t to the half 

00:28:58.909 --> 00:29:04.438
down here.
And now we can rearrange this

00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:08.944
and solve for this.
As we rearrange it,

00:29:08.944 --> 00:29:14.992
we can move the two up there.
And we can bring these

00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:21.158
concentration terms to the same
side of the equation.

00:29:21.158 --> 00:29:26.731
We can subtract now,
which gives us one over the

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:33.519
initial concentration of A.
And then, if we rearrange so

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:39.099
that we solve for the half-life,
we move the rate constant down

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:42.700
over here, and we can get our
expression.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.190
What is the biggest difference
between this expression and the

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:53.410
one for first-order half-life?
Dependence on concentration,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.470
right.
The concentration term is in

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.430
there.
With a first-order process,

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:05.562
the term for concentration is
no longer in the expression.

00:30:05.562 --> 00:30:10.603
The half-life does not depend
on the concentration of the

00:30:10.603 --> 00:30:15.014
original material,
but here the concentration term

00:30:15.014 --> 00:30:19.605
is in the expression.
Second-order half-life depends

00:30:19.605 --> 00:30:23.656
on the starting concentration of
the material.

00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:27.708
If you were really in a lab
doing experiments,

00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:32.479
you often need to figure out if
something is first- or

00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:36.730
second-order.
And in the problem set you will

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.134
have some different things where
you are trying to figure out,

00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:43.260
where I will show you how the
rate changes with different

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.548
concentrations.
And often what you do in a

00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:48.618
laboratory is you plot data and
see whether it does fit.

00:30:48.618 --> 00:30:51.576
I said, if you didn't get a
straight line when you are

00:30:51.576 --> 00:30:53.920
plotting, something is wrong.
In real life,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.930
sometimes you would be plotting
data.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.000
You can plot data as a first
order plot.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.389
Our first order expression was
here.

00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:04.872
The natural log of the
concentration of A at a given

00:31:04.872 --> 00:31:08.969
time is equal to minus kt plus
the natural log of the initial

00:31:08.969 --> 00:31:11.905
concentration.
Here would be a plot of that.

00:31:11.905 --> 00:31:15.865
And then for second order we
would use the equation that we

00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:18.323
just derived.
Instead of natural log,

00:31:18.323 --> 00:31:22.079
you are plotting one over the
concentration versus time.

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:25.425
And if the data really was a
second order process,

00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:30.000
you should get something that
looks good over here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.533
Whereas, over here you should
get something that doesn't

00:31:33.533 --> 00:31:35.460
really look good.
In real life,

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.993
often what you are doing is
seeing how well data fits to

00:31:38.993 --> 00:31:42.912
some assumption that you have.
And you are deciding the orders

00:31:42.912 --> 00:31:45.802
of reaction, you find that out
experimentally.

00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:49.464
It is usually not given to you.
That is something that you

00:31:49.464 --> 00:31:52.419
would be doing.
And you would be looking at how

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:55.760
rates change with time,
and you would be plotting out

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.000
data and seeing how well it fits
your assumptions.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.759
Okay.
Now, we get to go back and

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:08.367
think about, what do rates have
to do with chemical equilibrium?

00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:13.798
What is the connection between
rates and chemical equilibrium?

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:17.002
At equilibrium,
one way we can define

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:22.255
equilibrium is that the rates of
the forward and the reverse

00:32:22.255 --> 00:32:26.261
reactions are equal.
Now we are thinking about

00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:32.943
equilibrium in terms of rates.
I will leave that up,

00:32:32.943 --> 00:32:37.990
I guess.
Let's write out our standard

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.897
reaction.
This chalk is really good.

00:32:42.897 --> 00:32:47.523
No.
Here is a good piece of chalk.

00:32:47.523 --> 00:32:54.813
In our standard reaction,
we have A plus B going to C

00:32:54.813 --> 00:33:00.000
plus D.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.949
And that is how we have been
expressing it.

00:33:03.949 --> 00:33:09.686
Now we are going to think about
rates, so we are going to give

00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:15.141
the forward reaction a little k
one and the backward

00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:18.996
reaction, oh,
I am going to do k minus one.

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:22.194
Over the reverse and the

00:33:22.194 --> 00:33:26.896
backward direction.
Now we can express the rate for

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:31.664
the forward reaction.
And we can assume,

00:33:31.664 --> 00:33:35.456
here, that this is an
elementary reaction.

00:33:35.456 --> 00:33:40.358
We can write our rate law
exactly the way the equation

00:33:40.358 --> 00:33:42.208
looks.
If we do that,

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:46.000
the rate is going to have a
rate constant,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.514
k one.
And it will depend on the

00:33:49.514 --> 00:33:53.583
concentrations of our two
reacting materials,

00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:58.393
so the concentration of A and
the concentration of B.

00:33:58.393 --> 00:34:04.047
We can write this rate law

00:34:04.047 --> 00:34:07.434
without doing any of the
experimental stuff,

00:34:07.434 --> 00:34:11.214
if we are told that it is an
elementary reaction,

00:34:11.214 --> 00:34:14.995
a simple reaction.
We can also write the rate for

00:34:14.995 --> 00:34:18.854
the reverse reaction,
so the reaction going in the

00:34:18.854 --> 00:34:22.319
other direction.
And so that rate law will be

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:26.415
equal to the rate constant for
the reverse direction,

00:34:26.415 --> 00:34:31.140
which is k minus one,
times the concentrations of C

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:35.000
and D.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.500
That is the rate in the reverse
direction.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.000
What do we know about k?
What is big K?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.528
Products over reactants.
C times D over A B.

00:35:01.528 --> 00:35:07.628
That is our equilibrium

00:35:07.628 --> 00:35:10.371
constant.
At equilibrium,

00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:16.657
then, according to this new
definition, the rates of the

00:35:16.657 --> 00:35:23.171
forward reaction will be equal
to the rates of the reverse

00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:26.581
reaction.
At equilibrium,

00:35:26.581 --> 00:35:30.376
k one,
the rate of the forward

00:35:30.376 --> 00:35:36.913
reaction, k one times A times B
is going to be equal to k minus

00:35:36.913 --> 00:35:42.923
one times concentration of C
times the concentration of D.

00:35:42.923 --> 00:35:48.722
That is what happens at

00:35:48.722 --> 00:35:53.044
equilibrium.
Rates of the forward reaction

00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:58.000
equal rates of the reverse
reaction.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.937
Then, if we rearrange that
expression, we will see that

00:36:02.937 --> 00:36:08.788
that means that K is going to be
equal to k one over k minus one.

00:36:08.788 --> 00:36:13.360
Because,
if we rearrange this,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.845
C D divided by A B is going to
be equal to k one divided by k

00:36:18.845 --> 00:36:22.320
minus one.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.165
hese are equal.
You can express K in terms of

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:33.083
the concentrations.
And it is also going to be

00:36:33.083 --> 00:36:36.996
equal to those two rate
constants.

00:36:36.996 --> 00:36:44.110
What does this mean in terms of
our big equilibrium constants

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:51.581
and small equilibrium constants
that we have been talking about?

00:36:51.581 --> 00:36:56.679
In kinetic terms,
when we talk about K being

00:36:56.679 --> 00:37:01.784
greater than one --
Before, when we were talking

00:37:01.784 --> 00:37:04.588
about the equilibrium being
greater than one,

00:37:04.588 --> 00:37:07.901
we were talking about more
products than reactants at

00:37:07.901 --> 00:37:10.578
equilibrium.
And we were not really talking

00:37:10.578 --> 00:37:13.127
anything about the rates of the
reaction.

00:37:13.127 --> 00:37:16.441
What is going to be true in
terms of these small k's,

00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:19.500
k one and k minus one,
if big K,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.196
if the equilibrium constant,
is greater than one,

00:37:23.196 --> 00:37:28.834
what is true about those two?
Here, k one,

00:37:28.834 --> 00:37:36.292
then, has to be greater than k
minus one,

00:37:36.292 --> 00:37:44.348
or the rate constant for the
forward reaction has to be

00:37:44.348 --> 00:37:49.121
bigger.
Rate constant for forward

00:37:49.121 --> 00:37:56.777
reaction is bigger.
And big K, equilibrium constant

00:37:56.777 --> 00:38:03.966
K less than one means
that the rate of the reverse

00:38:03.966 --> 00:38:08.962
reaction, reverse rate constant
is bigger.

00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:15.420
Now you can think about
equilibrium constants in a new

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.197
way.
You can think about them in

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:22.000
kinetic terms.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.162
All right.
Now we are going to go in and

00:38:33.162 --> 00:38:36.648
start talking about mechanisms
of reactions.

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:41.432
And the mechanism is one of the
important things in terms of

00:38:41.432 --> 00:38:45.729
what affects the overall rate.
How many steps does the

00:38:45.729 --> 00:38:48.648
reaction go in?
Are there fast steps?

00:38:48.648 --> 00:38:51.972
Are there slow steps?
How many slow steps?

00:38:51.972 --> 00:38:55.864
How many fast steps?
How long does it really take

00:38:55.864 --> 00:39:00.000
for the reaction as written to
occur?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.560
And so it is unlikely that
reactions take place in one

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.970
step.
That is not too common.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.014
Usually, they proceed through a
series of steps.

00:39:11.014 --> 00:39:14.973
And each step is called an
elementary reaction.

00:39:14.973 --> 00:39:18.673
I have been mentioning
elementary reactions,

00:39:18.673 --> 00:39:23.664
saying that for an elementary
reaction you can write a rate

00:39:23.664 --> 00:39:29.000
law without any data.
You can just write it as is.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.777
That is what you are doing in
terms of mechanisms.

00:39:32.777 --> 00:39:36.863
You will see an overall
reaction and then you will try

00:39:36.863 --> 00:39:41.335
to break it down into steps.
And each step is an elementary

00:39:41.335 --> 00:39:44.188
reaction.
You can write a rate law for

00:39:44.188 --> 00:39:48.891
each step and then think about
whether that reaction mechanism

00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:53.285
makes sense in terms of the data
that is available for the

00:39:53.285 --> 00:39:56.678
overall reaction.
Again, an overall reaction,

00:39:56.678 --> 00:40:00.687
the order and the rate law
cannot be derived from the

00:40:00.687 --> 00:40:05.076
stoichiometry.
You wouldn't necessarily know

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:08.371
if it is first-order with
respect to one thing,

00:40:08.371 --> 00:40:11.450
second-order with respect to
something else,

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:14.387
you cannot do that,
but for the elementary

00:40:14.387 --> 00:40:17.108
reaction, it occurs exactly as
written.

00:40:17.108 --> 00:40:21.047
You have broken it down.
It is an elementary reaction or

00:40:21.047 --> 00:40:23.769
a step.
You have broken it down so that

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:27.421
it is occurring exactly as
written, and then you can

00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:33.690
predict the rate law.
You are sort of breaking down

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:38.400
the mechanism into the simplest
steps.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.599
Let's look at an example for
this.

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:46.927
Here is the decomposition of
ozone.

00:40:46.927 --> 00:40:54.309
You have two molecules over
here reacting to give you three

00:40:54.309 --> 00:41:00.603
molecules of oxygen.
A proposed mechanism then has

00:41:00.603 --> 00:41:03.925
two elementary reactions or two
steps.

00:41:03.925 --> 00:41:09.132
And here, in the first step,
we have one molecule of ozone.

00:41:09.132 --> 00:41:12.992
Are there questions?
It seems kind of noisy.

00:41:12.992 --> 00:41:18.019
One molecule of ozone going to
O, oxygen by itself there,

00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:21.790
plus O two.
This intermediate oxygen

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:26.997
species then comes back and
reacts with ozone again to give

00:41:26.997 --> 00:41:31.127
two molecules of O two.

00:41:31.127 --> 00:41:36.553
The first reaction is called

00:41:36.553 --> 00:41:41.386
unimolecular because there is
only one thing reacting.

00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:45.033
What do you think the next one
is called?

00:41:45.033 --> 00:41:47.768
Right.
It is going to be called

00:41:47.768 --> 00:41:51.051
bimolecular.
Let's put that up there.

00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:54.334
Oh, I guess I should go back to
that.

00:41:54.334 --> 00:41:57.890
All right.
Molecularity is the number of

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:04.000
reactant molecules that come
together to form product.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.331
That is molecularity.
And the second one would be

00:42:07.331 --> 00:42:10.107
bimolecular.
This is another one of those

00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:12.814
questions that can turn up on
the final.

00:42:12.814 --> 00:42:15.313
It is supposed to be the easy
points.

00:42:15.313 --> 00:42:18.367
I ask what the molecularity is,
and you look,

00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:21.352
there is one thing,
it's uni., there are two

00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:25.030
things, it is bimolecular,
but people forget what that

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.807
term means.
That is a good one to kind of

00:42:27.807 --> 00:42:33.496
keep in the back of your head.
That is just a really simple

00:42:33.496 --> 00:42:38.490
extra few points that you can
get on a final to recognize

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.452
those terms.
All right.

00:42:40.452 --> 00:42:44.643
We are not going to get to four
things reacting.

00:42:44.643 --> 00:42:48.923
We will go only as much as
three things reacting.

00:42:48.923 --> 00:42:51.242
Unimolecular,
one reactant.

00:42:51.242 --> 00:42:56.235
An example of that would be
some kind of decomposition or

00:42:56.235 --> 00:42:59.952
radioactive decay.
Bimolecular,

00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:03.923
two things reacting.
Here you would have two things

00:43:03.923 --> 00:43:07.416
coming together,
colliding to form a product.

00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:12.101
And we will talk in the next
few lectures about the energies

00:43:12.101 --> 00:43:15.198
associated with that reaction
occurring.

00:43:15.198 --> 00:43:18.930
And then termolecular.
I give you that that is a

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.980
little bit of a harder one to
remember than the uni.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.632
and bimolecular,
but the termolecular are three

00:43:26.632 --> 00:43:31.000
things coming together to form
products.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.413
As one might imagine,
three things all coming

00:43:34.413 --> 00:43:39.301
together at the exact same time
to form a product sort of in one

00:43:39.301 --> 00:43:41.784
step would be unlikely to
happen.

00:43:41.784 --> 00:43:45.818
These are fairly rare.
Something that is written this

00:43:45.818 --> 00:43:50.318
way, if you see something that
is written as a termolecular

00:43:50.318 --> 00:43:54.663
reaction, you may predict right
away that that is sort of

00:43:54.663 --> 00:44:00.165
unlikely to happen in one step.
Any of you just trying to get a

00:44:00.165 --> 00:44:04.218
group of friends together to do
something at the same time,

00:44:04.218 --> 00:44:07.991
knowing that getting three
people together at the exact

00:44:07.991 --> 00:44:11.484
same time to something that you
are planning to do,

00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:15.537
it is rare that everyone is
actually there at the same time

00:44:15.537 --> 00:44:18.192
to start.
You can remember that that is

00:44:18.192 --> 00:44:22.524
sort of a rare thing to happen.
But if three things did come to

00:44:22.524 --> 00:44:24.829
react, that would be
termolecular.

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:27.484
All right.
Now we can consider the rate

00:44:27.484 --> 00:44:31.403
laws for each step.
And because these are

00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:34.476
elementary reactions or steps to
the reactions,

00:44:34.476 --> 00:44:38.218
you can write the rate law
exactly from the reaction that

00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:42.293
is happening exactly as written.
You can use the stoichiometry

00:44:42.293 --> 00:44:45.768
to consider the rate law.
Let's look at the first one

00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:48.040
then.
The rate is going to be equal

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.848
to this k one term,
the rate constant for step one,

00:44:51.848 --> 00:44:55.256
or k one times the
reactant, which is O three,

00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:57.661
the concentration of O
three.

00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:02.272
That is the rate law for the

00:45:02.272 --> 00:45:04.787
forward direction.
In this case,

00:45:04.787 --> 00:45:08.115
there is no reverse direction
to consider.

00:45:08.115 --> 00:45:11.767
We only have this rate law for
the first step.

00:45:11.767 --> 00:45:15.824
In the second step,
then, we have the rate equals k

00:45:15.824 --> 00:45:20.693
two, so that is the rate
constant for the second step.

00:45:20.693 --> 00:45:25.643
And, in some of your problems,
you might not have these in the

00:45:25.643 --> 00:45:28.565
book.
You should use k one for

00:45:28.565 --> 00:45:32.951
the first step.
If there is a reverse reaction,

00:45:32.951 --> 00:45:36.538
that should be k minus one,
k two for the

00:45:36.538 --> 00:45:40.125
second step, if there was a
reverse reaction it would be k

00:45:40.125 --> 00:45:41.636
minus two,
etc.

00:45:41.636 --> 00:45:44.027
Again, these do not have
reverse steps,

00:45:44.027 --> 00:45:46.545
so we don't have to worry about
this yet.

00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:50.195
You will see more of these on
Wednesday on the problem set.

00:45:50.195 --> 00:45:54.034
Here, the rate is k two times
the concentration of O times the

00:45:54.034 --> 00:45:58.000
concentration of O three.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.170
We can write those exactly as
written, because those are

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.886
elementary steps in an overall
reaction mechanism.

00:46:05.886 --> 00:46:10.360
We could not write the rate law
for this, if it has multiple

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.227
steps, without experimental data
to help us do that.

00:46:14.227 --> 00:46:18.170
Then, the individual steps
should be able to be added

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.203
together to get the reaction in
question.

00:46:21.203 --> 00:46:23.933
And so here,
if we add this together,

00:46:23.933 --> 00:46:28.407
we have two O threes
and we have three O twos.

00:46:28.407 --> 00:46:32.189
And the O has canceled out.

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:35.351
That is an intermediate in the
reaction.

00:46:35.351 --> 00:46:38.027
O here is a reaction
intermediate.

00:46:38.027 --> 00:46:42.891
And the big trick in writing
reaction mechanisms and figuring

00:46:42.891 --> 00:46:47.351
out rate laws for overall
reactions up here is to cancel

00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:51.324
out intermediates.
You are going to spend the next

00:46:51.324 --> 00:46:55.540
few days getting ready for the
problem set on Friday,

00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.000
getting rid of intermediates in
reactions.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.048
It doesn't appear in the
overall reaction equation and it

00:47:04.048 --> 00:47:07.879
cannot appear in any of your
rate laws that define the

00:47:07.879 --> 00:47:10.337
particular reaction.
Just, finally,

00:47:10.337 --> 00:47:14.168
this is the last slide,
that reaction mechanisms are a

00:47:14.168 --> 00:47:17.421
series of steps.
Reaction mechanisms can never

00:47:17.421 --> 00:47:21.108
be proven to be correct.
They just can be consistent

00:47:21.108 --> 00:47:24.000
with data.
You are going to be predicting

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.975
reactions that are consistent
with the data on this next

00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:30.385
problem set.
Okay.

00:47:30.385 --> 00:47:31.385
Thanks.
