00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.610
The size and the shape base of
organization in Asian cities

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.820
has drastically transformed
the physical and socioeconomic

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.390
landscape.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.800
Urban population in East Asia
have increased 3% per year

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.028
while urban land expansion
reached 2.4% per year.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.920
This strain is intensifying
and has destroyed many places

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.670
of historical significance.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.510
Demand for real
estate development

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.780
has turned traditional villages
into modern high rise buildings

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.300
that are disconnected from
the lifestyles of existing

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.930
inhabitants.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.610
In many cases,
communities have not

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.060
been involved in the
process of deciding

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.620
how development should proceed.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.550
This video presents
how a Malay community

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.220
in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia responds

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.180
to a recent redevelopment effort
of their village Kampong Bharu.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.220
The concerns and aspiration
of the long-term residents,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.090
land owners, and
community leaders

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
were documented to identify
their vision of the future

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.430
of the urban village.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.340
Kampong Bharu sits in the
heart of the Kuala Lumpur

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.510
metropolitan region.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.270
A kampong is defined
as a Malay village

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.070
or locality with
10,000 or fewer people

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.816
under the leadership
of Village Heads.

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.550
Kampong Bharu was
formed in the early 1900

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.070
when His Royal Highness,
the Sultan of Sulaiman,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.900
granted the land to the Malay's
under a special condition

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980
that the land could only be
owned by the Malay people.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.410
The 223 acre Malay
agricultural settlement

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.000
survived under British Colonial
rule and Japanese occupation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.760
As a Malay enclave,
traditional Malay houses,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.770
microscale businesses,
local food and delicacies

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.430
has shaped its unique character.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.090
As Kuala Lumpur develops,
the 116 year old kampong

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.430
is now surrounded by high
rise structure, including

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.720
the iconic Petronas Tower
and modern office buildings.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.460
Despite piecemeal
development and extension

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.020
of commercial and
residential units,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.810
the kampong still looks
similar to its early years.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.180
Meanwhile, with only 35% of the
original residents remaining,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.770
the area has become occupied
mainly by immigrants.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.150
With the rising
land value, the area

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.940
has been subjected to the
real state development

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.560
scheme that would maximize
the economic potential

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.120
of the properties.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.470
However, redevelopment
efforts have

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.340
been futile due to the issues
of multiple land ownership, land

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.930
price disparities,
and resistance

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.560
from residents and land owners.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.280
The initiative to redevelop
the land resurfaced in 2012.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.860
With a strong commitment
from the government,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.630
a comprehensive
development master plan

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.370
was prepared by the Kampong
Bharu Development Corporation.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.410
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.930
Under parliamentary Act 733,
Kampong Bharu Development

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.220
Corporation was
established the facilitate

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.300
the development of the area.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.950
The vision is to develop and
to transform the real estate

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.430
in creating a better living
standard while balancing

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.280
the requirement of
preserving Kampong Bharu

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.430
historical values,
culture, and legacy.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.756
With a mission that
no land owner or heir

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:09.990
of Kampong Bharu land will be
left behind in this development

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.080
beyond 2020.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.910
Inspired by the Malay
and Islamic culture,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.670
the master plan seeks to
ensure holistic, inclusive,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.130
and balanced planning that
benefits the key stakeholders.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.810
Recent visits indicate that
transformation of Kampong Bharu

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.090
is now underway.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.670
But how do the community
leaders, land owners,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.580
and residents respond to
the redevelopment plan?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.750
What are their aspiration for
the future of the village?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.440
Will the local community
benefit from early development?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.120
Zamri Mohd Saharin,
the deputy director

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.590
of urban planning of Kampong
Bharu Redevelopment Corporation

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.917
said that the change would offer
economic and social benefits.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:55.750
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.770
Despite the advantage mentioned,
the Kampong Bharu community

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.460
is struggling to come to terms
with redevelopment plans.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.260
As the skepticism and
resistance persist,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.410
understanding the
aspiration of the community

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.010
may shed light on the
community's concern.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.260
Conversation with the
land owners, residents,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.860
and community leaders
of Kampong Bharu

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.270
highlight that various
concern and expectations.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.640
Land owners embrace the idea
of change and redevelopment

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.010
as long as it
conforms to the needs

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.090
and aspiration of the Malays.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.210
The economic sustainability
and the continuity

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.350
of social and cultural
identity of the Malays

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.720
were the main concern
regarding the development.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.000
The Village Heads
had their own views

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.801
on how the future of
Kampong Bharu should be.

00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:19.274
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.640
Several land owners insisted
that the development

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.690
should reflect the Malay
Islamic character and values

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.227
in a modern form.

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:29.060
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.358
Islamic and Malay city center.

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:39.334
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.800
A Malay town.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.440
And the first of its
kind in the whole world.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.020
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.730
New development should
bring about positive change

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.818
for a community.

00:07:50.818 --> 00:07:53.615
The land owners realize
the need to improve

00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:56.660
the socioeconomic
status of the Malays,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.180
but they were not convinced
that the development

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.470
could benefit the community.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.770
The chairman of the
Secretariat of Trade

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.220
and Businesses of Kampong
Bharu expressed his concern

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.020
about the
redevelopment approach.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.511
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.780
On the other hand, a
Malay real state developer

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.580
was confident that the
Malay will reap the benefit.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.150
The need is to have
suitable business model

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.820
to convince the land owners.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.235
[INAUDIBLE] incentive.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:04.133
Once we have incentive, that
mean the owner [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:07.031
will get advantage
as a land owner

00:09:07.031 --> 00:09:10.895
when you want to value land.

00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:13.310
Both land owners and
community leaders

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.890
want that their interest
to be safeguarded

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.950
and their voices to be heard.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.250
They insisted that
their rights to plan

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.230
the future of the kampong should
be acknowledged and integrated

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.520
in the planning and
decision making process.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.190
They have to follow
the [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.092
the voice of the
people of [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:32.092 --> 00:09:32.925
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.720
Dr. Shuhana Shamsuddin, a
professor in urban design,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.810
shared her thoughts
on the way forward

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.240
in transforming the place.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.690
The future development
of Kampong Bharu

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.679
will be more realistic
if they were to push it

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.820
on an incremental basis.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.070
But this will be done when
and if the owners are ready.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.680
If plans proceed,
Kampong Bharu will be

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.150
transformed on a massive scale.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.080
While the redevelopment
is designed

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.940
for economic and
social sustainability,

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.840
it may, in the end, benefit few.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.550
Without a collective
agreement from engaged members

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.180
of the community, the roadmap
to a sustainable future

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.660
of the kampong
remains uncertain.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.270
Despite the challenge,
sustainability

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.850
of an urban village
is hinged on adapting

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.000
to change while securing
the economic, social,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.640
and cultural values
of the place.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.370
The impact of the
redevelopment depends

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.800
on how people are
informed about and engaged

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.230
in the education of economic
and social benefits.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.260
Giving greater
voice to the people

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.790
is such [INAUDIBLE]
villages could better

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.690
align city
redevelopment objective

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.210
with the interests and
values of people living

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.840
in the traditional enclave.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.010
The road to a
sustainable development

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.950
could be paved
effectively by integrating

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.550
the principle for inclusive
urban development,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.510
adopting a place specific
planning approach,

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.400
considering rights
and ownership issues,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.290
planning for equity
and community benefits,

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.440
and empowering community
through public participation

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.870
and engagement.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.870
A framework for
future development

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.930
should allow for a place
to transform naturally

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.310
according to the current
needs and aspiration

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.620
of the local inhabitants.
