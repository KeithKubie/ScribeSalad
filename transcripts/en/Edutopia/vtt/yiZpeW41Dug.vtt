00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The average American
young person spends more than six

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.846
and a half hours in front of
some sort of screen each day.

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:21.906
Surfing the web, watching
TV, and playing games.

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:26.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, when
you have a novel--

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Yet, most schools treat
the written word as the only means

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:34.466
of communication worthy of
study, and as a consequence,

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:37.966
students remain poorly equipped
to think critically about,

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.276
and express themselves through, the
media they are immersed in every day.

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:46.526
&gt;&gt;George: We stress so
hard learning English,

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:51.466
and learning English grammar,
and then we shove music and art

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:55.186
over into some sort of
artistic, which means,

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:57.406
sort of therapeutic or fun thing.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:02.476
It's not approached as a very
valid form of communication.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:06.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In a recent interview,
filmmaker George Lucas spoke

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:09.876
about the need to rethink the way
we teach communication skills.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:12.856
&gt;&gt;George: So we go through
school, and then, later on we start

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:17.356
to learn the grammar of English, you
know, punctuation, capital letters,

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:23.486
you know, run on sentences, what a
verb is, but nobody teaches anybody

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:29.296
about what screen direction is,
what perspective is, what color is,

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:31.406
what a diagonal line means.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.036
Those are rules, those
are grammatical rules.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:38.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The teaching of
those rules and other facets

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:41.346
of media literacy, is
gradually gaining traction

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:42.956
in schools across the country.

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:47.406
Every state now incorporates
aspects of media education

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.616
in its core curricular framework.

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:51.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Media literacy,
living with media,

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:53.566
and there was something
else there that I missed.

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:54.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Visual and verbal message.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Visual and verbal message.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:59.626
&gt;&gt; Narrator: At the Greater Brunswick
Charter School, in New Jersey,

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:03.866
media analysis is part of a
class project on gender roles.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:04.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's the difference

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:06.866
between the male and
female images here?

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.756
We've been looking at movies
for the last couple of weeks.

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:09.426
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.556
&gt;&gt;Student: I guess you can say
lighter colors are more feminine,

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:16.356
the way they're advertising it there,
and the darker colors are for men.

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:17.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: But why?

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:20.826
&gt;&gt;Robert: This idea of a
longer sustained project

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.596
that kids get invested
in for a period of time,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:28.766
a project that has a lot of different
elements to it, jibes really well

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:31.456
with a lot of the goals of
media literacy, because we want

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:34.396
for students to realize that there
are all kinds of nodes being pushed,

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:37.736
all kinds of different aspects
to what they're learning about

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:40.286
and what they're addressing
when they make media,

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:41.896
or they think about media.

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:45.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Sit up tall, and I want
you to focus your eyes, your ears

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:50.026
and your hearts on what you're
about to see, hear and feel.

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:56.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the Jacob Burns Film
Center, in Pleasantville, New York,

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.456
third graders are introduced
to the basic grammar

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:02.226
and techniques of filmmaking.

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:05.826
&gt;&gt;Steve: We were always educated to
read actively, yet we're conditioned

00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:07.646
to view visual images passively.

00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:09.176
And that's something
that we hope to change.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Burns Center programs
serve some 8,000 area students.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:17.416
&gt;&gt;Steve: We understood that
it is critically important

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:21.516
to help kids understand that these
are stories being told to them.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:24.086
And to understand the techniques
in which stories are told,

00:03:24.086 --> 00:03:26.636
to understand the language of film.

00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:32.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth graders learn
how to produce animated shorts.

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.236
&gt;&gt;Character: Cat overboard!

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:41.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And high school
students create video biographies

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:43.596
of seniors in the community.

00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:46.106
&gt;&gt;Steve: To gain the tools,
to gain the techniques,

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:47.656
the understanding, the grammar.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.846
To then be able to take
that and apply that,

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:53.806
not only to a film they
see, from Denmark or Iran,

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:57.546
or these animated films that
they start with, but to apply it

00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:02.116
to the seven o'clock news, to apply
it to the advertising that they see,

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:06.726
to apply it to the internet sites
that they go on, and the webcasts.

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:09.836
&gt;&gt;Janet: A lot of what people are
exposed to in terms of information

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:12.696
that is critically important to how
they're going to live their lives,

00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:14.916
has to do with news media coverage.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:19.246
And I don't think they often
understand the comparative versions

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:22.156
of what they're being shown, the
choices that are made with each shot,

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:26.456
the propaganda value,
the subliminal value,

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:30.656
and if we do nothing else here,
we're going to teach kids how

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:34.856
to see more deeply into that, and how
to be able to speak for themselves

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:36.066
in the same kind of language.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I have a
list of questions here,

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.906
not all of them apply to every photo.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:44.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the Ascend
School in Oakland, California,

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:46.776
seventh graders studying
the war in Iraq,

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.936
learned to dissect local
newspaper coverage.

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.626
&gt;&gt;Teacher: In this photo,
who do you identify with?

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:54.866
&gt;&gt;Student: The Iraqi civilian.

00:04:55.206 --> 00:04:57.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The Iraqi civilian.

00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:02.206
What other kinds of things
do you think you might think?

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:04.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I realize this.

00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:08.076
It's like, if you look at
this picture, you feel sorry

00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:10.996
for the soldiers, and that kind of
makes you want to support the war,

00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:14.536
but then if you look at this picture,
you feel sorry for the Iraqi,

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:18.526
and that makes you think
that the war isn't necessary.

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:22.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the North East School
of the Arts in San Antonio, Texas,

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:25.566
students hone their writing
skills by telling stories

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:27.796
in their second language, film.

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:30.916
&gt;&gt;Student: Well I was
thinking about making a film

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.236
about two brothers attending
their father's funeral.

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:35.366
And--

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:36.846
&gt;&gt;George: Everybody
is affected by this,

00:05:36.846 --> 00:05:38.706
and it should be taught in school.

00:05:38.836 --> 00:05:41.596
You would find it in terms of
understanding screen direction,

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:45.546
and what a close up is, and a wide
shot, and why you use them, and how--

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.726
what order you use them in.

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:49.976
It's just as fascinating
to them, and actually,

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.826
it makes English much
more fascinating.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.476
&gt;&gt;George: As a matter of fact,
you know what would be cool.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:57.466
Take a look at Macbeth, and just
read the text, and specifically look

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:02.006
for Lady Macbeth, and
then look at the tone.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:05.876
&gt;&gt;What they should learn in the
class, is how to think, how to write,

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:12.236
how to think logically, and how
to be a well rounded individual.

00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:14.746
It showed up in this case,
in the context of filmmaking,

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:18.266
but that's the hook,
that's the bait to kind

00:06:18.266 --> 00:06:19.616
of get them moving in that direction.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's a transition?

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:25.586
&gt;&gt;Student: Transitions are like,
you can fade in and fade out, and--

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As courses and
projects featuring elements

00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:31.736
of media literacy find their way
into more and more classrooms,

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:35.966
writing English might become just
one of several forms of expression,

00:06:36.236 --> 00:06:39.036
along with graphics,
cinema and music,

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:42.926
to be taught in a basic
course called communication.

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.956
&gt;&gt;George: The basic grammar

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:48.376
of communicating should be taught
basically in the communication class.

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.406
It shouldn't be taught in
some esoteric arty thing,

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:56.196
it should be taught as a very
practical tool that you use to sell

00:06:56.196 --> 00:07:01.486
and influence people and to get your
point across, and to communicate

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:05.726
to other people, especially in
this age, where kids are more

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:07.186
and more using multimedia.

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:07.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Jeffrey?

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:09.706
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Are we going
to have enough room

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.746
for the whole web page
just on that one line?

00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:11.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We will.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:15.276
