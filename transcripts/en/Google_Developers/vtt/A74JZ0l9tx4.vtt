00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.060
My name is Jarek Wilkiwicz, and
I'm here with JJ Behrens.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.510
JJ BEHRENS: Hey, nice
to see you.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Nice seeing you.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.410
Long time, no see.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.730
JJ BEHRENS: I think
since lunch.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Exactly.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.680
And today, we'll talk about
YouTube for your Business,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.950
which is a webinar that JJ
recently published on YouTube.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.530
So we have a couple of questions
for you, JJ.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.350
You ready?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.300
JJ BEHRENS: I hope so.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, so the
first question is, I watched

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.250
this seminar.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.980
It's very interesting, but
I never knew what was

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.009
going to come next.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280
So you cover a lot of ground.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.090
What triggered you to actually
create a seminar that covers

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.830
so much ground in 15 minutes?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.170
JJ BEHRENS: Well, considering
you've given this talk like

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.210
umpteen billion times,
trying to surprise

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240
you is pretty hard.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.860
I had this idea that I wanted
to start with very

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.480
nontechnical examples
and then migrate to

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.090
very technical examples.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.460
And all along the way, I want
to show you something, talk

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.000
about it, show you how I did
it, and then give you a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.270
take-home message.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.940
And so that's really
where it's at.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630
And I really kind of did want
to surprise the user.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.380
Because there's so many
different ways

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.360
you could use YouTube.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.070
I wanted to keep
them guessing.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That
makes sense.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.920
You definitely had
me guessing.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.770
So question about some of the
content that you covered.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.140
I really like the video "New
Dork." It's timeless.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.110
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I have
to watch it daily.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Exactly.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.130
I think it definitely put me
in the right state of mind.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.230
JJ BEHRENS: Absolutely.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I didn't quite
get the part when you

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.220
talked about how Grasshopper
benefits from having published

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.800
a video on YouTube.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.790
How do people know that hey,
this is Grasshopper, or this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.090
is the product that's
being advertised?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.290
All I see is an awesome artist
and his backup singer equally,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.550
if not more awesome.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.380
And how do I actually make the
connection with Grasshopper?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.200
JJ BEHRENS: She was pretty
awesome, wasn't she?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.760
Yeah, Grasshopper--

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.280
well, it works a couple
different ways.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.250
So there's metadata
for the video.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.440
And so the metadata has a
link to grasshopper.com.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.510
And there's also basically ad
placement in the video for

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.600
grasshopper.com.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.930
And those two things together
are basically a great way to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.980
spread the message of
grasshopper.com.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.580
And the greatest thing
about this is that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.550
it goes viral, right?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.380
I can't stop watching that
video, because I love watching

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.860
that guy sing about random
things and show pictures of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.770
famous people in
the background.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.320
So it's like awesomely
free advertising.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
is the metadata.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.940
Something that they have to pay
for, or how does the user

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.110
actually encounter the
link to grasshopper?

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.620
JJ BEHRENS: No, it's free.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.140
And when you upload a video to
YouTube, you can pick your own

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.830
description and so forth, and
you can embed whatever you

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.650
want in the video, to some
degree, of course.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.890
We have rules, but--

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the URL to
Grasshopper is basically in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.490
the description, and that's
what drives the referral

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.290
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah,
that's right.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Got it.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.390
OK, great.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020
Another video that
you showed is the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.890
original skateboards video.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.400
So I was wondering, how are
you skateboarding skills?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.380
JJ BEHRENS: Well, you can't
see it, because

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.390
it's below the table.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.190
But I have scars all over
my body, which--

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.860
it's not pretty.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.280
So definitely--

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Not so good?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.100
JJ BEHRENS: Not so good.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what type
of skateboard do you have or

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.400
are you planning to buy in the
near future [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.790
JJ BEHRENS: So I was
a street skater.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.920
I did a little bit of downhill
as a kid, which results in

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.200
lots of long scars with
heavy scarring flesh.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.860
But yeah, I suck at
skateboarding.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.500
I was glad to finally discover
programming, because I was

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.140
finally good at that.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.140
Maybe you should just watch
that video instead.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.000
JJ BEHRENS: I know.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.960
That video makes me want
to buy a skateboard.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.835
I'll tell you that much.

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:42.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Definitely.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.420
Definitely.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.710
So you talk about YouTube Direct
and how this product,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.470
open source project, it's
great for soliciting

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.370
user-generated content.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.050
So the question I have, since
this is a talk about YouTube

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.460
for your Business , is suppose
I'm not a developer.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.490
How do I deploy it?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.800
And then how much time
would it take me?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.640
Can you tell me a little more
about what's involved in

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.800
actually getting it set
up for business?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.080
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, so YouTube
Direct is not the easiest

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.950
thing to set up.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.360
I mean, if you go through the
instructions, it walks you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.060
through setting up Eclipse.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.930
And as soon as you say Eclipse,
you're going to lose

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.959
30% of developers out there.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.250
But we have a session coming up
at Google I/O that somehow

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.870
talks about this thing called
YouTube Direct Light.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.040
And I'm just guessing--

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.900
I don't know for certain, but
I'm guessing that that Light

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.860
means something, and that it
might be easier for people

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.850
going forward.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if you are
a developer, what skills

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.800
do we need to have in order
to get it all done?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.230
What are all the major pieces
that you need to be familiar

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.380
with in order to deploy it?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.210
JJ BEHRENS: So to deploy YouTube
direct, I mean, you

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.350
don't actually have to alter
any source code.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.130
You basically--

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.810
it's a Java application, and
it uses Google App Engine.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.210
And so you don't actually have
to do any coding to set it up.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.040
It was fairly hard to set up for
people who weren't coders

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.910
at all, didn't know how to
do things with clips and

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.850
installing the right
applications.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.340
I think it's going to get even
easier in the future, and I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.690
think we're going to get to a
situation where you don't have

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.510
to be a developer at all.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I
hear YouTube Direct

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.410
is written in Java.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.310
JJ BEHRENS: Yep.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.740
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what
do you think about that?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.220
JJ BEHRENS: Well, you know,
there's a lot of people who

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.300
really like Java.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.130
That's what I think
about that.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's a very
diplomatic answer, JJ.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.770
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What
happened to you?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.520
JJ BEHRENS: Well,
you know, I--

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is it late in
the day, or you didn't have

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.790
your caffeine yet, or
what's going on?

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.510
JJ BEHRENS: Well, I
am a Python guy

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.910
and a Ruby guy, so--

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, I
tried to get you going.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.170
JJ BEHRENS: Jeez.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.990
Are we going to go into Emacs
versus vi as well?

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Maybe next time.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.260
OK, good.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.330
So sounds like it's really not
that big of a deal, as long as

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.870
you have some skills
and you know how

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.945
to use the App Engine.

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:46.810
JJ BEHRENS: That's right.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.890
So you talked about coffee
table applications.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.180
So my question is, are these
applications spill-proof?

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.300
JJ BEHRENS: Well, that's
a great question.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.630
So I should first start off with
explaining what a coffee

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.460
table application is.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.790
So tablets are pretty popular
these days, and 955 Dreams is

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.560
a company that has a few
different applications,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.560
including The History of Jazz
and Band of the Day.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.090
And these applications
are just beautiful.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.320
You just want to
play with them.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.670
It's like you pick it up, and
you're like, I want to play

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.230
with this thing.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.750
And so there's this idea
that you just put these

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.020
applications on a tablet, and
you leave them on your coffee

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.040
table, whereas in the past we
used to have art books on your

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.800
coffee table.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.290
And people will come over and
visit, start playing with the

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.990
application.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.020
And it's just a really
neat experience.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.050
Now, as to whether they're spill
proof, you know, I think

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.790
you have an iPad.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.040
We could try it out.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How about
we use your tablet?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.830
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, well,
you know.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: If I want to
learn more about these types

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.531
of apps, where can I find
more information?

00:06:58.531 --> 00:06:59.780
JJ BEHRENS: I'm not
actually sure.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.680
I mean, I guess you could go
check out 955 Dreams' Apps,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.590
and just try them out.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.620
That's the best I could say.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.280
I mean, I really like
Band of the Day.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.000
I think that that's a really
compelling app.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.310
I asked him, how do you
guys come up with

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.190
such beautiful apps?

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.350
And he says, well,
we go completely

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.150
custom from day one.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.250
They decide not to do
native widgets.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.690
They completely build their
UI from scratch.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.630
And he says, that's
what we do to make

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.130
things extremely beautiful.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.570
Band of the Day has this
beautiful calendar with the

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.820
artwork for the artist
in the background.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.530
And I don't know, those guys
have something I don't have.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.250
Design skills.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think
you're pretty stylish.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.590
So you talk about OAuth2.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.340
And I think--

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.150
again, this is a talk,
talks about

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.000
YouTube for your business.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.010
OAuth2 is something that sounds
a little scary to an

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.850
average user.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.080
Why not use username
and passwords?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.640
What's wrong with that?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.870
Can you just ask people to type
in their credentials and

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.370
be done with it?

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.440
This is how things have been
done for many years, right?

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.950
So is it really necessary?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.650
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, so it turns
out that client login, which

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.650
uses a username and password,
has a bunch of different

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.010
failure modes.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.290
And because of all those
different failure modes, we've

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.940
actually deprecated it.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.380
So the nice thing about OAuth2
is that it allows an

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.190
application to do things on
your behalf without you

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.700
sharing your username
and password.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.820
So that makes it a lot
more secure world.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is it more
difficult to program?

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.340
Say I'm a developer.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.980
I want to use the YouTube API.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.710
And I know a client login.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.120
I know username and passwords.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.840
What do I need to do to actually
integrate OAuth?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.870
JJ BEHRENS: So I think that
there's a couple different

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.010
things that are helpful to do.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.030
The first is that we
have really good

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.100
documentation on this.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.820
I'm always amazed at how good
Andy is at writing our tech

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.320
docs for YouTube.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.440
So he has this one-page thing
that explains OAuth2.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.030
I read that, and I
didn't understand

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.030
anything before that.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.750
And I read that, and it all
made sense after that.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.380
We also have an OpenID demo,
which is very related and

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.930
shows you all the
different steps.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.890
And you walk through that,
and it explains it.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.120
And also, the client libraries
tend to have samples of how to

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.730
do this stuff.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:23.120
And so when I did my other
webinar based on Ruby on

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.600
Rails, I actually took source
code from the client library,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.110
and it walked me through all
the different parts.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.640
And so yeah, there is
some learning curve.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.730
But it's worth it.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what does
the Auth stand for in OAuth?

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.330
JJ BEHRENS: I could never tell
if it's authentication or

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.790
authorization, but I think it's
a little bit of both.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.650
I think it's authorization.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think
it stands for oh, man.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.560
JJ BEHRENS: Oh man, yeah.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.150
And the two.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.770
So you mentioned Google I/O, and
this is where I'm going to

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.800
try to get you to leak stuff,
because I know leaking is

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.160
something that you never do.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.010
And I always want to get
some more information.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.540
So which feature from the
features that we're going to

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.230
be launching at Google I/O for
YouTube, which one gets you

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.980
most excited?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.390
JJ BEHRENS: Well, jeez.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.250
Are we talking about most
excited in terms of ones that

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.420
I'm going to use, or most
excited in terms of ones that

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.550
I'm afraid that other people in
the company might not let

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.521
us talk about?

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.833
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Now you're
getting too tricky, I think.

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:29.805
So which ones are you
going to use?

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:32.820
JJ BEHRENS: Well, we have a talk
where we're talking about

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.110
the new YouTube Direct Light.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.310
And it talks about soliciting
videos from your users.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.730
And I've seen that talk, of
course, in rehearsal, and I'm

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.840
super excited about this.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.060
I think this is going
to be a big deal.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.270
In fact, I would have to say
this is pure dead brilliant.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:53.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.700
So for folks that have watched
the YouTube for Your Business,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.620
what are the next steps?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.980
If I want to learn more, I want
to use YouTube for my

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.940
business, if I want to
advertise, if I want to build

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.730
application developers, where
do I go to find more

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.180
information about all the
different places?

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.280
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, so there's a
bunch of different directions

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.870
you could go.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:21.160
This talk kind of straddles the
middle, but once you start

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.520
in the middle, you have to walk
in a certain direction.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.510
So if you're a content owner,
and you're doing your own

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.010
sitcoms or something like that,
you probably want to go

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.840
to youtube.com/partner and
become a content partner.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.260
Now, if you're an application
developer, you want to learn

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.030
more about using the
YouTube API.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.610
So you could go to
youtube.com/dev.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.900
Either way, there's going to be
a lot of videos at Google

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.320
I/O, and you could watch all
of those different videos.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.270
And we're going to be having
them online after I/O, just in

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.780
case you can't make it to I/O.
And I think once you watch all

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.370
those different videos, you'll
know where to go next.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.380
Thanks, JJ.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.110
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, why thank you.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.610
And I'm just so happy that the
interns over there on the

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.850
couch stopped making
funny faces.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.090
I was going to crack up in the
middle of the talk, but now

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.744
we're almost done.

00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:09.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.270
I think this is all
the questions

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.630
that we have received.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.450
JJ BEHRENS: OK, thanks a lot,
guys, for watching.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.170
And for those of you that will
see us at Google I/O, we

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.320
really appreciate
your feedback.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.740
And talk to you later.
