00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.330
President Yudhoyono: Thank you,
Professor Sachs, for your nice word of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.349
introductions. Excellencies, distinguished

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.390
guests, friends, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.859
thank you, Professor Sachs, for giving
me the opportunity to share with your

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.750
distinguished colleagues and guests my

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.119
thoughts about the Millennium

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.030
Development Goals. One of the most difficult
things to do these days is to say

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.860
something important about the Millennium

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.780
Development Goals and the problems

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.690
of poverty that has not already been said
or written by Professor Sachs. Having

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.939
said that, I wish to begin by quoting

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.290
a few familiar statistics that are grim enough

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.549
to bear repeating any time. Despite the
abundance of the world as a whole,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.220
there are still 1.1 billion people living

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.500
in extreme poverty.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.210
Nearly 3 billion live on less than $2

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.000
a day. Some 1.3 billion people have no

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.690
access to clean water. Three billion have
no sanitation. Two billion have no

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.780
access to electricity and close to one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.630
billion entered the twenty-first century

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.630
unable to read or write. But the most
startling statistic is the number of people

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.570
who die every year because they are too

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.810
poor to live: eight million, enough to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.810
populate a sizable national capital. It
is said that statistics do not bleed, but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.450
when

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.380
they are as horrible as this you have
to pause and think. And apart from that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.640
when you see those video clips on TV of

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.659
skeletal babies in the throes of helpless

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.739
hunger your humanity is challenged.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.739
You cannot avert your eyes. Attention

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.430
must be paid; actions must be taken. And

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.659
yet it took many years and many major
U.N. conferences and summits before the

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.620
world community found a way of taking

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.769
concrete actions. At the millennium

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.269
summit of September 2000, in New York,
the heads of state and representatives

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.569
of 189 governments finally adopted the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.379
Millennium Declaration and its agenda for

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.650
development. That agenda, called the Millennium
Development Goals, are

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.139
actually all about human development and

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.180
how the human race would make a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.180
journey out of poverty. Much has happened
since then. What the (Inaudible)

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.319
deprecated as just another U.N. declaration

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.989
turned out to be far from being just

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:20.989
business as usual.

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.189
We knew how serious was the U.N. system

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.739
on this matter when the Secretary

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.969
General set up the Millennium Project
and had it chaired by Professor Sachs to

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.349
help countries towards their MDGs. U.N.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.669
agencies and other multilateral

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:47.079
institutions have given top priority to
helping countries attain their MDGs. Many

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.879
governments have successfully integrated

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.349
MDG target into national development

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.379
planning and public investment strategies.
But there is a great deal of global

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.089
(inaudible) today's massive effort. Financial

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.199
flows for development are

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:12.939
insufficient and are moreover often flowing
in the wrong directions. We do not

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.859
have an international trading regime that

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.109
can effectively open up markets for the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.400
exports of developing countries.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.590
Some developed countries that can make

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.780
a real difference between success and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.430
failure in this grand endeavor do not
have a genuine sense of partnership with

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.870
the developing world. In the Asia Pacific

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.159
region it can be said that there has

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:45.449
been real progress towards the achievement
of the goals. Alongside their robust

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.449
economic growth that took place in some

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.319
countries, the region has sounds of the

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.330
fastest-growing economies in the world
with high domestic saving and plenty of

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.300
international results. Yet the promise

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.479
of the MDGs remains out of the reach of

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:09.210
millions. Many countries in the region
lack the institutional capacity to take

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.430
appropriate action towards these goals.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.740
They have limited capacity to deliver

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.389
efficiently and equitably the basic services
needed to improve the overall quality

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.110
of life of their people.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.900
Those, despite a dramatically reduction

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.639
of poverty, the region is still home to

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.639
more than 700 million people languishing
in extreme destitution. That is about 70

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.819
percent of the world's poor. Malnutrition

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.659
persists among 400 million people in the

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:54.229
Asia Pacific. Two of every three Asians
have no access to safe drinking water.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.939
Of every two Asians, one has no access

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.719
to adequate sanitation facilities. And

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:09.060
this is the region to which the 21st century
is supposed to belong. Women and

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.389
children, especially in the rural areas,

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.879
are still often overlooked. They should

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:20.229
now have access to basic healthcare, education
and economic resources.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.030
Pockets of poverty that are the result

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.879
of uneven progress should be identified and

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:35.870
acted upon instead of being concealed
in national aggregations. This is exactly

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.490
what the leaders of Asian and Africa countries

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.189
agreed to do when they met in

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.870
Jakarta, Indonesia in April of last year,
the first time the Asia African conference

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.060
was held since 1955. This time around

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.590
they issued the declarations of the new

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.069
Asian African Strategic partnership, where
they agreed among others to meet

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.069
internationally agreed targets and goals

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.539
in poverty eradication, development and

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:15.629
growth while emphasizing the importance
of cooperation with all regions. The

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.009
declarations of the regional ministerial

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.009
meeting on MDGs in the Asia Pacific held

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.849
in Jakarta early last month also recognized
these challenges.

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.460
The meeting emphasized the need for collective

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.599
action while acknowledging that

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:39.650
attainment of the MDGs is still the primary
responsibility of individual countries.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.229
The ministers proposed (inaudible) regional

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.120
cooperation and partnership for

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.770
achieving the MDGs in the region with
special attention to the needs of least-

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.279
developed countries, land-locked developing

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.599
countries and small island

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:05.360
developing countries. We in the region
remain firmly committed and determined

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.349
to attain our MDGs. We are mobilizing

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:13.229
regional resources and initiatives such as

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:17.830
the Asian Development Bank and the Associations
of Southeast Asian Nations,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.270
to help us towards those goals.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.650
We have sought the assistance of international

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.569
financial institutions and

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:32.180
multilateral development agencies such
as the UNDB. We have invited the

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.719
United Nations system to provide comprehensive

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:37.659
and coherent programs of

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:43.419
support for regional countries. Specifically
we have called on the United Nation

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.300
Economic and Social Commission for Asia

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.590
and the Pacific to help us formulate a

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:58.570
road map to guide our future effort as
we move towards 2015. We urgently need

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.160
that road map. The drive towards the MDGs

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.670
has turned out to be a complex

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:12.500
journey with many obstacles. Though the
MDGs were formulated to help all

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.140
societies, they do not serve as a formula

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.290
for progress that applies to all. There is

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.500
great diversity among developing countries.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.470
They are not affected by the same problems

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.870
in the same way. They cannot have

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:35.010
uniform priorities. In the first place,
there are many factors and combination of

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.330
factors that may have to do with the poverty

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.210
of nations. This includes a country's

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:47.770
peculiar geography, its climate, the prevalence
of disease and natural (inaudible).

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.880
There are also political factors, such

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.090
as the lingering effect of oppressive and

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:01.830
exploitative colonial rule, the debilitating
consequences of corruption, the

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.760
negligent of government and the devastation

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.900
of (inaudible) armed conflict. Every

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.300
national strategy for development must
therefore be tailored to the environment

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.920
of the country, to its culture and tradition

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.020
as well as to its unique resources or

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.370
lack of resources.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.700
And let us never lose sight of the close

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.190
relationship between development and

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:36.060
security, as has been mentioned by Professor
Sachs. I am convinced that the

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.320
struggle for world peace and security

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.970
will never been won unless the challenge of

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:48.000
poverty has been defeated. I do not have
to look too far to find a case that

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.830
demonstrates that truism. For decades

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.820
the Indonesian province of Aceh

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.610
smoldered in resentment. You know Aceh.
Aceh is the province in Indonesia

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.560
that was hit by the tsunami that cost

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.710
130,000 lives. Again, for decades the

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:14.950
Indonesian province of Aceh smoldered
in resentment at what it perceived as an

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.720
unfair selling of the revenues from its

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.540
wealth of natural resources.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.010
For lack of development the proud and

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.310
courageous people of Aceh felt that they

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:32.090
were poor and did not deserve it. Poverty
was robbing them of their dignity.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.610
Grievance and resentment eventually broke

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.220
out into rebellion and separatisms.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.910
The result was three decades of armed
conflict. And while the conflict was

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.330
raging and taking a heavy toll of human

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.280
life, the province became even more

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:58.280
impoverished. The situation became a vicious
cycle: poverty bred violence and

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.670
the reign of violence rendered the people

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.500
even poorer. In the (inaudible) reform

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.470
movement that was launched in the midst
of the crisis of 1998, the government of

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.220
Indonesia failed to address the problems

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.690
of Aceh through dialogue and

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.310
reconciliation. It was not an easy task.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.770
Their first attempt aboard the government

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.310
of Indonesia and the (inaudible)

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:30.740
movement to achieve peace through negotiation
was a failure. Then came an

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.000
act of God, the earthquake and tsunami

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.990
of last December that visited tragedy

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.630
upon the province. The unprecedented catastrophe
killed more, as I have said,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:49.630
130,000 people died and about 120,000

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.790
missing in Aceh alone. And it

00:12:53.790 --> 00:13:00.790
devastated of 500 kilometers stretch a
coastline. More than half a million lost

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.430
their homes. It is amazing how tragedy

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.990
can make people see more clearly the

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.290
situation they are in. Both the government
and the free Aceh movement saw that

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.020
the reconstruction and rehabilitation

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.680
of the province could only be carried out

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.070
successfully in an atmosphere of peace.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.510
And the only way to peace is to make peace.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.820
We made that peace in record time

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:35.820
and that peace is holding. The challenge
now is to make that peace endure so

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.060
that it will become the environment of

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.630
a battle in which former adversaries will
be

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.660
fighting on the same side the battle against

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.670
poverty. Today the reconstruction

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:54.300
and rehabilitation of Aceh is being carried
out in a way that can serve as model

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.550
for development planning for the rest

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.120
of Indonesia. A master plan was prepared

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.050
with the full participations of the people
or of the communities being rebuilt. The

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.660
implementations of projects are monitored

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.230
and evaluated by the people. Thus

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:17.120
the people feel that they are the owners
of their own recovery. At the same time

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.040
we have put in place an airtight system

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.040
that guaranteed transparency and

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.080
accountability and the disbursement of
funds.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.570
I believe that by doing so we have been

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.920
able to eliminate one formidable ally of

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:39.080
poverty: corruption. It was in the spirit
of reform that we were able to address

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.590
with any success the challenges of (inaudible)

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.760
and development. It has been the

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.160
same spirit of reform that we have been
addressing the challenge of national

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.960
security and national development since

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.070
mid-1998. Where there are grievances

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:04.630
we bring justice and (inaudible) and reconciliation.
We are fostering interfaith

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.510
dialogue with the intentions of encouraging

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.340
religious leaders and scholars to take

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.580
a frontline position in the (inaudible).
Right after this session I will be attending

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.840
the interfaith dialogue that they will

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.640
be attending by world leaders and hosted by

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.540
President Arroyo of the Philippines.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.600
Indonesia also hosted many occasions of

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.370
the interfaith dialogue because this is

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:38.120
very important for Indonesia as a diverse
country that we have to bring harmony,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:45.120
respect others to at the end achieve true

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.350
peace in Indonesia. Where there is a

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.500
development project to be carried out
we shift the involvement of the largest

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.240
possible (inaudible) of (inaudible) orders.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.110
On the long term we are investing

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.570
heavily in human development, as reflected
in our budgetary outlay of education

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.180
and health. We have in place an economic

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.150
strategy that is basically pro growth

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:19.370
and pro poor. That strategy entails strengthening
of the export sector, promoting

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.690
domestic and foreign direct investment

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.680
to create jobs and accelerating the

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.820
development of rural economies.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.640
We are putting new emphasis on rural infrastructure.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.070
Nothing is too small to

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:40.070
matter. A bridge that can cut by half
a day a farmer's trek to town, a schoolhouse

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.140
where there was none for miles around,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.770
this makes a world of difference in the

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:51.680
villages. In the face of the skyrocketing
of oil prices we are exercising fiscal

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.620
restraint and budgetary discipline. At

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.590
the same time we are putting in place a

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.960
social safety net to protect our poor
from the rigors of these hard times especially

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.220
when we allow fuel prices to rise to market

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.360
level. The national social net will

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.699
consist of undertaking a human resources
development, infrastructural building

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:20.040
and of course food security. Initially,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.360
we expect to spend 1.9 billion for this effort

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.630
to help and to protect the poor because
of the new government policy to increase

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.200
the price of the fuel.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.100
The pockets of poverty in Indonesia are

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.860
considerable. We will neither deny nor

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:45.860
conceal these through deceptive aggregate
statistics, nor will we give into

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.450
despair. For we have a vision of ourselves

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.340
becoming a people that have

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.300
conquered poverty as the basic problem
of the human condition. We see

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.280
ourselves today as a people who have suffered

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.840
much but in the process gain a

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:08.810
wealth of experience and insight. In the
current debate on fighting global poverty

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.140
the developing countries have argued that

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.380
the developed world are not doing

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.630
enough to help developing countries. In
turn, the developed world suggests that

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.760
the developing countries are not doing

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.010
enough to help themselves. Well, I think

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.290
they are both right.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.010
Each of us, the developed and developing

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.910
world, needs to do more if we are to

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.400
tackle global poverty through global cooperation.
We in Indonesia know to

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.810
address the ills of our society we need

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.600
to improve government, fight corruption,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.210
have better planning, invest more in our
education and health, and utilize our

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.650
resources efficiently. Unless we do this

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.850
with the seriousness that we deserve,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:06.650
international cooperation alone will not
be sufficient. In the struggle for

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.440
development we know what works and what

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.410
does not work. We know what it

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.770
takes to attain prosperity, and that is
the continuing refinement of our institution

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.380
and human development in an environment

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.180
of democracy. We believe in the

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:30.320
perfectibility of our democracy and in
the fruitfulness of our constant process of

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.450
reform. That is our fighting fit and our

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.320
battle cry. Ladies and gentlemen, thank

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.670
you for your kind attention.
