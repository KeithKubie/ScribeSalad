00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.030
Andy Clark approached me a couple years

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.630
ago to commission me for this particular

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.510
concert and the guidelines were, he said

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.640
why don't you write something that is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.029
Christmas-y, wintry, not necessarily

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.350
religious. So I chose three texts, three

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.070
poems about winter. It conveys a blizzard

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.360
in a winter storm and it's a really

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.190
great way to start thinking about that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.530
chilly but exciting part of the year.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.770
It's a very festive atmosphere. This will

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.170
be a particularly sing-along focused

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.269
christmas concert but there's always a

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.129
lot of great audience participation

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.739
people come to these concerts expecting

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.229
to be involved in to be singing with us.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.570
More than just being a Harvard event

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.820
it's really a community event too, so in

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.170
working with the Snap Choir from

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.089
Lexington and making it a free concert

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.890
so that's accessible to everyone,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.479
we're really trying to bring this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.129
Christmas spirit that we're creating at

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.810
Harvard to both the Harvard community

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.850
and the broader Cambridge in Boston

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.250
communities. One of the major reasons

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.170
that the glee club commission's pieces

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.090
in the first place is to create

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.090
repertoire for other choirs to use. Not a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.980
whole lot of music necessarily is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.920
written for tenor-based choirs so we're sort of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.020
trying to keep that tradition alive

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.270
with our commissions and the same is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.150
really true of RCS' commission, sort

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.340
of the other way around, so they're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.140
sort of also contributing to a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.450
repertory tradition that can continue

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.410
for years into the future.
