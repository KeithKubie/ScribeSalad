00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.040
From the event we hope to get an innedit
level of action in Argentina, given its dimensions.

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:31.090
Argentina has lots of experience with hackathons
and in getting developers, and being able to

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.370
generate new ideas and to work in a communitarian way.
The developer community of Argentina is

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.760
more than interesting and, above all, with the possibility
to share and work on

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.760
that allow us to get a bigger amount of knowledge
and that will allow us to innovate

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.339
as well as new applications that can be use socially or

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.179
to grow the developer community and productive of
Argentina. In this case,

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:09.930
by its dimensions, we'll be faced with a event
with no predecesor, at least

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.820
in what I can remember. A developer, 
to be successful, at the very least should

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.140
count with two fundamental characteristics,
one is that he/she must know how to integrate gadgets

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.140
and programming; and second, he/she must be able to read
the need in his/her community

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.740
to transform it into a viable, intelligent, and
interesting solution; and above all

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.899
usable. The most important thing to have a 
successful app, is to have somebody incorporate it as

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.450
their own, for the app to be used and offer a solution
to a problem. The Google

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.039
tools, have in my opinion as a fundamental characteristic to have shown... In reality these are

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.070
platforms that have shown us how to work collaboratively.
We should never forget that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.049
before Google Maps, it was very hard that by using a single platform

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.020
information could be aggregated, say, in a way
so simple and useful; and that you could

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.020
see how that information, produces new knowledge, 
with the possibility to increase thtat idea

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.319
that the space-time, that place, that topology
being shown in the map can be aggregated

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.319
of a bunch of information on technological device.
We invite you!

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.569
I give a +1 to the Developer Bus!.
