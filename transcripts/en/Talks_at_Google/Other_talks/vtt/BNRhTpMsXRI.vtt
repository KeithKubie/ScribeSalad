&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Here at Google London.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.539
This book is about 10 years of my life trying
to figure out why people are good and evil.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.890
That's the longest debate since humans have
been having debates, right?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.030
Are we good, are we evil?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.770
And, of course, the answer is we're both.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.810
But that doesn't really help us.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.960
The question is why, right?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.039
Why would I ever behave in a way that's compassionate
or kind or why would I behave in a way that's

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.210
cruel or aggressive?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.149
So, let me start out by telling you a little
about two women.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600
One of them maybe you've heard of, one of
them you didn't.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.780
The first picture is from a crime scene.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
This crime was perpetrated by a woman that
I interviewed in a San Diego county jail in

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
California.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.550
So to picture her she's wearing an orange
jumpsuit, her hands are shackled in front

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.820
of her to her legs and she was a 25 year old,
long time meth user.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.080
So that tells you when she started using meth
and she had served a prison term for possession

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.570
of meth amphetamine and then was sent to a
halfway house.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.270
So, kind of transition her back into life.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.500
In this halfway house were 4 women living
together, so 3 women and her.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.619
And it had a shared kitchen and living space.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.930
And she and these other women kept on having
these clashes.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.180
So one day in the kitchen, the prisoner I'm
talking to, decides to stab her roommate 22

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.200
times and let her bleed to death on the kitchen
floor.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.960
So we're going through this long interview,
you know, when'd you first start using drugs?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960
Your family history?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.130
And I finally, she's already plead to murder
so she's agreed that she killed that lady

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.040
and so I said, "Why'd you kill this woman?"

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.240
"Ah, she bugged me."

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.729
As if she's a fly that she's swatting on the
wall.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.630
Okay, case 2, this is a picture from the 1930s,
again a woman who is about 25 years old at

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.320
the time and her name is Agnes Bojaxhiu and
she's Albanian.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.759
She's from a fairly wealthy family.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.350
At age 18 she decides she's gonna leave home
and join a convent called the Sisters of Loretto.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.940
It's gonna be very important, there's a quiz
at the end of this talk, so remember Sisters

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.459
of Loretto cause it's gonna be a key part
of my story.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.180
So she goes to England for training, she goes
to Ireland, then she's posted to India where

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.930
she spends her entire career ministering to
the poor, the sick, the untouchables as Mother

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.930
Theresa.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.579
She never returned home again, never saw her
family, never saw her siblings, she dedicated

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.579
her whole life to helping other people.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.249
So how do we get both those behaviors within
the human species?

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.689
Killing people like they're nothing and reaching
out.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.049
So flip that around, think of your own lives,
right, you all look like pretty nice people,

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.329
a couple of the guys in the back I'm not too
sure about but the rest of you look pretty

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.329
good.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.709
So how can you, yourself, go from being nice,
relaxed, kind, smiling to being aggressive,

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.760
grumpy, nasty?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.599
How does that switch occur?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.669
And so scientists have studied for a long
time the nasty part, the aggression, the fear,

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.139
because that gets huge responses in the brain.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.459
But I wanted to ask the other question.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.610
What modulates us to be more like Mother Theresa,
more compassionate, more kind to reach out

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.610
to others?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.579
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: And this took me on a 10 year
journey.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.950
And I'll tell you a little about that.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.409
But before I do I want to give you an idea
of some of the fun experiments that we've

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.110
run, not just in a laboratory, but in the
field.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.709
So this one happened right here in England
and I have a short video.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.709
[Cheering]

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.300
&gt;&gt;female on video: Most people plan to make
their wedding special but this wedding in

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.420
Southern England was a first for science.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.090
Nick and Linda had invited researcher, Paul
Zak, to take blood samples from them and their

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.389
guests.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.439
It was a chance to find out what goes on in
people's bodies during this momentous bonding

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.439
event.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.699
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: The value of doing this as a field
study is that we have an actual real life

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.699
event.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.000
So this way we actually go in, in a very natural
setting, a wedding with a hundred people,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.219
some of which knew each other, some of which
didn't know each other.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.809
&gt;&gt;female on video: Thirteen people, including
the bride and groom, had their blood drawn

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.719
before and after the couple took their vows.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.469
Zak wanted to find out if there would be a
rise in their oxytocin, a hormone associated

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.200
with love, trust and bonding.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.169
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: We thought maybe during this wedding
ceremony people are bonding to each other

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.630
and they're actually releasing oxytocin.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.020
So we measured oxytocin and we also measured
a cluster of other hormones that were also

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.020
associated with reproduction.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.919
&gt;&gt;female on video: Zak found that the couple
and close family members

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.080
&gt;&gt;female on video: had more extreme changes
in oxytocin.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.710
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Linda had the biggest spike in
oxytocin, a 28 percent increase in oxytocin

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.569
before and after her vows.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.040
So she's really feeling the love.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040
Who's next?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.949
The bride's mother, of course the bride's
mother is very engaged emotionally, and then

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.960
the groom's father, and then the groom.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.849
And then further out are just some random
friends that we pulled.

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.370
&gt;&gt;female on video: Testosterone is linked
to sex drive and studies have found that drops

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.300
when men fall in love.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.420
Zak expected this to happen at the wedding,
too.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.170
But results proved otherwise.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.840
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: We also found that testosterone
levels were flat for all the men we tested

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.120
except for the groom.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.180
So, immediately after the vows, his testosterone
levels doubled from beforehand.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.350
Why is that?

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.030
He had this beautiful woman, wearing a gorgeous
strapless gown and he's thinking about the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.030
honeymoon.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.430
&gt;&gt;female on video: According to Zak the most
important finding was that just being part

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.560
of a wedding makes us release oxytocin.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.770
This may help explain why most people choose
to have a wedding instead of eloping with

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.770
their partner.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.430
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: I think the ritual evolved because
we all have a stake in sustaining the human

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.430
race.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.610
The bride and groom have a built in set of
people who are emotionally engaged with them,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.199
who care about the outcome.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.039
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Okay, so that was one of the fun
experiments we've done outside the lab.

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.860
But it's just a way to kind of demonstrate
that the kind of behaviors we're finding in

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.379
the lab, that induce the release of oxytocin,
which I call the moral molecule, happen in

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.490
our daily lives all the time.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.110
And I think that's why this work is very interesting,
is because our brains are living in this sea

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.030
of chemicals and we're not always aware of
the chemicals that are being released and

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.650
how they impact our behavior.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.050
So oxytocin, until we started doing these
experiments 10 years ago, was only known in

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.620
human beings to facilitate birth and breastfeeding.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.020
In fact, one of my colleagues and I thought,
well, maybe oxytocin might modulate positive

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.199
behaviors in humans, told me it was the world's
stupidest idea.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.620
Cause everyone knows it's just for birth and
it's not very important.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.350
So, "But men's brains release this too," I
said, "There must be a reason why."

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.410
And in animals, oxytocin has been shown to
facilitate tolerance for animals that live

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.410
together.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.110
So I thought, well, tolerance to, like, treating
people well, that kind of runs on a continuum,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.490
maybe this works on humans.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.240
Okay, great idea, difficult execution.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.590
So, oxytocin is a very shy little molecule.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.469
You have to coax it out of the brain, it has
a three minute half life and then it disappears.

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:12.000
And, so, we're required some very tight experimental
procedures to get this thing to be released.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.249
And, again, before we start doing this, the
only ways known were birth, breastfeeding

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.500
and also sex.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.569
All three of which are too messy to run in
my lab.

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:25.070
So we thought well, maybe here's a way we
could induce the release of oxytocin in a

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.909
way that I can do consistently over and over
and over, and would explain one of the mysteries

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.990
of life which is why we actually trust strangers.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.830
So we used this task, a task that was developed
by a guy that won the Nobel Prize in economics

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.361
for inventing experimental economics, now
called the Trust Game.

00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:44.840
And here's the task.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.890
So everyone gets recruited to be in this experiment,
you get 10 dollars if you agree to sit in

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.199
these hard chairs for an hour and a half and
after lots of instruction and no deception

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.729
at all, we never deceive people cause we're
the moral behavior guys, it would be bad karma

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:58.499
to deceive people in experiments.

00:07:58.499 --> 00:07:59.499
Here's the task.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:03.449
You log into the computer, your identity is
masked with a secret number and you get paid

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:07.229
in private when the experiment's over and
you get randomly matched with someone else

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:10.499
in the lab, who also got 10 dollars for showing
up.

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:11.660
And here's the task.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.009
There's a first decision maker and a second
decision maker in each pair and the first

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:19.029
decision maker gets a prompt, by computer,
saying "Would you like to give up some of

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:23.650
the 10 dollars you've earned for being here
and transfer it to the other person in the

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.650
lab?"

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.139
Whatever you give up comes out of your account
but gets tripled in the other person's account.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:33.580
So if you give up, say 8 of your 10 dollars,
you keep 2, but that person just got 24.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.010
So the second person gets a message saying,
"Guy 1 sent you 24 dollars, you have 34 dollars

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.430
in your account, would you like to send some
amount back to that first person?"

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:48.370
So you can see, if you think about this task,
the pie's gonna grow by three.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.209
But if you're the first decision maker, you
have to hope, believe, trust that this person

00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.209
is gonna, in fact, get the signal and return
the money.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:09:01.110
But, from the second decision maker's perspective,
whatever they return to you comes out of their

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.440
account one to one, it doesn't get tripled
again, it's a pure monetary loss.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.350
Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're gonna stab
your arm with a needle twice and take four

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.589
tubes of blood each time.

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:12.329
So you're literally making decisions based
on blood money.

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:15.370
So, why would you ever do this?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:20.101
So, what we showed is that the more money
you receive, as the second decision maker

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:25.970
did earning trust, the more your brain releases
oxytocin and the more oxytocin onboard, the

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.190
more you reciprocate.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.300
This is actually really interesting news.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.600
We have a biological basis for reciprocation.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.910
Essentially this is the golden rule.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.220
The golden rule exists in every culture on
the planet.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.019
It says if you play nice, I play nice.

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:43.190
For 95 percent of people this is true.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.870
The 5 percent that don't get this are interesting.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.209
I'll tell you about those in a minute.

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:54.290
So once we discovered that oxytocin facilitated
this reciprocal behavior, this, this trusting

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.410
behavior, we had to really dig into this deeper.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.800
I mean, this is potentially very valuable.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.820
So not only do we measure oxytocin and blood,
we measure lots of other chemicals that interact

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.940
with oxytocin and none of those had an effect
on this behavior.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.860
And, we developed an oxytocin nasal inhaler,
in which I can shoot synthetic oxytocin into

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.759
the brain, safely, I've done this for about
700 people now, and we can turn on these moral

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.820
behaviors like a garden hose.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.779
So not just trust, but things like generosity,
where to be generous towards you means I have

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:30.459
to lose money myself.

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:37.990
Things like being compassionate, being charitable,
giving money to charity, so once we stimulate

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.460
the brain, release oxytocin or shoot this
into your brain synthetically, all of a sudden

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.100
people are reaching out to others.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.490
So, one way to think about this is, oxytocin
evolved in mammals to motivate care for offspring.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.279
And in humans, this system works so powerfully,
because we have these little parasites called

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:59.510
children attached to us for so long that we
attach to all kinds of people, including strangers.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.560
But I think that's one of the great triumphs
of the human species, is that we can extract

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.860
value from social relationships.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.430
And sometimes that value is from romantic
partners or friendships, but we can actually

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.519
interact with strangers and get lots of value
out of those relationships, sometimes economic

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:17.519
value.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.230
So how do we all work together?

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.370
Again, so if you guys were rats in this room,
fur would be flying.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.310
Rats who don't know each other don't like
each other.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.660
But, again, most people here look pretty comfortable
and relaxed, how do we do that?

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.880
Because we have something in our heads, oxytocin,
that says, "Johnny, perfectly safe.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.430
Seems to be a great guy and

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.600
&gt;&gt;audience member: Michael.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.490
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Michael, kind of sketchy, don't
wanna be around Michael."

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.670
So, again, if we didn't have that in our heads
we couldn't modulate the appropriate behavior.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.861
So, for Michael, I wanna go in and fight with
him.

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:54.970
I have different chemicals that tell me, like
testosterone, that tells me how to do that.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.199
Okay, so that's the basic outline.

00:11:57.199 --> 00:12:01.100
The open question, though, is what it feels
like when your brain releases oxytocin.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.240
So we ran an experiment, designed by one of
my former graduate students now a faculty

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.790
member with me, George Barazza which we had
people watch a very sad video.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.790
A hundred second video of a father and his
two year old son, the son's name is Ben and

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.990
he has terminal brain cancer.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.490
These are not actors, these are real people
and Ben has actually now died.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.190
So, I'm not gonna show you the video because
the last time I showed it was at a law conference

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.569
and several lawyers actually cried.

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:29.649
And you know lawyers don't have souls so,
you know, I don't wanna make you nice people

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:30.649
cry.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.209
Anyway, it's a very emotional video.

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.480
There's a control video in which Ben and his
father are just at the zoo, there's no mention

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.510
of cancer or death.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.190
So for the treatment video, the father actually
talks to the camera and talks about how it

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.420
knows to feel to know his son is gonna die
in a couple months.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.779
And the son doesn't know it; he's just a happy
little kid, going through chemo, whatever.

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:55.380
We get a 47 percent increase in oxytocin,
huge, just enormous increase, and people are

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.210
more generous to strangers in the lab with
the money they earn for being there.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.170
They donate more money to the charity that
produced this ad.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.790
But they reported feeling the experience of
empathy.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.350
So the change in oxytocin correlated positively
with the sense of empathy.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.500
So it seems to be empathy that oxytocin makes
us feel.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.290
So, again, when I release oxytocin, I'm more
connected to you emotionally.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.190
I'm better able to forecast your emotions
and, therefore, understand what you're likely

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.190
to do.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.029
This is pretty useful when you're around strangers.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.380
So, why is that useful?

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.579
Well, that's consistent with human beings
having to modulate our behavior to fit the

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:38.579
environment we're in.

00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:44.530
Alright, so if I have a sense of empathy then
I can figure out if you're gonna be aggressive,

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.040
if you're gonna be dangerous, if you're gonna
be useful to have a relationship with and

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.669
I'm plugged in more with you than just having
a cognitive mechanism that says, "Here are

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:56.160
the 14 things I can do.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.639
If you do this, I do that."

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:01.610
Now I'm kind of inside your head or inside
your heart, if you will.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.069
I'm getting a sense of what you're likely
to do.

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:09.710
OK, so why are people ever good when no one's
watching?

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.721
In our experiments, you're in a partitioned
booth, you have a ton of privacy, you can

00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:18.430
walk out the lab with the money that people
had given you but most people don't do that.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.850
Why not?

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.990
Well, maybe God's watching you.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.399
So you're gonna get punished now or later.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:31.071
Maybe the government's watching you, right,
maybe people have the sense that, you know

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:34.910
if I do something bad, eventually I'll get
caught and punished.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.910
Or, maybe this guy at the bottom of the screen
was right.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:44.420
So that's a picture of Adam Smith, Scottish
philosopher, famous for being the quote, father

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
of economics.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.290
He wrote a book in 1776 called The Wealth
of Nations, which you guys have all heard

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.290
of.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.680
But it turns out that Smith was, in fact,
more of a philosopher.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.160
And he wrote a book in 1759 called the Theory
of Moral Sentiments.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.940
Now to tell you a little about Smith, he was
a weird guy.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.040
He sometimes would get so caught up in his
own thinking that he would leave the house

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.490
in his pajamas.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.540
He lived with his mother his entire life until
she died.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.470
He was kind of a weird character and he was
very minor figure.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:18.819
Just a little guy in Edinburgh, giving lectures
on moral philosophy, but this book, The Theory

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:21.889
of Moral Sentiment, made him a rock star.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:25.779
So, 18th century Europe, this guy is the thing.

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.629
He's having dinner with the king of France;
he's hanging out with Benjamin Franklin and

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:35.100
Thomas Jefferson because he developed, in
this book, the first real terrestrial theory

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.870
of morality.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:43.329
And that theory said that we are social creatures
and we have, what he called mutual sympathy,

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:48.069
we would call that empathy today, and because
we have mutual sympathy, we inhabit other

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:50.040
people's heads just a little bit.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.759
So if I do something that brings Johnny pain,
I'm gonna feel that pain so I tend not to

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.019
do that cause I don't like pain.

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:59.920
And if I do something that brings Michael
pleasure, I get to share in that pleasure

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.649
and, therefore, I tend to do those things.

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:06.920
So we worked out our conditions in which this
would accentuate or be inhibited.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.279
And, so, I had the same discovery, I just
found the neuroscience behind it.

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.379
So Smith seemed to be right.

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:20.120
We have this underlying kind of Yin and Yang
of morality right inside us.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:30.009
Half that is oxytocin, it's what we feel when
we're in other people's presence, what we're

00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:35.300
experiencing from them, we call it empathy;
the Yang part is punishment which I'll tell

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.300
you about in a minute, which is interesting.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.920
So, I think the punch line here is we don't
need God or government telling us what to

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.310
do because we have this internal monitor and
it's kind of like rocket thrusters.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.629
Cause we live in this sea of strangers, we've
got to figure out which direction to go and

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:55.790
the negative direction was pretty well understood,
how to be aggressive and the mechanisms behind

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.899
that.

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:00.791
But the positive rocket thruster was not understood
before we starting running these experiments

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:05.930
and actually you see a really important part
of the puzzle because we do see in many circumstances

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.990
lots of good behavior among the humans.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.250
So one reason not to motivate more behaviors

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.270
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: is this one.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.390
This is from a show called Boston Legal.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.390
[Music plays]

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.390
&gt;&gt;female in video: Oxytocin?

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.390
&gt;&gt;male in video: It's a hormone not a drug.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.390
&gt;&gt;female in video: What does it do?

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.050
&gt;&gt;male in video: Well, essentially it causes
people to trust you.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.900
&gt;&gt;female in video: There's a hormone that
causes people to trust you?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.940
&gt;&gt;male in video: I mainly used it for me.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.220
It can also help people with social anxieties.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.280
It enabled me to trust her as well.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.030
I spray it on like cologne.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.670
It has a nice gentle fragrance, not too bold.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male in video: Anyway, Dana, that's her

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.530
name.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.320
She found out and she's suing me.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.900
&gt;&gt;male in video: You're disappointed in me.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.460
&gt;&gt;female in video: Well, I am, Jerry.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.040
Truth be told.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.680
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Okay, so two lessons come from
this video.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.390
One is, be careful what you do in research
because the TV shows will pick it up.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.600
But the answer here to increase more behaviors
is not to spritz the rooms with oxytocin.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.450
So, in fact, when we do these experimental
tasks where we infuse oxytocin, you're getting

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.150
about two teaspoons of liquid up your nose,
you know you're getting it, it's not very

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.940
pleasant and that's kind of a sledge hammer.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.990
So your brain's own oxytocin system has this
very short on, off.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.020
It's got a three minute half life.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.800
So I see Johnny, I turn it on, he's safe,
that allows me to approach him.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.490
So oxytocin modulates its approach, withdraw,
trust, distrust behavior.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.640
I don't wanna leave that switch on cause I
might run into Michael, scary guy, and I don't

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.390
wanna be reaching out to him cause he might
hurt me.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.320
Or he might just not be an appropriate person
to be around.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.620
So I've always got to modulate this kind of
behavior.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:59.160
But even with a drug, we don't see oxytocin
turning people into gullible, piles of mush

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.900
where they're just giving away money.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.960
They're still cognitively intact they've just
changed this balance between self and other.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.890
So one way to think of oxytocin is this molecule
that motivated us to care for our offspring,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.160
makes us treat strangers like family.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.840
So, that can be a very beautiful thing.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.060
All of a sudden now my family has enlarged
and it could include, potentially, the entire

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.430
planet.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.330
So I can connect to anybody around the planet.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:33.440
So, it's not drugs, it's understanding how
your brain releases oxytocin that can motivate

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.460
these positive social behaviors.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.290
By the way, I'm using the world moral and
it's not a big M, it's a small m, so moral

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.690
just means an appropriate social behavior.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:47.170
So like the golden rule, I have no theological
or philosophical stake in some other version

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.170
of that.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.910
So it just means the positive social behaviors
that sustain you in the social group as a

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.740
human being.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.410
So oxytocin actually activates a larger brain
circuit which I call the home circuit.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.350
Home stands for human oxytocin mediated empathy.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:08.420
And it utilizes two other neurotransmitters,
dopamine and serotonin.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.850
And the arrows show the kind of pathways that
oxytocin, which is released deep in the brainstem

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:19.440
these evolutionary old areas of the brain,
into areas that modulate social behaviors

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.880
and social memories.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.030
What's important about this is that the brain
has set it up so that it feels good to do

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.030
good.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:32.380
So, in particular, you get this dopamine release
that reinforces positive social behaviors

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.070
and you get a mood lift from the serotonin
release.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.830
So the brain is set up to motivate positive
behavior.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.460
So it's not an anomaly that we treat people
well, that we hold doors for people going

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.040
into office buildings, that's actually part
of our deep evolutionary history.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.570
Again, that's because that's what sustains
us in our social group, is behaving in appropriate

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.570
ways.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.670
Again, if I run into a scary guy or someone's
threatening my kids, believe me I'm gonna

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.740
turn it on and take em' out if I can, or get
my kids away.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:07.740
But, for the most part, for most people most
of the time, you play nice, they're gonna

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.570
play nice.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.180
So the most of the time, of course, is where
the rubber hits the road.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.710
So let's talk about ways we can inhibit oxytocin
release.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.260
So, there's a couple interesting ways.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.710
One of those is high levels of stress.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.540
So, it turns out that moderate stress induces
more oxytocin release, right, in a stressful

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.630
situation you wanna bond together.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.250
Think of yourself, I don't know, in the airplane
in a bad thunderstorm, the plane is jumping

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.220
around and you have avoided talking to your
seatmate, right, you're reading your book,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.300
playing with your computer and now you start,
you can't read anyway, but, you just start

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300
talking.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300
"Man I hate these thunderstorms.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.370
It sucks, I wanna get home."

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.370
Why do you do that?

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.330
It's actually calming to be going through
something stressful with someone else.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.320
But at high levels of stress, the plane's
going down, it's all about you.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.330
You're brain says, "Hey, you gotta get through
the next 20 minutes, forget about everybody

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.780
else."

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.150
So you guys know that.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.290
When you're under high stress you're not your
best self, right, kind of nasty and grumpy

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.290
or short tempered.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.630
And then what do you have to do the next day?

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.970
You gotta go into work or to your spouse and
go, "Man, I was a jerk yesterday."

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.230
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: "I was having a really bad day."

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.920
My dog died, my car broke down, whatever it
is and then you have to rebuild those social

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
relationships.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:24.710
Okay, the other potent oxytocin inhibitor
that we found in the lab, is a chemical that

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.690
is the most important chemical to half the
people in this room, testosterone.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.270
So when we administer testosterone to men
in experiments, can better themselves on placebo,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.070
we can make them more selfish and more entitled.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.420
Okay, so who are the most selfish and entitled
people on the planet? Teenage boys, which

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.820
half of us used to be, we can tell you that.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:51.561
But we also find that high testosterone individuals,
mostly males but sometimes females, also are

00:22:51.561 --> 00:22:58.080
more likely to punish people for moral violations,
for example, violations of sharing norms.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.340
So, the yang of biology is punishment.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.380
So, I might be nice to you because I had this
oxytocin release, I don't wanna give you pain

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.470
cause I'm gonna feel that pain or because
I fear that you're gonna be aggressive towards

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.470
me.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:18.210
You're gonna view what I'm doing as bad behavior
if I don't play nice and get aggressive towards

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:25.070
me, particularly if I'm a male, and, so, this
balancing act kind of keeps us on the straight

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.160
and narrow most of the time.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.380
So do we need God or government?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.430
We still need a little God and a little government
probably because since our brains live in

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.910
a sea of chemicals, we need these bright lines,
the society places or some book places that

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.640
says, "Look if you're not here, if you're
here everything's fine, but once you get out

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.270
here you gotta start worrying."

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.630
So, as a society, I think what we've done
is say, "Look, here's where the bright lines

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:52.162
are" We move them occasionally but, "Here's
where the lines are."

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:54.920
Within this range everything's pretty much
appropriate, you can pretty much modulate

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.660
your behavior, but once you start getting
outside those lines then we as a group are

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.450
gonna say, "We don't think that's acceptable."

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.570
So, I think we still need to have those bright
lines, again, cause we're not always consciously

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:12.390
aware of these evolutionary old impulses for
good or bad behavior.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.600
Other factors that affect the release of oxytocin
include developmental history.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.520
So in animals, animals that are abused or
neglected develop oxytocin receptors, particularly

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.700
in the forebrain, in which you get these good
feelings when you behave in a positive social

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.700
way.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.170
We found that about half of women who are
repeatedly sexually abused as children don't

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.350
release any oxytocin on stimulus.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:39.110
We've also found within this five percent
of so who don't respond in our experiments,

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.590
that a couple percent of those are psychopaths.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.080
So, psychopaths don't feel empathy and they're
mostly born that way.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.860
So you're born with bad genes.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.760
You just don't get this, you're just kind
of a user, you know, you've taken advantage

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.060
of people; you're in permanent survival mode.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.590
And the psychopaths are not fixable; we've
actually found in our blood tests, that we

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.600
can identify them before they behave in certain
ways.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.760
So, their oxytocin receptors seem to be dysfunctional.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.760
So there's no fix.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.610
We can't replace the oxytocin because the
whole brain system that utilizes it doesn't

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.610
work properly.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:17.740
So I avoid, I suggest avoiding the psychopaths,
they are dangerous.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.910
So in writing this book I really had come
to terms with why I spent 10 years of my life

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.320
looking at moral behaviors.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.810
And, in coming to terms with that, the first
answer was I had done work, both some as an

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.240
economist and a neuroscientist and in my economist
world, I had worked in the late 90s showing

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.320
that countries that had high levels of interpersonal
trust were more prosperous.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.260
So poor countries are, by large, low trust
countries and when trust is low, very few

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.010
transactions occur, including transactions
that create wealth and reduce poverty.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.340
So this work had a lot of impact.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.640
The World Bank flies me out, you know, how
do we raise trust in these developing countries?

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.560
And what I couldn't answer was, for a given
country, why two people who didn't know each

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.440
other would ever trust each other.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.130
So that really led into our original trust
experiments and then this longer odyssey.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.070
But as I started writing the book, I really
had to be honest about that.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:16.090
So for us trust is really important, relieving
poverty, the true reason for this 10 years

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.620
worth of work is this woman right here.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.200
This nun, her name is Sister Mary Maristella
and this is a picture from the 1950s.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.280
After the picture was taken she decided to
leave the Sisters of Loretto, the orders of

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.350
nun that she had joined.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.260
And, a couple years later became my mother.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.040
So you think you had an interesting childhood,
talk to me.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.140
So, Morality with a capital M was certainly
in our house all the time.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.220
I was an altar boy, I was raised Catholic,
learned Latin, breathed in a lot of incense

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.480
and over time, it just didn't make sense to
me.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.700
That only Catholics go to heaven and however
good a Buddhist person you are or a Hindi

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.300
or whatever; you're not the right kind of
moral person.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:07.070
So, I think in rejecting that kind of view
of this top down morality that my mother had,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:12.060
I was looking for this underlying, like Adam
Smith, terrestrial basis for my moral behavior.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:17.190
A biological basis to understand good and
evil, and this drove me to look at all these

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.140
different experiments.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.882
As I said earlier, we've gone outside the
lab, as well, to make sure that what we're

00:27:23.882 --> 00:27:28.570
finding in the laboratory actually works in
real life.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.800
And I seriously avoided anything having to
do with religion because of my background.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.250
I didn't wanna know, although we asked religious
question, you know, do you believe in God,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.250
do you pray?

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.340
None of that affects behavior in a laboratory
because oxytocin explains the vast majority

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.350
and variations in these behaviors.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:48.960
But anyway, having come to turns with my own
weird religious background, we have now, we've

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.480
gone to churches, we've gone to folk dances,
we've gone to places where people congregate,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.350
where they exercise, soldiers marching and
in all these circumstances we found, indeed,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.930
that the majority of people would release
oxytocin when they do these community activities.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:09.250
So, again, I don't think these rituals are
going away because people who release oxytocin

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:14.570
during the ecologically valid rituals feel
closer to their community.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:19.960
And when you feel closer to your community
then you have the value of those social relationships.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.060
So I don't think churches are disappearing,
but maybe in Europe, we'll see.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:30.410
Okay, so one more question really bugged me,
which is all the studies I've shown you so

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.350
far have been run either in Western Europe
or the U.S.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.660
And I thought, if we're really building a
theory, a biological theory, about morality,

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.210
oxytocin release has gotta be universal for
this theory to be universal.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.540
So last year, I went to the Highlands of Papua
New Guinea to run an experiment.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.310
So this is our rain forest in which there
are 800 distinct languages cause these tribes

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.410
of subsistence farmers are very isolated and
they can be very aggressive.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.120
50 years ago, they were cannibals.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.990
So I get there, and this is like the experiment
from hell.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.440
Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong,
other than someone getting seriously hurt

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.970
or killed.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.830
No electricity, no running water.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:13.770
So we brought generators, I brought all my
own medical equipment, but, anyway, there

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.210
were lots of issues that made it a very difficult
experiment to run.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.560
But we had these individuals do a typical
ritual that they would engage in, in their

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.330
village, and let me show you what it looks
like then tell you about it.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.330
[Music plays]

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.330
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: It's in Japanese.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.330
I can, if you wanna hear it.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.330
Any Japanese speakers?

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.600
[Music plays with Japanese narration]

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.720
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: So this was a Japanese documentary
on human evolution and so the camera crew

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.990
followed me for this experiment
[marching noise]

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:52.020
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: So these are people living in
a village called Malke, there's about a thousand

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.020
people there.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:58.140
This is a traditional war dance that they
do.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.070
[Murmuring]
[Japanese speaking]

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.610
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: And we took blood before and after.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.030
Before and after to find out what goes on
in the brain during this period.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:10.280
[Music plays]
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Like I said, there's no electricity.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:15.980
This is a hand crank centrifuge, we actually
brought a generator but my electrical centrifuge

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.610
started burning up and so we had to crank
some of the blood by hand which is, 10 minutes

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.620
by hand is a lot of work.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.060
[Music plays]
[Japanese speaking]

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.190
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: None of these men had ever been
to a doctor or dentist.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.090
They'd never seen their blood drawn before.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:37.710
And because there's no running water, although
it rains, we had to use like 5 or 6 alcohol

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.350
swabs just to get to skin.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.400
I mean, they're kind of covered with dirt.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:47.100
They live in a wet, muddy area.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.260
[Japanese speaking]
[Music plays]

00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:03.450
[Japanese speaking]
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: So, the other things we measured

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:13.010
were testosterone, stress hormones and oxytocin
release because they all interact with each

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.850
other.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.520
[Japanese speaking]

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:36.170
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: So you can 
hear my perfect Japanese on that tape.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:40.640
So what we found is, indeed, 60 percent of
the men in this ritual released oxytocin and

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.580
they felt closer to their community in this
ritual that they had done for thousands of

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.620
years.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:53.110
So the release of oxytocin appears to be universal,
almost everyone has it and I think harvesting

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.680
this power can be quite valuable.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:03.100
So, because stress, like survival stress,
inhibits the release of oxytocin, it also

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.440
inhibits our ability to feel empathy and to
connect to others and so there's this possibility

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.210
that there's this positive feedback loop in
which as I release oxytocin, I engage in more

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:18.830
moral behaviors, including trusting behaviors,
which allows for more extraction of social

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.610
value from in relationships including the
economic value.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:27.330
And as I move people out of poverty, I give
them the luxury of releasing oxytocin and

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:32.340
behaving in those social ways, and so this
feedback loop can start occurring.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.370
Of course you can unwind this, you can do
this backwards, we see lots of countries doing

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.370
this.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:44.160
So if this feedback loop is real, we should
be able to see a data at the country level

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.580
suggesting this is happening.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.390
And, in fact, we do see that.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.580
This is data on tolerance.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.270
It's a little hard to read but it's a strong
income gradient on measures of tolerance,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.580
the ability to tolerate people that are different
than you.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.530
There's a nice income gradient for things
like trust and there's even income gradient

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.260
for happiness.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:07.850
So countries that are more tolerant, more
trusting are more prosperous and are happier.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.760
And, in fact, we found the same thing at the
level of individuals.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.460
In a recent experiment, which we look at the
differences in oxytocin release, we asked,

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.190
"What's the difference between people who
release lots of oxytocin when they're trusting

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.240
versus those who release little?"

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.350
And the people who released the most were,
in fact, happier in their lives and they were

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:32.110
happier because they had better relationships
of all types, better romantic relationships,

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:37.380
more close friends, closer to family, they're
even nicer to strangers in laboratory tests.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.740
So, we looked at many ways to release oxytocin
and one of those is touch.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.230
Now, one our early experiments, we showed
that touch induces oxytocin release and so

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.260
you have to believe your own research.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.061
So I started changing my life because of my
own research and one of the things I refuse

00:33:54.061 --> 00:33:56.990
to do is I refuse to handshake now, I hug
everybody.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.380
And, so, the students in my lab started calling
me Doctor Love as kind of a joke.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.661
Anyways, I had this reporter a couple years
ago from Fast Company magazine come to the

00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:10.629
lab, run through some experiments and then
he added me as Doctor Love in the title of

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:12.329
his article about me.

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:15.099
And at first I was kind of unhappy cause I'm
a serious scientist.

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:19.839
Then I started thinking, like, what thing
could I do better in the world than encourage

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:22.629
people to connect more, to show more love.

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:24.700
In fact, oxytocin is just like love.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.460
You can't force someone to love you and you
can't force your own brain to release oxytocin.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.029
You can only give it to somebody else and
if you give it to somebody else, 95 percent

00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:38.139
of those people, they're likely to reciprocate
and show you that love, that care, that empathy

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.619
in return.

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.190
So I think, if I'm Doctor Love, fine.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.799
If I can encourage people to be more connecting,
more loving, I think I've done something good

00:34:45.799 --> 00:34:46.799
in the world.

00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:50.810
So, anyway, the book has a lot of practical
ways that you can do that besides just hugging

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:51.810
people.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:58.960
And I think what it means is that we can take
charge of our social lives and build communities

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:05.289
that allow us to foster better social relationships
and more happiness.

00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:09.650
So, understanding how to harness the power
of oxytocin, I think, is potentially very

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:10.650
valuable.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.109
By the way, let me just say, since I'm at
Google, we've also shown in a number of experiments

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:20.109
that using social media, like Google Plus,
induces the release of oxytocin as well.

00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:26.540
So, connection is what we need, connection
is what we want and if you understand that

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.980
that's a very deep evolutionary part of history,
a deep part of our human nature, then I think

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:39.420
it frees you up to connect to others and to
enjoy the reduction in stress, the improvement

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.859
in immune system and an increase in happiness
that you get from oxytocin release.

00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:50.820
So, I've said a lot, how about if I take some
questions and we can hang out and chat a little

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.820
bit.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.820
Oh, there's no questions at all?

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.660
Michael,we should let him go first cause I
picked on him.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.109
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: He's a fine person, we know that.

00:35:57.109 --> 00:36:03.519
&gt;&gt;male #1: So I have a question, um, does
the ability to perceive oxytocin change us

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:05.839
over time in the same person?

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.900
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: That's a great question.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:14.349
So, there is evidence suggesting that the
more you release oxytocin, the more you lower

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:15.369
the threshold for release.

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.160
In other words it gets easier to release oxytocin.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.660
By the way, that's different than fear.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.869
So fear we acclimate to, so I can scare you
and then you get used to that stimulus and

00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:26.329
I have to keep increasing it.

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:30.740
But with oxytocin release, it gets easier
and easier which is very interesting.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.170
Even though there's some experiments that
suggest that, my own experience is the same.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:39.300
Because I'm introvert, and I kind of get tired
talking to people but it turns out that the

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.619
more I connect to people, the easier it gets
and, presumably, the more oxytocin I'm releasing.

00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:47.670
So, I'm subject number one in that experiment.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.569
Yeah, thanks.

00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:57.759
&gt;&gt;male #2: So, did I understand correctly
that you said you could test, establish where

00:36:57.759 --> 00:37:01.650
people were on the psychopath scale through
blood testing?

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.950
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Yeah, we have evidence that we
can identify the psychopaths.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.730
We can't nail that exactly where they are
on a scale but if you're severe enough, this

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.660
is the Hare psychopathology's checklist.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.960
If you're severe enough on a checklist, you'll
get picked up in our blood test.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.940
&gt;&gt;male #2: So are you concerned with the,
sort of, criminal justice applications of

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.299
this at some point in the future?

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:27.930
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Right, so I see people who I talk
to and groups I talk to who really like this

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.410
work a lot are lawyers and judges because
they have these frequent fliers.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:38.560
So I spent a fair amount of time in courthouses
and jails interviewing these individuals to

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.200
find out why they don't respond to punishments.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.750
And there's actually some very funny stories
in there and also some tragic stories.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:51.140
But I'm not worried about a, kind of, Brave
New World approach where, again, we're shooting

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.930
this stuff into people's brains.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:58.020
Because, number one, the effects are fairly
subtle and, number two, these psychopaths

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.130
don't seem to have the receptors for oxytocin,
so even if I replace it, having said that,

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.530
there are drugs in development that can increase
the number of oxytocin receptors.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:11.350
And, so, those might be used to treat a variety
of disorders that associate with improper

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:16.170
social behaviors, schizophrenia, depression,
social anxiety and maybe psychopathology.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.819
So, again, I think society needs to say where
that line lies.

00:38:19.819 --> 00:38:23.779
I need to do the basic research and show the
world what we can do with it.

00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:29.750
&gt;&gt;male #2: So, I mean, given the Hare test
is used to sort of approve or deny parole

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:35.799
in some states, I mean, do you think that
would be a useful thing if this blood test

00:38:35.799 --> 00:38:40.410
became used eventually to, sort of, decide
people's futures?

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.950
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Right, so I think, we're still
doing more research on this so I'd say the

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.460
jury's still out.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.480
There's a funny story I tell in the book about
being pulled into a murder case.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:56.809
So there was an internet entrepreneur in Silicon
Valley named Hans Reiser who was getting divorced.

00:38:56.809 --> 00:39:03.670
His wife was Russian and instead of divorcing
his wife he decides, instead, to kill her.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.160
And he's on trial for this, they never find
the body, the last day of the trial he's gonna

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.410
be convicted for sure.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:17.049
He pleads to first degree murder to avoid
the death penalty and shows the prosecutor

00:39:17.049 --> 00:39:18.900
where the body is.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.390
He goes to jail for life, he's in San Quentin.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:25.960
A year into San Quentin, he writes a four
page, handwritten appeal to the state of California

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:32.859
asking for a new trial, citing my research,
claiming that his lawyer had oxytocin deficit

00:39:32.859 --> 00:39:36.410
disorder, this disorder I called, which you
don't release oxytocin.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.819
And, of course, that appeal was denied.

00:39:38.819 --> 00:39:42.589
But, I mean, the lack of insight, here's a
guy who has no empathy at all who's claiming

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:45.339
his lawyer didn't have empathy and couldn't
represent him properly.

00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:48.220
So it's getting into the law now.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:56.029
So, yeah, we're, the largest group of neuroscientists
have come out the last few years saying that

00:39:56.029 --> 00:40:01.559
many of the neuroscience findings like brain
imaging, are not ready for the courtroom because

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:08.250
they are, they can induce more bias than they
can remove uncertainty in, in people's minds.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.480
So, they're more prejudicial than they are
probative.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.539
Yeah, great question, thanks.

00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:16.559
Yeah.

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:17.569
[Pause]

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:28.450
&gt;&gt;male #3: Two related questions on the, assuming
that there are other factors, say besides

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:32.450
trust, that might effect a country's prosperity
where, could you name a few countries who

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:37.430
may have had high, um, low trust but high
prosperity?

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:44.329
And then on the individual level is it possible,
again, similarly to, the 5 percent of people

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:53.910
who were kind of psychopathic, is it possible
to override the oxytocin pathway process and

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:58.920
still do some of these negative things but
have fully functioning oxytocin receptors?

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.509
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Great question, two great questions.

00:41:01.509 --> 00:41:07.109
So, we actually ran a horse race using cross
country data which asked does this oxytocin

00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:11.530
which facilitates trust, does that come first
or do you need kind of good institutions?

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:17.230
So, it's the institutions that actually generate
high trust and the oxytocin response to that.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:22.960
So those are a government that fairly enforces
contracts, independent judiciary, having a

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.640
well functioning social sector so not a lot
of social strife and having a well functioning

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640
economic sector.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.530
So, for example, a very high variance in distribution
of income tends to drag down trust levels

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.250
because now it's harder to understand if someone's
gonna behave nicely because they might be

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.559
under survival stress.

00:41:39.559 --> 00:41:45.420
And so yeah, fixing those three sectors come
first and then the brain responds with this

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.619
feeling of safety.

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:51.890
So a great example is London or New York which,
you know, 25-30 years ago were much less safe

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:58.660
places and have become, actually, much friendlier,
much safer and, actually, very prosperous.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.859
So, I was in New York 10 days ago, I mean,
2 in the morning you can walk around and you

00:42:02.859 --> 00:42:06.950
feel totally comfortable in Manhattan and
just about anywhere.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.519
So yeah, there are, there's this positive
feedback loop.

00:42:10.519 --> 00:42:14.099
The second question was on individuals who
don't seem to have these oxytocin receptors.

00:42:14.099 --> 00:42:21.690
So, in a short story to illustrate this point,
we ran an experiment for a TV show, which

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.579
I talk about in the book, a show on the seven
deadly sins.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:26.700
And, so, of course I was hoping to get lust.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.130
Unfortunately, I got greed.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:35.730
I thought I could do lust, but anyway, the
shtick on the show was they took a woman from

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:41.381
the Donald Trump show, The Apprentice, in
the US, and who is gorgeous, successful, but

00:42:41.381 --> 00:42:42.381
famously greedy.

00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:47.390
And we run her through a battery of trials
to understand, is she a psychopath?

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.640
Is she using people?

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.419
Or, so she was actually very greedy for money,
in fact, we put her on the intranasal oxytocin,

00:42:53.419 --> 00:42:56.200
it didn't affect her behavior.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.029
So, she has many of the attributes of psychopaths,
although she has a very funny developmental

00:43:00.029 --> 00:43:02.190
history which you can read up on in the book.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:05.359
Her father was a drug dealer, although she's
very intelligent.

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:12.089
But, when we did other tasks with her, like
we did some cooperation tasks in which they

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:17.119
don't involve money, she was wonderfully cooperative
and an actually very nice person but she doesn't

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.109
have the underlying oxytocin release.

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:25.310
So, she can still be a nice person when she
wants to, but when it comes to business she

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.319
will take your face off if she can.

00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:31.099
So, again, we learn to modulate this.

00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:35.570
So, again, it's not just oxytocin, there's
lots of other factors that affect our social

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:36.570
behaviors.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.499
But that was really the missing mechanism
that motivates the many positive behaviors.

00:43:40.499 --> 00:43:41.499
Yeah, thanks.

00:43:41.499 --> 00:43:46.380
&gt;&gt;male #4: So, one of the behaviors that you're
talking about, oxytocin in the brain that

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:50.490
you're measuring it from blood before and
after samples, so I was wondering if you could

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.039
talk about the difference between the oxytocin
in the brain versus in the blood.

00:43:54.039 --> 00:43:58.769
And, are there any sort of experimental techniques
coming up where you'll be able to more directly

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:03.380
measure during an activity rather than just
a before and after snapshot?

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.980
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Right, great, great neuroscience
question.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:13.369
So, because oxytocin is so evolutionarily
old, it's one of the few brain chemicals that'

00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:17.049
released simultaneously both in brain and
blood under physiological stress.

00:44:17.049 --> 00:44:22.670
And when we give these tasks, we're stressing
you and so what's in brain and blood are correlated.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.640
Base line levels are not correlated but under
physiological stress they are.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:33.280
So, what's in blood is a decent reflection
of what's in brain and we, you know, we collaborated,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.720
we confirmed what we see in blood by, again,
infusing intranasal oxytocin.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.392
So we show the brain releasing oxytocin for
this task, then we infuse oxytocin and show

00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:42.859
we can replicate the task.

00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:47.160
And we've done things like functional brain
imaging to show in these tasks we see a big

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:53.369
activation or a larger activation versus controls
that are rich in oxytocin receptors.

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:57.319
So we are working, now, on, actually with
the US military, on very rapid ways to measure

00:44:57.319 --> 00:44:58.319
oxytocin release.

00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:04.480
So I can't talk about those but there are
ways that we're investigating that may allow

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.819
us to measure on a second by second basis
or even faster, what is going on in the brain.

00:45:10.819 --> 00:45:18.450
&gt;&gt;male #5: You seem to be saying that cause
and effect from increased oxytocin to increased

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.170
empathy or increased trust works in both directions.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.170
Is that, is that correct?

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.130
Is that what you are saying?

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.280
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Right, so it's the receipt of
the positive social signal, could be a signal

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.059
of trust, could be a hug, that induces the
recipient's brain to release oxytocin and

00:45:32.059 --> 00:45:34.829
then motivates these moral behaviors or pro
social behaviors.

00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:42.430
&gt;&gt;male #5: But you also were saying that if
you inject or nasally inject oxytocin equivalents

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.880
then you can see changes in behavior?

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:50.020
&gt;&gt;Paul Zak: Right, so the reason for the oxytocin
inhaler studies is to, again, complete that

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.020
circle.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:56.009
But also because it gives someone, gives people
in the experiment a physiologically equivalent

00:45:56.009 --> 00:45:57.480
social signal.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.410
So I could, in experiments, have everyone
go and hug each other, but those, that'll

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.999
have varying effects across individuals.

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:06.930
When I give you the oxytocin spray, it's as
if you received a positive social signal and

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.759
everyone gets the same signal.

00:46:08.759 --> 00:46:11.759
Yeah, another good question.

00:46:11.759 --> 00:46:15.500
One more question and then we'll sign some
books.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:22.299
No more questions, okay, so thanks to you
guys for coming and if you wanna chat afterwards

00:46:22.299 --> 00:46:27.460
come by and get a hug from me, Doctor Love,
and thanks so much for your questions.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.859
[Applause]
