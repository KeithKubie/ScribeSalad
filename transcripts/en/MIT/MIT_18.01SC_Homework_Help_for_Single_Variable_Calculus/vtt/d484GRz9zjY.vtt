JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.690
In lecture, you've been
doing related rates problems.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.910
I've got another
example for you, here.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.585
So this one's a
really tricky one.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.690
So I'm going to give you
some time to work on it.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.730
But I really think you
should try and work

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.910
through this one yourself.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.050
It'll be well worth your effort.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.820
So we've got here--

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.810
OK, so this is a mouthful.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.520
We've got a 20-foot-long
ladder and it's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.400
leaning against a 12-foot wall.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.870
But it's leaning over the wall.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.530
So 5 feet of the ladder project
over the top of the wall.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.360
And then the bottom
of the ladder

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.840
is being pulled away from the
wall at 5 feet per second.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.590
The question is, while
this is going on,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.240
how quickly is the top of
the ladder going downwards?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.310
How quickly is it
approaching the ground?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.552
So why don't you
take a few minutes.

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:03.260
Well, maybe more than
a few for this one.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.150
It took me a while to work
it out the first time.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630
Take a few minutes, work
this one out, come back,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.190
and we'll see how it went.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.480
All right.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.354
So hopefully you've had
some luck working out

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:22.760
this problem on your own.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.040
Now let's work it out together.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.460
So OK, so this is a sort
of classic, really tricky

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.880
related rates problem in that
there's a lot of geometric work

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.390
that you have to
do at the beginning

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.110
in order to get this right.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.400
And then once you get
the geometry down,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.394
the calculus is basically
totally straightforward.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.310
You know, you compute a
couple of derivatives,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.486
you use the chain
rule once, whatever.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:45.986
You know.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.590
So OK, so let's start
off by trying and drawing

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.725
a careful picture.

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:53.100
And then we'll
have to figure out

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.933
what the quantities
that we're interested in

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:59.330
are and the relationships
between them.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.810
So we have here,
here's the ground.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.190
And we have a 12-foot wall.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.910
And we have a 20-foot ladder
leaning against the wall

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.490
and extending over it.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.170
So, my ladder.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.340
So here's my ladder.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.980
Here's my wall.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.480
All right.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.150
And this, the bottom
of the ladder here,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.220
is what's getting pulled
away from the wall at 5

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.090
units per second.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.760
5 feet per second.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.255
So 5 feet per second is
how fast that's going.

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:51.670
And we're interested--

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.560
so while you do that,
you know, the ladder

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.540
is changing position.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.010
So the question is, how fast
is the top of the ladder

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.100
descending?

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.730
So you know, it
might also be moving

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.188
in some other
directions, but we're

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:07.015
just interested in how quickly
it's going straight down.

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:08.890
So, OK, so first, let's
talk about the things

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.640
that don't change.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.220
So the height of this
wall is not changing.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.430
The wall is staying
put the whole time.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.380
And the length of the
ladder is not changing.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.050
That's staying put, as well.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.550
But what--

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.799
OK, so those are the fixed
quantities in this problem.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.600
Basically, everything
else is changing.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.210
So for example, this distance
between the base of the wall

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.800
and the base of
the ladder, that's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800
changing because the
ladder is being pulled away

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.610
from the wall.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.790
So we can give that a name.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330
Let's call that-- that's
a horizontal distance,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.840
so we can call that x, say.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.070
And the height of the top
of the ladder is changing,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.460
so let's draw that in.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.930
That's what we're interested in.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.090
It's the height, so
we can call it y.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.200
And let's see.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.910
What else?

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.485
Well OK, the whole ladder
isn't changing in length,

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.815
but the amount, but
as this gets pulled,

00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:08.240
you know, this top point
is sort of sliding down

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.620
towards the wall, the amount
of the ladder that extends

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.056
over the wall is changing.

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.180
So I guess we could choose.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.210
We could give this
a variable name

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.130
or we could give this
part a variable name.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.646
I think I'm going to give the
little one a variable name.

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:26.130
I'll call it d for
distance, I guess.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.630
And, OK.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.430
So if this is d, because the
whole ladder has length 20,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.930
we have that this part, this
segment has length 20 minus d.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.040
OK so, I think that
those quantities

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.190
describe all the
possible lengths

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.520
of interest in this picture.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.020
So now, OK.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.850
So that's just the
first, the set up.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.860
That's the first thing
that has to happen.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.629
Now after we set up,
we need to figure out

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.170
what the relationships between
these different variables are.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.670
Well, let's see.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.440
What have we got?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.030
Well one thing we've
got is that we've

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.030
got a right triangle here.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.200
So the wall and the
ground and the ladder.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.535
Those three segments
form a right triangle.

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:18.060
So OK.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.530
So we can apply the
Pythagorean Theorem here.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.290
So that's one
relationship we have,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.600
and that's going to give
us a relationship between x

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.700
and well, OK, 20 minus d.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.015
So that'll give us a
relationship between x and d.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:33.390
So this, so OK, so what does
the Pythagorean Theorem say?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.060
So by the Pythagorean
Theorem, we

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.687
have x squared plus-- that's
a 1-- 12 squared is equal

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:49.580
to the quantity 20
minus d squared.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.600
So that's one identity that
we have, identity we have that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.620
relates these three quantities.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.550
And so that's good.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.340
Because we know how
fast x is changing.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.580
And so with this
identity, that means

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.950
we can use related rates
to figure out how fast d

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.310
is changing, as well.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.002
So that's good.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.710
That'll be a step in
the right direction,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.155
but what we actually need to
know is how fast y is changing.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.102
So-- right?

00:06:18.102 --> 00:06:19.560
Because that's what
the question is

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.700
asking for-- how quickly
is the top of the ladder

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.658
approaching the ground?

00:06:22.658 --> 00:06:25.190
So how, what's the
rate of change in y

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.220
with respect to time?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.470
So I need another
identity here in order

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.780
to figure out what the
relationship with y is

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.620
and these other variables.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.610
And there are a couple
of different ways

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.640
to go about this.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.200
I think the one that I'm
going to do-- so there

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.900
is another right triangle here.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.360
So you could, if you wanted
to name this segment,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.714
as well, then you could
do another right triangle.

00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:53.380
But then you'd need
a third relationship

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.434
relating this segment to
d or something like that.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:06:57.850
So I'm not going
to go that route,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.170
but I'm going to go do
something related to that, which

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.100
is that this bigger
right triangle, right,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.660
which has the height of the top
of the ladder from the ground

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.340
and the whole length of the
ladder as two of its sides,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.960
and a piece of the ground, so
that bigger right triangle is

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.785
similar to this
smaller right triangle.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:17.841
Right?

00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:19.590
I mean, they have,
they're right triangles

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.930
and they have the
same base angle there.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.150
So they're similar triangles.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
So OK, so by similar
triangles-- now

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.420
I have to remember all
my geometry, right?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.440
So the ratio of corresponding
sides are equal,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.910
so in this case, the
ratio of the hypotenuses

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.640
is equal to the
ratio of these legs.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.905
And that'll relate-- so
the hypotenuses involve d.

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.280
And the vertical legs, well,
one of them is just constant

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.430
and one of them involves y.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.000
So that'll set up a
relationship between d and y,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.940
and so then I'll
have x linked to d

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.381
and I'll have d linked to y.

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.880
And so then we can
use related rates

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.170
to figure out what the
relationship between y and x

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.840
is and figure out the
thing we're after,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.392
which is the rate
of change in y.

00:08:03.392 --> 00:08:05.725
So OK, so I haven't actually
written anything down, yet.

00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:08.660
So what is the similar triangle?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.930
So here, let's look
at the hypotenuses.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.930
So the big hypotenuse
has length 20,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:25.391
and the small hypotenuse
has length 20 minus d.

00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:25.890
Good.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.550
So that's the ratio
of the hypotenuses,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.530
and so that has to
be equal to the ratio

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.420
of the corresponding legs.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:40.494
And so the big leg is y,
and the small leg is 12.

00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:40.994
OK.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.710
All right, so there's
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.970
There's similar triangles.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.020
So we now have the
relationships that we're after,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.880
relating x and y and
d all to each other.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.250
Great.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:01.440
So now we can do the calculus
part of this problem, right?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.270
So, now we know--

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.330
oh, I guess, actually, we
need a few more things.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.080
Take it back.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.000
So now we need the condition.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.900
We're after this at a
particular moment in time,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.670
and at our particular
moment in time--

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.840
so I haven't used
this one given yet,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.927
that 5 feet of the wall-- oh,
sorry-- 5 feet of the ladder

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:20.885
projects over the wall.

00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:35.430
So OK, so, at our moment,
so at the key moment,

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.850
we have that d is equal to 5.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:45.690
OK, so that means 20
minus d is equal to 15.

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:49.460
What else does that mean?

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.900
So that means that
at that moment,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.390
x in this right triangle
is the third leg

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.410
in a right triangle with
hypotenuse 15 and one leg 12.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.790
So that's one of
your 3-4-5 triangles,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.150
but blown up a little bit.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.819
So we have at that moment,
that x is equal to 9.

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:10.610
And OK, so at that
moment, to figure out y,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.325
we can use this other
relationship that we have.

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:18.950
So 20 over 15 is
equal to y over 12,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:25.620
so y is equal to 20
over 15 times 12.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.810
So that's 4 over
3, so that's 16.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.700
So at our key moment
in time, these

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.160
are the values that we're
going to end up plugging in.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.330
And also, dx/dt is equal to 5.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.252
x is being increased.

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:42.752
Increased?

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:49.880
Yeah x is, right, so as
the foot gets pulled away,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.730
x is getting bigger.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.063
So x is being increased
at 5 units per second.

00:10:53.063 --> 00:10:55.646
All right, so these are all the
things we're going to plug in.

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:57.620
All right, good.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:04.270
So now we are after
dy/dt at this moment.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.750
And we don't have a
relation-- so, we know dx/dt.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.185
We don't have a direct
relationship between y and x,

00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:14.460
but we do have a direct
relationship between y and d.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:22.940
So if we got dd/dt-- sorry--
dd/dt, then we could get dy/dt,

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.221
and because of this
relationship, we can get dd/dt.

00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:26.720
All right.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.890
So let's start
off by doing that.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.470
So OK, so this is an identity.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.690
It holds always, so we
can differentiate it.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.020
And we're going to differentiate
it with respect to t.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.591
x and d are functions of t.

00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:38.090
So OK.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:49.010
So differentiating this
identity I get 2x times dx/dt

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.870
plus-- well, OK, derivative
of 144 with respect to t

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:58.060
is 0-- is equal to-- I guess
I could expand this out,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.610
but it's easier just to use
the chain rule right away.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:07.250
So this is equal to
2 times 20 minus d

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.070
times the derivative of
20 minus d with respect

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:16.190
to t, which is minus dd/dt.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.710
All right.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.710
I beg the gods of math notation
to forgive me for dd/dt.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.020
But, OK.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.280
So, all right, so now--
this is always true.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.280
And what we want is the value of
dd/dt at our particular moment

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.310
in time.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.460
So at our particular moment in
time we have-- well let's see,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.760
so OK, we have x, we have
the dx/dt, and we have d.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.820
So we can just plug
all those things in.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.030
So, at our moment--

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.030
let me see how I'm
going to do this.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.200
I'll do it over here.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:07.960
At our moment-- so 2x is 18
times dx/dt is 5 equals 2 times

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:17.620
20 minus d is 15
times minus dd/dt.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.260
And dd/dt is what we're after.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.760
So OK.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.980
So divide 2 into this is 9.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:34.220
45 divided by 15 is 3, so
dd/dt is equal to minus 3

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.981
at the moment that
we're interested in.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.480
All right.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.800
Great.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.637
So now we have
dd/dt, and so now we

00:13:40.637 --> 00:13:42.220
can go back to the
second relationship

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.900
we have, the one
that relates d and y,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.790
and we can do the
same thing here.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.790
We can take a derivative,
use the chain rule,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:57.160
use, and get a relationship
between dy/dt and d and dd/dt.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.440
And then we'll be able to
plug in all these values we

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.310
have for our particular moment.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.661
So OK, so I think I'm just going
to differentiate this straight.

00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:09.660
There are some simplifications
I could do first,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.770
but it'll work fine if
we just do it straight.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.797
So OK, so I need to
compute the derivative.

00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:16.630
This is an identity.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.190
I can take its derivative,
so I differentiate

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.980
the left-hand side
with respect to t,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:29.431
so I get 20 over-- so this
is a minus first power-- so I

00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:34.060
get minus 20 over
20 minus d quantity

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.830
squared times-- I need the
derivative of the bottom--

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:44.140
is minus dd/dt.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:55.150
And on the right-hand
side I get dy/dt over 12.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.806
So I have this relationship
between d and y,

00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:00.180
I take its
derivative, now I have

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.620
a relationship that involves
dy/dt, which is the thing

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.150
that I'm after.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.290
So, whew.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.760
So now, I'm back at
this plugging-in stage.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.030
So at our moment in
time, I know what d is,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.390
and I just figured
out what dd/dt

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.760
is, so I can just
plug those values in

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.050
to figure out what dy/dt is.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.140
So OK, so let's do that.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.730
So at this moment
in time we have-- so

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.670
let me just multiply
through by the 12

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.260
and that will let us
solve-- so we have dy/dt

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:41.670
is equal to 12 times-- well, so
it's minus 20 over 15 squared,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.050
times minus minus 3.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.150
Times 3.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.610
So this is-- all right.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.392
Arithmetic.

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:54.850
Not my favorite
thing in the world.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.810
So we've got two 3's here.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.240
We're going to end up with
a 5 in the denominator,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:09.850
and then we've got 4 times minus
4, so that's minus 16 over 5.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.521
So.

00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:13.020
All right.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.160
So that's the answer.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.980
Let's remember what we've done.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.210
So minus 16 over 5,
that's a negative number.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.880
Why is it a negative number?

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.160
Well, as we pull this, the
bottom of this ladder here,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.825
away from the wall,
the top of the ladder

00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.804
is going to fall
downwards, it's going

00:16:35.804 --> 00:16:36.970
to get closer to the ground.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.167
And y is the vertical
distance between the ground

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.250
and the top of the ladder.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.840
So that's shrinking; y
is shrinking and should

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.290
have a negative derivative.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.150
OK.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.194
Negative derivative, minus
16 over 5 feet per second.

00:16:51.194 --> 00:16:55.240
So it would take, if this
instantaneous rate held up,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.240
which it won't in this
situation-- if it held up

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.960
it would take 5 seconds
to get down, so it's not

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.940
falling very quickly.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.440
OK.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.320
That seems about right.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.290
Anything else?

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.290
I guess we computed that
dd/dt was also negative.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.150
Same thing here.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.189
When you pull this way, this
length is going to shrink,

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:15.480
so d is getting smaller, so
it has negative derivative.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.660
OK.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.130
So at this moment in time,
the top of the ladder

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.360
is falling-- the thing we're
interested in-- at exactly

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.880
16 over 5 feet per second.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.420
And we're all set.
