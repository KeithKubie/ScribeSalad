[MUSIC - PEARL JAM, "PENDULUM"]

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:39.017
MALE SPEAKER: I'll talk.

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:41.649
MALE SPEAKER: Who
the hell are you?

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.440
MALE SPEAKER: The United
States of America.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.226
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're
building a weapon.

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:52.698
MALE SPEAKER: It's called
an atomic chain reaction.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.536
MALE SPEAKER: There is a spy.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:56.488
MALE SPEAKER: You are
in a world of trouble

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:57.952
from sea to shining sea.

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.184
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'll bet you
overhear all kinds of secrets.

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.880
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi, everyone.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.920
Welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.190
Today it's my pleasure to
welcome David Ellison, Dana

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.210
Goldberg, Sam Shaw,
and Marcy Ross

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.551
from "Manhattan" and
Skydance Productions.

00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:21.050
Thank you guys for
joining us today.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.890
So I would love to
know-- this is to Sam.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.700
What made you go, I
want to make a show

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.810
about making the atomic bomb.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.560
SAM SHAW: First off,
thanks for having us.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.130
It's great to be here,
but that's actually not

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.640
what I set out to do.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.500
This is a creative
process that I would not

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.850
recommend to anyone, but
about six or seven years ago I

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.504
sat down to write something
about a totally different war

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:44.420
in a different decade.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.410
I was writing what I thought
was going to be-- and also

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.680
by the way, not a TV show.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.700
So basically I struck out
in every possible way.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.110
I thought I was going to
write a feature about the war

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.890
on terror set in the
present, and about people

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.360
who are involved in matters
of national security

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.160
and secret work, and what
the implications are for them

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.040
in their personal lives.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.990
And in the process
of doing what I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.700
was training to do as
a journalist, which

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.090
is what I did before I wrote
for television, which is that I

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.087
just buried myself in research.

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:14.670
What I began to
discover is, if you're

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.210
sort of interested in
questions of national security

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.760
and this sort of
towering secrecy edifice

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.960
that is at the heart of so much
of our political conversation

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.530
these days, you find
that all roads lead back

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.024
to the New Mexico
desert and that really

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.440
the story of the
birth of the bomb

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.482
is kind of the story of
the birth of 21st century

00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.440
America and the world
that we're living in now.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.860
So I went down a very,
very, very deep rabbit hole,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.930
and I'm still down
there somewhere now six

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.090
or seven years later.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.970
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hidden
away in the desert.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.780
SAM SHAW: I am.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.870
I am [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.780
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So
at what point did

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.520
this come to Skydance, though?

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.940
At what point do you
go, OK, you know what?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.060
It is going to be
television show.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.200
It's going to be set in
this time in this era.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.960
Who's going to help me make it?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.480
SAM SHAW: So I wrote a draft.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.280
I revised it.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130
I wrote about 20
drafts, and finally it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.963
became the thing it was
sort of going to be,

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:05.020
and I partnered up with my
partner in crime creatively,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.930
Tommy Schlamme, our executive
producer and director,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.710
who is very well
known in television.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.340
Won about a million Emmys
for "The West Wing"--

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.180
principally is what
he's known for.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.724
And then we went looking for
some congenial partners who

00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:20.890
would help us get this thing
made, and first of all,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.710
it's an incredibly ambitious
and complicated show to make.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.290
Period.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
Full stop, but particularly
on television, particularly

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.450
on basic cable.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.860
So finding people who had the
right creative sensibilities,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.030
who loved this subject
matter and loved the story as

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.600
much as we did-- it
was sort of a miracle

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.404
that we wound up with
the folks on this stage.

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:43.320
And so we sat down
together, I guess, probably

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.650
about-- I don't know--
two and a half years ago

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.670
or something like that.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.465
It was this very refreshing
thing where it was really

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:52.840
just a few people in the room,
and we talked passionately

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.400
about the subject matter, and
by the end of the meeting,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.532
they said, let's go make
a TV show, and we did.

00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:00.490
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Was there
anything scary to you

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.640
guys about the scope of
this television show?

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640
It's a period piece.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.314
It's about a very tough
time in US history.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.480
DAVID ELLISON: Dana, please.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.690
DANA GOLDBERG: Not really.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.090
To be honest, a credit to
Sam and, as you said, Tommy.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.800
We read the script,
and we just loved it.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.040
We thought it was
beautiful, and as you said,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.930
we all got in a room
together, and we

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.050
felt like we really found people
who so understood the subject

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.376
matter, and the
beauty of the script

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:28.750
and for us the
beauty of the show

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.320
is, yes, you have this
incredible historical backdrop,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.410
but it was really about the
characters, and to this day

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.540
we always say one of the
first things that Sam said to

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.020
us is, yes, it's a
show about Los Alamos,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.970
and yes it's about people
who built the bomb.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.840
It's really a show
about secrets and lies,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.298
and it's about the
secrets and lies

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.240
that, yes, the government
can tell scientists,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.650
but it's really about the lies
between husbands, and wives,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.060
and families, and what the
ramifications of those lies

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.820
are.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.365
So we felt incredibly
comfortable in that room.

00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.781
MARCY ROSS: And I
just want to add

00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:03.650
it's also about timing,
because the landscape has

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.270
changed so much in the
television business.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.120
So it was a perfect timing
between incredible material,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.000
broad, hugely ambitious
subject matter, and scope,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.850
but the television
business was able-- there

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.840
was a network there that
was able to support it

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.001
and was not afraid of it.

00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.250
And I think a few years ago
people would've definitely

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.154
been afraid of it.

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:29.320
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think you
make an excellent point,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.410
and one of the things that
I loved about the show,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.500
and I think that we here at
Google especially can relate to

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.999
is it's this kind
of isolation where

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:37.990
you're working on something
that you can't talk about.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.620
And you're maybe surrounded by
a bunch of other really smart

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.203
people, but those are the only
ones you can talk to you about,

00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:45.580
and there's competition,
and there's personalities,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.120
and there's all sorts
of that, but they're

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.710
working with a very
technical subject matter.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.960
How do you make that
relatable for audiences?

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.700
Is that where the
character part comes in?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.860
SAM SHAW: Well, it
is actually in a way.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.567
The job that I had immediately
before I got the chance

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.150
to make this show
that I'd been hoping

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.774
to make for all these
years was working

00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:07.880
on a Showtime show,
"Masters of Sex,"

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.894
which is also a show
oddly-- they share some DNA.

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:12.560
It's also a show about
science, and it's

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.170
about the collision
between science,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.689
and culture, and ethics, but
we had this rule of thumb

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.230
on that show, which is that sex
could never exist on "Masters

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.130
of Sex" just for sex's sake.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.720
Although by the
way, sex is probably

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.380
more obvious as a sales
pitch to a network

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.692
than nuclear physics
is, but the deal

00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:36.650
was it always had to be
a vehicle for character

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.194
storytelling.

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:39.360
So to the extent that a sex
scene could sort of help

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.720
us to come to understand what
made these characters tick

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.925
or sort of dramatize some
essential conflict-- then

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:44.925
it belonged on the show.

00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:46.379
It wasn't there to titillate.

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.920
Now, I don't know
how many people are

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.200
titillated by nuclear physics.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.491
I happen to find it really,
really, really fascinating,

00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.340
I must say, as a non-physicist.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.530
I'm not a scientist,
but I've come

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.470
to be really fascinated
by the science,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.320
but for us it was the same rule.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.831
There is a lot of
science in our show,

00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:04.330
but our challenge-- and it's
sort of the gift of the subject

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.120
matter-- is to find
ways to let science

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.977
be an engine for deep
character storytelling,

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:11.810
to let it reveal things
about our characters

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.080
that we didn't know, and
we're constantly trying

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.621
to find new ways to do that.

00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:19.620
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
mentioned the science of it.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.940
Did you guys bring in
consultants for it?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.300
I assume you did a bunch of
historical research on this.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.920
SAM SHAW: We just
made it all up.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.020
No, we didn't.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.220
We have a few-- I was
going to say an army.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.670
It's as small army.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:35.100
We have a few incredibly smart
and really, really heroically

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.810
patient consultants
who work with us.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.790
Now, all the writers on our
show-- we love the research,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.420
and we love the subject
matter, but we get stuff wrong,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.000
and it's an incredibly
specific set of talents

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.070
you have to have as a
consultant to understand

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.660
what the story needs are that
at the heart of the question.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.340
And so we have a physicist at
UCLA named David Saltzburg, who

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.840
is incredible, and there's
a nuclear historian

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.360
named Alex Wellerstein,
who writes exclusively

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.869
about issues of secrecy
and the atomic bomb,

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:03.160
and does it really brilliantly.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.300
So he helps keep us honest, too.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.190
MARCY ROSS: It's really
fun when John always

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.010
talks about having to
familiarize himself

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.610
with the math and the science,
and he was a complete math nerd

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.050
in high school, and how this has
made him feel so much smarter.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.515
SAM SHAW: Yeah, the thing
that John Benjamin Hickey, who

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:21.056
plays Frank on our
show, likes to say

00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:22.510
is that before he
started the show

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.849
he called up some buddies who
work on "Big Bang Theory,"

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:26.890
and he was like, you've
got to give me some tips.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.000
And they said, always make
sure that they give you

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.600
the last couple numbers of
the equation, that they just

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
tell you what those are.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.641
And they say, action, and
you just write them in,

00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.756
and you look very, very smart.

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:37.630
He does it very well.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.539
DANA HAN-KLEIN: He does.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.580
How do you strike a balance
between incorporating

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.310
the obviously real world events
and characters-- like you

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.890
can't have a show
about the atomic bomb

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.992
without Oppenheimer.

00:08:48.992 --> 00:08:51.450
How do you strike a balance
between that and then exploring

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.366
this universe that you
guys have also created,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:57.720
because it's a
fictionalization of the history

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.770
that we're familiar with.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.180
SAM SHAW: Yeah, well
there's two things.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.440
One is-- that I was sort of
amazed by-- actually for such

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.530
an incredibly important
moment in our history--

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.919
I think it is an origin
story, and it really

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.460
has a lot to say
about who we became.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.630
For such an important
moment, actually I

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.280
think a lay audience doesn't
really know a lot about it,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.790
and that was the first thing
that was exciting to me

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.890
about the story-- is that I
knew a bit about the science,

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.990
but I did not know that
there is this town that

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.420
was built almost overnight
in the desert on top

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.370
of a dead volcano, surrounded
by barbed wire fences.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.050
And all these incredibly
brilliant people, the greatest

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.950
geniuses on the planet, came
together to build this weapon,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.030
but we were just talking
about this this morning.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.367
They brought their families,
and there were kids,

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:40.950
when there are kids,
you need schools,

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.320
and you need teachers to
teach those kids at schools.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.650
And you need grocers,
and you need contractors

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.690
to build the buildings.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.750
So there's this huge, teaming
community that cropped up

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:55.710
overnight, and only the tiniest
minority, a tiny percentage,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.140
less than 10% of
the people living

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.160
in this place had any idea what
the purpose of the town was.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.700
So that was this incredibly
riveting thing to me,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.720
but that was what
really captured

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.300
me-- was that emotional
dynamic, what it is to try

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.509
to lead a life in this place.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:15.049
And what it suggested was that
we needed to tell story really

00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:17.410
about fictional characters
set against the backdrop

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.940
of this historical moment so
that we would have the freedom

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.560
to kind of explore their
interior lives in the way

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.370
that we wanted to.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.380
Now of course, Oppenheimer
pops up from time

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.220
to time, mostly in
the first season

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.150
as this kind of Olympian god.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.910
His shadow is cast
over the events.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.250
He plays more of a role
in the second season,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.120
but for the most part,
what we tried to do

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.960
is use the history
as kind of a stage

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.350
on which the dramas of
these fictional characters

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.816
are played out.

00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:47.440
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And the stage of
the town-- my understanding is

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.580
it's a big set.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.000
Could you guys talk
about the commitment to--

00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:57.720
DAVID ELLISON: [INAUDIBLE], Sam.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.190
MARCY ROSS: You want to go?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.731
SAM SHAW: Well,
here's what I'll say.

00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:01.980
MARCY ROSS: It's an
extraordinary experience.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.880
It's sort of like being
on a Google campus,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.400
where it's all encompassing.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.980
When you visit the set--
and basically Sam and Tommy

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.770
created this environment
that, if it's raining,

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.750
our actors will be wet, just
as they were wet and muddy

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.210
as they were tromping through
the town back in the '40s.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.850
So there's a level of
immersion and reality

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.530
that's kind of extraordinary.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.410
When you visit it
it, the ashtrays

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:36.530
have the exact brand
stubs of cigarettes.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.680
You open up the drawers.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.411
Everything is accurate
at such a deep level.

00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:42.535
It's sort of extraordinary.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.535
SAM SHAW: No, it's nuts.

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:48.380
And it's so antithetical to the
way that TV usually gets made.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.562
Usually just because
of the budgets

00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:52.270
and these incredibly
punishing schedules,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.830
we have to make these
episodes so quickly.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.340
So usually you're
on a sound stage,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.298
and you're shooting on
stages, and the lighting

00:11:57.298 --> 00:12:01.030
is really controlled, but
Tommy had the audacity

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.580
to think that the way to make
this show feel the way that we

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.440
wanted it to feel, all of us,
was just do what the Army did,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.700
which is that we built a town.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.120
And we are lucky enough
to find this 11 acre

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.919
compound of 1940s buildings in
Santa Fe that we got use of,

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:16.710
and we rehabbed it.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.895
And so it really is like
Colonial Williamsburg,

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.270
except instead of
churning butter

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.965
you go and you invent
the apocalypse.

00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:26.830
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
There's something

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.246
that I found interesting that
I feel like there's actually

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:31.740
more diversity in the
show than there would

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.350
have been in the actual town.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.050
And the internet sometimes
[? might lie to me ?] also.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.450
Maybe back that up, but I
like seeing the diversity,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.370
and I like seeing this
representation of also

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.312
these characters who were very
marginalized in the history

00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:45.770
books, where it's
like, yeah, there

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.290
are people of all
shapes, colors,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.170
whatever contributing
to these projects,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.040
and yet we don't
get to see them.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.270
Was that something you
knew from the beginning

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.395
that you wanted to incorporate
so you could explore

00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.390
those issues, or was that
something that came along

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.040
as you were developing it?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.340
SAM SHAW: Well, quite
honestly it was a challenge.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.024
That is a really
tricky question when

00:13:04.024 --> 00:13:05.690
you're dealing with
the historical time,

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.590
because-- well look, we're
interested in the fact

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.900
that antisemitism is part of
the conversation of our show.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.620
Look at what was
happening in Europe,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.227
and that was the pretext for
this race to build a bomb,

00:13:18.227 --> 00:13:19.810
and so it was important
for that to be

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.601
part of a conversation
in spite of the fact

00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:23.810
that a lot of the
physicists in this place

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:29.760
were expatriate
European Jews, but we

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.140
were somewhat constrained
because it was largely

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.050
a pretty white community
of scientists there,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.260
but that wasn't
entirely the case.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.880
So we have tried to find ways to
bring in as diverse an ensemble

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.040
of voices as we can in
the show, and that's

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.570
part of what's exciting to us.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:52.190
And in writing about women at
Los Alamos, and the experience

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.870
of female physicists, and the
experience of brilliant women

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.210
who were wives, who were
excluded from the secret--

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.210
those are the kind of
people who I think usually

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.330
are left on the margins of
stories about the Manhattan

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.090
Project and about this
moment in history.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.360
And so it was
interesting to us to try

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.059
to find a way to make those
voices part of the discussion.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.350
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And just from
a personal point of view.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.308
My grandmother worked on
the Manhattan Project.

00:14:15.308 --> 00:14:16.160
Not in Los Alamos.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.670
MARCY ROSS: Wow.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.711
SAM SHAW: That's amazing.

00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:19.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
So it's very nice

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.310
to see her-- not her exact
work, but her contribution

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.472
rewarded in a way.

00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:25.930
It's like something
that only maybe

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.880
my family would
have known about,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.200
but now it's like, oh no, look.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
There were ladies there.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.840
There were people of color.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.700
There were all these sorts
of different characters

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.040
contributing to history,
like America's melting pot.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.320
So I appreciate that personally
as an audience member,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.779
seeing this kind
of representation.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.736
And you bring up a great
point about the women,

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:44.920
where I love that there
are these two very hyper

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.820
intelligent strong
women who were

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.280
trapped in a time era that isn't
necessarily welcoming of that.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.049
And one of them is in a position
of being included to a degree,

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:56.840
being a contributing
member on the project,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.050
and then this other character
who's just kind of trapped

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.920
and sort of being punished
for her intelligence.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.250
So I would love to
know, is that something

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.650
that you discovered going-- as
you developed the characters,

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.005
or was it something ahead of
time you saw these situations

00:15:12.005 --> 00:15:14.130
and went this is how I'm
going to represent the two

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.875
ends of that spectrum?

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:17.250
SAM SHAW: Well,
it is a spectrum,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.365
and it evolves in
the second season.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.190
One thing that was interesting,
but also constraining

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.940
for us in the first
season is that

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.330
a few of our
principal characters--

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.290
Liza, played by Olivia
Williams-- Abby,

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.270
played by Rachel
Brosnahan-- they

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.470
are at a structural disadvantage
in our storytelling,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.260
because they're not
able to penetrate

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.640
to the nucleus of this secret.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.370
And that means that they
can't put their hands

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.080
on this sort of
central drama that

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.340
is the spine around
which the show is built.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.580
That changes in the
second season in some ways

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.680
that I don't want to
say too much about,

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.471
because I think it's
exciting storytelling,

00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:00.980
but it activates
them as characters

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.317
in the story in a
really exciting way.

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:05.400
But yeah, absolutely we
were interested in writing

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.840
about that and exploring
those questions.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.430
There is something fascinating
to me about the fact

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.420
that this moment, World War II,
actually created opportunities

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.840
for women that hadn't
existed before, some of which

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.770
went away when the war ended.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.400
And so that was a thing
that-- and Katja Herbers

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.750
plays Helen in our show.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.570
She talks about that,
as that, in an odd way,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.780
although she's working to end
this incredibly catastrophic

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.860
war, she's sort of aware of
this bittersweet fact, which

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.280
is that it's like the chariot
turns back into a pumpkin

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.547
as soon as that war
ends in a way for her.

00:16:41.547 --> 00:16:43.630
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'd love
to talk about season two,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.540
because I cheated.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.830
I've seen a little bit
of it, and it definitely

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.100
feels very intense.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.110
It feels like the
stakes have been raised.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.376
Obviously the real life
stakes were being raised.

00:16:54.376 --> 00:16:56.500
We're getting closer and
closer to real life events

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.510
that they needed to get
this bomb built for,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.693
but was it a conscious
decision going into season two

00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:05.609
to be like, OK, let's
really turn up the heat.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:06.540
We've established this world.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.089
We've established
these characters.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.963
Or was it more based on
the timeline of where

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:13.270
they were in the real world?

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.192
MARCY ROSS: I'll
start [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:18.400
It's really difficult to
speak about the show sitting

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.770
next to Sam because no one talks
about the show as well as Sam

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.060
does, but from our
perspective, looking at it,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.360
what season two really
feels like is 10 chapters

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.540
of incredibly wild thriller.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.170
To me it's like
the span of it is

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.030
how do you-- it takes
place over 15 months--

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.740
and how do you put that
much story in 10 episodes?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.120
It's kind of extraordinary
how they did it

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.809
so that it's like that--
it's so unexpected to have

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:54.850
this kind of thrill ride.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.956
When you actually
know the ending,

00:17:56.956 --> 00:17:58.830
but you still are biting
your nails thinking,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.780
how are they going
to solve this?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.020
Or what's the
outcome going to be?

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.100
SAM SHAW: Yeah, that
was our sort of goal,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.270
in a way-- was we all felt that
by the end of the first season

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.820
the storytelling has hit
this break neck pace,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.849
and every event has huge
ramifications for everybody

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:21.890
in the world of the show.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.723
There's a sense that
the people who come out

00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:25.634
the other end of this
experience are not

00:18:25.634 --> 00:18:27.050
going to be exactly
the people who

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.470
went into it in the beginning.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.495
And what we didn't want to do
was take our foot off the gas,

00:18:33.495 --> 00:18:35.750
and slow down, and
rebuild, and have

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.449
four or five seasons of
exposition to set of stories.

00:18:39.449 --> 00:18:41.740
And partially that just
wouldn't have felt honest given

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.790
the subject matter.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.930
They're careening toward
this event, and it's coming.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.272
And in a way, it just
felt important to us

00:18:49.272 --> 00:18:52.650
to have the storytelling
accelerate as well.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.070
So that's kind of what
this second season is.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.145
We throw the characters through
the windshield of the story.

00:18:58.145 --> 00:18:58.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I have to ask.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.020
For those of you at
the studio, is it

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.080
one of the scary moments
when you're like,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.490
this show has to have
an end theoretically.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:03.990
It's great.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.560
It's successful, but there
is a real world event

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.760
that ends it, or is the idea
just sort of let it organically

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.640
play out?

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640
DAVID ELLISON: No, I
think one of things

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.306
that was really
remarkable when we first

00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:17.880
got involved with the show
was-- as Dana said earlier,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.410
Sam had written a script which
we all fell in love with,

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.685
but when we were fortunate
enough to partner with Sam

00:19:23.685 --> 00:19:25.435
and actually took the
show to the network,

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:28.740
Sam knew what all five seasons
were before we started shooting

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.900
a frame of episode one.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.110
And I think what is
really interesting is

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.980
the bomb dropping-- there is so
much in the history about Los

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.550
Alamos that happened even
after those events actually

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.680
occurred that there is so much
history and texture to explore.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.971
And what Sam has
done brilliantly,

00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:48.470
much like if you think about
something like "Titanic," which

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.550
was a huge phenomenon
and everyone

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.258
knew that the boat
sank at the end of it,

00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:52.790
but you're riveted
by the character

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.190
stories that are taking place.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.625
And I think really
the familial stories

00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:01.015
that Sam has told in the show
are riveting, and beautiful,

00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:03.140
and incredibly exciting to
watch on a weekly basis.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.900
They keep you
wanting to come back,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.269
despite the event that you might
be hurling yourself towards.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:09.810
SAM SHAW: Yeah, I
will also say, too,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.450
that just-- because it
would seem like a story that

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.129
has an obvious conclusion--
we sort of are brushing up

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:17.170
against this, but it would
seem like a story that

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.910
has an obvious endpoint, but
the truth is the trick up

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.950
the sleeve narratively
to me has always

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.999
been that, while
it appears to be

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:27.540
a show about the
end of World War II,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.420
it's really a show about the
beginning of the Atomic Age

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.160
that followed it.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.840
And so for me,
from my standpoint,

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.740
actually the most exciting
and interesting story material

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.420
takes place after
this war has ended,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.830
and Los Alamos
remained the center

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.040
for weapons development
for decades afterward.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.890
Still is, but that great
moral clarity of World War II

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.980
was gone, and so at that moment
where we enter this Cold War

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.590
arms race instead
and what that means

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.330
for people who have been
party to this act of violence

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.570
for good or for ill.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.891
That's a really exciting
part of the story to us.

00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:08.390
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'd love to
know without any spoilers what's

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.160
the topic that you're
all most excited that we

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.368
get to explore in season two?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.280
MARCY ROSS: For me, it's
always about the characters,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.930
and I think there's
not one character that

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:28.120
ends up at the end of
season two that anyone

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.170
will have seen coming.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.260
So I really don't want
to give anything away,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.950
but I think, too, what
Sam did so brilliantly

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.670
is the notion of
how we reintroduce

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.146
Frank Winters at the end.

00:21:43.146 --> 00:21:45.020
It's such a cliffhanger
what happened to him,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.540
and it's very unconventional
how we start the season and then

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.400
the slow reveal of
who Frank is, and I

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.630
think people-- the journey
he's on this season-- he

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:01.550
and Charlie-- it's kind of
an extraordinary melding,

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.095
and mixing, and coming
out on the other side,

00:22:04.095 --> 00:22:06.364
if that's not too vague.

00:22:06.364 --> 00:22:08.050
DANA GOLDBERG: It's
a little vague.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.300
MARCY ROSS: It's a lot vague,
because I'm staring at--

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.425
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But you're
preserving the audience.

00:22:12.425 --> 00:22:13.634
You're not spoiling anything.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.760
SAM SHAW: It's just building
on what Marcy was saying.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.790
It's funny talking
about this at Google,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.026
because one thing that's
been interesting to us

00:22:26.026 --> 00:22:28.400
in writing the show is it is
very much a show about work,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.580
and the culture
of work, and what

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.230
it is when you're in
an enclosed environment

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.200
with really really, really
smart people working

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.300
on the same project.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.044
And I can analogize
in my own small way

00:22:40.044 --> 00:22:42.460
to the experience of working
on a show in a writer's room,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.660
but there's a
moment where you get

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.254
lost in the fog
of the work, and I

00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:49.670
think that was very much the
experience of a lot of people

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.628
who worked on the bomb.

00:22:50.628 --> 00:22:53.120
So the thing to me
that is most exciting

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.420
about this second season,
besides the fact that we've

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.045
talked about an atomic
bomb for a while

00:22:57.045 --> 00:22:59.570
and we might actually
get to see one this year,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.466
is the journey that Frank--
that John Benjamin Hickey takes

00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:05.340
Frank on over the course
of the season, which

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.520
is from being the
person who is in a way

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:14.210
the most dogged, Ahab-like
proponent of the idea

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.439
that we have to build this
bomb and end this war,

00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:18.480
and a guy who has
compartmentalized and repressed

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.680
a lot of misgivings
and self-doubt in order

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.410
to deliver that weapon.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.310
He goes through a
set of circumstances

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.360
that fundamentally changes
his relationship to this thing

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.720
that he's helped
midwife into the world,

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.280
and I think that
generates some really,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.550
really exciting and powerful
character storytelling.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.630
And John, I have to say, is just
completely extraordinary in it

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.580
this season, as all of
our cast members are.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.999
MARCY ROSS: Yeah,
what Sam just said.

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:45.540
DANA GOLDBERG: I'll
say for me again,

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.331
going back to the very
first thing Sam ever

00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:50.280
said about this project
is it's the ramifications

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.300
of those secrets and those lies.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.470
You specifically pointed
out the female characters

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.790
who, in season one, obviously
don't really necessarily

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.070
have the knowledge of what's
going on in Los Alamos.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.350
And for me in season
two, it's fascinating,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.890
because with
knowledge comes power,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.180
but in this case also
can come a great burden

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.670
and what happens when
people who don't really

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.620
know what's going there find
out and how it affects someone

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.290
on both a very personal
level, and then

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.030
how it changes their characters,
because again suddenly you

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.100
know something you
didn't know before,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.620
and you know the
ramifications, and everything

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.184
changes as a result. And I think
the way Sam and the writers

00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:31.350
have written that this
season is just extraordinary.

00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:35.830
DAVID ELLISON: Again, it's
dovetailing off of it.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.288
It really is the
character journeys

00:24:37.288 --> 00:24:39.805
that our ensemble goes
through this season,

00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:41.930
and one of the relationships
that I've always loved

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.410
is the Frank and
Charlie relationship.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.610
And obviously those
characters in season one

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.436
take incredible turns
in terms of where

00:24:49.436 --> 00:24:50.810
the relationship
begins and where

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.760
the relationship ultimately
ends, and I think

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.270
that in season two, without
wanting to give anything away,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.500
Sam has really dialed that
in to a whole new level.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.120
And it's really,
really exciting,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.090
and we can't wait
for people to see it.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Great.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.560
MARCY ROSS: Can I just
add one more thing

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.851
that I think is so significant.

00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:07.020
What Sam has done
is the story is

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.320
told in a less linear fashion
than it was in season one.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.250
So you really are leaning in.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.960
So I think that
that's just really

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.230
a fascinating device
of storytelling.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.610
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'm curious
to know-- because Skydance

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.690
has done all these huge,
amazing, big blockbustery ones,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.170
and then now you guys have
these two very successful shows.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.170
And one is this
historical grounded--

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.930
and the other one is on
Netflix, and so what prompted

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.180
you guys to go, you know what?

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.179
These are our two.

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:38.470
This is when we're going to TV.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.610
DAVID ELLISON: When
we first set out

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.000
to start the television
division of the company,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.540
we wanted to do a
show that we felt

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.710
like could be the calling
card and the identity

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.980
for the company.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.240
So much about what you do first
defines you in entertainment.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.760
And much akin to when we did
"True Grit" with the Coen

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.900
Brothers as our first movie,
we wanted it to be something

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.750
that, A, first and foremost,
everybody here loved,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.410
but that we believed
could achieve

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:07.080
the-- if we all did our
jobs collectively right,

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.800
hopefully a level of both
commercial and critical

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.310
success, which is always such
a hard thing to find something

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.590
that really rises to
those two occasions.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.570
And "Manhattan" was
the first script

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.950
that we read that all of us
absolutely fell in love with.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.990
Dana actually read it
first, and called me,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.750
and said you have to read
this, and read it immediately.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.960
And then all of us collectively
looked at each other and said,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.510
we have to get this made.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.360
And got in a room with
Sam and with Tommy,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.020
and we were fortunate
enough that they decided

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.610
to trust us to help get this
show out into the world,

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.630
and we found terrific
partners at Lion's Gate

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.670
and then at WGN,
where everybody shared

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.750
the same passion for the story.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.284
And we're very thankful to now
be heading into season two.

00:26:54.284 --> 00:26:55.200
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Great.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.380
DANA GOLDBERG: I'd say
one of the things for us

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.950
that's guiding us, whether
you're talking about features

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.600
and whether it's a big
budget sci-fi fantasy movie,

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.270
or you're talking
about historical drama,

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.110
it all goes back to the story.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.610
It really is just,
do we love the story?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.530
Do we love these
characters, and do we

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.160
love the possibilities
of where they can go?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.240
Then combine with, is
the story in the hands?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.650
So "Manhattan" was an
obvious yes across the board

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.730
as a result of
that, because to be

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.480
able to spend time
with these characters

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.285
in this incredible backdrop
for us was a no brainer.

00:27:28.285 --> 00:27:30.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Marcy, I
want to go back to a point

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.826
that you made
earlier that I love.

00:27:31.826 --> 00:27:34.210
You talked about the changing
television landscape,

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.800
and I feel like
with all the respect

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.300
for a show that's
hyper intelligent,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.096
and about science,
and all that stuff.

00:27:40.096 --> 00:27:41.512
MARCY ROSS: Didn't
stand a chance.

00:27:41.512 --> 00:27:41.960
Did not stand a chance.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.220
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Not necessarily
going to stand a chance,

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.595
but it's great
that you guys have

00:27:44.595 --> 00:27:47.065
found a home for
it, and also, again,

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:48.430
"Grace and Frankie" on Netflix.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.670
So you guys have really
embraced this divergence

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.090
of trusting your audience.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.840
Are there other projects
that you guys are

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.700
excited to work on with that, or
are you incubating these babies

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.200
right now?

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.033
MARCY ROSS: Oh, yes.

00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:04.260
No, I have to say this is an
amazing time for television.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.560
I've been in the business--
in the conventional television

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.880
business, for over 20 years.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.790
So for me to look
out at the wild west,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.310
and there's 57 places
to sell content,

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.150
and there's so many
different ways to communicate

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.430
your specific vision for a show,
or to have a writer like Sam,

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.460
or Marta Kauffman,
or we're working

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.190
with some other
fantastic writers,

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.677
and basically sit with them
and say, what you want to do?

00:28:34.677 --> 00:28:36.510
Don't think about where
you want to sell it.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.490
Don't think about what
the potential of it

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.200
is in terms of business,
but just you do it,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.690
and you do it as best and with
most integrity that you can,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.530
and we will find a home for it.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.030
You never used to be
able to program that way.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.900
So it's creative drives
everything right now,

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.057
and that is
incredibly liberating.

00:28:57.057 --> 00:28:58.640
DANA HAN-KLEIN: As
an audience member,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.764
that's always nice to hear.

00:28:59.764 --> 00:29:01.290
MARCY ROSS: No, it's wonderful.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.710
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think my
last question for you guys

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.430
would be, if you were
living on the hill,

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.504
what job would you
have liked to have?

00:29:07.504 --> 00:29:09.170
SAM SHAW: That's a
very tricky question.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.930
MARCY ROSS: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.445
DANA GOLDBERG: Wow.

00:29:10.445 --> 00:29:12.430
SAM SHAW: What job would
I have liked to have?

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.125
Well, I've got to tell
you, Abby Isaac's--

00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:16.500
DANA GOLDBERG:
Oh, you took mine.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.208
SAM SHAW: I'm sorry,
but I've got to say.

00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:19.125
MARCY ROSS: Oh my god.

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:20.957
SAM SHAW: I was going
to say the job I would

00:29:20.957 --> 00:29:23.180
be tempted to take
would be her job, which

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.670
was the case in this place.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.040
All phone calls and all
letters were censored,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.516
and so all phone calls
were eavesdropped upon.

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:32.640
So one of our characters
actually sits in that room

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.880
and listens to
phone calls all day.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.420
It's like those
are her radio soap

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.040
operas for the interior lives
of other people she knows,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.980
and I also know it would be
the worst job for me possibly

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.420
to have, because I would
hear things that I just--

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.440
and also I'm absolutely,
completely, constitutionally

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.780
incapable of keeping secrets.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.230
So I would be the last
person to have that job.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.694
DAVID ELLISON: Marcy?

00:29:53.694 --> 00:29:54.860
MARCY ROSS: He took the one.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.270
DANA GOLDBERG: He
took the obvious job.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:56.420
SAM SHAW: Sorry, guys.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.500
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
There's an entire bank

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.870
full of people doing that job.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.210
You could ask for the same one.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.001
MARCY ROSS: I know.

00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:03.945
SAM SHAW: We could all
work together, guys.

00:30:03.945 --> 00:30:06.310
MARCY ROSS: Gosh, I think
I'd want to be the spy.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.119
Is that weird?

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:10.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.201
MARCY ROSS: I want to be Meeks.

00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:15.184
I want to be Meeks
and be the spy.

00:30:15.184 --> 00:30:16.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Dana,
any preference on?

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.141
DANA GOLDBERG: Well, I was
going to go with Abby's job,

00:30:19.141 --> 00:30:22.090
because you do-- you're
the one person who,

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.730
if you want to get it, can
get all the information

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.970
and not have to do
anything with it.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.799
I'm going to go
with-- he may not

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:30.840
be the nicest character
in the world necessarily,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.145
but William Peterson plays
a character named Darrow

00:30:33.145 --> 00:30:35.994
this season on the show,
and he's the opposite end

00:30:35.994 --> 00:30:36.660
of the spectrum.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.260
He's what do you do if you
have all of the information,

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.970
and you are the guy that
everybody is looking at,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.640
and you have a very
clear point of view,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.930
and you think you're right?

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.070
I'm not saying I would
want to necessarily be him,

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.707
but I might want
to have his job.

00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:54.850
MARCY ROSS: You're kind
of scaring me, Dana.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.850
DAVID ELLISON: I'd want
to be a scientist there.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.850
I grew up computer
programming when I was 13

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.349
and took pre-med and
physics class for fun

00:31:01.349 --> 00:31:02.140
throughout college.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.269
And so to be on the
cutting edge of technology

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:07.310
is something that I would
have found fascinating.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.440
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Wonderful.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.110
DANA GOLDBERG: Which
job would you want?

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.484
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Oh, that's tough.

00:31:11.484 --> 00:31:13.615
I think I'd want to be
one of the boss jobs.

00:31:13.615 --> 00:31:14.600
SAM SHAW: There you go.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.100
Why not?

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.350
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Or not
Oppenheimer's responsibilities,

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.346
but that job wouldn't be bad.

00:31:19.346 --> 00:31:21.220
Well, we have a moment
for audience questions

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.783
if anyone has one.

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:25.954
I know there's at least one.

00:31:25.954 --> 00:31:27.975
AUDIENCE: I'll pick
one up on the mic.

00:31:27.975 --> 00:31:30.730
Could you describe
some of the side

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.370
elements of creating the show?

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.710
For example, the music,
the costuming-- there's

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:39.460
a mix between Icelandic post
rock with Jonsi and Alex,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.440
and then just the period songs.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.537
How do create that
balance and mixture?

00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:47.120
SAM SHAW: Well, this
is a conversation

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.640
that it started as a
conversation between me

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.100
and Tommy Schlamme, our
director, about what

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.700
the show should feel like.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.890
What should it look like?

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.180
What should it feel like?

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.580
This was the moment-- look,
I'd been a huge fan of His

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.110
I was a huge fan
of "The West Wing,"

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.443
but it was a moment when I
understood that we were going

00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:05.200
to have a really great
partnership working

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.600
on "Manhattan" together,
because we both really responded

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.300
to just this-- there's
something a little unsettling,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.900
and fundamentally strange,
and "Twilight Zone"

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.880
like about the
subject matter itself.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.940
The Hill was this
odd, secret suburb,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.060
and it became really
important for us

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.250
to find a way to tell a story
about this moment in the Second

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.914
World War, but not to fall into
all the conventional tropes

00:32:33.914 --> 00:32:35.580
of World War II
storytelling, because we

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.450
know what those feel like.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.750
There are incredible movies, and
there has been incredible TV.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.220
"Band of Brothers" is incredible
as a World War II story,

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.678
but that's not what
this story was.

00:32:42.678 --> 00:32:44.530
This is a true life
science fiction story.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.920
So we were so lucky when
Jonsi and Alex came on

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.680
to compose the score for
us in the first season,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.010
and that's like a metonymy
for the whole thing for us,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.770
which is that these
guys who in some ways

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.790
were a crazy choice--
Jonsi is the front man

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.810
of the Icelandic
rock band Sigur Ros,

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.900
and their music is this
ambient, eerie, sometimes

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.310
electronic music.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.200
And there was just something
really fruitful and exciting

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.070
to us about the mix between
that sound and then these great

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.030
period-- [INAUDIBLE]
you hear the radio,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.080
and it's-- hear Carmen
Miranda on the radio,

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.090
and what's not to like?

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:25.280
MARCY ROSS: Also it's the
timelessness of the piece

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.300
and the subject matter.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.315
It's not just rooted
in that one event.

00:33:28.315 --> 00:33:29.940
SAM SHAW: Well that's
absolutely right.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.610
This is a very
important thing to us--

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.070
is that we see this as an
incredibly contemporary story.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.330
It starts in 1943.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.420
We're up to 1945 by the
end of the second season,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.275
but I think it has a
real mirror to hold up

00:33:44.275 --> 00:33:45.650
to this contemporary
moment we're

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.390
living in right now, and so
just the aesthetic of the show--

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.640
how we shoot it, what the
visual reference points were,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.110
what it sounds like-- it was
really important that we lift

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.100
it out of a box of feeling like
it's some sort of powdered wig

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:04.059
period drama, but it is a little
harder to pin down than that.

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:05.600
AUDIENCE: I guess
one other question.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.041
So as you're entering the season
two, the reception for the show

00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:10.790
has gotten bigger.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.260
I see that there's
reviews and recaps

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.920
in "Scientific American."

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.239
What's been the reception
among history buffs,

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.250
historical enthusiasts,
or people whose relatives

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.719
worked on the Hill?

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.639
Are they clamoring for
lectures? [? How's it going? ?]

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.555
SAM SHAW: It's been
really, really gratifying.

00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:32.790
I will say when we first started
the show out of the gates,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.380
I think we were the
only TV show-- there's

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.949
a culture now online of doing
weekly reviews of episodes

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:40.089
of TV.

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:42.130
I'm not sure there's
another show on the air that

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.860
was getting weekly recaps
written by "Scientific

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.027
American," as you say, and--

00:34:46.027 --> 00:34:47.359
MARCY ROSS: "Popular Mechanics."

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:49.409
SAM SHAW: "Popular
Mechanics," but that

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.780
seemed like a really,
really pretty cool punk rock

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.570
kind of thing to be a show
that was getting weekly reviews

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.310
by "Popular Mechanics,"
but the truth

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.140
is scientists in the
science community

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.890
has been incredibly
supportive of the show

00:34:58.890 --> 00:34:59.940
and really welcoming.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.390
I know there's a regular
Tuesday night pizza

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.440
party at some bar in Los
Alamos where people watch

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.740
the show and talk about it.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:07.840
MARCY ROSS: Have you gone?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.500
SAM SHAW: I have not gone.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.640
As I say, I can't watch
the show with other people.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.990
I'm too much of a hermit.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.560
Can't watch people
watch the show,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.327
but no, it's been
really gratifying.

00:35:17.327 --> 00:35:18.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Wonderful.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.060
Well, thank you all so
much for joining us today.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.190
We're looking forward
to season two.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.860
MARCY ROSS: Thank you.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.460
DANA GOLDBERG:
Thanks for having us.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.060
SAM SHAW: Thank you
so much for having us.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:23.660
DAVID ELLISON: Thank you.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.368
Great to be here.

00:35:24.368 --> 00:35:26.110
MARCY ROSS: Thank you.
