00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.469
Throughout the course we've been
mentioning how crucial it is for

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.000
startups to keep iterating and learning.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.740
&gt;&gt; In this lesson we're going to
explore how to choose the right

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.780
metrics to measure your marketing goals,
and how to track them.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.140
Each case will be different, but

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.830
there are a few things you can consider
when choosing the metrics to follow.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.480
You're going to learn
how to validate and

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.610
optimize your marketing efforts
through experimentation.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.140
We'll talk about how to run
marketing experiments and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.520
iterate based on
the results you receive.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.470
&gt;&gt; And finally, on top of analyzing the
what, we will research also the why and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.490
learn how to run experiment
with read users using your app.
