00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:03.580
LAURA LING: Tens of
millions of young Americans

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.710
are drowning in
student loan debt.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.900
But one person is
trying to reinvent

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.900
higher ed and the
outrageous cost associated

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.490
with getting a degree.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.900
And he's an MIT dropout.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.650
JEREMY ROSSMANN: Our
mission is to provide

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.850
the most accessible
highest quality [? CS ?]

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.622
education that is really
out there in higher ed.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.455
And a big part of that
is not taking tuition

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.246
from students up front,
and instead, taking

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.640
a percentage of their salaries.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.330
Because there should not
be a way for a school

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.820
to succeed other than
producing successful students.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.030
LAURA LING: Frustrated as
a math and computer science

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.410
student at MIT, Jeremy
Rossmann decided

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.540
to leave traditional
university life.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.800
By 23, he co-founded
the Make School

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.670
in San Francisco, California.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.230
The school's
website describes it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.820
as a college replacement
for founders and developers.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.420
What you're saying is you
guys don't charge any tuition

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.920
up front?

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.360
JEREMY ROSSMANN: Correct.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.130
There's no gotchas.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.770
There's no tricks.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.603
You're never paying a
dollar you don't have.

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:00.550
It changes a lot.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.370
It means that we
can only stay alive

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.695
if our students get
the best education

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:06.727
and get great employment.

00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:08.560
LAURA LING: Many of the
Make School students

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.490
are college dropouts
like Rossmann

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.040
and have left top universities
including Carnegie

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.620
Mellon, UCLA, and Columbia.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.820
19-year-old, Jimmy Yue,
decided to leave UC Irvine

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.810
and attend the Make
School instead.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.970
He showed me the app
that he just created.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.094
JIMMY YUE: So the
Music Virtualizer, wow.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:25.635
It's so cool.

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:26.134
All right.

00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.130
We can point it
at the cameraman.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.890
LAURA LING: OK.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.203
Hi, Alex.

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:31.703
Ah.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.280
Cool, cool.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.070
So when you play
different music--

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.170
JIMMY YUE: Right.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.270
LAURA LING: Like, if
you played hip hop,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.075
then Alex would be
doing something else.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.533
JIMMY YUE: It reacts differently
to pretty much everything.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.922
So musical reality.

00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:47.380
LAURA LING: What do you feel
you're getting out of the Make

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.579
School that you weren't getting
out of a traditional college?

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370
JIMMY YUE: It's definitely
the environment,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.990
how people keep
trying to make things

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.730
rather than being
a college where

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.312
everyone's like, yeah, we need
to get an A on this next exam.

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:02.770
LAURA LING: The Make School
says they have a 10% acceptance

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.237
rate, making it more competitive
than Duke or Dartmouth.

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:07.820
What really
differentiates Make School

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.125
from the traditional college?

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.250
JIMMY YUE: Several factors.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.850
There's no grades.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.558
There's no tests.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.970
There's no traditional
problem-based homework.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.657
It's all about building things
as you would in the real world.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:22.240
LAURA LING: Do you
think that students

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.467
are taking too big of a risk
to give up formal education?

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.300
JIMMY YUE: I think
culturally we've mixed up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.980
the cause and effect
between getting your degree

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.460
and having a good
life afterwards.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.706
It's not the degree
that got it for you.

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:39.080
It's what you
learned in the name

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.121
of the school and the
connections it brought you.

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.290
There's such a big difference
between leaving school

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.960
to attend a full-time program
like Make School versus leaving

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.600
school to backpack across the
country and find yourself.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.975
LAURA LING: How did your
parents react when you told them

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:54.650
that you were dropping out
of the University of Irvine?

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.850
JIMMY YUE: Oh, they were
horrified because they're

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.659
very traditional.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.200
They went to university
on their own.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.710
And they got master's.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.610
And they think that
in this age, it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.210
still you have to go to a good
university just to get a job

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.455
and just to work.

00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:09.355
[MUSIC PLAYING ]

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.190
LAURA LING: Do you
have any regrets

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.580
about dropping out of MIT?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.038
JEREMY ROSSMANN:
No strong regrets.

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:18.190
I know that many of my students
will go on to become much more

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.011
successful than I will be.

00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:22.260
And that when I'm looking
for a job, they will be open

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.060
minded enough to look past my
lack of traditional credential

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.202
and perhaps offer me one.

00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:28.660
LAURA LING: So do
you think one day

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.490
you'll be knocking on the
door of one of your students?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.030
JEREMY ROSSMANN:
I'm almost certain.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.889
Yeah.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.930
LAURA LING: Is the cost
of college impacting you?

artist Jay Nelson, who turns
trash into amazing treehouses.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.510
JAY NELSON: My friends and
I, all through high school,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.970
we just built forts.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.945
We weren't really interested
in girls or-- we just weren't.

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:51.820
We were, like, we were
interested in building

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.740
forts and surfing.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.137
We never really grew out of it.
