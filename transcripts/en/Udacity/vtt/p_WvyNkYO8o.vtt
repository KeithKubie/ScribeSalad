00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.080
I figured out a way to implement this change in only the index.html file.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.410
Remember, that's where the templates are stored.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.960
Now, I haven't used Backbone a ton, and there wasn't an answer waiting for me.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.960
So, I had to figure it out myself.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.100
Let me go through my thought process.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.210
The first thing I noticed is when we check a box,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.560
something actually happens here.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.540
Where is the code that makes that happen, I asked myself.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.410
Well, I remembered that each one of these is rendered based off of a template,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.630
and that template is here in the HTML file.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.550
So I scroll down and found it.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.580
And sure enough right here is the input, the check box.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.670
And it says, input class="toggle" type="checkbox", and this weird thing.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.230
So what the heck is that?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.870
It turns out this is the way the template conditionally adds things.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.749
This here is interpreted logically, it's not just normal HTML,

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.700
it's actually interpreted by Backbone.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.745
And it says, completed?

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:02.560
'checked', or empty.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.570
So if completed, is true,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.850
then add the checked attribute, otherwise add no attribute.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.840
Now what I wanted to do is I wanted to add a done text to the end of the title.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.250
So I figured, this looks like the title right here.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.840
I could probably just do the same thing here, right here.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.860
So when completed is true, we want to spit out checked.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.560
Let's save that, and go into our browser and see what that looks like.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.430
If I hit refresh, you'll see that it says run the application checked,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.790
explore the file structure checked.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.226
Modify our application, nothing's here, but

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:47.850
if I click the checkmark, sure enough, checked.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.490
Now that's not exactly what I wanted it to do.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.980
I want it instead to add the text, dash dash done.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.820
Let me save that and go and refresh.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.150
And sure enough, dash dash done.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.740
So I tested it.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.150
It worked.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.960
And then I went back and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.970
I added an exclamation point because I was really excited.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.970
So that really was only a couple of steps.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.000
First I noticed that something changed when we checked the box, and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670
that's what I wanted to change.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.540
I found the code that made that happen in the item template in our HTML.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.690
And I looked at the syntax that was making this happen.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.550
And I basically copied it, changed it up a teeny bit, tested it,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.150
it worked, and then I added the exclamation mark.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.830
So that was pretty simple, and it's because I've done this before.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.660
Not this problem, but I've gotten code that is not my code, and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.010
I've had to find a way to integrate my changes.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.690
And ultimately it's the practice that helps.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.400
We aren't learning to solve individual problems anymore.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.010
We're ultimately learning how to be a detective.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460
Well, a Tofu detective, actually.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.160
One who can track down where the change should be made and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.970
then integrate seamlessly into the code that's already there.
