00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.968
So while we looked at shutter speeds,

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.838
now let's talk about the concept of aperture.

00:00:03.838 --> 00:00:06.611
Which basically, again, is nothing else, but

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:10.240
the opening that let's in the light into the sensor.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.590
So as I said before, aperture is basically dependent on irradiance.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.310
Irradiance on a sensor is the amount of light captured and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.540
is proportional to the area of the aperture opening.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.350
So of course, the amount of light that's going to go through

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.930
the aperture is depending on how big the area is small area, larger area.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.891
Traditionally of course when you just do

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:38.039
simple math you can see that the area really depends on pi, f over 2N.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.983
Where f is the focal length, and

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:43.710
N is the number that we'll talk about in a second.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.780
Here, f is the focal length of the lens being used.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.960
And of course, you can start now looking at it as how does one

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.100
compute the area of something here.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.290
And based on this,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.870
can we actually now figure out what is the diameter of the aperture.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.519
So of course, an area of a circle is pi r squared, where r would be the radius.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.720
This is replacing the radius, by this term here.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.338
Usually, in most cameras you'll actually see the aperture number.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:14.478
Or even if you look at any of the details of the metadata of your image,

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:17.311
the aperture number would be actually written as a capital N.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.400
And usually written as f over N.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.010
Let's look at this in a little bit more detail.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.980
So the focal length f and aperture number are known.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.840
Now one of the interesting things to note is aperture number is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.240
given irrespective.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.530
It gives the irradiance of what's hitting the sensor irrespective of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.180
the lens being used.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
Because it's the f that's dependent on the lens.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.870
And is of course size of the aperture.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.140
So for example, when somebody gives you a lens f 2.0 on a 50 millimeters lens.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.200
So f over 2 Aperture for a 50 millimeter lens.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.620
Is going to basically say that the aperture size is 25 millimeters.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.920
So for a f over 2 N number, for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.000
a 200 millimeter lens, the aperture would be 100 millimeters.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.720
So this should start telling us that if the f number is low for

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.770
a telephoto lens.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.310
That basically means it should be a much bigger, wider lens.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.020
See here, I'm just showing you the lens that I had earlier shown you folks.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.609
And this is, of course, a standard telephoto lens.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.956
Has a lot of range and goes from 700, sorry 70, to 300 millimeter focal length.

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:45.638
It also has the f numbers written here from f 1 4, to 5.6.

00:02:45.638 --> 00:02:51.750
And, basically, if I wanted the f number

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.100
to be low on this lens, I would have had to have, of course, a much bigger lens.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.680
This one is of course limited by the size of this, and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.480
of course, the size depends exactly on my aperture has to be smaller than this.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.250
So if I really want a low aperture number.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.790
I would need a thicker lens.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.860
And you may have seen sports photographers carry those huge lenses out on

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.830
the sidelines to be able to capture images.
