00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.780
Virginia Woolf was a writer concerned, above all, with capturing in words

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.680
the excitement, pain, beauty, and horror of what she termed, the Modern Age.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.220
Born in 1882, she was conscious of herself as a distinctively modernist writer

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.600
at odds with a raft of the staid and complacent assumptions of nineteenth-century English literature.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.880
She realized that a new era, marked by extraordinary developments in urbanism, technology, warfare,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.700
consumerism, and family life

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.940
would need to be captured by a different sort of writer.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.260
Along with Joyce and Proust, she was a relentlessly creative writer

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.020
in search of new literary forms that could do justice to the complexities of modern consciousness.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.100
Her books and essays retain a power to convey the thrill and drama of living in the 20th century.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.820
Woolf was born in London.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.280
Her father was a famous author and mountaineer,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.120
and her mother, a well known model.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.520
Her family hosted many of the most influential and important members of Victorian Literary Society.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
Woolf was largely cynical about these grand types,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.940
accusing them of pomposity and narrow-mindedness.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.860
Woolf and her sister weren't even allowed to go to Cambridge like their brothers,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.720
but had to steal an education from their father's study.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.220
After her mother died when she was only thirteen,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.260
Woolf had the first of a series of mental breakdowns that would plague her for the rest of her life;

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.240
partly caused, too, by the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her half-brother, George Duckworth.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.200
Despite her illness, she became a journalist, and then a novelist,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620
and the central figure in the Bloomsbury Group,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.340
which included John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster, and Lytton Strachey.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.340
She married one of the members: the writer and journalist, Leonard Woolf.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.180
She and Leonard bought a small hand printing press, named it "The Hogarth Press,"

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.080
and published books from their dining room.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.420
They printed Woolf's radical novels and political essays when no one else would

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.060
and they produced the first full English edition of Freud's works.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.820
In just four short years between World Wars I and II, Woolf wrote four of her famous works:

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.920
"Mrs. Dalloway," "To the Lighthouse," "Orlando," and the essay, "A Room of One's Own."

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.560
In March 1941, feeling the onset of another bout of mental illness,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.080
Woolf drowned herself in the River Ouse.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.600
Her work has many vital things to teach us.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340
Woolf was one of the great observers of English literature.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.260
Perhaps the finest short piece of prose she ever wrote

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.760
was the essay, "The Death of the Moth," published in 1942.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.900
It contains her observations as she sits in her study, watching a humble moth trapped by a pane of glass.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.980
Rarely have so many profound thoughts been eked out from such an apparently mindless situation--

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.940
though for Woolf, there were no such things as mindless situations.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.560
"One could not help watching him. One was, indeed, conscious of a queer feeling of pity for him.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.660
The possibilities of pleasure seemed, that morning, so enormous and so various,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.940
that to have only a moth's part in life-- and a day moth's at that-- appeared a hard fate...

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.960
...and his zest in enjoying his meager opportunities to the full, pathetic.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.280
He flew vigorously to one corner of his compartment,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.160
and after waiting there a second, flew across to the other.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.720
What remained for him, but to fly to a third corner and then to a fourth.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.820
That was all he could do in spite of the width of the sky, the far off smooth of houses,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.040
and the romantic voice, now and then, of a steam out at sea.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.020
Woolf noticed everything that you and I tend to walk past:

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.680
the sky, the pain in others' eyes, the gaze of children, the stoicism of wives, the pleasures of department stores,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.960
the interests of harbors and docks.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.920
Emerson, one of her favorite writers, may have been speaking generally,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.240
but he captured everything that makes Woolf special when he remarked,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.840
"In the work of a writer of genius, we rediscover our own neglected thoughts.”

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.040
In another great essay, "On Being Ill," Woolf lamented how seldom writers stoop to describe illness--

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.000
an oversight that seemed characteristic of a snobbery against the everyday in literature.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.760
English, which can express the thoughts of Hamlet and the tragedy of Lear,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.720
has no words for the shiver and the headache.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.200
The mere schoolgirl, when she falls in love, has Shakespeare or Keats to speak her mind for her,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.480
but let us suffer her trying to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.420
This would be her mission; Woolf tried throughout her life to make sure language would do a better job

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.340
at defining who we really are,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.280
with all our vulnerabilities, confusions, and bodily sensations.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.060
Woolf raised her sensitivity to the highest art form.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.340
She had the confidence and seriousness to use what happened to her--

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.780
the sensory details of her own life--

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.200
as the basis for the largest ideas.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.200
Woolf was always profound, but never afraid of what others called "trivial."

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.920
She was confident that the ambitions of her mind

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.560
to love beauty and engage with big ideas

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.640
were completely compatible with an interest in shopping, cakes, and hats--

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.460
subjects on which she wrote with almost unique eloquence and depth.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.320
In another particularly good essay of hers called the "Oxford Street Tide,"

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.060
she celebrates the gaudy vulgarity of this huge London shopping street.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.180
"The moral-less point the finger of scorn at Oxford Street;

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.820
it reflects, they say, the levity, the ostentation, the haste, and the irresponsibility of our age.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.640
Yet perhaps, they are as much out in their scorn as we should be if we asked of the lily

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.200
that it should be cast in bronze, or of the daisy that it should have petals of imperishable enamel.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.160
The charm of modern London is that it isn't built to last-- it is built to pass."

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.400
In an accompanying essay, equally open to the un-prestigious side of modern life,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.600
Woolf goes to visit the giant docks of London.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.940
"A thousand ships with thousand cargoes are being unladen every week...

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.580
and not only is each package of this vast and varied merchandise picked up and set down accurately,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.980
but each is weighed and opened, sampled and recorded, and again stitched up and laid in its place,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.580
without haste or waste or hurry, or confusion, by a very few men in shirt sleeves

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.740
who, working with the utmost organization in the common interest, are yet able to pause in their work

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.520
and say to the casual visitor, 'Would you like to see what sort of thing we sometimes find in sacks of cinnamon?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.960
Look at this snake!'"

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.340
Woolf was deeply aware that men and women fit themselves into rigid roles,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.880
and as they do so, overlook their fuller personalities.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.840
In her eyes, in order to grow, we need to do something gender bending--

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.680
we need to seek experiences that blur what it means to be a "real man" or a "real woman."

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.680
Woolf had a few lesbian affairs in her life, and she wrote a magnificently bold queer text,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.920
"Orlando," a portrait of her lover, Vita, described as a nobleman who becomes a woman.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.840
She wrote, "It is fatal to be a man or woman, pure and simple. One must be woman-manly, or man-womanly."

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.140
In her anti-war track, "Three Guineas," Woolf argued that we will only ever end war

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.140
by rethinking the habit of pitting of sex against sex;

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:45.480
all this claiming of superiority and impudent inferiority belonged to the private school stage of human existence

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.280
where there are sides, and it is necessary for one side to beat another side, and of the utmost importance,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.460
to walk up to a platform and receive from the hands of the headmaster, a highly ornamental pot.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.980
Woolf wished desperately to raise the status of women in her society.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.960
She recognized that the problem was largely down to money.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.400
Women didn't have freedom, especially freedom of the spirit, because they didn't control their own income.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.580
"Women have always been poor," she cried. "Not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time,

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.280
women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.660
Women have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry."

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.360
Her great feminist rallying cry, "A Room of One's Own," culminated in a specific political demand:

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.380
in order to stand on the same intellectual footing as men, women not only needed dignity,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.780
but also equal rights to education, an income of five hundred pounds a year, and a room of one's own.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.520
Woolf was probably the best writer in the English language

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.360
for describing our minds without the jargon of clinical psychology.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.800
The generation before hers, the Victorians, wrote novels focused on external details:

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.960
city scenes, marriages, wills.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.880
Woolf envisaged a new form of expression that would focus instead,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.720
on how it feels inside to know ourselves and other people.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:12.220
Books like Woolf's, which aren't overly sarcastic, aren't caught up in adventure plots, or cradled in convention

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.460
are our contract.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.420
She's expecting us to turn down the outside volume, to try on her perspective,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.180
and to spend energy with subtle sentences...

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.920
and in turn, she offers us the opportunity to notice the tremors we normally miss,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.960
and to better appreciate moths, our own headaches, and our fascinating, fluid sexualities.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.740
If you like this video, then I think you'll really appreciate "Wisecrack," another fine channel on YouTube

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.460
that also celebrates literature, philosophy, cinema, psychology, and more.

If you're interested in smart, yet hilarious, breakdowns of classic literature, be sure to watch their popular series,

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.540
"Thug notes."

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.640
They have over 80 titles in their library to choose from, including:

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.960
"Pride and Prejudice," "The Great Gatsby," "Lolita," "Dune," "Crime and Punishment," and many more.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.880
I think you'll enjoy them as much as we do.
