1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,590
That was in a competitive fight. How
good is Roundtree look how good too. Oh,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,540
you said something on the price
of any life. Said everyone's,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,270
someone's booking a trip down cow. My
kids, he was right now. I was like,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,370
where the fuck was he at?
Then they're making fucking
plane trips to Pooh cat. My,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,740
my only thing is with that is what's
the grappling like out there? Hey Man,

6
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,790
I don't know man, but get somebody to
help them get somebody that motherfucker,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
he throws some of the nastiest inside
leg kicks and so fast and he was total

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,090
Thai style. I wish I could lift my arms
up. Oh, she just got my shoulder shirt.

9
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,580
You can tell you it into style,
but he was alive leg dude.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,520
His timing, his speed was off the
charts. He fucked his life up.

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:45,170
I hope that your candor is posted a
picture today about it, but um, how tough,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,200
first of all, how fucking tough is
Eric, his coaches, what are you doing?

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,190
This is not a title fight.
There's nothing really on the line here.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,090
It's just not his day. He couldn't ask
him game plan for financing to quit.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,140
They just wouldn't ask him to quit.
He's so fucked. Coaches half the,

16
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:04,920
he's so tough. Crimson tide alumni
monster did cheer with Jon. Anik said,

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,341
what'd he say?

18
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,730
He said he goes and he loves
winning fights because then
Bruce buffer has to say

19
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:13,500
your boy. Oh really? Is he a boy? A boy.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,120
And that's hilarious. He's
a bad motherfucker. Boy.
He's a bad mother fucker.

21
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,690
Cause that guy does not
have a long history of mixed
martial arts like a lot of

22
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:25,170
these guys like man, way more athletic
than the waste then a lot of them.

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,250
But look Culito's athletic as fuck too
man. You know he used to be 320 pounds.

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,990
Yeah, it was huge. Have you, have you
met Craig Guy? He seems like a great guy.

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,910
Used to train with
them. Monster. I'm just,

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,750
well I was impressed when he knocked
out. Go Con Saki and then, um,

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,150
I know he lost a Johnnie
Walker who's just a beast.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,690
I don't know what to make
of Johnny Walker. Yeah. Ooh,
he's care. I'm on the train,

29
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,690
but I'm kinda like, come on, where
are we at? Fucking two. I'm on me too.

30
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,110
I'm pulling. I'm on the back like
Johnny. He's a bad motherfucker, dude.

31
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,970
He's something special. He's
a something. I'm not sure.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm not hope he didn't hurt his
fucking shoulder when he fell.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,410
Did that worm thing.
I hope.

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,680
I hope he didn't really hurt himself
because if be really hurt himself and they

35
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,350
can't fix that,
that would be a damn shame.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,810
If the way he got injured is falling down,

37
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:10,340
playing around after a spectacular
victory. I thought he came out,

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,740
said he was fine though. His Man
Shit. He's fine. Would say that.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,710
I would say that too.
You gotta tell everybody you're fine.

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,510
We'll fix this will fit. He does look like
he's a freak dude. He has crazy power.

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,070
Crazy power.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,160
He's scary and he caught collegial
with the elbow with close up when those

43
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,590
elbows where your hands up high
in Thai style in the clench,

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,520
but it was beautiful flatland him the
way he did it though. Like the tech look,

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,280
anybody gets flat lined with that
fucking elbow and knee buddy.

46
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,850
That guy hits hard.
And how about that's the site.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,590
That was the reason why Cleo went to
Thailand. Yes, that's what I was like,

48
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:47,760
fuck this noise. It's beautiful. And now
he's all in. He's like, he's moving there,

49
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,940
he's going to move his family there. He's
going to do all his camps. So intense.

50
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,810
It's so intense. But when you have
results like that, like I love it.

51
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,090
I love a story like that.
I love a story like that.

52
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,250
Telegraph what comes around goes more.
That's cool.

53
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,860
Thailand riding elephants and
shit. Check this up. Yeah,

54
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,910
but that's what I'm worried about.

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,080
Who kept top team and a lot of those
places out there in Aka Aka Mike's squeaks

56
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:12,440
place. They must have wrestling,
I'm sure. Right. Came out of AK.

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,050
Miss Farsi Academy. But Mike Sweeney
was exactly wrestling. Well he,

58
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,410
but he knows this deal always with
wrestlers though. You're right.

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,770
I mean he knew how to wrestle. Sweat
could do everything. Yeah, that's true.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,950
He's been, the gay was, I'm sure they
got a mother, but is that where he's at?

61
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,780
Ak it out there. Hey,
he's got his place out.

62
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,440
But now I saying is that we're
caleel's that I do not know.

63
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,590
I think he's at straight
kicking. Oh Damn. Boom.

64
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,440
He's doing the Reinhardt style
coconuts. He actually yelled, lady boys,

65
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,870
go to his,
um,

66
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,720
see if you can go to clue round tree
juniors Instagram page because he posted

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,670
thanks after the fight. There's
a lot of people doing it. Yeah,

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,130
well a lot of people are
going to Thailand. I think
there's something to it, man.

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,340
Learning in the motherland
with those dudes, you know,

70
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,330
watching those guys work out and train
and just to be in that environment.

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,810
It's good for the soul. Nobody, it
would be like, he's the nicest guy. Joe,

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,980
the nicest guy. But that's
caleel's Instagram. That's
me. And Him and his crew,

73
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,060
he used to work at like an MMA warehouse
and sell shirts when he's 300 pounds.

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,350
I was like, dude, I want to fight. That's
crazy. See if, um, there's a thank go,

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,870
go to the back to the, um,
oh, that's it right there.

76
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,700
And I'm sorry to go back to that one.
This here.

77
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:23,380
There it says teddy bear
peachy in the boxing.

78
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,060
See that? Click on that. That's the
dude. I think that's, that's the gym.

79
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,210
So he's with or that's one of his friends.
He's training with them right there.

80
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,540
The gym there. Yeah. Oh, that's not what
I'm thinking. It's, see I want to, damn,

81
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,930
that dude is in shape.
I want to see. Listen,

82
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,730
you want a little round
treat junior kicking you.

83
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,330
You're probably better off in that shady
fucking yeah, you gotta be shaped like,

84
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,630
it's nice. That dude was probably his
pads guy that helped him with his pants.

85
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,950
He's doing work, man. Damn. Look at
the legs on that fucking time, dude.

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,870
Oh Dude.
He's on a western diet son.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,700
It's like pass on the Pad Thai and
get me the Donald Trump pad. Thai.

88
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,820
Fuck that noise. Ah, there's something
too. I think it's good for the soul.

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,820
Might be so being over there you mean?
Yeah.

90
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,550
There's something about
[inaudible] man. Oh, this is,

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,840
Tammy is doing this just to make us
laugh. Thank you, Tish. Son of a bitch.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,530
I've shout out to that guy. Yeah. Um,

93
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,760
there's something about being in a place
where something was invented that must

94
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:22,990
give you some extra juice.
