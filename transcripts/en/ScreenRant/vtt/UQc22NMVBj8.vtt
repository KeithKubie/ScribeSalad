10 Famous Superhero Movies That Got The COSTUMES
All Wrong

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.381
It's always exciting when a superhero movie
is released to see how the characters in them

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.650
are going to look in live action.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.709
In a lot of cases, they look fantastic.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.890
Ben Affleck's Batman, Ryan Reynolds' most
recent Deadpool, Robert Downey, Jr.'s Iron

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.960
Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki all looked great,
for example - but that's not always the case.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.161
Whether it's because they were vastly different
from the classic costumes seen in the comic

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.570
books, or because the actors hated wearing
them, or because the fans just didn't take

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.619
to them at all, costumes in superhero movies
have been the source of a lot of controversy

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.380
over the years.That applies to both heroes
and villains and this video will take a look

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.380
at some prime examples.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.830
Here are ten famous superhero movies that
got the costumes all wrong.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.470
Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine
Thankfully, we've now had a cinematic version

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.590
of Deadpool worthy of praise - he looked awesome
in 2016, even if his costume and makeup did

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.200
make it impossible for Ryan Reynolds to even
sit down - but, back in 2009, in X-Men Origins:

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.370
Wolverine, we were given a version of the
character that was all wrong - especially

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.520
with regards to the way he looked and the
way he was dressed.He looked more like Baraka

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.810
from the Mortal Kombat video game series than
he looked like Deadpool from the comic books

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.750
- and he was infamously nicknamed “Barakapool“
as a result.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.720
In addition to having his mouth sewn shut,
he wore simple elastic top pants and no top,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.460
instead of Deadpool's famous all over red
and black uniform.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.940
It really was horrendous in every respect.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.240
Daredevil in Daredevil
We may have a great live action version of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.810
Daredevil on the small screen these days,
and Ben Affleck might have finally proven

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.420
his worth as a superhero in Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice, but nobody will forget how

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.850
bad 2003's Daredevil movie was in a hurry
- not least because of how silly the man without

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.170
fear looked in his costume in the movie.The
hero of Hell's Kitchen is blind, so you can

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
forgive him for his poor choice, but the fact
is that his red leather costume made him look

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.870
like a male dominatrix.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.690
It genuinely looked as though it would make
a squeaking noise every time Daredevil moved

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.720
and the tiny protruding horns on the headpiece
made it look like something a child would

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.460
wear to dress up as the Devil on Halloween.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.460
It's the type of thing you'd wear if you wanted
to whip people while they were suspended in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.460
a sex swing but, for fighting crime on the
mean streets?

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.460
Absolutely not.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.460
It also has a visible zip.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.950
No superhero costume should ever have a visible
zip.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.880
Hal Jordan in Green Lantern
CGI is a big part of Hollywood these days

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.259
- and even costumes that are mostly practical
can be augmented with some computer-generated

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.060
imagery - but 2011's Green Lantern movie went
a step further than any superhero movie before

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
it by making the lead character's costume
entirely CGI.The idea was that the suit was

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.170
created by Hal Jordan's Green Lantern Ring
and was made of pure energy, but the end result

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.170
wasn't great.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.010
It just didn't look natural and didn't seem
to combine harmoniously with the live action

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.130
actor wearing it - and when that actor has
the superhero-esque body of Ryan Reynolds,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.130
you'd expect better.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.420
Reynolds himself also stressed that the bodysuit
that he had to wear in order for the costume

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.360
to be generated over it must have been made
of "actual woven misery", given how uncomfortable

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.610
it made him feel - and he even made reference
to how bad the costume itself was in his latest

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.000
superhero outing as Deadpool.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.280
John Constantine in Constantine
If there's one thing that DC and Vertigo Comics'

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.650
John Constantine is known for, it's his iconic
beige trench coat.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.349
And what one thing did 2005's Constantine
movie seemingly forget to give the character?

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.819
You got it - his iconic beige trench coat.Keanu
Reeves starred as the character in the somewhat

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.590
underrated movie, but the item of clothing
he is so notable for wearing in the comic

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.700
books was very conspicuous in its absence.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700
Instead, he wore a long black coat.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.620
And while it wasn't terrible and didn't make
him look silly or anything, it just wasn't

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.620
Constantine.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.819
Thankfully, we have since had a live action
Constantine television series, starring Matt

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.890
Ryan in the titular role, in which the character
did wear a beige trench coat - but that's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.530
now been cancelled.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.491
Scarlet Witch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
When Elizabeth Olsen first appeared in the

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.830
Marvel Cinematic Universe as Scarlet Witch
in the mid-credits scene of Captain America:

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.650
The Winter Soldier in 2014, it was very exciting
for fans.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.770
Since then, she's appeared in 2015's Avengers:
Age of Ultron and 2016's Captain America:

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.280
Civil War as the character - and, to be fair
to the actress, she's been great - but her

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.530
costume is incredibly boring compared to the
comic book version of the character.Classically,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.849
Scarlet Witch wears a very sexy red outfit
that shows a lot of flesh, and it comes complete

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.740
with a red cape and a headdress, but the MCU
version wears what are essentially everyday

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.740
clothes.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.731
There's some red in the costume, but that's
as far as the similarities with the comic

00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:04.731
version go.

00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:05.731
It might be unrealistic to hope for a costume
identical to the one in the comics to appear

00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.099
on screen - Olsen herself has even said that
she's glad she didn't have to wear it - but

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.099
something closer than the one we were given
would've been cooler.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.489
Apocalypse in X-Men: Apocalypse
Nobody in their right mind would have thought

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.930
a crossover between the X-Men and Power Rangers
was possible before 2016, but when images

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.000
of the titular villain in X-Men: Apocalypse
first appeared, some people were almost convinced

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.210
it was about to happen!Oscar Isaac's character
looked absolutely nothing like how Apocalypse

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.000
looks in the comic books and far more strongly
resembled a certain Ivan Ooze from 1995's

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.630
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.100
The armour on this version of Apocalypse just
wasn't bulky enough and it didn't have the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.160
obvious protruding cables hanging from it.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.156
More to the point, it just looked cheap - like,
for example, it belonged in a movie that cost

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:40.156
$160 million less than X-Men: Apocalypse did
21 years prior.

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:42.630
It was also purple, which forced Fox to put
a blue hue on the movie to make the colour

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.350
more closely resemble the comic book version.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.370
Patience Phillips in Catwoman
Michelle Pfeiffer might have hated her costume

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.400
in 1992's Batman Returns - she had to be vaccuum-sealed
into it and it was very uncomfortable for

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.280
her, after all - but at least she looked damn
good in it.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.871
Halle Berry can't say the same for the time
she portrayed a twisted version of the character

00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:06.150
in 2004's awful Catwoman movie.Aside from
the fact that the movie totally butchered

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.650
the origins of the character, gave her cat-like
powers and changed her name to Patience Phillips,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.229
Berry's Catwoman looked ridiculous.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.960
More specifically, her costume was absolutely
horrendous.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.130
It looked cheap - like something from a low-class
adult show in Amsterdam - and, while it showed

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.960
a hell of a lot more skin than Pfeiffer's
version, it just wasn't as sexy and it didn't

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.010
quite have the same effect on men around the
world as a result.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.500
Batman in Batman &amp; Robin
1997's Batman &amp; Robin was the worst Batman

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.389
movie of all time and, although the lead character's
costume wasn't that much different from the

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.960
one worn by Michael Keaton in the far superior
Batman and Batman Returns, it had one very

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.050
obvious flaw - visible nipples.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.570
Big, prominent, distracting, Bat-nipples.The
fact that it was worn by the worst big screen

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.840
Batman by far in George Clooney really didn't
help matters, but the main point is that the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.090
Bat-nipples are just downright unacceptable.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.210
The costume also limited Clooney's movement
significantly when he was wearing it and it

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.440
had an extremely prominent, weird-looking
and slightly misshapen crotch area that almost

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.460
defied physics and, with all of those things
in mind, it absolutely has to be on this list.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.539
General Zod and Co. in Superman II
This might be a controversial entry, given

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.020
the era of the movie in question and the popularity
of the iconic villains who wore the costumes,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.570
but the fact is that - retrospectively at
least - these guys looked absolutely ridiculous.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.610
We are, of course, referring to Kryptonian
villains General Zod, Ursa and Non – played

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.020
so memorably by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas
and Jack O’Halloran – from 1980’s Superman

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.270
II.What on Earth were they actually wearing?!

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.930
They genuinely looked like a corny Scandinavian
pop group in matching all-in-one playsuits.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.860
Even in the early 1980's, that was hardly
a look that should have struck fear into the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.330
heart of a superhero.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.050
Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad
Ever since she first appeared in a 1992 episode

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.180
of Batman: The Animated Series - and in her
countless subsequent comic book appearances

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.630
- Harley Quinn's costume has caused controversy.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.449
By the character's very nature, what she wears
is very sexualised and, over the years, it

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.740
seems to have gotten skimpier and skimpier,
but the latest version in 2016's Suicide Squad

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.770
movie has prompted the most complaints.Margot
Robbie's character has been given a completely

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.520
new look that some people are arguing isn't
anything like what Harley Quinn should look

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520
like.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.760
Her modern red and blue colour scheme is still
somewhat intact, and she wears short shorts

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.479
and stilettos like she has done in the comics
in recent years, but something about it just

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:16.479
doesn't look right - and Robbie herself has
complained that she got cold and wet whilst

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:17.479
wearing it.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.830
Don't get us wrong though, the actress does
look sexy as hell, so we'll have to wait and

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:46.630
see if audiences take to the character with
this new look.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.380
Thanks for watching our list of ten famous
superhero movies that got the costumes all

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.380
wrong.
