00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.720
PROFESSOR: We're
constantly asking how long

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.340
we have to wait for things.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.200
And in the context of
probability theory,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.760
it turns into the
technical question called,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.550
the expected time to failure--
or the mean time to failure.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.220
Some examples might be that
an insurance company wants

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160
to know, for a
given policy holder,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.390
the expected time before
that policy holder dies.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.460
A mechanical engineer wants
to know the expected time

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.140
before a button that's
being pushed once per second

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.409
is expected to fail.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.100
And I want to know when
the part that my body

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.642
shop has been waiting for
is expected to come in.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.870
The mean time to
failure problem,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.300
we can formalize in
terms of flipping coins.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.990
So we're going to flip a
coin until a head comes up.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.470
And we're going
to think of a head

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.750
as being a failure, and
a tail as a success.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.520
So let's assume the
probability of getting a head--

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.280
the probability
of failure-- is p.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.150
Again, this is not a fair coin.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.260
It's a coin that may be
biased in either direction.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.570
And let's let F be
the number of flips

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.590
until the first head comes
up-- the number of flips

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.370
until the first failure.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.760
And if we're counting as flips
as time, it's the time to fail.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.940
So what we'd like to know is
what's the expectation of F?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.010
What's the expected number of
flips before a head comes up?

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.080
Well, in order to
calculate that expectation,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.670
we need to know
some probabilities.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.460
So what's the probability
that F equals 1?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.586
Well that's the same
as saying that that's

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.210
getting a head on
the first flip-- it's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.550
the probability that you get
just an H on the first flip,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.560
and that has probability, P.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920
What's the probability
that F equals 2?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.915
Well that's the probability
that you flip a tail and then

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:52.870
a head.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.960
And that has
probability q times p,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.390
because we're assuming
the flips are independent,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.490
so it's the probability
of a tail-- which

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.590
is q-- times the probability
of a head-- which is p.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.470
Similarly, the
probability of F equals

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.900
3 is the same as the probability
of flipping tail, tail, head--

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.240
and it's q squared p.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080
And of course, the
probability density function

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.250
of F-- the number
of steps until you'd

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.550
flip a head-- at
n-- the probability

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.110
that you have to flip n times
before you get the first head--

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.090
is q at the n minus 1 p.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.810
By the way, a random variable
whose probability density

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.000
function is this value is
called a geometric distribution.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.920
They come up all the time.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.150
All right, so what's the formula
for the expectation of F?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.070
It's simply, of
course, by definition,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.370
it's the sum over all the
possible values of F--

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.010
which in this case are
integers, n, greater than 0,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.090
of n times the probability
that F equals n.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.640
We figured out that the
probability that F equals n

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.310
is q to n minus 1 times p.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.950
And now I'm going to
observe that we really

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.600
do know how to evaluate
this sum easily enough.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.650
I'm going to factor
out the p, and it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.060
becomes a sum over n
greater than 0 of q

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970
to the n minus 1 times n.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.810
And then I can simplify matters
if I replace n by n minus 1.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.720
And then I get a
q to the n power.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.310
So this is equivalent to
p times the sum over n

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
greater than or equal to
0 of n plus 1 q to the n.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.190
Now this is a familiar
generating function.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.780
It's simply equal to 1
over 1 minus q squared,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.890
as we've seen already.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.020
So in short, the expectation
of F is p times 1

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.124
over the square of 1 minus q.

00:03:42.124 --> 00:03:43.540
So let's put them
together, there.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.330
Of course 1 minus q is
p, so it's p times 1

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.260
over p squared, or one over p.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.370
And we get this really
very clean answer.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.360
The expected number
of flips before you

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.460
get a head is 1 over the
probability of a head.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.670
So for example, with a
fair coin, where p is 1/2,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.440
the expected number of flips
until you get the first head

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.680
is 2-- it's 1 over 1/2.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.290
If you had a biased coin, where
the probability of getting

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.500
a head was 1 in 3--
1/3-- then, in fact,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.930
the expected number of flips
until you got a head was 3.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.960
OK, that's a nice clean answer.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.070
But we got it in this
way that doesn't really

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.928
give much intuition.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.470
So let's look at
another naive way

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.585
to derive the expected
time to the first head,

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:36.710
without having to worry
about generating functions,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.290
and all that sophisticated
stuff about series-- which

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.210
is easy to forget.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.440
So let's look at the
outcome tree that

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.270
describes this
experiment of flipping

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.770
until you get the first head.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.950
So starting at the
root, with probability,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.720
p, you flip a head
immediately and you stop.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.500
Or, with probability,
q, you flip a tail,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.100
and then with probability,
p, you finally flip the head

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.760
and stop.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.960
If you haven't flipped the head
by the end of the second step,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.400
then that is a possibility
that, with probability, q,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000
flipped a tail, and then
there's a possibility

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.680
that you stop after the third
step, with a head, and so on.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.150
That's how this tree goes.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.030
Now, looking at the
structure of this tree,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.340
it's an infinite tree,
but it's very repetitive.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.180
In fact, if we call it the
tree B, then what we're seeing

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.300
is that this whole
sub-tree is a copy of B.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.050
So now I have a nice
recursive, but very finite,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.840
description of this
whole infinite tree.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.710
B is a tree that has a
left branch of p that

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.510
ends in a leaf, or a right
branch with probability,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.450
q, followed by a
repeat of the tree, B.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.630
So now I can apply
total expectation

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.810
to find the expectation of F. F
is the expected number of steps

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.700
I make in this tree until I
finally make the left branch

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.670
to an H. How do
I figure out what

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.710
the expected time in the tree
is until I make that left branch

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.330
of flipping a head, finally?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.250
Well, using total
expectation, what I can do

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.250
is branch on whether or not
the first flip is a head.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.990
So the expectation
of F, according

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.870
to the total
expectation is going

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.670
to be the expectation
of F, given

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.800
that the first flip is a head,
times the probability, p,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.370
that it is a head.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.840
And the other term is that it's
the expectation of F, given

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.100
that the first flip is a
tail times q, the probability

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.040
that the first flip is a tail.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.670
Well, first of all,
let's look at this term.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.830
What is the expected
number of flips

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.010
until you get a head,
given that you got a head?

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.810
Well, it's 1.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.690
So this term is
easily taken care of.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.500
We understand that one.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.470
What about this term?

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.730
This is the expected
number of flips

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.100
until you get the first tail.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.630
Sorry-- it's the
expected number of flips

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.620
until you get the first head,
given that your first step was

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.750
a tail.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.455
Well what that means is that
we are here after the tail,

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:22.450
and we're asking,
what's the expectation

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.730
of F-- the number
of flips that you

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.780
get starting at B-- when you
do one flip that takes you

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.890
to the start of B again?

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:36.140
And the answer is, obviously,
1 plus the expected number

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.740
of flips in B,
which is expectation

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.400
of F. In short, this term--
the expectation of F, given

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.470
that the first flip
is a tail, is simply

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.320
1 plus the expected
number of flips

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.770
that we're trying to figure out.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.610
Now look at this-- I have a very
simple arithmetic formula now.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.340
Expectation of F is 1 times
p plus 1 plus F times q.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.460
There it is.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.610
And now I can solve
for E of F. Well,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.370
just taking a
quick look at this,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.090
this is going to yield a
q term, and p plus q is 1.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.490
And this is going to be q times
E of F, and there's an E of F

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.780
there.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.170
If I pull the E of
F over, I'm going

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.870
to do a little
arithmetic-- I'm going

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.280
to leave the rest to
you, and realize, again,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.070
that the answer is what we had
before, the expectation of F

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.240
is equal to 1 over p.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.569
So let's do one more
silly example for fun

00:08:32.569 --> 00:08:36.580
to remember what the
significance of 1 over p is.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.320
[? Suppose we think ?]
about the space station Mir.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.860
Now, it's spinning around,
and there's a lot of garbage

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.540
out there that it's likely
to hit-- a lot of space junk.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.260
And suppose that, based
on our previous statistics

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.080
and estimations of the small
stuff that has been hitting Mir

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.120
that it could survive, that we
estimate that there's about a 1

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.030
in 150,000 chance that
in any given hour,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.970
it's going to run
into some intolerable

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.850
collision with space junk, or a
meteor that's going to destroy.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.530
So suppose the space
station Mir has a 1

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.700
in 150,000 chance of
destruction in any given hour.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.610
So how many hours do we
expect until destruction?

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.960
Well, it's 1 of over
150,000, 150,000 hours,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.633
which [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.850
So much for silly
space station examples.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.341
Let's wrap up with an intuitive
argument that could be made

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.840
rigorous, but I'm not going to,
because I think it's clearer

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.820
just left in this informal
way that makes it intuitive

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.000
why you would expect
that, of course,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.100
the expected time
to failure is 1

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.600
over the probability of
failing on a given flip.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.380
Well, how many failures
do we expect in one try?

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.340
Well, by definition,
it's the expectation

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.030
of getting a head on
the first flip-- it's p.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.500
OK, now if you flip
n times, you expect

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.570
to get n times as many failures
as you'd expect in one try.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.790
So the expected number of
fails in n tries is n times p.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.110
That's an intuitive argument.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.190
In fact, it's the
rigorously correct argument.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.850
Remember that if
we flip n times,

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.720
we're counting the number
of heads and flips--

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.490
that's a binomial
distribution we already

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.440
figured out in a
couple of ways--

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.170
that it's expectations is n p.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.310
But never mind that.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.600
I think it's intuitively
clear that if you expect

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.390
p heads in one try, and you do n
tries that are all independent,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:44.700
you're going to expect to get
n times p failures-- or heads.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.850
Now, what's the expected number
of tries between failures?

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.560
Well if you think about
that, I've done n tries,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.190
and I've got n p failures, so
if I divide the number of tries

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.500
by the number of failures,
that, by definition, is

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.810
the average time
between the failures.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.170
It's the expected
time to a failure.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.650
So I divide the number of tries
by the number of fails-- which,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.510
by definition, is the
average number of tries

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.370
between failures, and it's
equal to n over n p, which

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.260
is equal to 1 over p.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.360
And that's an argument that
I hope you will remember.
