00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:05.310
GAIL SIMMONS:
Thanks for having us

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.976
and thanks for giving
me the opportunity

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.280
to spend more time
with Leanne Brown.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.670
I'm really excited that
you asked me here today

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.730
to speak with you because
it's a topic that's not only

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.510
incredibly timely and important
at this moment in America

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.120
for a lot of reasons,
b but it is something

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.280
that as a person who
eats for a living,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.780
I think about every day.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.860
And I think, as someone
who is lucky enough

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.436
to eat well in this
country, as we all are--

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.310
and I know that I can
say that because I just

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.860
had lunch in your cafeteria.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.120
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, we know.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.620
GAIL SIMMONS: And
I know how you all

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.040
eat, which is an
incredible privilege.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.270
But sadly it has
become a privilege.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.300
And I think I wanted
to start there,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.170
so that we can talk a little
bit about how this book came

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.090
to be because it is one of
the most unique stories,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.830
certainly in cookbook
publishing, of the last decade.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.509
I mean it really
was born in a way

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.050
that I think could
have only happened

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.330
at this moment in this
country as it happened.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.550
So, let's go back
for a little bit.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.800
LEANNE BROWN: You're so right.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.880
Sometimes people ask me,
how did you start this?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.750
Or ask for advice
for publishing.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.940
I'm always like, I'm
not sure we can really

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.020
recreate the bizarre
experience that I had.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.150
So for those of you who aren't
familiar with the project,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.145
it actually started out as my
thesis project for my masters

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:31.270
at NYU in food studies.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.510
So it was like this
really nerdy big project.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.480
And because food studies
is this very new field.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.057
It's only been I
think 15 years--

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.140
GAIL SIMMONS: I would say.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.670
LEANNE BROWN: --at NYU.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.340
And I believe that's
the oldest program.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.230
GAIL SIMMONS: And it's
a very unique program.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.020
It doesn't exist in
many places at all.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.936
LEANNE BROWN: Exactly.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:49.630
And so, because it's
so new and unique,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.490
there is no one
specific way that you

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.470
have to do your thesis.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.250
It's not like an
anthropology degree,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.000
where you write this long paper
in this very specific style.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.460
And for me, what I'd been
drawn to during the course

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.783
of the degree, really
it just became clear

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:08.449
that this was something
that I could do.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.660
And something that
I was uniquely

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.510
capable of
contributing, which is

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.600
to create a cookbook for people
who are living on a food stamps

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.514
budget.

00:02:17.514 --> 00:02:19.680
GAIL SIMMONS: So let's just
take a minute background

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.970
on food stamps.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.260
They are a complicated
issue in US politics.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.960
A very unique and at
moments, actually exciting

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.560
story, in this country
of how they came to.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.360
The history of them and their
current status in America

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.390
has changed a lot.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.570
And food stamps, as people know,
are social welfare for people

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.357
who obviously who cannot
afford to pay for their food.

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:57.690
LEANNE BROWN: Right, for
people with a certain threshold

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.290
right of income.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.000
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.833
But it takes a lot of
work to prove that you

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.179
are below that threshold.

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.220
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, even
just doing the paperwork

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.810
is extraordinary.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.450
It's incredibly difficult
simply to sign up for them.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.380
And so, the book is
called, "Good and Cheap,"

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.820
not the food stamps cookbook.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.155
It's called, "Eat Well
on $4/day" because $4

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.880
a day is the average amount
that you have to work with.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.890
So even after you managed to
sign up, which is no easy feat,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.030
then suddenly you have
approximately $4 a day

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.160
to work with, which
is an incredible gift.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
But at the same time
is not like, oh ho,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.300
no problem then,
everything's going to be OK!

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.240
It's still
extraordinarily difficult.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.670
GAIL SIMMONS: Especially in
places all over the country

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.930
where access to food--

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.310
LEANNE BROWN: Exactly, which
is such an important topic,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.685
especially while
I was at school.

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:53.410
And continues to be a really
important field of study

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.470
that a lot of great
minds are working on.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.140
And I see a lot of hope there.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.460
But yeah, there's this focus on
not everyone has even a place

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.240
to go grocery shopping to spend
your $4 in an appropriate way.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.460
You know there might be the
place several miles away.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.710
And food security looks
different in different places.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.950
Like the way that it looks in
New York City's sort of food

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.640
insecurity might be,
urban and security

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.420
means having to walk
a half hour somewhere,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.610
having to take lousy public
transit with heavy bags.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.750
In the rural countryside,
it might mean only

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.770
being able to afford gas to
go those five towns over once

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.970
a month or something like that.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.500
So it looks very different
in different places.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.180
And I was studying
all these big issues

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.870
and becoming really frustrated
by it and angry about it.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.050
And we'd have in
grad school you have

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.230
all these amazing
conversations with people.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.459
And you have these intense
conversations in class.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.500
And then at the end you
always come to this point

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.980
we're you're like, well,
I don't we're going to do.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.780
We're screwed.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.340
That's usually where you end up.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.380
And I just got so tired of
that experience and sort

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.202
of knowing the struggles
that we had ahead.

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:08.910
And knowing like how
important they were.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.190
And I never want to
give up on those sort

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.900
of large scale struggles.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.300
But I also was like desperate
to just do something

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.802
right now that could be of use.

00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:18.260
And that could be
of immediate use.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.150
That certainly was a response
to the whole problem,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.260
but was the one thing that
I was sort of good at,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.760
which was and is cooking.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.710
I know and as you know,
Gail, and many people

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.400
who work in food knows
the cost of basic food.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.560
Basic foods are really,
really inexpensive,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.110
if you know how to
put them together.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.314
You know if you have
those abilities.

00:05:41.314 --> 00:05:42.230
It's really just work.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.440
It's a practice.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.170
And so that was something
that I really wanted to share.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.950
And I never in a
million years imagined

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.200
it would end up at this scale.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.744
I had hoped to be
able to have it

00:05:51.744 --> 00:05:53.910
be of use to a few of the
people that I worked with,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.630
that I volunteered with.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.980
It's amazing that it has been
as well received as it has.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.700
I think it just shows that it's
something that a lot of people

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.450
are excited about.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.140
GAIL SIMMONS: And
there was a hole.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.265
It hadn't been done before.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.360
It seems quite
simple that we all,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.780
no matter I think at
what income you're at,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.880
and how much access
to good food you have,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.379
you need to know
what to do with it.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:17.870
And that's a complicated topic.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.210
That's why cookbooks exist--

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.126
LEANNE BROWN: Exactly.

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.700
GAIL SIMMONS: --in
the first place.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.075
LEANNE BROWN: Even
the best of us

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:26.230
sometimes are just like, ugh,
I don't know what to do today.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.530
GAIL SIMMONS: Or you
look at a pantry of food

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.330
and how do you make
that into a meal.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.560
Moreover, how do you make
it into a nutritious meal,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.170
but that's also delicious?

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.270
LEANNE BROWN: Yes.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.560
GAIL SIMMONS: And I think that
there are, for so many years--

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.680
LEANNE BROWN: Something
you look forward to.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.320
Right.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.236
GAIL SIMMONS: --that
those have been opposing.

00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:44.410
And I think that especially
at the food stamp

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.864
level and the
level of people who

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.280
need to get access
the most, there

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.240
has been a bit of a disconnect
in the conversation between how

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.440
do we make sure that we eat
well and feed our families,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.220
but also eat food that we
want to eat that tastes good

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.380
and that we feel
empowered by eating.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.350
So you are right--

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.820
LEANNE BROWN: And
that is something

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.590
you look forward to because it's
something that we all deserve.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.360
I mean we all had
this wonderful lunch.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.027
And you guys get to
have that every day.

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.568
And that's something
that can get you

00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:11.740
through a difficult day.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.860
And that should be available
for absolutely everyone.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.880
Everyone deserves
that type of comfort.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.247
GAIL SIMMONS: That should
be a right, not a privilege.

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:20.830
So you're writing
your thesis, and you

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.250
decide I'm going to write a
cookbook with recipes that

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.080
fit in the food stamp budget.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.010
And then what happens?

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.607
Because it took a turn in a way
that I think is worth sharing.

00:07:32.607 --> 00:07:33.440
LEANNE BROWN: Right.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.640
So after I graduated,
this was December of 2013,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.200
I had kind of thought, OK,
great, so I've done this,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.010
now I need to get
it out to people.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.540
And I initially
thought this would

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.790
be a great tool in the hands
of some of the nonprofits

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.820
that I'd worked with,
that I had volunteered

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.415
with during my degree.

00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.040
I was thinking of a
lot of the families

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.998
that I had spoken with.

00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:53.830
I'd just love to be able
to give this to them.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.234
And so I started out there.

00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:58.150
I was sort of pitching
it to different profits

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.120
and people were
interested in it.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.360
But no one was really sure.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.929
At that point It was just a PDF.

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.970
I was kind of scrolling
through it, showing them.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.220
Like, oh, this is really nice.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.150
We're not exactly
sure how we'll use it.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.590
And, again, my
impatience took over.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.870
And I just decided
in April of 2014

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.870
that I was just going to
create a little website

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.294
and put the book up there and
kind of see what happened.

00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:22.710
I didn't really
have a great plan.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.334
I wasn't like, well,
I'm going to start

00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:26.534
pitching this to everyone.

00:08:26.534 --> 00:08:27.950
There was no real
rhyme or reason.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.286
I was just like, I just
want to put it out there.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:31.090
GAIL SIMMONS: Did
you tell anybody?

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.920
LEANNE BROWN: And
we'll figure it out.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.870
GAIL SIMMONS: Dan knew.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.370
Dan definitely knew.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.661
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, I told Dan.

00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:36.169
I told a few of my friends.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.000
I really didn't tell that
many people, actually.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.959
So, which is why I was
really surprised when

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:44.250
one day at the end of April,
just a few weeks after I'd

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.500
made the website, I came home.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.760
And I opened up my computer
and I had hundreds of emails

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.010
from my website.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.840
And at that point, it
was the weirdest thing,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.750
because like Dan
had seen the website

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.020
and my father had
seen the website.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.840
He had pretty much every day
called to say like, Leanne,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840
you've got some typos on
there, can you please--

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.214
GAIL SIMMONS: Mmm,
thank you dad.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:05.870
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, thanks Dad.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.020
But nobody else had so I
was like, what is going on?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.630
And it turned out that someone
had posted it on Reddit.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.130
And it had become a
very popular thread.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.340
And I was terrified,
instantly terrified,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.410
assumed the worse, of course.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.202
And was thinking like,
oh my goodness, it's

00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:24.368
all these people probably
criticizing and saying I'm

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:24.910
an idiot.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.951
GAIL SIMMONS: More typos.

00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.700
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah,
it's definitely typos.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.925
And it turned out that
it was the opposite.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.220
I remember one of
the first e-mails

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.750
that I got that really struck
me was this young man, named

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.510
Christian.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.349
He said I am a student.

00:09:40.349 --> 00:09:41.390
I'm going back to school.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.980
I have to go on food
stamps for the first time

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.622
because I have to
cut my hours back.

00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.080
And I was so terrified I was
just going to be eating ramen.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.830
Because that's what
everyone tells you.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.870
And he said, oh, it's
such a relief to me.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.650
I'm really excited about this.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.939
And there were hundreds more
like that with similar stories

00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.230
and a lot of different stories.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.210
The actual thing that really
touched me was not just

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.640
the people who are saying,
this is helpful to me

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.380
right now, which of course
was tremendously validating,

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.547
but was that people were sharing
stories about experiences

00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:12.630
they've had in their past.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.140
Like growing up with
hunger, talking about,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.390
my grandparents
who look at looked

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.651
after us did a great job.

00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:21.650
We ate really well, but
I remember our neighbors

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.080
had a really tough time.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.830
And I wish they'd had
something like this.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.330
People were sharing
stuff like this.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.222
It was so incredible.

00:10:27.222 --> 00:10:29.180
And people were creating
this little community,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.540
sort of saying like, all right,
well, let's help Leanne out.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.039
Like, how can we
get this out there?

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:35.141
And I was like, yeah,
guys, what do you think,

00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:36.390
how can we get this out there?

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.460
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.890
And so that was really exciting.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.680
And after Reddit, it sort of
spread to a few different parts

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.530
of the internet.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.860
And I realized that I just
needed to have courage.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.650
I needed to stop like
being a wimp, kind

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.450
of just telling Dan
and just telling

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.650
my dad about these things.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.175
I needed to go for it.

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.550
GAIL SIMMONS: What
did that mean?

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.549
LEANNE BROWN: That meant
launching a Kickstarter

00:10:57.549 --> 00:10:58.790
to fund an actual print run.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.420
Because of course the one
very legitimate criticism

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.852
that people had was like,
it's great that it's online.

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:06.810
And it's very easy to
give things away for free

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.910
on the internet.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.040
But it's not that easy to
give things away for free

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.400
when they're physical.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.960
I knew that we wanted to
make physical cookbooks,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.920
but I just didn't
really know how.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.650
And so with all
this encouragement

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.775
from all these wonderful
strangers, I was like, OK,

00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:24.380
maybe we can raise some money.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.150
So we decided to do a
Kickstarter campaign.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.830
Stole the Tom's shoes model,
the buy one, give one.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.550
Because it was very important
that this not sort of just

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.670
be a cookbook, it
was very important

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.970
that it remain totally free
and as accessible as possible

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.720
for people for whom it would
really be a genuine burden

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.727
to pay $20 for a cookbook.

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:46.810
I just didn't want to put
up that kind of barrier.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.880
So luckily Kickstarter
exists, you can kind of

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.240
do what you need to do,
just put it out there,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.550
ask people for this.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.800
So we launched the campaign.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.790
We asked for $10,000.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.240
And we figured with
that-- Dan helped

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.240
with these calculations--
that we could

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.570
print about 1,000 books total.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.160
500 we'd be able to give away.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.880
500 we'd give to our backers.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.410
And we could sort of break even
and get by and it would be OK.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.440
But we reached that goal in the
first 36 hours of the campaign.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.520
So it's like a day
and a half later.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.370
It was unbelievable.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.036
And I have to say
just because I am here

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:20.730
at Google that a lot
of Dan's colleagues

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.330
and even people that
he'd never met before

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.870
were incredible in those
first few days, so supportive.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.440
Everyone was so excited.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.200
And I think really lent some
great momentum to the project.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.580
And so then, by the end of the
campaign, we had over $144,000.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.580
GAIL SIMMONS: Which
translate to how many books?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.610
LEANNE BROWN: 40,000 books.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.500
GAIL SIMMONS: 40,000 books.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.291
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:45.210
GAIL SIMMONS: Just to
put that in perspective,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.251
and the people at
Workman can certainly--

00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:48.250
LEANNE BROWN: Oh my god.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.320
GAIL SIMMONS: --fill in
the blanks about this.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.280
But a first run of a cookbook
by someone relatively unknown

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.064
at the time.

00:12:57.064 --> 00:12:57.850
LEANNE BROWN: Completely, yeah.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.391
GAIL SIMMONS: Now, Leanne Brown
will be in the history books.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.020
Is sort of unprecedented.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.680
Who publishes a 40,000 book run?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.590
Granted you were given
a lot of them away.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.210
But that is, by any measure,
an extraordinary feat.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.460
Let alone one that
you knew most of which

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.447
was going to be given away--

00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:20.280
LEANNE BROWN: Right.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.946
GAIL SIMMONS: --as a
non-profit venture.

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:24.670
LEANNE BROWN: Well, and that was
what was kind of exciting as we

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.960
were making more
and more money, we

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.220
knew that we were going to
be able to give more away.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.420
That was kind of
what we had said.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.670
When I made my little video
I said, the more we raise,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.753
the more we can give away.

00:13:33.753 --> 00:13:36.540
And we really wanted to do that.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.130
In the end the
breakdown was, 7,000

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.640
went to our Kickstarter
backers 9,000

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.469
we donated through hundreds
of different profits

00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:45.260
across the country.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.880
And I can talk a little
bit more about that later.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.000
And then the balance,
so we had 24,000 left.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.150
And we wanted to give
away as many as possible.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.650
But it's expensive to just like
purely donate those things.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.540
And so what we figured
was, we could still

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.540
get more into people's
hands, if we asked people

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.970
to pay just a
little bit for them.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.390
So we asked the same
nonprofits, would you guys

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.380
be interested in
purchasing these at cost?

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.840
So about $4 a book.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.360
And we got an incredible
outpouring of interest

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
there as well.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.592
And so the balance was
24,000 we sold at $4 each

00:14:15.592 --> 00:14:17.050
to those same
non-profits we worked

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.490
with about 600 different
non-profits across the country.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.710
And they were talking
about, obviously,

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.920
food banks and food
pantries, a lot of schools

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.100
and daycare programs,
senior centers, lots

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.100
of farmers' markets, a lot
of different health care

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.880
organizations, even
some health insurance

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.210
plans were interested in.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.650
It was fascinating the
sort of groups of people

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.980
who I had never thought about
being interested in this,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.920
who were saying, this is such an
important issue for my clients.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.070
It's people that I never
really thought about.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.660
GAIL SIMMONS: I think that
that brings up a point,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.733
if I can take a
slight serious turn.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.370
The scale of the issue
of hunger in America.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:10.200
Your book says this, 46 million
people in this country know

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.940
hunger, go to--

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.940
LEANNE BROWN: Right now.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.430
GAIL SIMMONS: --hungry, or
what's called food insecure.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.832
So don't know where their
next meal will be from.

00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:21.540
LEANNE BROWN: It's
15% of the population.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.890
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.640
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.931
GAIL SIMMONS: By the way,
side note, we're from Canada.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.100
By far not a perfect country,
but a much smaller country

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.120
by population.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.390
46 million hungry
people in this country.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:38.722
There are only 35 million
people in Canada, full stop.

00:15:38.722 --> 00:15:40.680
LEANNE BROWN: I mean that
was a huge thing when

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.840
I was in grad school, just
that, thinking about that.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.090
It's difficult to actually
wrap your mind around.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.990
GAIL SIMMONS: And knowing
that the face of hunger-- that

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.890
sounds like a weird
poster that should

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.699
go on the subway-- but you
don't know what it looks like.

00:15:56.699 --> 00:15:57.490
And to your point--

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.110
LEANNE BROWN: It's so diverse.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.690
GAIL SIMMONS: --the outpouring
of people that we talked about

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.960
and the places that you
were being contacted by

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:11.182
were incredibly diverse and from
the corners of our population

00:16:11.182 --> 00:16:12.390
that you would never imagine.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.960
LEANNE BROWN: Absolutely.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.580
I mean we all know
that there are so

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.690
many stereotypes about people
who are living with hunger,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.210
people who are on food stamps.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.410
But it's 15% of the
population, they're

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.510
as diverse as the
rest of the country.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.270
And the stories are really
incredible and really moving

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.560
and really important.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.900
And that's actually
something about this project

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.940
that I probably
should have expected,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.080
but I never expected sort of
to be as intense and as moving.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.890
I hear from people daily
who will share things.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.620
I get a lot of letters
that start with,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.370
I've never shared this
story with anyone before.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.970
And I'm so honored
that people trust me

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.250
that see me as someone
who can understand

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.430
their story that is probably
really difficult to tell.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:05.680
But I also I feel an intense
need to tell those stories too.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.212
And a real desire
to in small ways

00:17:09.212 --> 00:17:10.920
try to make the world
a little bit safer,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.943
so that people can feel
more comfortable sharing

00:17:12.943 --> 00:17:13.859
their stories as well.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.660
And especially to
the people that they

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.762
work with and their family and
their friends because you know

00:17:18.762 --> 00:17:20.720
we're talking about 15%
of the population who's

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.420
dealing with this right now.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.290
Think about over the
course of your life.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.520
We all know someone,
or even many people,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.010
who have dealt
with these issues.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.780
And it's a very hidden problem.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:36.610
And it shouldn't be because
shame festers in places

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.690
where there's no light
when we don't talk

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.050
to people about these things.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.530
GAIL SIMMONS: And becomes
in itself a cycle.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.500
LEANNE BROWN: Yes

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.050
GAIL SIMMONS: Being able
to eat with integrity

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.970
I think about a lot.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.130
And I think this is a viable
tool by which people can do so.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.880
LEANNE BROWN: Yes.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.160
I mean I hope that it can be
useful for a lot of people.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.740
It's certainly not going
to work for everyone.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.480
There's no tool I think that can
work for absolutely everyone.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.510
But I hope that this is of use.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.965
I know that it's of
use to a lot of people.

00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:11.340
GAIL SIMMONS: So tell us where
you are now with the book.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.750
You gave away and sold
those first 40,000.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.650
And then?

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.130
LEANNE BROWN: Well, and then
it was during the Kickstarter

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.700
that I heard from a few
different publishers, which

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.040
was really surprising
to me at first.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.590
And not because I thought,
well, I'm the best, Dan

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.502
and I are brilliant
at publishing,

00:18:30.502 --> 00:18:31.960
we just want to do
this on our own.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.334
It was just that
we never thought

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:37.520
that any publisher would want
to help us give away cookbooks.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.010
They're in the business
of the opposite of that.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.220
So I just never looked
for a publisher.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.910
And so I ended up meeting up
with the incredible people

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.210
at Workman Publishing,
many of whom are here

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.260
today to support me.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.000
And they said we
love your cookbook,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.450
but we and we want to help
you take this project further.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.672
We love the giveaway idea.

00:18:58.672 --> 00:18:59.880
This is what we're all about.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.546
And we want to help
you take it further.

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:03.720
I was like, yes, please.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.940
Not only because, obviously,
that's just a good idea,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.120
but also because
we had just managed

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.940
to distribute 40,000 books and
never wanted to do that again.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.600
Actually it before
all that happened.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.970
GAIL SIMMONS: From
your apartment--

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.450
LEANNE BROWN: I was
just terrified about it

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.158
at that point it.

00:19:16.158 --> 00:19:18.129
I was just like, ugh.

00:19:18.129 --> 00:19:19.920
GAIL SIMMONS: But doing
it with a publisher

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.050
will give you an enormous
amount of infrastructure.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.530
LEANNE BROWN: Let the people
who know what they're doing,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.260
do their thing.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.682
Yes.

00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:26.566
There are experts--

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:27.008
GAIL SIMMONS:
That's what they do.

00:19:27.008 --> 00:19:28.091
LEANNE BROWN: --out there.

00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:29.170
Yes.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.290
So it's been incredible.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.550
So what we did was, we created a
second edition of the cookbook.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.420
So that gave me the opportunity
to kind of look at the book

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.420
again because it had
sort of melded out

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.650
of this thesis and then
some other information.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.210
And then I'd added
some new recipes

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.340
through the Kickstarter, gotten
some cool stories from people

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.730
that had written to me.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.470
I'd been able to
improve it a little bit,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.670
but this is another
opportunity to fill

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.984
in a lot more of the holes,
address some of the things

00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:58.650
that people said, we
actually like this.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.779
Like all the information
about how to shop,

00:20:03.779 --> 00:20:05.820
like what are some strategies
for what you should

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.030
have in your kitchen, and how
you can get food on the table

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.530
quickly.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.800
All these kinds of things.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.580
That tends to be the
part of the cookbook

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.370
that I personally skip.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.634
So I was like, uh, people
aren't that into this.

00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:17.800
It turned out that people
were incredibly interested

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.633
in that information.

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:21.526
And so I added a
lot more of that.

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.900
I think we've
really improved it.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.510
And so that's what came
out this past July.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.200
And for every one
that's sold, not just

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.620
on my little
website, where people

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.470
ha to go to get it before,
but now in bookstores,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.120
everywhere, online,
everywhere, we

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.400
are donating one for one
for every single one.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.152
And that's going to
be as long as it's--

00:20:41.152 --> 00:20:42.610
GAIL SIMMONS: How
do you distribute

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.840
the ones that are given away?

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.320
LEANNE BROWN: Right.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.972
That's the other exciting thing.

00:20:46.972 --> 00:20:48.930
With the publisher we
had even more opportunity

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.780
for partnership.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.650
So our giveaway partner
is located in Cincinnati.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.290
They're called, Access Wireless.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.310
And they warehouse all the
books and they send them

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.860
out to the different nonprofits
and to the Feeding America Food

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.160
Bank system, as well as
to a lot of their clients.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.830
So Access Wireless is a
provider of the government

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.770
funded lifeline program, which
has been around since the '80s.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.600
And the idea behind
it when it started

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.730
was that no one should ever
have to choose between paying

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.765
for food or paying for a phone.

00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:23.640
GAIL SIMMONS: And in
the '80s, let's remember

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.707
what phones looked like.

00:21:24.707 --> 00:21:25.790
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, right.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.400
Exactly.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.430
GAIL SIMMONS: They were held
with a briefcase I think.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.490
None of you are old enough--

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.040
LEANNE BROWN: Shoulder pads.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.000
GAIL SIMMONS: --to remember
that, but I remember that.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.190
LEANNE BROWN: Balanced it in
your neck on your shoulder pad.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.940
Yeah, that was how.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.760
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.218
LEANNE BROWN: That's
how you do it.

00:21:37.218 --> 00:21:40.700
And so it's basically a
free phone or phone plan

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.550
for people who can't afford it.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.700
And so Access Wireless
clients are pretty much

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.910
exactly the people
that we really want

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.190
to reach with good and cheap.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.790
And they're also partnered
with a huge grocery store

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.380
chain, Kroger.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.920
And so they did all this work,
often in grocery store parking

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.250
lots , sort of saying, hey, you
might qualify for this phone.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.880
And so they were
hearing all the time

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.650
from people about what was
their number one issue.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.524
It was food security.

00:22:09.524 --> 00:22:12.920
It was being afraid about
where their next meal is gonna

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.137
come from, how they're going
to feed their family well,

00:22:16.137 --> 00:22:17.220
all these kinds of things.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.900
And so it was something that
had become really important

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.510
to them.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.050
And so they reached out to me
during the Kickstarter as well

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.860
and said, we might like to
get several thousand books.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.569
And I was like, (GASPS) I don't
know if we have those for you.

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:29.860
GAIL SIMMONS: But Workman does.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.080
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah,
but Workman does.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.950
And now they're an
incredible partner.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.540
And we're so lucky
like that they're

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.110
willing to do this for us.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.670
They're able to sort of
lean on their partnerships

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.910
to make this more powerful.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.135
And I just feel so honored to
have them involved with it.

00:22:45.135 --> 00:22:46.510
GAIL SIMMONS: Do
you have a gauge

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.010
at this point of how many books
you've given away in total?

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.384
LEANNE BROWN: Dan, do you know
the numbers at this point?

00:22:52.384 --> 00:22:53.145
DAN: 20,000.

00:22:53.145 --> 00:22:54.020
LEANNE BROWN: 20,000.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.560
GAIL SIMMONS: 20,000 books
have been given away.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.310
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah,
through this version.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.268
GAIL SIMMONS: This version
and the other 20,000

00:22:59.268 --> 00:23:00.360
from the last version.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.609
So, 40,000 books have been
given away more or less.

00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:05.400
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.560
GAIL SIMMONS: Let's
just, say yes.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.400
LEANNE BROWN: There's a
lot of them out there.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.440
GAIL SIMMONS: I know it's
more complicated, but--

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.731
LEANNE BROWN: Let's go with it.

00:23:11.731 --> 00:23:12.260
Yeah.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.540
GAIL SIMMONS: That is
an extraordinary amount

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.790
of people who have been
reached through your book.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.105
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.813
GAIL SIMMONS: So,
let's talk about what's

00:23:18.813 --> 00:23:21.876
inside this book for a
second because I've been

00:23:21.876 --> 00:23:23.000
able to spend time with it.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.121
I got a copy in
July and have been

00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:29.370
drooling over it and thinking
about it and reading it.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.210
And there is a lot
of information--

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:31.530
LEANNE BROWN: I
hope you guys got

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.175
to eat a few of the things
that your wonderful--

00:23:34.175 --> 00:23:34.810
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes,
today in the cafeteria.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.101
LEANNE BROWN: --chefs prepared.

00:23:37.429 --> 00:23:39.970
GAIL SIMMONS: There's a lot of
really great information here.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:45.200
And I think I should note,
applicable to everyone,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.660
on how to shop, on how to cook.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.590
And there's a few really
important lessons at the front.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.024
So let's talk about stuff
for a second that you thought

00:23:53.024 --> 00:23:53.940
wasn't that important.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.159
Which I actually think is really
strategies for eating well.

00:23:59.159 --> 00:23:59.950
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.540
GAIL SIMMONS: What are
some of the strategies

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.470
that you hope people will take
away when they read this book?

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.780
Simple strategies
people can employ

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.200
in their kitchens every day
or in their daily lives.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.930
LEANNE BROWN: Well, so I think
one of the key things is just

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.150
don't be scared, it's
going to be totally OK.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.740
There's almost no way that you
can really, really screw up

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.850
as badly as you can
imagine you can.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.529
So first off, relax.

00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:28.820
I mean if you've never done
this before, you can do it.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.309
So much of eating well
on a really strict budget

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:36.100
is making sure that
you just eat everything

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.170
that you buy and use it to
sort of its fullest extent.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.950
And so that you try to
purchase as many things that

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.420
have multiple uses as possible.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.189
Just like in so many
areas of our lives,

00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:51.730
if you purchase something that
you can only have one use for,

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.604
it's only going to be
useful in that one way.

00:24:53.604 --> 00:24:58.280
So things like, pancake
mix, it's not that useful,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.410
except to make pancakes.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.900
Like you can make
pancakes, great.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.400
You cannot do
anything else with it.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.390
If you buy flour, if
you buy baking soda,

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.140
suddenly there's a million
things that you can bake.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.720
And so those sorts of
rules are very important.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.487
Actually we just
switched the slide

00:25:12.487 --> 00:25:14.320
to the peanut butter
and jelly granola bars.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.770
I have this big
section on oatmeal

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.850
because well, oatmeal
is really inexpensive,

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.527
it's super filling,
it's fantastic.

00:25:24.527 --> 00:25:25.360
GAIL SIMMONS: Fiber.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.859
LEANNE BROWN: It's something
that's right next to the cereal

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.190
and it's like an
eighth the price.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.270
And you can make it
flavored anyway you like.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.020
And it's something that we
sort of tend to have a lot of.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.550
And so these peanut butter
and jelly granola bars

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.870
are basically
taking three things

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.964
that we almost all
have in our cupboard.

00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:44.630
Or if we don't have
'em in our cupboard,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.180
you know they're going
to be in a food pantry.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.596
You're probably going to be
able to get your hands on oats

00:25:48.596 --> 00:25:50.440
and peanut butter and jelly.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.040
And of course we've
all eaten oatmeal,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.800
we've all had peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.910
And this is a way
to sort of transform

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.060
those things into something
completely different.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.510
And so what's in a granola bar?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.730
It's basically just
oats and some stuff

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.814
to make it stick together.

00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:09.021
And so why shouldn't that
be peanut butter and jelly?

00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:10.630
And that's really
all that this is.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.620
And so this is an
extremely flexible recipe,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.160
sort of taking some basics
that you have around.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.897
And not being afraid to
kind of smush them together

00:26:17.897 --> 00:26:19.480
to make them into
something different.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.200
And it's again, it's
extremely flexible.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.250
You know if you have other
things in the pantry,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.749
if you have some coconut, if
you have some leftover almonds,

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:31.240
you know the bottom of that bag
of cereal that's really dusty,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.550
and you don't really want
to eat it with your milk,

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.850
you can throw that in here
and make it really great.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:36.450
GAIL SIMMONS: Love that.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.960
LEANNE BROWN: And so
I think this recipe

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.270
is sort of a good
example of something--

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.660
GAIL SIMMONS: Go back
to it for one second.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.760
Sorry, I wanted to point
out one other thing.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.920
LEANNE BROWN: --that is just
it's really about flexibility,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.230
like being comfortable
in your kitchen.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.160
And sort of going for
it has to do with having

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.540
a little bit of courage.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.440
And also just being confident.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.799
And using every last
little bit of everything.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.590
GAIL SIMMONS: Tell us
about the information

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.960
in the top, left hand corner.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.110
LEANNE BROWN: Oh, right.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.700
Yes.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.685
So that is the cost.

00:27:06.867 --> 00:27:08.950
I don't know if you want
me to get too nerdy about

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:09.760
exactly how those--

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.230
GAIL SIMMONS: If you're
going to get nerdy anywhere,

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.090
you're going to do it at Google.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.798
LEANNE BROWN: OK.

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:13.430
Here we go.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.350
All right.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.100
GAIL SIMMONS: I mean
that in the best way.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.433
LEANNE BROWN: It's a good point.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.950
I basically took
one neighborhood

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.360
in New York City,
Inwood, and I went

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.090
to all of the grocery stores.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.170
And I had a huge list of all
the sort of basic pantry items.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.740
Like we had sort of your
basic fruits and vegetables,

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.200
we had stuff from every
category, a pretty significant

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.100
list.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.630
And I took down the prices
of all of those items

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.490
at all the different
grocery stores.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.910
And then I sort of
averaged them out across.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.481
And it was even
ridiculous like, what

00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:52.730
do you say the price of
potatoes is at a given grocery

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.480
store because there's
like 20 kinds of potatoes,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.105
and they come in different bags,
and all these kinds of things.

00:27:57.105 --> 00:28:00.580
So it's very much an average
cost of all those items.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.750
And I made that
into spreadsheets

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.390
and ended up ultimately
costing everything out.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.800
And so that's where
that comes from.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.480
And the reason that
I wanted to do that

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.450
was because initially this
book actually started out

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.980
as a critique of the
food stamps system

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.030
that we sort of take the average
cost of food across the country

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.660
and make decisions based on
that when the cost of food

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:31.620
varies so wildly by city,
by region, by neighborhood.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.350
And so I sort of felt like this
could be a useful little thing

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.430
for New York City, which
is another reason why

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.940
when it first ended up getting
out on Reddit, I was like,

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.480
oh my god, this might not be
helpful, or work anywhere else.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.910
But I realized that
it was important not

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.880
to sort of baby people
and sort of say, look,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.390
here's an exact replica of
something that you can do.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.590
Now, do this.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:01.220
But to introduce large scale
or concepts of how to shop.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.540
How can you sort of
get the best value?

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.990
How can you eat
more seasonally, so

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.860
that you can enjoy good
variety in your diet that

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.990
is still reasonably priced?

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.120
These sorts of things.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.970
And so the kind of morphed
into that with time.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.280
GAIL SIMMONS: And tell us
about some of the recipes.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.856
LEANNE BROWN: So, we have the
vegetable quiche here as well,

00:29:23.856 --> 00:29:25.230
which is another
example I guess.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.230
Flexibility is probably
like the number one thing.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.779
And that's because when
you have very little money,

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:33.320
you need to be able
to take advantage

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.452
of things like sales
or things like what

00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:36.660
you happen to have available.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.730
You need to be confident to look
into your vegetable crisper,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.140
go like, ugh, those
things are going off,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.890
how can I make something
good out of that?

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.037
And so as many of the
recipes as possible

00:29:47.037 --> 00:29:48.620
really kind of take
that into account.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.640
And so the quiche, for me,
is really one of those things

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.380
that at the end of the week when
you're looking at your produce

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.310
an you're thinking, this isn't
looking very good anymore.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.250
What am I going to do?

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.902
I definitely want to make a
salad out of this wilty stuff.

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:06.110
This is a really great way
to bring those things back

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.730
to life, so that you're
using them all up.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.146
And it's one of
the simplest tips.

00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:12.964
I almost feel ridiculous saying,
but like when people ask,

00:30:12.964 --> 00:30:14.880
I'll always say, don't
go to the grocery store

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.830
until you look in the
fridge and just see

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.660
what you have in
there, like especially

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.874
in your vegetable crisper.

00:30:20.874 --> 00:30:22.790
Like just make sure that
you've emptied it out

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.537
before you start putting
other stuff on top of that.

00:30:25.537 --> 00:30:27.120
And so this is a
great way to do that.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.060
And it uses eggs, which are,
again, one of the, for me,

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.350
just key things to
always have with you

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.770
because you can have food
on the table so quickly.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.360
GAIL SIMMONS: I actually noticed
in the beginning of the book,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.849
and I'm excited about this,
you spend a lot of time

00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:42.640
talking about eggs.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.939
I'm a big egg lover myself.

00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:45.480
LEANNE BROWN: They're
transformative.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.280
They're so exciting, like
doesn't this look amazing?

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.071
GAIL SIMMONS: The most
versatile ingredient

00:30:49.071 --> 00:30:50.160
I think known to man.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.517
LEANNE BROWN: I think so.

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:52.850
GAIL SIMMONS: And other species.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.933
LEANNE BROWN: So far, yes.

00:30:53.933 --> 00:30:56.650
GAIL SIMMONS: Right?

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.000
And so tell us a
little about that

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.230
because I think eggs
appear and reappear

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.130
in so many different
ways in this book.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.670
I mean that's such
a great example of--

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:14.080
LEANNE BROWN: Right, so
it's just like efficiency.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.460
It's basic economics.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.142
If you buy a few
things, and you can

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:18.600
use them a bunch
of different ways,

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.099
it's going to be
way more efficient.

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:21.762
And so eggs are
one of those items.

00:31:21.762 --> 00:31:23.970
Of course you can have them
really quickly scrambled,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.950
but you can create these
dishes that actually

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.800
feel really fancy
and really special,

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.450
kind of out of the scraps
and bits and pieces.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.170
And make something
that you would

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.080
have at a beautiful restaurant
with ladies who lunch.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.717
And that is the
magic and the power

00:31:38.717 --> 00:31:39.800
and the beauty of cooking.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.730
So the other really big thing
is using leftovers as well.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.535
So we'll often make a
larger amount of something.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.330
I don't know about
you, Gail, but I

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.910
tend to be sort
of not as excited

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.320
about leftovers the next day.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:02.440
GAIL SIMMONS: Oh no.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.023
I'm actually very
suspicious of people

00:32:04.023 --> 00:32:05.640
who don't like leftovers.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.786
I'm sorry, Leanne.

00:32:06.786 --> 00:32:08.660
We're going to agree to
disagree on this one.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.076
LEANNE BROWN: I'm
happy with them,

00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:13.834
but I have to do something
different to them.

00:32:13.834 --> 00:32:15.250
GAIL SIMMONS: I'll
allow you that.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.625
LEANNE BROWN: That
just sometimes

00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:17.831
means putting an egg on top.

00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:20.330
GAIL SIMMONS: We have a saying
at the food and wine offices,

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.610
everything is better
with an egg on top.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.030
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, right.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.010
Drooling out.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.547
GAIL SIMMONS: Yes.

00:32:25.547 --> 00:32:27.630
And there's a lot of great
information about eggs.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.130
And I could talk
about eggs all day.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.950
But there's a lot
of simple examples,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.884
like eggs that I
think become so handy.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:33.800
Yogurt is one of them.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.010
I love your discussion
about yogurt

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.760
because I think it's
something that people

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.110
don't think about a lot.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.026
LEANNE BROWN: Totally.

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:43.230
And that actually came almost
directly out of this work

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.410
that I did during my degree.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.170
I got to do grocery store tours
with a lot of families who

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.100
are part of the WIC program.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.240
And we would so often--

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.935
GAIL SIMMONS: WIC is--

00:32:53.935 --> 00:32:55.820
LEANNE BROWN: I'm sorry, yes,
the Women with Infant Children

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.320
program.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.211
So it's special food
vouchers basically of foods

00:33:01.211 --> 00:33:02.710
that are specifically
good for women

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.410
who are pregnant with children
up to the age of five.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.884
GAIL SIMMONS: It's subsidies
as part of the bigger--

00:33:07.884 --> 00:33:08.800
LEANNE BROWN: Exactly.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.804
And so there's a big
dairy component, actually.

00:33:11.804 --> 00:33:13.220
And that became
really interesting

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.428
because of course some people
are lactose intolerant.

00:33:15.428 --> 00:33:17.950
And it was always like,
OK, how do you use this?

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.950
But we always have such
a fascinating discussion

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.540
at the dairy case.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.750
And everyone would
say, oh, I love yogurt.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.760
I love giving these
yogurts to my kids.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.240
And it was usually
those tiny little ones

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.690
that are unfortunately full
of sugar and almost as bad

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.370
as an ice cream a
lot of the time.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.010
And as I was sort of having to
deliver this sort of bad news,

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:43.060
I was like, how can I
like soften the blow here?

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.470
And because yogurt is a really,
really nutritious and fantastic

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.200
ingredient.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.630
It's just that it's
really good when it's

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.110
like the good plain yogurt.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.320
These like little fancified,
little mini whatevers

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.870
are not so hot for you.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.680
And so I would always be
trying to explain like,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.410
buy the large tub of yogurt.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.450
Not only can you make your own
flavors at home if you like,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.780
you can throw in some
blueberries, a tablespoon

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.432
of jam, whatever you like.

00:34:11.432 --> 00:34:12.710
GAIL SIMMONS: As seen on page.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.880
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, you can make
your own key lime pie version

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.380
a home.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.250
It's not that
difficult. But also

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.719
it becomes then
an ingredient too.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.790
It something I would
always love explaining.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.340
Greek yogurt is really just
strange regular yogurt.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.699
And that's something you can do.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:30.217
And you can make all kinds
of savory sauces, make Raita.

00:34:30.217 --> 00:34:31.300
GAIL SIMMONS: Dips using--

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.823
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, tzatziki.

00:34:32.823 --> 00:34:34.239
GAIL SIMMONS: --as
a substitution.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.655
LEANNE BROWN: Right
and that's why

00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:36.850
there's quite a few I think.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.030
The zucchini muffins
recipe uses yogurt.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.570
And just yogurt is an item that
you should have in the fridge.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:47.139
And so I tried to design as many
of the recipes as possible that

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:48.889
use those sort of
really basic things

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.722
that you might use for
a snack, but then you

00:34:50.722 --> 00:34:53.090
can use them in different ways.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:53.980
So, yeah.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.230
GAIL SIMMONS: What's your
favorite recipe in the book?

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:00.020
If You had to make something
every day, what would you make?

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.520
What's the recipe
you love the most?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.800
LEANNE BROWN: It's
the Chana Masala,

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.690
which is a chickpea curry.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.560
And that's because when
I was in university,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.890
I was totally obsessed
with Indian food.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.835
I absolutely loved it.

00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:14.210
And it really took
me a long time

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.709
to figure out how
to make it myself.

00:35:15.709 --> 00:35:17.550
And I had a ton
of trial and error

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.630
and just failed miserably
many, many times.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.730
But because I
loved it so much, I

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.130
continued to try to
make it and my friends

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:30.470
and I had this one coffee
shop that we would always

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.020
hang out at.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.436
And it was a coffee
shop that also

00:35:32.436 --> 00:35:35.040
had all kinds of
Pakistani food, which is

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.680
a sort of strange combination.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.450
But it was awesome.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:41.240
And they had Chana Masala.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.990
And we were totally
obsessed with it.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.121
And so I had to figure
out how to make it.

00:35:46.121 --> 00:35:47.620
It's really not
that difficult. It's

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.020
just that you need to
sort of toast the spices

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.220
and layer the flavors.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.240
And I finally figured that out.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.890
And I was just so excited to
share this with my friends.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.340
And it's also something that
takes only about 20 minutes

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.020
to put together.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.870
And it so transforms just
regular old chickpeas

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:06.570
into this most unctuous,
most incredibly comforting

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.750
beautiful dish.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.820
GAIL SIMMONS: And it costs what?

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.080
LEANNE BROWN: I think it's
like $3 for that amount.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.216
It's so cheap.

00:36:14.216 --> 00:36:16.590
Which is, of course, amazing
because we were all students

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.449
and had no money.

00:36:17.449 --> 00:36:19.490
And we would spend our
money at this coffee shop,

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.930
but it would be a lot better
if we could make it at home.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.040
And it was one of the
first times I really

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.040
had that satisfying feeling of
sharing a recipe with people

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.050
and people say, I made
that and I really loved it.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.930
And my friends will
still tell me to this day

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.250
that that's comfort food
that they make for themselves

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.640
on a regular basis.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.120
And to me that's just so
amazing and such an honor

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.352
to be in someone's home in a
small way by giving a recipe.

00:36:44.352 --> 00:36:46.643
GAIL SIMMONS: So we're all
making Chana Masala tonight,

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:47.430
right?

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.450
I am.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.090
Before we take some questions
from the audience, last thing.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.380
What is next for
"Good and Cheap?"

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.870
If you could have your own way
and do whatever and take it

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.370
to the next level,
what would it be?

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.411
LEANNE BROWN: Oh my gosh.

00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:06.100
For "Good and Cheap," well,
so we're going to keep going.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.020
I think there's
incredible partnership

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.950
possibilities available.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.575
But my big focus,
and I don't know

00:37:11.575 --> 00:37:12.950
exactly how I'm
going to do this,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.290
but is to share the stories
that people have been

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.180
sharing with me in some way.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.552
In a way that really honors
them and that will make

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:24.010
people want to read them and
pay attention to them as well.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.020
And so I'm not sure how
that project will work,

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.760
whether it'll be a
podcast or a video series.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.120
But I think that's a really
important component of this

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.940
because it's not
just about the food,

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.410
but it's about the people
who are making this food.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.950
And I feel like I have a
responsibility to do that.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.250
GAIL SIMMONS: Then there's
a part B to this question.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.320
I'm getting kicked off stage.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000
How can we help?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.240
LEANNE BROWN: Oh my goodness.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.250
Well, I guess tell
people about the stuff.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.946
Cook.

00:37:56.946 --> 00:37:58.070
GAIL SIMMONS: Buy the book.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.480
LEANNE BROWN: Learn more
about the Food Stamps program.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.970
Vote for people who
you think actually

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.650
care about these
issues and are not

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.080
going to continue
to defund them.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.125
Very, very, very important.

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:15.250
GAIL SIMMONS: You can find
out who those people are

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:15.900
pretty easily, actually.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.870
LEANNE BROWN: Pretty easily.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.050
GAIL SIMMONS: There's a, now
I'm forgetting the name of it.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.540
There's a website
that just launched.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.248
OK, I'm going to get
back to you on that.

00:38:22.248 --> 00:38:24.080
But that rates the
Congress people

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.290
in your constituency on
issues surrounding the Farm

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:33.540
Bill and Child Nutrition Act.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.740
This, in the biggest way I
think, is a policy issue.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.240
But--

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.750
LEANNE BROWN: Agree.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.166
GAIL SIMMONS: --we
all have voices

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:45.080
and we all can improve the
health of our communities

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.834
by cooking good and cheap.

00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:48.000
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.220
I guess just be confident
in your own lives.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.420
And know that cooking
is not something

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.420
that's only for experts.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.086
It's something that
absolutely all of us

00:38:56.086 --> 00:38:59.050
can do, and get a lot
of enjoyment out of,

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.581
and improve our lives
in just small ways.

00:39:02.581 --> 00:39:04.080
GAIL SIMMONS: Thank
you so, so much.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.204
Thanks everyone for coming.

00:39:08.257 --> 00:39:10.090
LEANNE BROWN: Do we
have time for questions?

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.410
OK, wonderful.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:16.430
And Dan could we switch to
the slide that shows the map?

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.730
I just wanted to show
that off because it's

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.320
my most favorite thing.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.870
So this map shows all of
the different non-profits

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.000
that we've worked with to-date.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.080
And if you want to see that
in a much more detailed way,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.920
you can go to
LeanneBrown.com/impact.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.075
And you can scroll
down and see the names

00:39:34.075 --> 00:39:36.200
of all the different places
that we've worked with.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.840
Because if you're
not from New York

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.923
and you want to see sort
of where in your hometown

00:39:39.923 --> 00:39:42.852
we've worked with, you
can check that out.

00:39:42.852 --> 00:39:44.346
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:39:44.346 --> 00:39:45.280
Read your book.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.801
You had a lot of really
good ideas in it.

00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:50.965
But I noticed this earlier
you made a quip like,

00:39:50.965 --> 00:39:53.090
oh, people think when
they're going on food stamps,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.400
all they're going to be
able to eat is ramen.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.790
LEANNE BROWN: Right.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.070
AUDIENCE: And that's
not really true.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.640
Would you say it's more
accurate that if someone's

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.135
going on food
stamps, they're going

00:39:59.135 --> 00:40:01.050
to be eating a lot less meat?

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.190
And if that is
accurate, do you think

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.730
that would be a cultural shift
for your average food stamp

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.909
recipient?

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:10.450
LEANNE BROWN: So I don't think
there is an average food stamp

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:10.950
recipient.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.939
So that's not something
that I sort of feel

00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:17.230
totally comfortable going with.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:23.460
But definitely I think
it's naturally much cheaper

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.816
to eat less meat.

00:40:24.816 --> 00:40:26.190
And you'll notice
in the book you

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.650
know it's not a
vegetarian book, but there

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.440
isn't that much meat in it.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.570
And that's just for
practical reasons.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:37.260
And because if you use meat in
sort of more as a flavoring,

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.840
rather than as the
center of the dish,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.205
you can still have it as a
part of your diet without it

00:40:43.205 --> 00:40:44.210
sort of taking over.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.890
I think the fact is
that a lot of people

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.879
are very used to eating meat,
who maybe have had something

00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:51.420
happen in their life
that has made it

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.405
so that they are
having a change,

00:40:54.405 --> 00:40:56.530
having to go on food stamps
say for the first time,

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.630
that yes you might sort
of start out buying

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.680
your regular amount of meat.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.660
And maybe discover
that as a result,

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.160
you don't have enough
left over to eat enough.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.470
So that would
probably be a shift.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:12.910
But there are so many
cultures that meat is not

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.690
half the plate.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.280
It's usually like
1/15 of the plate.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.359
It's just sort of
a part of the dish.

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:19.900
And so it's something
that's actually

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.275
pretty unique in the world
that we eat the amount of meat

00:41:22.275 --> 00:41:24.010
that we do.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.010
I think it's not about
sort of thinking, oh man,

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.218
I don't get any meat anymore.

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:30.160
It's about replacing that with
stuff that you're excited about

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.360
and giving it a try.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.954
And then hopefully
realizing that the food

00:41:33.954 --> 00:41:36.370
that you're going to eat is
just as satisfying and just as

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:36.890
interesting.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.440
And for me fruits and
vegetables are actually

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.670
a lot more exciting and
hold a lot more potential

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.210
of interesting flavor
than the meat really does.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:49.620
And so when you create menus and
food with fruits and vegetables

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.340
as the organizing
principle, I think

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.500
you're going to be
really excited by it.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.389
GAIL SIMMONS: And from a
health standpoint, better off.

00:41:56.389 --> 00:41:57.180
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.020
GAIL SIMMONS: Most
likely to right?

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.811
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah.

00:41:58.811 --> 00:42:01.850
We all know we need more
fruits and vegetables.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.329
GAIL SIMMONS: Protein Is
not the same thing as meat.

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:05.620
LEANNE BROWN: Eggs are protein.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.220
GAIL SIMMONS: Right.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.580
And beans are protein.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.205
And there's a lot of ways to get
great protein without focusing

00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:12.704
on meat.

00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:13.220
I think.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.111
And you discuss that a
lot in the book actually.

00:42:16.111 --> 00:42:17.550
LEANNE BROWN: Hey, Eric.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:18.520
ERIC: Hey.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.060
Any thoughts on how the
food industry could help

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.260
meet these goals as well?

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.260
Changes they could make.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.580
For instance, I know
that sometimes people

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.970
who are low on money
are also low on time.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.510
And cooking from
scratch takes time.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.730
I'm a big Trader Joe's,
not for the prepared food

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.350
because they kind of like
take a whole butternut squash

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.350
and cut it into
little cubes for me.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.300
Do you have any other thoughts
that have come up in your work

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.341
around how the industry
can help meet you halfway

00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:43.100
in getting people
to do more cooking.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.410
LEANNE BROWN: I think it's
a great point you bring up.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.770
I really like that as
well, like those sorts

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:52.244
of taking basic foods, and
just half preparing them.

00:42:52.244 --> 00:42:53.702
Not going the full
way where you're

00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:56.090
getting your frozen samosas.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.450
But the cubed butternut squash.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.330
The problem is often that those
also come with a cost increase,

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:01.830
right?

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.130
Because it's like
the bags of spinach

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.762
that are prewashed
and beautiful.

00:43:05.762 --> 00:43:07.720
They're double the price
of a bunch of spinach.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.710
And I mean that's one of
those basic tips is usually

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.970
the more work you
have to do to it,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.740
the cheaper it's going to be.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.830
But if there is a way to sort
of to use scale to make it so

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.980
those are more accessible,
then absolutely.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.334
Gail, do you want to talk
about the grocery store

00:43:24.334 --> 00:43:25.500
that you were talking about?

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.440
GAIL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.930
Quickly, there was a man
who worked at Trader Joe's

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:34.950
for 30 years and he was the
president by the time he left.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:40.370
And he left a few years ago to
start a company called, Daily

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.760
Table, DailyTable.org.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.300
You can read about it.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.650
And right now it's sort of
in beta in Massachusetts,

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:50.440
in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:57.600
It is a grocery store that
takes in all of the almost

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.880
at the point of not being able
to sell produce and perishable

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.482
food from grocery stores and
retailers across the country

00:44:07.482 --> 00:44:08.690
and brings it to their store.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.500
So their shelves are
constantly being turned over

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.720
and they buy smaller amounts of
stuff that may be in two days

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.960
from now, a big grocery chain
wouldn't be able to sell.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.980
And sells it at
deep, deep discounts.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.360
And they open in food desert.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.300
They open in communities
that don't have access

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.560
to other grocery stores.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.080
And so that thinking,
that idea I think--

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.050
and I have every
ounce of confidence

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.590
that this model
will really take off

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.490
and he'll be able to build a
chain across the country of it

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:46.350
because it's extraordinary--
it has allowed people

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.560
on limited budgets of
any kind to have access

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.390
to fresh fruits or
vegetables in a way

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.210
that they never have before.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.751
Because the other
piece of the puzzle

00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:57.640
that we've all sort of skirted
around and talked about that's

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.030
so connected and there's so many
sides to this is food waste.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.560
And that's also part of the
problem, that we as a nation

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.410
are wasting 30% of the
food that we produce.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.310
And that has to change in order
for costs to come down as well.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:10.460
LEANNE BROWN: Right.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.459
Well, I mean that's
actually why the Food Stamps

00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:15.140
program came to be.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.800
Was actually because of
the crisis in America

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.855
there is so much food
available, but it's not

00:45:21.855 --> 00:45:22.980
going to where it's needed.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.090
GAIL SIMMONS: And
that's still the issue.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.465
The issue is not
that there isn't

00:45:25.465 --> 00:45:27.440
enough food in this country.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.380
LEANNE BROWN: It's a
distribution problem.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.463
GAIL SIMMONS: It's a
distribution issues, exactly.

00:45:30.463 --> 00:45:34.186
And it's a government subsidy
issue to some extent as well.

00:45:34.186 --> 00:45:36.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
guys, again, for coming.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.184
This has been really great.

00:45:37.184 --> 00:45:39.740
I have a question about what
happened once you start gaining

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.650
momentum and popularity.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.760
Did other experts or people
working in this space

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.740
try to jump in on
your cookbook and get

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.819
their recipes or
their ideas involved?

00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:50.860
LEANNE BROWN: Not really.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.540
I mean I had a tremendous
amount of encouragement

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.894
from other people.

00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:57.810
Yeah, I mean people send
me recipes sometimes.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.393
Or will say, hey,
you're missing this.

00:45:59.393 --> 00:46:00.640
You should have this.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.900
But I have to sort of take
that with a grain of salt

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.340
and go like, well,
what is my wider goal?

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.270
But no, people were incredibly
kind to me actually I think.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.350
Because I think this issue
is really, really important

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:15.372
to everyone.

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:16.830
Yeah, people were
just tremendously

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.960
encouraging to be honest.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.960
AUDIENCE: I'm surprised.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.460
LEANNE BROWN: I
know it's very cool.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.002
GAIL SIMMONS: Have
faith in humanity.

00:46:23.002 --> 00:46:25.376
LEANNE BROWN: Gave me so much
faith in humanity actually,

00:46:25.376 --> 00:46:25.900
overall.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.150
Not just experts, but just
the Kickstarter itself.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.210
People care about this issue
enormously, but we all I think,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.980
feel, and I frequently feel,
like unsure in the face of it.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.280
It's such a big problem.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.300
GAIL SIMMONS: Overwhelmed
by how we can actually

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.074
do anything as individuals.

00:46:45.074 --> 00:46:45.990
LEANNE BROWN: Exactly.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:49.430
And in a way we can't
do a lot as individuals.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.810
And that's a fact.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.540
It's large policy shifts
that will make an impact,

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.030
but we want to help
with these things.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.280
And so I think supporting
the Kickstarter,

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.510
sort of being able to get this
book out to some more people,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.520
being able to sort of point to
this as some type of evidence,

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.650
as some sort of piece of hope,
meant a lot to a lot of people.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.080
And they were willing to
put their money behind it

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.910
and put their confidence behind
it and let more people know,

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:16.820
so that it spread.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.730
And to me that just
shows awesome things.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.230
GAIL SIMMONS: Well,
it's empowering.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.689
It's empowering for people
like us who want to help,

00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:26.480
but don't know how.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.840
And I think it's empowering to
the people who this book was

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.430
originally conceived for
because it gives them a tool

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.060
that they'd otherwise not have.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.320
And it gives us all a voice and
makes us more aware of an issue

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.900
that we wouldn't otherwise
have the information

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.590
and channel to learn about.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.290
You are inspiring us.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:47.170
No, in truth.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.390
Thank you so much.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:50.890
LEANNE BROWN: Thank you.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.880
GAIL SIMMONS: One more question?

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming again.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.290
I was just wondering if you
had a specific audience in mind

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.900
when you were
writing the cookbook.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.680
More specifically, whether it
was for singles or for people

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.040
supporting families
because as a single person,

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.620
I find it difficult
to go grocery shopping

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.490
and difficult to
cook for one person.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.400
Either you're cooking
a lot of the same thing

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.210
and it gets boring.

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.370
Or things tend to go bad quicker
because you're not consuming it

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:16.200
fast enough.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.330
LEANNE BROWN: Yeah, totally.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.240
Great question actually.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.850
So, so many cookbooks are
really designed for people

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.550
with families,
which is important I

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.270
think because it's a big issue.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.199
And it I think it
feels more acute.

00:48:28.199 --> 00:48:30.490
It's like, oh my gosh, I have
all these people to feed.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.720
Ugh.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:38.270
But I really wanted for everyone
with every kind of family size

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.350
with all kinds of
backgrounds to be

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.540
able to recognize something
of themselves in this.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.620
And so I really tried to
make it as open as possible.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:50.480
And I actually thought a
lot about single people

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.270
because I feel like
they're less catered to,

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:55.650
which is very important.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.320
Because it's so difficult
when you have very little,

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.860
like you cannot take advantage
of a lot of the sort of scale

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.950
things that can help, if
you have a larger family.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:08.460
You know it can feel very
demoralizing to sometimes

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.300
to cook for one or to eat the
same thing over and over again.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.050
That's one of the
reasons I have a lot of,

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.930
here's how to use
up leftovers, here's

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.090
how to kind of create a
few different things that

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.360
have the same basic five
things over and over.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.150
I have a lot of that
kind of information

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.760
because I think
that's a big deal.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.250
I have the stuff
on toast section.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.400
Is like that's what I
eat when Dan's away,

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.210
or when I'm just on my own,
or when he stays late and eats

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.370
at Google all the time.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.777
And I've heard from a lot
of people who are also

00:49:42.777 --> 00:49:44.360
single who said, oh
my gosh, thank you

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.385
for like giving me permission
to have this be a meal.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.460
And that's actually
a big thing, is

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.700
we can eat whatever we
want at any time of day.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.504
It doesn't matter.

00:49:54.504 --> 00:49:56.670
Like that's one of the
awesome things about cooking.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.340
You do not have to have a
meat with two vegetables

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.390
and that's your dinner.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.340
Otherwise, you're
not doing it right.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.540
There are so many different
things that we can eat.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.570
And I think sometimes you
just need a little nudge

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.560
and a reminder that
that's totally OK.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.910
And so long as you're enjoying
it that hopefully you're

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.076
eating a reasonable number
of fruits and vegetables,

00:50:15.076 --> 00:50:17.740
you're fine.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.230
And sometimes that means
eating really, really simply.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.040
So I tried to design it
very much to have people

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.740
from all walks of life be
able to recognize themselves.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.970
And that means to some
extent, that it's not

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.650
for any one group of people.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.330
And so I'm always
shocked when people say,

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.080
I've tried every single
thing in the book.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.050
I'm like, really?

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.070
Because I think that people
will take it and go like,

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.150
OK, there's five recipes in here
that I really like, whatever.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.856
But I can't remember where
I was going with this.

00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:49.730
GAIL SIMMONS: There's
something for everyone.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.896
LEANNE BROWN: I hope there's
something for everyone.

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:55.760
A few weeks ago, I
had someone come up

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.100
at another event I was doing and
said, you know the Roti in here

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.889
is something that
we've made as a family

00:51:02.889 --> 00:51:05.430
because we're from the Caribbean
and we've made it for years.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.719
And that made us feel so
excited about this book.

00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:10.260
That this was something that we
made in our home and so maybe

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.530
there were some other ideas.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.614
And I think that's just a
very natural response is

00:51:13.614 --> 00:51:15.238
if you see something,
you're like, hey,

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:16.830
I know what that
is, I like that, it

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.750
makes you trust and be
interested in the rest

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.249
of the book.

00:51:19.249 --> 00:51:22.680
And so I just wanted it to
be as inviting as possible.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.590
GAIL SIMMONS: Including Awesome.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.799
LEANNE BROWN: You're welcome.

00:51:26.799 --> 00:51:29.131
GAIL SIMMONS: I think that's
all we have time for today.

00:51:29.131 --> 00:51:30.650
Thanks for joining
us on your lunch.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:31.050
I know--

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:31.890
LEANNE BROWN: Thanks, guys.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:32.690
GAIL SIMMONS: --that
everyone has a busy day.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.320
LEANNE BROWN: I'll let
you get back to work.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.915
GAIL SIMMONS: Thanks guys.

00:51:36.915 --> 00:51:37.865
Thank you.

00:51:37.865 --> 00:51:40.095
LEANNE BROWN: Thank you.
