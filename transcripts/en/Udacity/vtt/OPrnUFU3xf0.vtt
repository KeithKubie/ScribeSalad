00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:06.950
Finally, we want to improve this
orientation for future students as well.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.550
In the instructor notes below,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.070
you'll find a link to a survey where you
can give us feedback on the orientation.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.720
Are there any tools
that we didn't cover?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.250
Any tips you'd like to share?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.210
Any additional information you'd
like to see in this orientation?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.690
Let us know in that survey.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.960
We'll duplicate the link
at the end of every lesson.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.400
&gt;&gt; But for now, welcome to Georgia Tech.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.530
Let's get started.
