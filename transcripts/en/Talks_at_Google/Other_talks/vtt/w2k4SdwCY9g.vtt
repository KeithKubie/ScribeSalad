SONIA SHAH: Hello.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.480
Thank you guys for coming.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.720
I'm Sonia Shah.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.760
I'm a science journalist.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.704
I've spent the last six
years looking at pandemics.

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:12.745
And when I first started
writing this book-- this

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:17.220
is my fourth book-- when I first
started writing it in 2010,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.950
I certainly didn't
think we'd actually

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.630
be living through a pandemic
of a brand-new pathogen right

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.370
when it came out.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.120
But of course here we
are, with the Zika virus

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.060
washing over the Americas.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.140
And it's a really
good example of what's

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.920
been going on globally,
and why I decided

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.480
to write this book in the first
place, which is that we've had,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.980
over the past 50 years, over
300 infectious pathogens that

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.620
have either newly
emerged or reemerged

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.990
into new places where they
never have been seen before.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.000
So Zika's really
just the latest one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.410
We've had Ebola in
West Africa, where

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.130
it hadn't been seen before,
novel kinds of avian

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.730
influenzas that infect
birds and also some of them

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.650
infect humans, new
kinds of coronaviruses

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.529
that cause diseases like SARS,
a new one that's coming out

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:08.570
of the Middle East called
Middle East Respiratory

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.180
Syndrome, new kinds of
tick-borne illnesses,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.280
mosquito-borne viruses
from dengue to chikungunya

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.160
to West Nile virus.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.370
So the sense that
a pandemic, that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.990
is, an outbreak of disease that
starts in one part of the world

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.850
and then spreads like a wave
across global populations,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.690
is definitely growing.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.430
And that's not just the
opinion of the worried well,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.470
as they call us,
but also experts.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.770
This is a survey that was done
in 2006 of emerging disease

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.490
experts.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.420
And the majority said
that a pandemic that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.440
would sicken a billion
people, kill 165 million,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.260
and cost the global
economy $3 trillion

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.910
would occur sometime in
the next two generations.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.950
So the big question
is, of course,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.510
which pathogen is going to cause
this death and destruction?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.030
And we have a lot of
potential candidates.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.570
150,000 species of bacteria,
nearly a million viruses that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.500
can infect mammals-- so
picking out which one of these

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.170
will cause the next
pandemic may not be so easy.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.780
But while we can't
know which one,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.550
we can potentially
know how it happens.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.900
Because historically,
only a very few microbes

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.990
have been able to
cause pandemics.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.790
We've had Yersinia pestis, which
caused the Plague, influenza,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.070
which causes influenza
pandemics, Variola which causes

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.340
smallpox, HIV, which causes
the ongoing HIV pandemic,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.280
and then the fifth
one is cholera.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.410
This is the one that
interests me the most,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.960
in part because
it's very deadly.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.340
Cholera kills about half
of the people who get it,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.480
if they're not rapidly treated.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.820
But also because cholera is
one of the most successful

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.200
of our pandemic-causing
pathogens.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.340
It hasn't caused just
one or two pandemics.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.500
It's actually caused
seven pandemics.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.090
And the latest one is going on
right now just a few 100 miles

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.550
off the coast of
Florida in Haiti.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.610
So we think of cholera today
as a poor person's disease.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.230
And that is basically true now.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.580
But it wasn't true when cholera
was a brand-new disease.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.710
When cholera first emerged
in the 19th century,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.660
it hit some of the most advanced
cities of the time-- cities

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.870
like New York, which was
plagued by repeated epidemics

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.630
of cholera in the 1800s.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.070
And not just New York
City-- London, Paris,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.750
New Orleans-- all these places
were plagued by this scourge.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.420
And thousands of people died.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.810
But it wasn't just deadly.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.980
These epidemics are very
disruptive, as well.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.110
And this is sort of a hallmark
of new pathogens, which

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.150
is when they
emerge, people don't

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.117
know why they suddenly arrived.

00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:01.950
They don't know how
they're transmitted, how

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.230
they're spread between people.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.870
And they often start
to blame each other.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.660
So in the 1830s, the cholera
was blamed on the Irish.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.350
In the 1840s, it
was the Muslims.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.500
By the 1890s, it was
the Eastern Europeans

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.029
who were getting
blamed for the cholera.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.660
And this wasn't just
social exclusion.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.820
This was actually violent--
violent assaults as well.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.810
This picture is
of smashed skulls

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.750
that were scarred
by bullets that

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.310
were found in a mass grave.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.110
It was excavated outside
of Philadelphia in 2009.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.234
And what had happened
there is, in 1832,

00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:43.900
a bunch of Irish
immigrants were working

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.940
on a stretch of railway track.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.780
And there had been
a cholera outbreak.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.190
And the local community
quarantined the valley

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.500
that the Irish workers
are staying in.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.390
But then they also secretly came
back and massacred all of them,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.900
and buried them in this mass
grave, which we just recently

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.947
found.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:03.530
But it wasn't just
marginalized groups

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.330
that were attacked during
these outbreaks of disease.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.800
It was also healthcare workers.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.820
So doctors were routinely
stoned in the streets

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.010
during cholera outbreaks.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.690
Quarantine hospitals
were surrounded by mobs.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.850
A lot of them were burnt down.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.610
So the question I
wanted to ask is,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.370
how does a microbe cause all
of this death and destruction?

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.860
When you think about
a microbe, it's

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.740
this little, tiny,
microscopic thing

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.710
with no independent
locomotion at all.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.070
And yet it can cause
all of this devastation,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.179
and impact human history
in such a profound way.

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.720
And so what I wanted to look at
is, what are the drivers that

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.480
turn a microbe into a pandemic?

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.870
Cholera started in
the environment,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.370
which is where a
lot of new microbes

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.460
are coming out of today.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.104
It comes out of a place
called the Sundarbans.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.020
This is pictured here.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.470
It's where the major
rivers of South Asia

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.770
drain into the Bay of Bengal.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.260
And the water here is
half salty, half fresh.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.980
It's quite warm.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.576
It's quite alkaline.

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.450
And the bacteria that
causes cholera actually

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.330
lives naturally in
this environment,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.760
and in similar environments
around the world.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.740
It lives in conjunction
with zooplankton.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.090
And it actually is a peaceful
and useful inhabitant

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.210
in that environment.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.094
It helps recycle nutrients.

00:06:23.094 --> 00:06:24.510
And for a long
time, people didn't

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.970
live in places like the
superabundance of course

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.830
it's covered in mangrove
swamps the crocodiles there's

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.340
tigers there's cyclones.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.710
It's flooded by the
tides twice a day.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.770
That all changed, of
course, when the British Raj

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.340
decided to colonize
the Sundarbans

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.691
and turn it into rice farms.

00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.940
And this happened over the
course of the 19th century.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.680
Over 90% of the Sundarbans
was settled by people.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.000
So quite suddenly, humans
had invaded the habitat

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.670
of the cholera bacteria.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.230
And this allowed the bacteria
to spill over into our bodies.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.830
And inside the human
body, the cholera bacteria

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.850
performs a very
different function

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.307
than it does in its
natural environment.

00:07:08.307 --> 00:07:10.390
So if you ingest a little
bit of cholera bacteria,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.520
the bacteria will line
the interior of your gut.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.340
And it actually reverses
the normal functioning

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.960
of that organ, so that instead
of nourishing the tissues

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.700
in the body with fluids, the
cholera-infected gut actually

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.870
extracts fluids out of
the body and expels them

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.880
in a massive torrent of
watery diarrhea and vomiting.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.700
In fact, a person
infected with cholera

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.510
can lose 15 liters
of fluid a day.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.330
And that's what kills
you from cholera.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.812
You basically just
dehydrate to death.

00:07:44.812 --> 00:07:45.395
You desiccate.

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:49.197
It can happen in
a matter of hours.

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:51.530
So the first pandemic of
cholera began in the Sundarbans

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.045
in 1817.

00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:55.810
It started traveling
up into Russia, out

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.252
into this newly industrializing
cities of the Old World.

00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:01.710
But of course, to
cause a pandemic,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.720
it has spread across
to global populations.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.600
It would have to
cross the Atlantic.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.970
And all of this is happening
right at the transition

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.700
from sail to steam.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.677
So instead of taking eight
weeks to cross the Atlantic,

00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:17.510
over the course of the
early 1800s, suddenly

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.780
it was taking more
like one week.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.490
And once we started
building steamships,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.750
we could go not just down our
rivers but up them as well.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.900
And then we used steam
engines to build canals,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.250
like the Erie Canal
which opened in 1825.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.510
And that connected all
these waterways together.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.330
So we had this nice
network of waterways.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.850
It's like a highway system.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.640
And it was perfect for cholera
to come over from London

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.340
to Paris, over the
Atlantic into Canada,

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.750
and thence filter throughout
the interior of North America.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.590
And of course, at this time we
were urbanizing really rapidly.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.830
This was a new form
of living in cities.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.480
People are rushing
out of the farms

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.360
into the cities for
new factory jobs.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.630
Places like New York City were
becoming incredibly crowded.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.600
Of course, there were no
subway hookups and highways

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.540
to let people sprawl
outside of the city center.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.940
So everyone had
to live near work

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.970
or the possibility of work.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.840
In the most crowded
parts of New York City,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.480
there was about 77,000
people per square kilometer.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.060
So that's six times more
crowded than modern-day Tokyo.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.610
It's also 1,000
times more crowded

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.840
than anyone had ever lived
before-- brand-new way

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.880
of living.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.076
So suddenly, people are
really close together,

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:34.950
breathing each other.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.180
They're touching
each other more.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.055
And they also created
a huge sanitary crisis.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.580
So when people moved from
the farms to the cities,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.490
they didn't come up with a new
way of managing human waste.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.320
They basically just used that
old system in the new place.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.490
And the old system was simply
to use outhouses and privies

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.340
and cesspools, and let the
human waste just kind of sink

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.750
into the ground and decompose.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.120
So that works OK in places where
there is not a lot of crowding,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.370
and there's enough
room for, and space

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.960
for, this stuff to decompose.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.660
But that's not what
happened in New York

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.620
City and similar
industrialized cities.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.960
Across New York, there's
about 1/12 of the city

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.770
was covered with cesspools,
privies, and outhouses.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.370
There was no such sewer system
to carry this stuff away

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.060
and to treat it.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.900
There weren't even
any rules, actually,

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.030
that you had to empty out
your outhouses or cesspools.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.740
So all of this
material was allowed

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.080
to simply sink into the ground,
spill over into the streets,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.920
spill over into people's
wells, and then down

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.570
into the groundwater.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.090
The typical 19th
century New Yorker

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.280
was ingesting
about two teaspoons

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.950
of fecal matter every day.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.450
So you can imagine when cholera
came into a city like that,

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.910
it just exploded.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.160
And this happened
time and time again.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.000
Now, there were things that they
could have done even back then.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.712
But there were
political problems, too.

00:11:06.712 --> 00:11:08.170
So the public health
infrastructure

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.045
had just started out.

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:11.530
And meanwhile, this was the
era of the robber barons.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.680
Private interests had
become incredibly powerful.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.620
And when they objected to
certain public health measures,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.630
they were not inactive.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.070
For example, in 1832,
the Governor of New York

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.252
actually sent a doctor up to
upstate New York and Canada

00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:31.210
to see what was happening--
to do surveillance,

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.170
see if cholera is going to
threaten the City of New York.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.220
And this is the data that
that doctor collected

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.320
in 1832, which we've mapped.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.680
It shows a pretty clear picture.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.810
Cholera is coming
down the Hudson River.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.690
It's coming down the Erie Canal.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.465
And it's heading straight
for New York City.

00:11:50.465 --> 00:11:51.840
So the obvious
thing, then, would

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.290
have been to enact a
quarantine on the waterways.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.930
But they didn't, because
private interests

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.440
decided that that would be
far too disruptive to trade.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.860
And so cholera was allowed
to come down these waterways

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.270
again and again.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.070
In fact, there
were companies that

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.500
were making money selling
cholera-contaminated water

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.487
to the people of New York.

00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:16.820
The epicenter of a lot of the
cholera epidemics happened

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.850
in a slum called Five Points,
which is pictured here.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.630
If you've ever seen the movie
"Gangs of New York," the Martin

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.690
Scorsese movie, that's
actually about Five Points.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.190
So this was the epicenter of a
lot of the cholera epidemics.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.830
And this slum, unlike
the rest of Manhattan,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.410
which is built on
bedrock, this slum

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.650
was actually built on
what was once a pond.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.940
It was the only source of
fresh water in Manhattan.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.760
That pond had been
filled up with garbage.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.930
And then the slum had
been built on top of it.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.540
So the ground underneath
the slum was very unstable.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.980
It was low lying.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.590
And of course, the
groundwater underneath it

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.310
was very easily
contaminated with all

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.730
of the outhouses and privies
of the slum on top of it.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.750
But the company that the
State of New York chartered

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.190
to deliver drinking water
to the people of New York,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.150
rather than tap upstream sources
of water-- which they knew

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.140
would be fresher and which
would taste better-- they

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.270
decided to save money,
kind of like what

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.830
happened in Flint, Michigan.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.180
They sank their well right
in the middle of that slum.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.500
And they delivered
that water to one-third

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.880
of the people of New York.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.989
And this happened repeatedly
throughout the 1800s.

00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:33.280
And the reason they did that--
actually, the person who

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.870
was behind all of these
machinations that allowed this

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.590
to happen was the notorious
Aaron Burr, who we all

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.360
love to hate now-- the bad
boy of the American founding.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.480
And the reason he did
that is because he wanted

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.540
to start a bank-- the Bank
of the Manhattan Company,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.110
of course, which ended up
being incredibly powerful.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.340
Do any of you guys know
what the bank of the company

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.480
is called today?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.560
It's JP Morgan Chase-- the
biggest bank in the country.

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:06.240
So it wasn't just political
defenses that failed.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.950
It was also medical
defenses that failed.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.620
Doctors simply applied their
thinking on old diseases

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.470
to the new disease.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.380
So the old way of
thinking about diseases

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.310
was that they were caused
by what were called miasmas.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.350
These were basically
stinky airs that

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.790
rise up from decomposing
organic material.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.110
And the idea is
that these stinky

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.950
airs-- if you inhale
them, you get sick.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.160
I mean, this is based on a
2000-year-old Hippocratic

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.549
theory.

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:38.090
And it made a certain
amount of sense

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.990
for old diseases like,
say, malaria, which

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.270
isn't carried by stinky air.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.228
But certainly the mosquitoes
that carry malaria

00:14:44.228 --> 00:14:47.000
would be more likely to
exist in the sulfurous airs

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.290
around swamps and
things like that.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.530
But when applied to a
new disease like cholera,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.840
miasmatism could make
the disease much worse.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.050
So for example, in
the city of London,

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.170
over the course of
the 1700s and 1800s,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.870
people had started
installing water closets,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.709
or what we know
as flush toilets.

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:09.000
And they thought this would
be really healthy for them,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.420
because it would get rid of all
the bad smells of human waste.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.220
You rid the stuff, read
the smell out of your home,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.350
out of your street, and
just flush it all away.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.660
But the thing is, they didn't
care about the contents

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.460
of the flushed toilets.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.460
All they cared
about was the smell.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.690
So they didn't mind
that the contents of all

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.820
of these flush toilets
was dumped directly

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.260
into the River Thames, which
was their drinking water.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.810
And in fact, after
every cholera outbreak

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.180
the people of London
installed more flush

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.780
toilets to dump more
of their human waste

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.499
into the drinking
water, rather than less.

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:50.040
So the other question
I wanted to ask

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.580
is, could this happen again?

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.290
And I went around to
places where new pathogens

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.210
are emerging today to try to
see how the story of cholera

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.210
could shed light on
what might happen

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.200
with these other new pathogens.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.370
And what I found is,
those same drivers

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.270
that brought cholera into
human populations in the 1900s

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.840
are being recreated today,
but on a global scale.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.990
So we're invading wild habitat
on a scale never seen before.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.080
And that's because our
populations are growing,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.960
and also, our industrial
developments are growing.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.900
And what this means is that
we're disrupting and invading

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.810
a lot of wildlife habitat.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:32.510
And as we do that, humans come
into novel, intimate contact

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.141
with different wild
animals, wild species.

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:38.390
And that allows the microbes
that live in their bodies

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.600
to spill over into our bodies.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.050
And a great example
of that is Ebola.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.630
So this whole swath of
the continent of Africa

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.000
has been deforested
pretty steadily,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.740
not just because of urbanization
and farms growing, and mines,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.370
and things like that, but also
because of political violence.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.890
Those three countries
on the westernmost side

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.030
of Africa-- Sierra Leone,
Guinea, and Liberia--

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.790
where those three
countries meet was once

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.050
one of the most biodiverse
forests in the world.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.810
But over the course
of the 1990s,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.060
there was an incredibly
complex political conflict--

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.140
very bloody, went on for years.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.010
And one result of that
was 600,000 refugees

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.310
fled into that forest
to escape the fighting.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.760
And what happened to that
forest is visible from space.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.250
The inset in this picture
shows where that forest is--

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.580
those three countries meet.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.630
And the inset is from 1970.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.120
It shows almost all green.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.080
The bigger picture is from 1999.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.360
And that's a satellite
picture-- the same one.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.693
And it shows that area where
those three countries meet.

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:50.530
It's mostly all brown,
because only 15%

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.820
of that original
forest remained.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.830
And what we now know
is that whole area

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.770
that's been deforested
overlaps pretty well

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.970
with the habitat of fruit bats.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.510
And fruit bats, as we now know,
is a reservoir of Ebola virus.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.060
And as people come into
novel, intimate contact

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.000
with fruit bats, the viruses
and microbes that live in bats

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.730
spill over into our bodies.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.570
And that's exactly what
happened in December 2013,

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.310
when a two-year-old child who
lived near that deforested area

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.340
where those three
countries meet-- we

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.330
know he was playing near a tree
where bats were known to roost.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.120
And so maybe he touched some
bat saliva or some bat excreta.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.760
However it happened, the
Ebola virus from the bat

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.220
got into this boy's body.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.930
And he got sick.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.930
And before he died, he
infected his family members.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.280
And they infected their
healthcare workers.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.050
And they infected
their family members,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.170
until we had the biggest
outbreak of Ebola

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.430
in history-- bigger than all
previous outbreaks of Ebola

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.010
combined.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.450
Over 11,000 people died.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.990
But this isn't just
happening in far-off places.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.670
This is happening right here
in the United States, too.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.970
West Nile virus, for
example-- West Nile virus

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.650
is a virus of migratory birds.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.610
They come from Africa.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.880
They fly over here by
the millions every year,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.840
because-- especially in
places like New York--

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.790
it's on a flyaway.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.070
So they land here a lot.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.090
But we didn't have West
Nile virus in people

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:29.060
until 1999, because we
had a very diverse bird

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.470
flock around us.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.890
We had birds like
woodpeckers, and rails,

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.940
and other bird species.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.024
And those birds actually
repel the virus.

00:19:38.024 --> 00:19:40.190
So as long as you have a
lot of diverse bird species

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.630
around, including
woodpeckers and rails,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.296
you don't have that
much West Nile virus

00:19:43.296 --> 00:19:45.110
around in your
domestic bird flocks.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.630
And you're not so likely to
get West Nile virus in humans.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.560
But what happened over
the past 25 years is,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.294
we've lost a lot of
that biodiversity.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.960
So right now, actually
in last 25 years,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.970
American Robin populations
have doubled as the woodpeckers

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.310
and rails have vanished.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.700
So of course,
robins and crows can

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.560
live in any kind of
broken environment.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.260
But woodpeckers and rails can't.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.730
And it turns out that,
unlike woodpeckers and rails,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:17.340
robins and crows are excellent
amplifiers of West Nile virus.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.880
So the fewer woodpeckers
and rails you have around,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.200
and the more robins and
crows you have around,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.614
the more West Nile
virus you have around.

00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:26.530
And the more likely it
is that a mosquito will

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.550
bite an infected bird
and then bite a human,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.820
and trigger an epidemic.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.600
And that's exactly
what happened in 1999,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.100
with the first outbreak of West
Nile virus in New York City.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.710
And since then, the
virus has steadily

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.360
spread across the nation.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.160
This map is all
the counties where

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.400
West Nile virus-infected
birds have been found.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.800
Similarly, in the Northeastern
forest, when it was intact

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.170
we had a diversity
of woodland species.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.130
We had chipmunks.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.400
We had opossum.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.540
We had deer and mice.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.470
And these animals helped
control tick populations.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:07.360
The typical opossum actually
destroys 6,000 ticks a week

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.612
through grooming.

00:21:09.612 --> 00:21:11.070
But what we've done
is we've broken

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.420
this forest up into a
little patchwork quilt

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.670
as we've expanded our suburbs
into the Northeastern forests.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.220
And opossums and
chipmunks-- they

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.130
don't survive well in
that broken environment.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.300
But what do have a lot
of is deer and mice.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.110
While the typical possum will
destroy 6,000 ticks a week,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.960
the typical mouse destroys
about 50 ticks a week.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.680
So the fewer opossums you have
around and the more mice you

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.230
have around, the more ticks you
have around and the more likely

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.130
it is that an outbreak
of tick-borne disease

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.230
will happen in humans.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.720
And that's exactly what
happened in the late 1970s

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.620
in Connecticut with the first
outbreak of Lyme disease.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.600
And that has steadily
crossed the country, as well.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.320
We have about 300,000 Americans
diagnosed with Lyme disease

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.750
every year.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.224
So we're driving pathogens
into human populations

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:06.390
in all these different ways.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.765
But then we're
also offering them

00:22:07.765 --> 00:22:11.250
these fantastic amplification
opportunities, just

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.080
like those slums in New York
City in the 19th century.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.390
So that process of urbanization
that started back then

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.870
is really reaching its peak now.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.940
By 2030, the majority
of the human species

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.844
will live in cities.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.260
And they're not
going to be cities

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.820
like New York and Seattle.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.280
They're going to be cities more
like Monrovia and Freetown--

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.360
lots of ad hoc development,
not a lot of infrastructure,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.040
and a lot of slums.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.820
About two billion
people are expected

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.355
to be living in slums by 2030.

00:22:43.355 --> 00:22:45.480
And there are pathogens
that are already exploiting

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.490
this-- new pathogens.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.920
Ebola is one example.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.072
We've had Ebola outbreaks
since the 1970s.

00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:55.030
But they've always been
really relatively small

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.410
and contained,
because they never

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.570
infected any place that had more
than a few 100,000 inhabitants.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.590
Within a few weeks of
emerging in Guinea in 2013,

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.760
Ebola had reached
three capital cities

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.090
with a combined population
of nearly three million.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.820
And this is one
important reason why it

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.810
was such a huge conflagration.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.810
Similarly, Zika virus is
exploiting urbanization, too.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.340
We've had Zika at
least since the 1940s.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.740
But it was carried
by a forest mosquito

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.830
in the equatorial forests
of Africa and Asia.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.232
And that forest mosquito didn't
really bite people that much.

00:23:32.232 --> 00:23:33.190
It lived in the forest.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.860
It mostly bit animals.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.910
Today, Zika is being
carried by a mosquito called

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.650
Aedes aegypti.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.660
This is a mosquito
that has dramatically

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.940
expanded its range
as we have urbanized,

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.400
especially in the tropics.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.060
It can breed in a drop
of water in a bottle cap.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.450
It loves all of
our plastic garbage

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.730
that we leave lying around.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.770
And on top of that,
it only bites humans.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.570
So it's one important reason
why Zika is now exploding so

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.830
dramatically in the Americas.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.610
But we're not just
offering crowds of people

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.080
to our pathogens to amplify.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.910
We're also offering
them crowds of animals.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.740
We have more animals
under domestication

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.200
today than in the last
10,000 years of domestication

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.520
up until 1960
combined-- huge number

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.860
of animals as our
demand for meat goes up

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.900
and the demand for protein.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.740
And a lot of these
animals are being

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.560
kept in the animal equivalent of
a slum, which are these factory

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.020
farms, where there's a million
or more individuals crammed

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.460
really closely together.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.670
And this offers pathogens
other opportunities to amplify.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.090
One example is avian influenza.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.630
So avian influenza normally
lives in wild waterfowl,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.840
like ducks and goose and stuff.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.750
And it doesn't really
make them sick.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.960
But when those viruses
drop into a factory

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.890
farm full of
captive chickens, it

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.090
starts to replicate really
wildly, and mutate, and evolve,

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.699
and become more virulent.

00:25:03.699 --> 00:25:05.240
And this has happened
again and again

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.550
with increasing frequency
as factory farming has

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.840
spread in Asia, where we have
most of our wild waterfowl.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.970
And some of these
mutated viruses

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.320
can actually infect
humans as well.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.814
And this is, of course,
creating a new sanitary crisis.

00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:23.480
We have about 2.6 billion people
around the world today who have

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.679
no access to modern sanitation.

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:27.470
So they're living in
19th century standards

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.160
already, to this day.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.750
But on top of that, we also have
seven billion tons of animal

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.530
excreta to manage every year.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.260
And this is far more than our
croplands can possibly absorb,

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.830
which is how we used
to manage animal waste.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.620
So what farmers are doing
is collecting all this stuff

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.210
in giant manure lagoons, which
is what these pits are called.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.370
They're basically
just untreated,

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.530
unlined cesspools
of animal waste.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.930
And so when it rains,
or if there's storms,

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.667
all of this material gets
out into the environment.

00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:03.000
And this is one reason why
we have an increasing problem

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.570
with virulent forms of E. coli.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.770
You probably heard of
killer hamburger virus.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:14.530
These are caused by viruses like
shiga toxin-producing E. coli.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.300
And this microbe
normally lives in cattle.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.520
About half of all American
cattle on feedlots

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.090
is infected with shiga
toxin-producing E. coli.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.840
It doesn't really
make them sick.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.200
But because cattle manure
so often contaminates

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.330
our food and water, we
have about 7,000 Americans

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.230
getting sick with shiga
toxin-producing E.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.535
coli every year.

00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:39.410
And then of course,
we're carrying this stuff

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.210
around in the most
efficient method possible,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.690
which is our flight network.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.330
We don't just have a few
airports in capital cities,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.980
but thousands of airports,
even in small towns,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.360
and hundreds of thousands
of connections between them.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.360
So when a pathogen emerges
in one part of the world,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.440
it can very rapidly spread
through the rest of the globe,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.700
as this simulation
of a flu pandemic

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.890
shows on this geographic map.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.920
And in fact, you can predict
where an epidemic will strike

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.530
next, simply by
measuring the number

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.950
of direct flights between
infected and uninfected cities.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.650
So this is the same flu pandemic
on a map of cities as connected

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.070
by direct flights.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.370
And when you run that
simulation, on a map like this,

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.611
it's just a perfect
series of waves.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.120
So we're driving these
pathogens into our populations.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.260
But of course, we have a lot of
defenses-- and better defenses

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.620
now than we did in
the 19th century.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.230
And yet we still have
similar challenges.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.100
Of the 100 biggest
economies in the world

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.780
today, only 49 are governments.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.960
51 are corporations.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.220
And so when our public health
strategies come into conflict

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.550
with private interests, we're
not able to implement them.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:00.370
And a good example of that is
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:05.980
We've known since the 1980s
that if you use antibiotics

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.270
in a way that's not
medically necessary,

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.310
you will trigger the evolution
of antibiotic-resistant

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.970
bacteria.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.260
But today, all of that
blue part of that pie chart

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.110
is commercial use
of antibiotics.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.339
That's 80% of the
antibiotics that

00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:21.880
are consumed in the
United States are

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.160
used for commercial reasons.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.880
That is, farmers give them in
low doses to their livestock

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.690
to help fatten them
for market so they can

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.800
bring them to market faster.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.580
So it's really
just a tiny sliver

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.700
of our antibiotic consumption
that is medically necessary.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.260
And yet attempts to control
this have failed again and again

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.240
since the 1970s.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.430
We've just barely started
making kind of baby steps

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.310
towards reining
in this practice.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.510
And we have 23,000
people dying of

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:55.110
antibiotic-resistant bacteria
every year as a result.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.190
Now, our medicine
is far superior

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.150
than it was in the 19th
century, of course.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.750
We can very rapidly come up with
cures and drugs and vaccines

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.730
for new pathogens.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.100
But I would argue there
is still a mismatch.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.430
So a lot of these pathogens
are coming out of wildlife

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.090
or coming out of animals.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.650
They're coming through
human populations,

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.830
being driven by social
and political factors.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.450
So you would think, then,
that the best way to contain

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.870
these threats is through
a multidisciplinary kind

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.099
of collaborative process.

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.390
You get the wildlife biologist.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.847
You get the ecologist,
get the epidemiologist,

00:29:30.847 --> 00:29:31.680
you get the doctors.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.888
You get the social scientists
and the anthropologists

00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:37.150
and the political scientists,
and you approach it that way.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.760
But that's not what we do.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.310
So we think of
contagious disease

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.720
as solely a biomedical problem.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.270
And one example of what
happens is dengue in Florida,

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.442
and how that was managed.

00:29:49.442 --> 00:29:51.640
Dengue virus is
carried by mosquitoes.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.010
It first emerged in
Florida in 2009--

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.020
hadn't been seen
there in 70 years.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.540
And we immediately attacked
it as a biomedical problem.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.070
We mobilized our resources
to target the mosquito,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.160
target the virus with killing
chemicals-- sort of attacked

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.040
this invasion of
mosquitoes and virus.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.440
In fact, though,
Florida has been

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.620
surrounded by places where
there's dengue for a long time.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.670
The mosquitoes that carry dengue
have been present in Florida

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.260
for a long time.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.040
So there wasn't actually
any invasion to repel.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.780
What had happened is in 2008,
we had the foreclosure crisis.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.620
And it hit Florida
particularly hard.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.320
And since it's
Florida, when there's

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.986
a lot of abandoned
homes around, there's

00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:43.257
also a lot of empty
swimming pools.

00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:45.840
And when the rains came, all of
these abandoned swimming pools

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.640
started to fill up
with standing water.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.040
And they became giant
mosquito hatcheries.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.630
And a year later, we had
this unprecedented outbreak

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.980
of dengue in Florida.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.830
Now, would have addressing
the housing crisis

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.040
have helped prevent
or even contain

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.840
the dengue outbreak in Florida?

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.230
I don't know, because
nobody tried that.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.150
What I do know is arguably,
the biomedical response

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.610
has failed, in the sense that
we keep attacking dengue,

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.080
but now it's considered
endemic in Florida.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.110
Dengue's considered
a permanent part

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.096
of the landscape
of Florida today.

00:31:21.096 --> 00:31:22.220
So what can we do about it?

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.830
This is not a crystal
ball, of course.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.854
This is not Nostradamus.

00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:26.770
This is not what's
definitely going to happen.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.062
This is what's going to
happen if we don't change.

00:31:30.062 --> 00:31:31.520
And there's a lot
of things I think

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.450
we can do to mitigate
the risk of pandemics.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.220
This is a typical
epidemic curve.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.940
It shows cases over time
that occur in a completely

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.060
susceptible population.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.532
So the pathogen starts
to cause some sickness,

00:31:45.532 --> 00:31:47.240
and then it starts to
grow exponentially.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.610
It reaches a peak when
the majority of people

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.990
have either been sick and
have died, or have been sick

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.960
and recovered.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.810
And then the epidemic
will start to collapse.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:01.560
So our present system of
surveillance for new diseases--

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.840
the best we can do
at the moment is

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.540
start to attack these
things right about there,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.970
where that arrow is.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.190
So exponential growth
of untreatable disease

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.990
has already begun.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.310
And so to contain
it at that point,

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.720
you need almost perfect control.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.090
You need to stamp out
every single case,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.350
because you already
have exponential growth.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.320
But what if you push that
back just a little bit?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.230
And that is now possible.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.836
We don't know
which pathogens are

00:32:30.836 --> 00:32:32.210
going to cause
the next pandemic,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.050
but since we do know how,
we can predict where.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.980
And this map is a map
of disease hotspots.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.840
It's places where there is a
lot of invasion of wildlife

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.340
habitat, a lot of
intensification of agriculture,

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.320
of livestock agriculture,
a lot of slums,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.670
a lot of flight connections, or
some combination of all of that

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.950
together.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.750
And these are places
where scientists

00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:00.220
believe new pathogens are
most likely to emerge.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.350
So we can do, in these
places, active surveillance,

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.837
so that going out
into the environment,

00:33:05.837 --> 00:33:08.420
looking out wildlife, looking
at people on the front lines who

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.240
are dealing with
wildlife, and trying

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.080
to track how microbes
might be changing,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.220
and stamp them out before
they start to spread.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.165
And there's an ad hoc group
of academic groups, NGOs,

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.040
some government actors
who are actually doing

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.910
this kind of work right now.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.100
Of course, all of us need to
become responsible citizens,

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.980
too, in this new
age of pandemics.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.920
And that's doing
some obvious things,

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.680
like washing hands, and staying
away from antibiotics, avoiding

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.880
factory meats, and all that.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.260
But we also need to just be
informed that each pathogen is

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.210
different.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.110
Because I think the big
missing piece in the whole way

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.450
we approach pandemics
is public engagement.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.550
We really leave this all up
to the biomedical experts.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.590
Instead, we all need to
be engaged in the rising

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.950
risks of the way we live today.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.290
And ultimately, I think what
the history of pandemics

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:08.050
has taught me is that all
these things are connected.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.719
Human health is connected to
the health of our societies,

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.489
the health of our animals,
the health of our wildlife,

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.290
the health of our ecosystems.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.550
These are all connected.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.699
So we need to kind
of re-imagine the way

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.790
we think of ourselves
in this microbial world

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.350
that we all live in.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.360
And ultimately, I think it is
possible to prevent pandemics

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.590
altogether, by just changing
the conditions that give rise

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.460
to them.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.690
We could do things like
restore wild habitat

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.510
so that microbes that live
in animals stay in animals

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.250
and don't spill over
into human bodies.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.679
We can do things like protect
the health of the most

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.620
vulnerable among
us-- the people who

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.820
are living without
sanitation, the people who

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.510
are living in slums, the animals
who are living in their factory

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.710
farm slums.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.120
Because their health is now
very obviously connected

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.907
to the rest of us, too.

00:34:56.907 --> 00:34:58.240
And I'm happy to take questions.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.376
Thank you so much for listening.

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:04.182
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.378
Anyone?

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:18.160
I stunned them all into silence.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.870
Well, great.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:19.640
Oh, here we go.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.280
AUDIENCE: I guess
I'll ask a question.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.980
I really loved the talk.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.110
And I loved the way you
were able to connect

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.570
so many disparate
modes of our lives,

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.140
and to be able to see it all
together in this public health

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.210
way.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.880
A question I have
is that, so you're

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.920
talking about these pandemics,
that one of the older pandemics

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.130
that you just mentioned
earlier, which

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:48.490
is the bubonic
plague-- so there,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:54.630
they did not have a lot of the
post-Industrial Revolution,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.080
interconnected world kind
of aspects we have now.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.060
Obviously, they also
didn't have germ theory

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.410
and modern medicine.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.630
But what was it
that caught there?

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.640
How did that become as
big a pandemic as the ones

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.689
that we have now, post
steamship and airplane and all

00:36:11.689 --> 00:36:12.480
these other things.

00:36:14.644 --> 00:36:16.810
SONIA SHAH: I haven't studied
the history of plague,

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.455
so I'm not sure exactly
what the main factors were.

00:36:19.455 --> 00:36:21.580
But certainly one big
difference is those pandemics

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.620
were so much slower.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.680
And I think what's
so disruptive today

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.040
is the speed with which
these things can pass.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.340
Because when we have
new diseases that

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.160
come into a population
slowly, we can build immunity.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.140
We can adapt to it.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.120
And in fact, sometimes they
become even more entrenched.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.260
And so I'm wondering
if with plague,

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.590
since those pandemics were so
very slow, that the drivers

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.690
would be quite different.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.007
And the way we would have
adapted to living with plague

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:50.340
would have been quite different.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.620
I mean, cholera came
through incredibly fast.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.160
Because there'd be one
ship that would arrive,

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.510
and this bacteria would
get into the water system.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.470
And bang, everyone would be
getting sick all at once.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:06.210
And that's something very unique
about these highly virulent

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.840
pathogens that can
spread so rapidly.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.150
So plague is quite
different in that sense.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.840
AUDIENCE: So 19th century New
York, there's a lot of poverty.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.450
I look around now, and I see a
lot of plump, healthy people.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.690
I wonder if we have examples
of pandemics exploding

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.520
in plump, healthy populations?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.479
SONIA SHAH: Sure, HIV.

00:37:26.479 --> 00:37:27.270
AUDIENCE: Good one.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.582
SONIA SHAH: There you go.

00:37:28.582 --> 00:37:29.290
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:29.998
But you're right.

00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:32.290
So our immune status and
our nutritional status

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.150
play a big role in
how sick we get.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.700
And we saw this with Ebola,
for example, where it really

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.060
seemed that people who had
a different immune status,

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.260
and were maybe more
nutritionally sound or intact

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.830
were surviving it better.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.970
So you're right.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.200
So that's going to
protect us to some degree.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.570
But of course,
pathogens are very wily.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.900
A pathogen is a microbe that
just fills the new niche

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.440
that we provide to it.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.010
So we provide lots
of healthy bodies

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.890
that are easy to get
from one to the other,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.460
it'll take advantage
of that, too.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.750
And HIV is just one example.

00:38:08.642 --> 00:38:11.100
AUDIENCE: First, I want to say
thanks for coming and giving

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.615
this talk.

00:38:11.615 --> 00:38:13.240
I got in a little
late, so I don't know

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.190
if you already touched on this.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.010
But I heard you mention Zika
briefly during your talk.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.560
So I was just
wondering, do you feel

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.230
like was the Olympics--
do you think that could

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.080
be a big factor in its spread?

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.170
Or in the big picture, it
doesn't really matter much?

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.000
SONIA SHAH: So Zika
virus is carried

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.520
by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.360
In August, it'll be winter
in the southern hemisphere.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.950
So this mosquito is very
sensitive to climatic factors.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.050
It needs at least a week
or two of standing water

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.720
in order for the eggs to hatch.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.320
And then for one
mosquito to get infected,

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.280
it takes a blood meal.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.810
And then it takes another
week for the virus

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.700
to kind of mature into its
life cycle in the mosquito

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.470
before the mosquito can bite
another person and pass it on.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:05.184
So if it's dry, if it's
cool, and mosquitoes either

00:39:05.184 --> 00:39:07.350
don't hatch-- there's a lot
of standing water around

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.570
for mosquitoes to
hatch-- or if they

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.430
don't live as long,
because when it's dry,

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:13.230
they desiccate
really easily, that

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.930
is going to dramatically
reduce mosquito populations.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.750
And that's the conditions that
they're expecting in August.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.321
Of course, we're living in
a time of disruptive weather

00:39:21.321 --> 00:39:21.820
patterns.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.780
And all you would
need is a couple weeks

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.870
of standing water around in,
like I said tiny, tiny bits.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.530
Because the eggs of
the aegypti mosquito--

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.395
they desiccate, and then they're
all over the environment.

00:39:33.395 --> 00:39:35.520
And as soon as you just
put a little water on them,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.478
they come back to life.

00:39:36.478 --> 00:39:40.100
Because they can be dormant
for weeks or even months.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.600
That said, we're not going to
stop Zika from coming here,

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.610
whether we go to
the Olympics or not.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.370
We have millions of Americans
going back and forth.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.880
And we Zika's
probably already here

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.350
in a larger proportion
than we actually know.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.680
Because of course, 80%
of people who get it

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.130
don't have any symptoms.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.590
So we have a lot of silent
carriers who can travel.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.430
And they'll never know that
they were infected at all.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.040
And even the people
who do have symptoms,

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.917
it's so mild that you wouldn't
necessarily get diagnosed.

00:40:11.917 --> 00:40:14.250
You would just think, oh, I
have a rash, a little fever.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.830
It passes.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.925
It's self limiting.

00:40:16.925 --> 00:40:17.800
So it's very cryptic.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.030
It can travel really far.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:21.940
So whether we go or not,
Zika's going to come.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.010
And it's probably already here.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.019
Thanks.

00:40:26.019 --> 00:40:27.560
AUDIENCE: Firstly,
thanks for coming.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.910
Excellent presentation.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:34.540
So what can Google do to
help track contagions?

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.920
Because we've already done
some things in this space.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.362
We tried to correlate searches.

00:40:40.362 --> 00:40:42.630
SONIA SHAH: Yes, like
Google Flu Trends.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.320
AUDIENCE: Which had some
mixed results, apparently.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.317
So what would you
recommend based

00:40:47.317 --> 00:40:48.900
on all the different
resources and all

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.899
of the things we can do?

00:40:49.899 --> 00:40:52.970
Because there's, of course,
lots of effort with Google

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.310
putting in volunteer work.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.360
For example, when there
was the tsunami in Japan,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.040
they put a ton of resources,
used all their tools to try

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.174
to come up with solutions.

00:41:01.174 --> 00:41:03.590
What do you think we should
do on more of an ongoing basis

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.370
to track contagions?

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.750
SONIA SHAH: Not being as
familiar with everything

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.420
Google does as you
are, since I've

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.050
been living in this world of
pandemic disease for six years,

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.610
I do know there's
a lot to be done

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.130
with mapping and with predicting
where these new pathogens are

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:20.770
coming out.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.570
There's new studies
showing that you

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.570
can correlate satellite data
of chlorophyll signatures

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.940
in the water, and predict
when cholera might outbreak

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.800
in Bangladesh and elsewhere.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.746
And I wonder if there's
more ways to do that,

00:41:33.746 --> 00:41:35.120
so that we could
actually come up

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.630
with a kind of forecasting
system like the way we forecast

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.440
the weather.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.290
And if we had enough data
on the environment and all

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.302
these drivers that
bring pathogens out,

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:47.260
and how outbreaks occur,
that we could actually

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.360
have a forecasting for
disease-- a disease

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.000
forecast so you could
know in advance.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.130
And that means
everything, because time

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.530
is completely of
the essence when

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:59.260
you think of these things
that can spread exponentially.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.280
So if you know even days
or weeks in advance,

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.570
there's so much more
we can do to save lives

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.540
and to prevent all the
destruction of these outbreaks.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.790
So I think there's lots of
opportunities in that area,

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:10.290
especially.

00:42:12.884 --> 00:42:13.550
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.370
Sounds like antibiotic
has been a big problem.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.776
And seems that over
70% of antibiotics

00:42:19.776 --> 00:42:23.390
are used on livestock.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:28.590
So how do you think we
can tackle this problem?

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.470
SONIA SHAH: Well, we
know that in places

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.560
where they don't use
antibiotics commercially,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.940
and antibiotics are used
as they say rationally--

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.356
which is only when they're
medically necessary-- that they

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:41.140
don't have problems with
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.380
So that is a known thing.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.920
So the path forward is
actually really clear.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.680
We need to use these
drugs rationally.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.460
We need to steward these drugs.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.670
We have not done that.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.140
We've used them as commodities.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.910
And so that's the thing.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.690
The thing we have to
do is really simple.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.030
It's difficult
politically, of course.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.300
So that's going to
be the big hurdle.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.000
And what we've seen
with Obama's recent--

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.740
the White House
recently passed--

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.120
they made some efforts,
some initiatives to try

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.700
to deal with this problem.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.750
And there's two parts to it.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:19.250
One part was let's try to reduce
use and use these rationally.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.660
But first let's get
a committee to think

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.840
about it for a couple
years, and then

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.120
issues and recommendations.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.170
On the other hand, the
other thing we can do

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.310
is, let's throw a lot of
money at drug companies

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.722
to come up with new antibiotics.

00:43:30.722 --> 00:43:33.180
And then we can just keep using
them like as badly as we're

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.010
using them now.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.440
But we'll just keep getting
new ones and getting new ones

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.120
and getting new ones.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.120
Right now, drug
companies don't want

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.140
to create a lot of
antibiotics, because it's not

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.970
a very good market.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:48.740
I mean, these are drugs you only
use for a week or two at most.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.170
And people have been trained
to only want to pay $100 or so.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.420
I mean, we'll pay hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.680
for a cancer drug
that maybe will

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.950
extend life for a week at best.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.560
But a lifesaving
antibiotic, we don't

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.800
want to pay more than $100.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.120
So it's not a very
good market for them.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.259
So that's one of the
parts of the initiative,

00:44:08.259 --> 00:44:10.300
is to throw more money
and incentives at the drug

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.758
companies, so that
they'll actually

00:44:11.758 --> 00:44:13.310
make us some new antibiotics.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.270
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.320
SONIA SHAH: Thank you.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.800
I've been reading in some
journals and articles

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.910
about the possibility of
having male mosquitoes which

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.210
are infertile, and introducing
them to the population

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.670
and trying to cut back
on mosquito populations.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.560
Do you think that's
a viable solution

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.160
to cut back on mosquitoes?

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.379
Or do you think that's
kind of a stretch?

00:44:37.379 --> 00:44:39.170
SONIA SHAH: I mean,
this is the thing-- you

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.690
introduce an infertile male.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:42.380
And then it mates.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.270
And they so they have no babies.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.100
So you've done that once.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.530
Now, that trait is not
going to get passed down.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.580
So there's no like
sustainable chain of events.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.140
You have just keep
doing this-- keep

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.920
introducing more and
more of these insects

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.934
in order to keep controlling
the population of mosquitoes.

00:44:58.934 --> 00:45:01.100
So in that sense, it's not
that different than using

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.480
insecticides.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.790
And what we know, that when
we throw killing chemicals

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.950
or reduce the ability of
living things to reproduce,

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.800
that they evolve in ways so
that they can get around that.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.760
Because there's very strong
selection for creatures

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.210
to do that.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.960
So to me, it's as promising
as a new insecticide.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.180
It's not any more
promising than that.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.930
And then you have all
the ethical problems

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.100
of places where
they already have

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.140
a lot of mosquito-borne disease,
and then people coming up,

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.000
white-coated people
coming up and releasing

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.460
more mosquitoes that
are special-- there's

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.140
going to be some
resistance to that,

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.210
I think, in local communities.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:40.403
That could be an issue.

00:45:42.962 --> 00:45:44.920
The other thing is a lot
of these diseases that

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.170
are caused by
mosquitoes, you don't

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.930
have to kill a lot of
mosquitoes to control them.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.400
There's usually a time
period during which

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.359
the disease or pathogen inside
the mosquito has to develop,

00:45:58.359 --> 00:45:59.400
has to have a life cycle.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.120
So malaria takes
seven to 10 days.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.700
Zika takes around the
same amount of time.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.200
So you don't need
to kill them all.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.870
You just need to
shorten their lives.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.400
So if you just depress
the lifespan of mosquitoes

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.600
so that they don't live long
enough to pass on a pathogen,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.150
then you can disrupt the
disease spread altogether.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.207
And you won't be working
against evolution.

00:46:22.207 --> 00:46:24.040
Because you're going
to allow these mosquito

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.250
populations to survive.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.030
You're going to allow
them to reproduce.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.446
You're just going to kill all
the grandmothers, basically.

00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:34.660
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for the great talk.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:39.130
So from your talk, I feel a
huge part of preventing pandemic

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:46.830
is from nudging the general
public to pick up their life

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.720
habits.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.040
So are you aware of any of the
current, ongoing policy which

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.050
could help us do it
better right now?

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.510
SONIA SHAH: You're talking
about individual behaviors that

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.060
could reduce risk?

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.327
What were you thinking?

00:47:02.327 --> 00:47:03.410
What did you have in mind?

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.210
AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking because it's

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.190
kind of hard to really
control everyone,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:13.850
and help prevent epidemic,
you could sort of

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:17.470
think about it as a collective
effort for everyone.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.420
How do we do it better?

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.140
SONIA SHAH: Yeah, so
changing human behavior

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.960
is probably the hardest
part of all of these things.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.670
I mean, we know that
washing your hands

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:30.800
would prevent the spread of
a lot of infectious diseases.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.290
And people don't do that well.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:35.020
We have a lot of
simple things we

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.090
could do that require
some behavior change that

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.130
could disrupt a lot
of these contagions.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.510
But we don't do them.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.410
And I think a good
example of that

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:46.062
is bed nets for malaria
control, where this

00:47:46.062 --> 00:47:47.270
is a very simple thing to do.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:48.070
You get a bed net.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.460
You sleep under it every night.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.600
And you don't get malaria,
this killer disease.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.720
Well, when they first started
distributing those nets,

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.000
like 20% of the
people used them.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.410
80% just thought, oh, this
is the most fancy thing

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.730
I've ever owned.

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.300
I'm going to keep
it in this chest

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.249
and when my fancy
uncle comes over,

00:48:04.249 --> 00:48:05.540
I'll show him that I have this.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.820
Or I'll use it for a wedding
veil, or fishing nets,

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.800
or whatever.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.030
So that's why so
much of public health

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:16.120
is about coming up
with ways so that we

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.490
don't have to ask people to
change their behavior that

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.480
much.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.250
So how do you engineer our
architecture, or our economy,

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.130
or all these other incentives
that shape human behavior?

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.910
How do you change that
part, so that doing

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.070
the disease-free or
disease-minimizing behavior

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.220
becomes easy?

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.806
It has to be the path
of least resistance.

00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:40.520
We see even in hospitals that
doctors don't wash their hands

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.780
between patients.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.820
I mean, that's kind of an
amazing thing-- so simple.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.080
But simple solutions,
when it comes up

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.080
to complex human behaviors,
turn out to be not so simple.

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:54.850
AUDIENCE: Fantastic
talk, by the way.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.494
You're a very
impressive speaker.

00:48:56.494 --> 00:48:57.410
SONIA SHAH: Thank you.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.610
AUDIENCE: One of the concerns--
back again towards the Zika

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.090
virus and how likely it is
already here in the United

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.090
States-- speaking
politically, what

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.730
are some of the things in your
study or someone in your field

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:11.400
that would raise a red
flag as part of, maybe,

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.600
a legislation that
would make us more

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.200
vulnerable to the
transmitting and the spread

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.110
of this particular virus?

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.610
SONIA SHAH: Well,
this is the thing.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.134
Right now, we're talking about,
let's attack the mosquito.

00:49:24.134 --> 00:49:25.800
We need more money
for mosquito control,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.690
more insecticides to
depress mosquito populations

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:31.600
in the South and other the
parts of the United States

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.550
where we have Aedes mosquitoes
that could carry Zika virus.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:36.866
And the fact is, it's
already too late to do that,

00:49:36.866 --> 00:49:38.490
because these
populations of mosquitoes

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:40.540
are highly entrenched.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.980
Their eggs are everywhere
in the environment.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.470
You could maybe depress their
populations for a while,

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.710
but you're not going to
get rid of them anymore.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.710
And it's an interesting
story of what happened--

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.440
how we got these mosquitoes.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.820
Both of the Aedes mosquitoes
that are in this country

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.660
are invasive species.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.670
Aedes albopictus, which
is the one that about 60%

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:02.210
of the United States
is vulnerable to--

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.650
and I live in Baltimore, and
there's tons of these things

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:04.930
around.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.050
And you guys have
them up here, too,

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.966
I think when it's hot,
like in the summer when

00:50:07.966 --> 00:50:09.930
it's really hot.

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.620
That's an invasive mosquito
that came over in the used tire

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.010
trade in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.480
And people are bringing tires.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.509
In the wild, they
live in tree holes.

00:50:21.509 --> 00:50:23.050
These mosquitoes
live in tree holes--

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:27.280
so a dark environment
with standing water.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.800
And you think about a tire.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.970
I mean, you can never get
the water out of a tire.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.380
So these used tires
fill up with some water.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.840
And the mosquitoes lay
their eggs in there.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.270
And they survive this long
travel across from Asia.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.920
We have distributed these
tires across the nation.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.060
I mean, they're used
for embankments.

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.870
People throw them
over into streams

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.900
to build up the
streambeds for erosion.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.890
They're recapped and then
put back into rotation.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.580
They're also often
kept in giant piles

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.980
next to other giant piles
that have been sitting there

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:02.910
for a long time.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:06.070
So even if they didn't come over
infested with these mosquito

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.740
eggs, they will get infested
while they're sitting there.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.730
And so that's been
going on for decades.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:16.210
And this happened with
the full knowledge

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:18.460
of our medical entomologists
and our medical community

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.226
that this was happening.

00:51:20.226 --> 00:51:22.100
So that was the time
when we should have been

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.224
doing the mosquito control.

00:51:23.224 --> 00:51:26.060
That was the time when we should
have said, let's quarantine,

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.240
inspect, and treat these tires.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.180
Because the US military actually
knew that this was happening.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.670
It started in the 1940s when
all of our surplus war materials

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.400
were coming back from
war zones in Asia.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.200
And they found the tires were
just full of all these mosquito

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:40.820
eggs.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.030
And so they started
treating them

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.940
so it wouldn't lead to an
invasion of these populations.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.950
But once private
companies started

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.090
doing this, and bringing these
tires in container ships-- not

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.880
just a ship, but
these giant containers

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.130
and many, many containers--
we just didn't do it.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.110
So we totally dropped the ball.

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.590
That's when the mosquito
control should have happened.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.880
At this point, I
wonder, actually,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.500
if immunity isn't our
best defense against Zika.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.710
Once you get Zika, it looks
like you don't get it again.

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.000
That's what the science
looks like right now.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.630
Of course, a lot more
needs to be learned.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.579
But given that it is mild--
if you have your bout of Zika,

00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:22.620
you may not even know you
have your bout of Zika.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.489
But after that, you're immune.

00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.530
Then you can have babies.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.110
You can have sex,
do all these things.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:31.330
You're not going to
endanger the child.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:33.360
That's, of course,
the biggest risk.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.930
So if we want to
build up immunity,

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.250
then it's a real question.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.920
Should we depress
mosquito populations?

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.700
Because doesn't that mean
that fewer people are going

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.250
to get exposed to this virus?

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:48.620
I mean, if we all are able to
put off childbearing while we

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.170
develop immunity, or
protect our pregnant women

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.670
and protect our
childbearing people,

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:57.190
and let everybody
else get immunity--

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.970
but it's sort of an
anathematic disease.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.480
It's just a totally
disruptive idea.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.960
I mean, public health
authorities can't possibly say,

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.680
oh, we're just going
to let Zika come.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.528
Everyone can get infected.

00:53:09.528 --> 00:53:12.930
AUDIENCE: Say, hey, go to Puerto
Rico with your pregnant wife.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.360
SONIA SHAH: Well, exactly.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.920
And I think at the root
of it is sort of this idea

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:21.010
that we shouldn't be
vulnerable to contagion.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:26.090
We had probably about 40
years from 1940 to 1980

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:30.470
or so, when we felt like
contagions were under control.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.400
And we could live this
sort of germ-free life.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.820
And if we did get an infection,
we could just take something.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.660
And it'll be really
simple, and get over it.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.050
And I think that has infiltrated
our thinking to such a degree

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.850
that when there is these
threats that maybe aren't

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.730
so bad for most of us--
I mean, most people are

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.770
going to be fine with Zika.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:50.810
It's just really the
microcephaly in children

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.300
that's the main thing.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.084
But we don't think
of it that way.

00:53:54.084 --> 00:53:55.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:56.166
SONIA SHAH: Thank you.

00:53:59.889 --> 00:54:01.930
AUDIENCE: Overall great
speech, very informative.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.990
But the underlying
thing I've seen

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:06.140
that it seems to be the
advancement of the economy

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:11.480
that's really pushed this issue
of pandemics to the main stage,

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.790
through transportation
or economic advancement,

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.400
going into different areas
that weren't developed before.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.180
I mean, is there an
international coalition

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.530
that's trying to create
standards to prevent this, when

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:26.280
we actually have workers
going internationally

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.940
to different areas that never
have been inhabited or visited

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.440
by humans ever,
to prevent spreads

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.990
of different contagions?

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:36.990
SONIA SHAH: So that would
be great if there was.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:38.190
But of course, there isn't.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.510
So this is all unregulated.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.470
People can do what they want.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:44.800
Some people go want to go in
Congo and start a mine there,

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.894
they just get the
appropriate licensing

00:54:46.894 --> 00:54:49.060
from some corrupt governments,
and they can do that.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.830
So that's the world we live in.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:56.020
That said, economic
growth is still

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.620
really important for
controlling contagions, too.

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.880
We saw during the Ebola
outbreak in West Africa

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.450
that a lot of other nations
got really panicked and scared,

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.520
and started to cut down trade
and transportation links.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.570
And this had a terrible
effect on the ability

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:13.250
of those countries to
control the disease.

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:14.710
Aid workers couldn't come in.

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:17.990
Commodities couldn't come in.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.350
These are fragile
economies to begin with,

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.410
and they started
to really suffer.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.190
And that completely
undermines their ability

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.420
to contain these pathogens.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:31.260
So it's not a one-to-one thing
that economic-- we need both.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.160
For getting rid of a
lot of these diseases,

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.920
we need more development and
more prosperity-- diseases

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.950
like malaria, which are very
much shaped by poverty-- just

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.941
living in poor circumstances.

00:55:42.941 --> 00:55:44.190
You don't have window screens.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.780
You have bad drainage around.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.520
Lifting people out of poverty
through economic development

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.817
would actually do a lot to
control a disease like that.

00:55:52.817 --> 00:55:54.400
AUDIENCE: I mean,
my question was more

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.800
pushing towards there's
no measures that's

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.920
done by the CDC.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.020
For instance, if you visited
Europe in set period,

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.425
you can't give blood
because of mad cow.

00:56:04.425 --> 00:56:06.550
They don't have anything
for workers that come back

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.890
internationally to screen
them properly medically,

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:12.100
and make sure that they
don't have any of these--

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.599
SONIA SHAH: I think there
probably is in an ad hoc way.

00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:16.640
But the problem is, we're
talking about pathogens

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.050
that we don't know about.

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.890
So how do you screen for things
you don't know are there?

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.010
We don't really have the
diagnostics to do that.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:26.880
So that piece of the puzzle
would be just technically

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.948
impossible at the moment.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.430
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for a great talk.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.770
So I think it's an
unfortunate truth

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.670
that the private and
public interests that

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.930
led to the cholera outbreak in
New York still exists today.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:46.350
So what do you think we didn't
do in the last 100 years

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:49.483
that we should probably
not repeat in the next 100?

00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:53.450
SONIA SHAH: I mean,
I think there's so

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:57.430
many lessons from the past that
are still applicable today.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.400
So that was sort
of my main point,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.480
is that all the ways in which
these old pandemics were

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:09.602
unfolding are still factors
today-- in fact, even more so.

00:57:09.602 --> 00:57:10.560
Is that what you meant?

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.018
AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking mostly about

00:57:12.018 --> 00:57:13.890
the private-public interest.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.390
SONIA SHAH: So
what's happened now--

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:19.280
and I think it's actually
a little more worrisome--

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.390
is that we've divested
out of public health,

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.830
to a large degree.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.730
The WHO, for
example-- we've been

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:31.660
under-financing that agency
since about the '80s.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.500
Their budget has been getting
smaller and smaller every year

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.330
in terms of their membership
dues from member countries.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.570
So what they've done is they've
turned to the private sector

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:45.960
to do partnerships to
maintain their budget.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.480
So 80% or so of the
WHO budget is now

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.580
coming from these donations.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.710
And that can be companies.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:52.690
It can be NGOs.

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.190
It can be other governments.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.670
It can be any kind
of entity, really.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:59.690
But the problem is,
they earmark that money.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:04.510
So the WHO is not in charge
of the majority of its budget.

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.570
Other entities are
in charge of that.

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.370
And there is no
democratic accountability

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:10.870
to what they decide.

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.570
So we know that 91% of
those extra-budgetary funds,

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.090
those donated funds
that the WHO gets--

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:22.760
are given over to diseases that
affect 8% of the global disease

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.520
burden.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.220
So it is a huge mismatch.

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.760
So the WHO is not
able to really address

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.810
our global health priorities
because of these budgeting

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.520
issues.

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.870
And we've seen it
even with CDC now.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.420
CDC is getting a lot more money
from private interests, too.

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.920
They're doing whole
campaigns that

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.710
are in partnership with drug
companies, and the sugar

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.590
industry, and a whole
bunch of other companies,

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.950
because that's how
they can continue

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.240
doing some work at all.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.700
When the CDC tried to do gun
prevention violence research,

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.750
the NRA just shut them down.

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:57.470
And they slashed a whole
big part of their budget.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:00.040
So it's very difficult for
these public health agencies

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.999
to tackle private interests.

00:59:01.999 --> 00:59:04.540
And what they've been doing more
and more just collaborating.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.780
So what we get is
public health-- we

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.121
have the Venn diagram of things
we can do for public health,

00:59:10.121 --> 00:59:12.370
things we can do that will
protect economic interests,

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.720
and there's that overlap.

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.120
And that's what
our public health

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.660
community is able to do today.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.740
But all those other things that
kind of fall outside of that

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:20.908
is much harder.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.560
Thank you all so much.

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.170
It's been really
lovely being here.

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.720
[APPLAUSE]
