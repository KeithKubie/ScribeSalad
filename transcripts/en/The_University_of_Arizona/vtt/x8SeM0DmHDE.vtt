00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.950
We were asking really
basic questions

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.740
and very limited questions.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.970
How does estrogen control
thermal regulation?

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.510
What is the function of
these neurons in reproduction

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.430
and in thermal regulation?

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.370
And we didn't know in advance
that they would have anything

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.070
to do with thermal regulation.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.790
The research has led to a
non-estrogen replacement

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.370
therapy treatment
of hot flashes.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.430
And to this point,
the other treatments

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.870
have not been effective or
have had too many side effects.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.240
It's just beyond
belief that I would

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.470
be the world's expert
on estrogen modulation

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.610
of thermal regulation.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.270
I mean, how could that happen?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990
I should be competing
with hundreds of people

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.145
really to study this.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.200
To me, that seems absurd.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.670
There should be
an entire research

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.060
field studying regulation
of temperature by estrogen.
