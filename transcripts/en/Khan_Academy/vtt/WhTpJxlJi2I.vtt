00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:02.670
- [Instructor] We're now
going to talk about Hinduism

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.692
which is one of the
largest religions on Earth,

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:07.807
practiced by over a billion people.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.311
And, it's interesting for several reasons.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.497
First, it is considered to be one of the

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:15.326
oldest religions that is still practiced.

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:18.211
Some historians would place the origins

00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.936
of Hinduism at 5,000 years into the past.

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:24.442
It has elements that
may have been practiced

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.441
in the Indus Valley civilization.

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.594
You also have significant
elements that come

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.982
from the Vedic Period.

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:33.405
In fact, the Vedas, for which
the Vedic Period is named

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:38.199
really form the root of Hinduism
as it is practiced today.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.465
It is believed that the Vedas come from

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.255
an Indo-Aryan people that many historians

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.732
believe came from Central
Asia and were related

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:49.573
to many of the people
who colonized Europe.

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:51.522
Now, the other thing that is fascinating

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:53.696
about Hinduism, and I really just referred

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:57.460
to some of it, it is a
combination of many cultures

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.070
that really merged over
thousands of years.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.639
And, they merged around
the Indian subcontinent.

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.637
As you will see there are many traditions,

00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:10.579
many cultures, many
different ways that one can,

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.987
and many different ways that
people do practice Hinduism.

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:16.173
But, there are also core
beliefs that we wanna get

00:01:16.173 --> 00:01:17.822
to the heart of in this video.

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:20.213
And, we'll discuss more in future videos.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.802
Now, what's also interesting
is where the name

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:26.105
Hinduism or Hindu comes
from, a Hindu being someone

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.191
who practices Hinduism.

00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:31.651
The name for what we
now call the Indus River

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.269
in Sanskrit was Sindhu,
and Sindh is still a region

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:38.058
in the Indian subcontinent.

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:41.051
The version that the
Persians said was Hindus

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:44.567
and this got converted to Indus in Latin.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:49.180
So really, Hinduism is
the term for the cultural

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.347
and religious practices of
people beyond the Indus River.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.137
The India really comes
from this same root.

00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:00.996
Indus is where India comes
from, but Indus comes from

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.959
Hindus, which comes from
Sindhu and these are all

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.632
related to the word Hindu.

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:08.791
And, you can see that very
clearly in the Persian version.

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.476
Now, as I mentioned, there's
many different practices

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:14.167
in Hinduism, many different
traditions, many different

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.759
rituals in Hinduism, but
I'm going to try to focus

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.620
in on what could be
considered the spiritual core.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.656
And, a lot of this comes out of the Vedas.

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:27.277
They're a collection of hymns, rituals,

00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.021
but also philosophy.

00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.316
And, the subset of the Vedas
that are very concerned

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:34.727
with the spiritual and the philosophical

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:38.274
are known as the Upanishads,
which means sitting down

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:39.236
or coming near to.

00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:41.225
Some people say coming near to God,

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.867
some people say coming
near to the actual reality,

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.156
or coming near to a
teacher as in sitting down

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:51.156
to get a lesson or to have a dialog.

00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:54.399
Now, the central idea in Hinduism

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.316
is the idea of Brahman.

00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:01.402
And Brahman should not be
confused with the god Brahma.

00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:06.249
Brahma is sometimes, you
could view, as a aspect

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.176
of a Brahman, but Brahman
is viewed as the true

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:11.621
reality of things.

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.950
It is shapeless, genderless, bodiless,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.477
it cannot be described.

00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:18.727
It can only be experienced.

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:23.046
Now, according to Hindu belief we are all

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.152
part of Brahman.

00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:28.505
And, what we perceive as our individuality

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.356
is really, you can consider
to be a quasi-illusion.

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.187
So, this might be one
individual right over here

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:40.354
and then we might have another
individual right over here.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.307
And, this separateness,
the illusion of the reality

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:48.474
that we see around us this
is referred to as Maya.

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:53.282
And, Maya is not just the
illusion or the quasi-illusion

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:55.959
created by our senses it is even notions

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.385
like our ego, our identity.

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.566
And, within that context
that inner self, the thing

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:04.736
that is even within
our, that is even deeper

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:06.360
than our sense of identity.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.777
This is referred to as Atman.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.638
And, as you can see they way
it's been diagrammed here,

00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:15.460
the way we've drawn it
out Atman is essentially

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.508
the same thing as Brahman.

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:20.445
And, oftentimes you
will see it referred to

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:25.112
as Atman-Brahman, they're
really the same thing

00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:27.946
but it's really, it's
an illusion that there

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:31.266
is this separateness of our reality.

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:34.849
Now, according to Hindu
belief in each life

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.821
you have this core part of
yourself which is Atman,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.613
which is part of Brahman.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.905
And, when you die it doesn't disappear,

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:49.016
but it will take on or
it will subjugate itself

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:50.599
to another reality.

00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:58.362
So, after death this
individual or this perceived

00:04:58.362 --> 00:05:01.888
individual might take on another identity

00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:03.094
in another reality.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.408
They would perceive it as another life.

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:08.902
And, this notion of
one life after another,

00:05:08.902 --> 00:05:11.772
one reality after another is sometimes

00:05:11.772 --> 00:05:15.052
referred to as transmigration of the soul,

00:05:15.052 --> 00:05:18.676
sometimes referred to reincarnation,

00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:23.240
or this notion of Samsara,
which is this endless cycle

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.426
of birth and rebirth.

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:28.398
It really comes from this
notion of same flowing,

00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:31.714
this thing, this pattern
that goes on and on and on.

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:35.809
And, according to Hindu
belief what that next life is,

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.645
what that next reality is
is based on your actions

00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:41.450
in this life.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.331
Karma, literally is referring to actions,

00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:47.503
but it's really actions
driving consequences

00:05:47.503 --> 00:05:51.234
not only in this reality
but in the next reality.

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:53.895
Now, there's another notion of Dharma.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:57.656
Dharma is based on what is
the role you should play

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:02.197
given the reality, given
the life that you are in.

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:04.257
So, in a very simplified
way you could say,

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:07.495
"Well, Dharma is the rightful
role, the rightful actions,

00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:10.634
"your duty depending on your role,

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:12.739
"depending on your reality."

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.183
Karma is how that action
translates into consequences

00:06:17.183 --> 00:06:20.328
which is going to drive what
happens in this endless cycle.

00:06:20.328 --> 00:06:23.984
Now, a core idea of
Hinduism is to try to escape

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:28.339
from this cycle, to awaken
to the true reality,

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.893
awaken from this quasi-reality.

00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:33.233
And, this is really one
of the central ideas

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:37.991
of the Upanishads that
eventually if you can awaken,

00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:41.309
so let's say that this is
an awakening, this entity,

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.870
this Atman, this self right over here,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.549
this perceived individual has now awoken

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:50.215
and can see through, pierces
the veil of that Maya.

00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:54.537
Now, they have rejoined
Brahman and they've recognized

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:57.349
that Atman and Brahman are the same.

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.402
And, this freeing from Samsara, from this

00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.386
birth death cycle, this is

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:05.219
referred to as Moksha.

00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:11.943
Now, to make this idea
a little bit clearer

00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:16.668
let's look at some quotes
from the actual Upanishads.

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:20.798
So, this is two versions
from the Isha Upanishad

00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:23.855
and the reason why I like
to show it is because

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:27.042
it shows that if you're
translating from Sanskrit

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.526
into English or really from
any one language into another

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:31.637
there's gonna be some
room for interpretation

00:07:31.637 --> 00:07:32.787
but we can see it here.

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.708
So, this is from the Isha
Upanishad which is considered

00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.073
one of most important ones.

00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:40.192
It's a subset, it's a
section of the Yajurveda,

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:42.547
one of the four early Vedas.

00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:44.880
And, they write, and this
is an English translation,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.531
"The wise man beholds all beings
in the self, or the Atman,

00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:52.382
"and the self in all
beings, for that reason

00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:53.983
"he does not hate anyone.

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:57.668
"To the seer all things
have verily become the self.

00:07:57.668 --> 00:08:00.621
"What delusion, what
sorrow can there be for him

00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.672
"who beholds that oneness?"

00:08:02.672 --> 00:08:05.627
This is another version of the same verses

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.673
from the Isha Upanishad.

00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:10.772
"He who sees all beings
in the self and the self

00:08:10.772 --> 00:08:14.774
"in all beings he never
turns away from it, the self.

00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:17.877
"For, he who percieves
all beings as the self

00:08:17.877 --> 00:08:19.989
"how can there be delusion or grief

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:23.172
"when he sees this oneness everywhere."

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.916
So, I might be getting into
an argument with someone

00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:28.947
but deep down if I
recognize that both myself

00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:33.341
and that individual that we
are part of this same Brahman

00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.499
that he is me and I am it, or I am he,

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:40.638
well then that anger seems
a little bit misguided.

00:08:40.638 --> 00:08:43.047
Now, to get a little bit more context on

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:46.260
this notion of oneness
here's another verse

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.297
from Chandogya Upanishad,
which is also considered

00:08:49.297 --> 00:08:51.505
one of the significant Upanishads.

00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:54.172
And, it's part of the Sama Veda.

00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:59.498
"As the rivers flowing east
and west merge in the sea

00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:02.924
"and become one with it,
forgetting they were separate

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:06.954
"rivers, so do all creatures
lose their separateness

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:11.121
"when they merge at last into
pure Being," into Brahman.

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:15.336
"There's nothing that
does not come from him."

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:17.151
And, the use of the word him is really

00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:20.634
an anthropomorphism of
this notion that has

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:23.384
really no gender or body or form.

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:27.631
"Of everything he is the inmost Self.

00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:30.923
"He is the truth, he is the Self supreme.

00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:34.820
"You are that Shvetaketu, you are that."

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.456
And, this last verse is
referring it's in this

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:40.560
Chandogya Upanishad it's
a conversation between

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.774
the teacher and his son.

00:09:41.774 --> 00:09:44.024
And, the son is Shvetaketu,

00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:47.444
my apologies for pronunciation.

00:09:47.444 --> 00:09:50.788
So, what's he's saying is that
these rivers is an analogy

00:09:50.788 --> 00:09:54.234
for you and I and we might
see ourselves as different

00:09:54.234 --> 00:09:56.032
but at some point we will flow

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:57.929
and become one with the ocean.

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:01.282
And, he's pointing out to his
son, you are not different

00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:03.994
from that, you are self, you are Ahtman.
