00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.890
I was going to do a video about Internet addiction,
but I spent all my time on Facebook instead

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.469
of writing it.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.450
Anthony here for DNews and the INTERNET.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.680
I've never had a more complicated love/hate
relationship with anything.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.220
YouTube holes, Tumblr holes, I go to check
myFacebook messages for a second and come

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.530
out two hours later.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.100
What makes the Internet so addictive?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.720
There's a theory that Internet Addiction comes
from the same bit of our brains that loves

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.040
gambling- pull a slot machine's handle and
most of the time you lose.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.230
But every once in a while, you hit the jackpot.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.859
Our brains look for patterns and register
every tiny difference.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.210
It's a survival instinct.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.980
And when the unexpected thing we experience
is some sort of win, we get positive chemical

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.530
feedback from our brain.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350
The Internet is the same way.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.379
Most of the stuff scrolling by in your feed
is terrible- but that makes

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.100
every amazing corgi video that comes by so
much more exciting..

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.010
Over time, your brain starts to associate
the internet as a whole with that tiny feeling

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.390
of victory- it's like pavlov's dogs.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.180
We begin to drool at the possibility of good
internet.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.690
That's why you can't help but look when you
hear the IM bell or the new mail noise.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.390
And if you share a great video and people
like it or reblog it, you get addicted to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.500
the positive social reinforcement.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.670
We talked about that social aspect a bit in
that video we did about Fear of Missing Out.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.720
Another problem is that the Internet doesn't
really have boundaries- multitasking is awesome,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.290
but when everything is happening at once it
becomes hard to draw a line at where to stop

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.230
using your computer or looking at your phone.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.770
You're in the middle of checking Facebook
and you get an email, and you're finishing

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.490
that email when you get a Twitter reply.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.750
Studies show that willpower can be exhausted-
sort of like a muscle.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.020
And cognitive tasks can be really exhausting.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.490
So here you are, sitting in front of a screen
that's giving you endless things to think

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.360
about and emotionally react to- and your willpower
just wears out and you keep clicking around.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.520
If your internet addiction is particularly
bad, hi, hello, that's me- its recommended

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.020
that you make strict boundaries on your time.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.430
I use this pomodoro timer that makes me work
in 20 minute intervals, then gives me 5 minutes

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.749
off to bum around the internet doing whatever
I want.

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:10.749
I don't...

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.579
follow it.

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.579
But I should.

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.940
Internet Addiction is so prevalent that it's
actually mentioned in the newly released DSM-5-

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.180
the manual for the mental health professionals.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.160
It's not classified as a disorder YET, but
it's 'recommended for further research."

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.299
I say get on it, science, because it feels
crazy real to me.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.400
How bad is your internet addiction?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.280
Be honest, this is a safe place.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.319
