00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.340
Too often, affairs are seen as the outcome of random horniness – or just plain old nastiness.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.420
But that's very rarely the case.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.280
When it comes to affairs, we spend far too long being incensed or secretive,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.440
And far too little time trying to understand.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.700
In truth, affairs stem from a very fiddly aspect of our romantic psychology.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.760
In relationships with a partner, all of us need carefully calibrated mixtures of two different ingredients.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.360
We have A Need for Closeness and A Need for Distance.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.720
We want to impart Closeness to feel we can hug, touch, be cosy, intimate and entirely relaxed and at home with someone.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.220
We want them to know our thoughts and to wander freely in their minds too.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.320
But we also need Distance enough not to feel cloyingly submerged, subsumed or owned by another.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.940
We want to retain a sense of freedom.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.660
We need a private room to which we alone have the key.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.300
Any imbalances, towards Over-Closeness or Over-Distance, may prove catastrophic if left unaddressed.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.380
In a relationship which threatens to lean perilously towards over-closeness,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.360
we can be driven to stray by a powerful urge to prove to ourselves that not everything we do and are is owned by the partner;

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.800
that we remain desirable to the world and a going concern in and of ourselves.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.360
Going to bed with a new person might not be simply about lust:

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.680
it’s about escaping the alarming feeling that one’s whole identity

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.800
appears to be on the verge of dissolving into the couple.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.040
But too much distance can undermine fidelity no less powerfully.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.700
The distance reads like constant rejection:

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.280
when we try to touch the partner, they move away or sigh.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.580
When we bring up something personal, they change the subject.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.040
We may end up having an affair, not because we don’t love the partner any more

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040
but precisely because we do...

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.540
and yet the distance they appear to be imposing on us through their lack of engagement feels unendurable and humiliating.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.320
It’s the final irony that – if caught – we’ll be accused of not caring,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.300
when it was caring too much that might have inspired the whole mistaken escapade.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.060
Tragically, two people almost never enter a relationship with the same needs for Distance and Closeness.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.300
That’s why in every couple, we hear the accusation that one person is too ‘clingy’ and another is ‘cold’.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.140
These are unhelpfully vicious words for what are, at heart, just two different ways of feeling comfortable in love.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.520
It’s therefore an early imperative in any relationship to work out what the relative needs for Distance and Closeness are,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.700
to air the disjuncture, not to get angry about it,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.720
and mutually and with good humour to apologise for one’s distinctive contribution to it.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.500
Only thus can we hope to ensure that the gap won’t lead

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.940
– in an online chat, at a bar or at a conference –

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.620
to a situation where only an affair feels like a plausible solution to the vexing problems of Distance and Closeness.
