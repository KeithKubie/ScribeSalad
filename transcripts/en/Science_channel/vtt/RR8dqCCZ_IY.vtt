FOR THE AGES.

A GIANT-SIZED GLUE TRAP

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.534

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES

OF A HUMAN BEING,

IS A WHOPPING 60 GALLONS

OF OFF-THE-SHELF RODENT GLUE,
A PROPRIETARY FORMULA

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.067
THAT COMBINES LINSEED OIL
AND POLYURETHANE DERIVATIVES

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:52.200
FOR VISCOSITY
AND ADHESIVE POWER.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.501

ENDED UP WITH A GLUE
