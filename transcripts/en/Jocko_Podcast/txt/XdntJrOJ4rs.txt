Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number three with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. So last show we dug into the book about face by Colonel David Hackworth and today we're gonna dive into aid. Another book on that was very influential to me and it's called the last hundred yards. Now this book is very different from about face in many ways. Number one, it's, it was not a New York Times bestseller. It was probably never on any kind of list of any kind. It's a legit tactical guidebook for people in the military. That's what it is. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about the author right now. Guy named Hj Poole who retired from the Marine Corps in 1993 when he was on active duty. He studied small unit tactics for nine years, six months at the basic school in quantum of Quantico, seven months as a platoon commander in Vietnam, three months as a rifle company commander at Camp Pendleton in 1967 five months as a regimental headquarters company commander in Vietnam in 1968 eight months as a rifle company commander in Vietnam, 1968 to 1969 five and a half years as an instructor with advanced infantry training down at Camp Camp Lajune. While he was at that advanced infantry training company, he developed, taught refined courses of instruction on maneuver warfare, land navigation, fire support coordination, call for fire, adjust fire, close air support two oh three grenade launcher movement to contact daylight attack, night attack, infiltration, defense offense, Iv military operations in urban terrain, defensive military operations in urban terrain, NBC defense and leadership.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       So the guy has some good background and this book was very influential to me when I was coming up. And again, as I just like with about face as I was thinking about what I was going to say about it and I wanted to talk about when I got it and I couldn't remember when I got about face. It just Kinda came into my life at some point and it's the same thing with the last hundred yards and I don't really know 100% when I got it or who told me to get it. It's one of those things that just became so ingrained with me that now I, I didn't want to even remember when it happened. So one of the, one of the key kind of components or, or the basis of the book that I kind of have to introduce you to is it, it talks about something called maneuver warfare and maneuver warfare is a, is a obviously a type of warfare.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       It's a type of technique and it's, it's counter to something that's called attrition warfare. Now you could probably guess what attrition warfare is. Attrition warfare is we're going to go against the enemy, we're going to go stand toe to toe and we're going to punch each other in the face until one of us goes down. Now when you add bombs and bullets into that scenario, it means we're going to stand across from each other, from the enemy, and we're going to shoot each other and bomb each other until one of us breaks. And that's very American way of fighting is to start this attrition warfare because why? We've got massive supplies, we've got awesome industry, and we can get away with that. Maneuver warfare is, is very different, and to go into the book a little bit in talking about maneuver warfare, this is what maneuver warfare is. In maneuver warfare, the emphasis is on maneuver. Firepower is considered important only to the extent that it facilitates maneuver. The overall offensive mission is to win decisively by getting the enemy to surrender.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       So it's very different you in in that definition, they're not even looking to kill the person, the enemy, they're looking to make them surrender because it's in some ways easier. If the enemy surrenders, you don't have to kill them all. Now to go on the focus is outward on the enemy. Again, this is, this is maneuver warfare. The focus is outward on the enemy and a few mistakes like outdistancing ones logistical support or shooting in a friendly unit are acceptable and unavoidable. So that's kind of crazy, right? That you actually, you take these risks in maneuver warfare where you might engage friendly forces. You might get so separated that you end up in a bad situation, but it's because you're pushing the pace. Control is decentralized and every sub unit or individual is encouraged to display the initiative needed to react successfully to the local threat.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       And this is the biggest distinguisher between attrition warfare and the way it's run and maneuver warfare. Decentralized Command. And that is a chapter in the book extreme ownership that Leif and I wrote. It's, that's one of the laws of combat that we talk about is decentralized command is that everybody that's out on the battlefield, every individual unit leader can make decisions on their own and they can make something happen. They can react and they can execute without having to run it up the chain of command. That's maneuver warfare very, very different. And, and you know these days where we see the big difference, you know, you see a big bureaucratic company, you know now that we're working with businesses, we see a big bureaucratic company, they become very centralized in their control and they fight attrition warfare against other companies because they're bigger and they have more resources.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       Whereas you see the young startups, what are they doing? They're doing maneuver warfare there. They've got decentralized command, they've got people taking chances, they're taking risks and they've got different leaders out there on the battlefield that are trying to make things happen. The emphasis is on training personnel and this is back to the book. The emphasis is on training personnel, well enough ahead of time that they can follow their commander's intent in combat after only receiving broad guidance. Of course, sub unit must still keep their commanders informed of any actions that might affect adjacent units. So you end up with a situation where the commander is not telling you exactly what to do. They giving you broad guidance, hey, this is the, this is the end state of the mission that I want to have accomplished. And they're not telling you exactly how to accomplish it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       They're just telling you what they want done. So that's, uh, that's, that's a difference between the two. Now there's a piece that's very different as well, or maybe not different, but another key element of maneuver warfare and decentralized command versus attrition warfare and centralized command. So if you don't, if, if you're listening and you haven't been in the military before, the military is separated into two groups of people, officers ended listed people. The officers are sort of the senior leaders who are, you know, strategic planners and they're, they're, they're the broader, higher up, higher ranking leaders. And then the enlisted are the tacticians, the folks that are shooting the machine guns, throwing their grenades, making things happen. And they do have, you know, the, the enlisted service men also have their noncommissioned officers, which are the senior ranking enlisted guys, which are usually the expert tacticians but it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       So this is going back to the book now in in the average platoon, the NCO pose provide most of the collective experience. So again, you see this sometimes in the movies where they get the young officer and they're green and they don't really know what's going on. And then you get the salty old, you know, bad ass that's played by a salty old, you know, uh, uh, Clint Eastwood and easily that older guy with all the experience. And that's what that saying this, the ncls provide most of the collective experience. For this reason, they should participate in most of the tactical decisions. That absolutely makes sense. This should have no way challenged the authority of the officer's. Okay, that's that sensible. After all commissioned and noncommissioned officers share the same responsibilities in combat. If the lieutenant, which is the officer is wounded, the platoon sergeant takes over when they both, this is key. When they both work together, better decisions, result, obviously you've got two mines and instead of one, this brain trust can be further enhanced by including squad leaders. So they're, they're saying, let's bring in more minds, more of these junior enlisted guys. Let's find out what they think.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       The enduring satisfaction that comes from making the situation, the correct decision, and then having that decision fully supported during execution far outweighs the temporary insecurity that may come from soliciting the advice of support minutes. I love that quote. I love that because I'm going to say it again. So it's saying that the decision and the execution doing that well far outweighs the temporary insecurity that may come from soliciting the advice of subordinates. So, and I used to see this with these young junior officers, if they're insecure with their leadership, they don't want to take advice and they definitely don't want to ask for advice because they feel like that makes them look weak or they don't know what they're talking about. They don't know what they're talking about. Oh, they're going to lose respect. That's all their ego talking and is their insecurity talking. Whereas you get a young officer that's smart and that's confident.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       He has no problem looking at the gunnery sergeant or looking at the platoon chief and saying, hey chief, how do you think we should do this? Hey chief, I've never even seen this type of operation before. Can you give me some help or can let, can you take lead on this? And that is the way a real leader operates. You don't always see that, unfortunately. Same thing with the mistakes too, right? When you say, Oh man, I made that mistake. Oh, exactly. It's hard to do that a lot of the time because they think, oh, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. Obviously made a mistake even admitted it kind of thing. Yeah, and w w what the reality is, people don't actually think that. They don't think, oh, he just admitted his mistake. He really doesn't know what he's doing. No, they go, okay, well at least he's aware of his mistake. Unless everything they do as a mistake, then that's different. But on the other hand, it is courting disaster to rely on one's personal impressions to provide the solution to complex scenario and then not consider whether one subordinates have the skills to execute that solution. So don't sit there stuck in your own brain, afraid to ask anybody else or you're going to lose.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       Now as we push through this, we can get pretty deep, um, to you is going back to the book again, t to a US infantry men actively engaged in a losing effort. This shortage of rest reference material can be quite unsettling. And what this, what this is talking about previously to this sentence is saying that although there's all kinds of books and manuals in the military, this detailed reference material of exactly how to do the front line, what is that point man do? What does that machine gun or do? How do they actually do it? That information can get lost cause it's more past word of mouth than anything else.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       And it goes into a talking about, believe it or not, Hackworth, with a combat commission from Korea, Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth was no stranger to war. When he called, when he was called to serve in Vietnam after two tours, he pointed out that the u s knowledge on Small Unit infantry tactics had not been significantly enhanced by the longest war in us history, meaning Vietnam. And here's what, here's what Hackworth said, almost 15 years since the tragic inevitable fall of Saigon. And this is so he's saying this 15 years after the end, the Vietnam war, almost 15 years since the end, since the tragic inevitable fall of Saigon, there's been no major, honest, postmortem of the war. There have been critiqued dealing with the big picture, but none has addressed the lessons learned the hard way at the fighting level where people died and the war was in fact lost. So all those lessons learned in all those, no one ever made an honest critique and dug down onto the battlefield to see what these guys could do. And I know I talked about this last time as well, is that when I first got in the seal teams, there was guys from Vietnam and when those guys spoke, you absolutely listened because you were hearing knowledge, knowledge and

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       that

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       if I didn't experience that, if I didn't meet those guys, I will no one, you know, I wouldn't hurt it. It wasn't written down anywhere. And so you've got to always remember when you do learn stuff, you got to write it down. And you know, Lafe and I talk about that, the fact that when we got back from Ramadi, you know, I started teaching it trade at what's called training detachment. And he started teaching the, the seals that were coming out of, uh, the new guys that were coming out of the seal training. And that's where we were, had the opportunity to really capture a lot of this information that we learned in Ramadi and we were able to pass it on. And ultimately those lessons learned or what became the book.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       So that being said, you start talking about doctrine. And I can tell you that doctrine is not everything. In fact, and you'll hear me talk about people, People's biggest strengths are often their biggest weaknesses. So if you have someone that's super aggressive and they're, they're aggressive in the business world or making things happen, and that's a real advantage for them, but they can get over aggressive and then they end up doing stupid things and they fail. Right? That's one example of how your biggest strength can be your biggest weaknesses in the seal teams, we really didn't have, we had very limited doctrine and it was a real big weakness for us because if you had never run a certain type of operation before, you couldn't refer back to something and say, okay, here's the method or the, the written documentation of how you're supposed to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       So that's, that's pretty weak. That's pretty horrible. That's a big weakness. But at the same time, it was a strength because as the battlefield changes, we started getting tasked with missions that we had never done before that no one had ever done before. We were very adaptable because we were used to trying to figure things out so it's a strength and weakness. That being said, and although we did capture much of our lessons learned, this is going back to the book here, basic field manual talking about all these manuals that capture the doctrine. Knowledge is fine but it is useless without common sense. Common sense is of greater value than all the words in the book and this is another thing they will stereotypically put in Hollywood movies about cops are about soldiers. You know you've got some guy that's buy the book, buy the book, buy the book in and you can see this is calling it out.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       This is, this is colonel armor, our sims or guy that was in the Marine Corps on Guadalcanal and he said that common sense was more important than anything in the in the field manuals, which is something I completely agree with and to carry that point a little bit further back to the book and here's a quote from major general fuller. The central ideas of an army is known as its doctrine, which to be sound must be based on principles of war and which to be effective must be elastic enough to admit of mutation in accordance with change in circumstance. So again, these all these people that really understand war, they know that this doctrine is something that needs to be written. It needs to exist, but it needs to be adapted to and common sense is is the superior rank over doctrine. In another thing, and this is, this is a

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       a

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       a comment on training because it becomes very difficult when you think about training people for situations that are unknown. It's easy to train something people for something that they know is going to happen, but it's a lot more difficult to train people for something that is unknown. How do you do that? As we get into the discussion of training a little bit, the small unit into the book here, the small unit that to faithfully follows the method in the book, we'll eventually attempted under the wrong conditions. Furthermore, the unit may have a diff, have difficulty, surprising any enemy who has read their book. That makes sense, right? The enemy's going to know your play. And by the way, all these military manuals can all be found online. They're online, they're on the Internet. So the enemy definitely reads what we have. On the other hand, the unit that doesn't prepare for any particular scenario, we'll take too long to decide what to do automatically sacrificing surprise and momentum and then not have the teamwork to execute what it does decide to do. So there's two ends of the spectrum. You know, we talk about the dichotomy of leadership and how you're constantly going against opposing forces. Well, here's, you know, you can train so hard and so specifically to what to doctrine that it eliminates your flexibility. The other end of the spectrum is to not train at all and then you can't execute anything.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       And Rommel, Rommel said, the ordinary soldier has a surprisingly good nose for what is true and what is false and an eye that's not just soldiers. You know what? I talked about that before, that people know, even if they don't know what the truth is, they know you're not telling them that he might not know what the actual truth is. And, and then going back to training in actuality at back to training and back to the book and actuality motes most small scale combat is won or lost months before the battle during training. And that's something that people say all the time about mixed martial arts as well. You know, it's during that training as you prepare, that's what wins the battle. It's a fight camp, right? It's the same thing with, uh, with military maneuvers.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       So as we continue on here, as expected, battlefield conditions change. So too must learning overreliance on books. Solutions in itself constitute a short fall in training because it minimizes the importance of the unique aspects of each situation. Blind faith in standard operating procedures doesn't even constitute being well trained. This is something that when I was training, we caused complete mayhem on the guys that were going through training and anybody that went through training when I was running it right now as a smile on their face because they know that they were put into scenarios that were completely confusing, distracting, disturbing, mayhem, chaos. It was just crazy. And the reason we did that is because we wanted to test their minds, not their standard operating procedures, not uh, their shooting capabilities. We wanted to test the minds of the leaders. Could the leaders be in that chaos, stepped back from that chaos, either physically or mentally or both get an assessment of everything that was happening and then say, okay, this is what we need to do to get out of the situation or improve the situation or when the situation, what the other thing that it requires, not only is that the leaders step back and have the ability to set back, but the NCO is again, these noncommissioned officers must love initiative and must hold what ground they have to the utmost.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       It often happens that a sergeant or even a corporal corporal made aside a battle by boldness with which he sees as a bit of ground and holds it. So we tried to inspire the younger guys, the new guys, a guy that had no experience in the seal teams, but we wanted that guy to go, you know what, I'm going to get in this room or I'm going to take this building, I'm going to get to this rooftop, I'm going to get this good position. And not to do it as a rogue element, but within the confines of what the strategy was and what the plan was. And that's where you end up with an, with a unit that works together very well. And uh, you know, one of the things that I remember of where people get locked into these, you can see it sometimes in MMA fights.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       You'll see a fighter that's got a good, you know, ground game or he's, and all he's trying to do is take the person down and take the person down using all their energy. Just keeps trying to clench, keep keeps shooting shots and they're getting their shots stuff, but they can't adapt. They don't have the skills or they don't have the mindset to adapt. I remember one scenario where we had what's called a bunkered machine gun position. This isn't a training, a training event. So there's a long hallway. This is in an urban environment. There's a big giant building. This is all fake by the way, but there's a big giant building and in the end of the hallway we've got a bad guy who's in a bunkered position. So he's in behind tables and drawers and concrete and he's got a fully automatic paintball gun and the seals are trying to go down the hallway to get them and they're shooting at him.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       But this guy isn't a bunkered position. They can't hit him. He's hidden. And so every time they come out in the hallway to try and move towards him, he just mowed them down. And first is one guy, then it's another guy, then three guys, then it's six guys that it's eight guys are laying in the hallway, you know, cause every time they get shot with paint ball, if they get shot a few times we're putting them down like, okay, you're dead. Just lay down, stay there, you're dead. Stay there, you're dead. Okay you're you, you're dead to, they can't move. They just got to lay there. So I go to the guy that's running it and it was a platoon chief and I walked over and I said, hey chief, you know, how's this going to work out? And he said, we just got to, I've got to get these guys moving down this hallway.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       And I said, do you think there might be another way? And he kind of looked at me and he realized that, yeah, there's another way. He sent a couple guys back out of the building. They walked the down the outside of the building to the window where the guy was bunkered in through a couple of grenades in there, jumped in, killed the guy. But the mindset wasn't there to have the flexibility to do that. And that's what we are training. Cause I never wanted to see guys get locked in to a situation. That's why training all training needs to expand your brain. They need to expand your mind needs to it shouldn't constraint, shouldn't constrain your ideas. Yeah. It almost seems like that would be a different type of training. Even almost like you could like phone with fourth of the double leg or something.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       They're forcing, they're not getting it. They're not getting it. He should have been trained in other take downs. If in fact taking the guy down was the strategy. You should be trained in other stuff. They'll be some judo stuff. No, no doubt about it. And this is one, one thing that's interesting and I th I think that's the e the evolution is you're hearing, you know about Conor McGregor right now, and I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but you know you see him doing like this movement type drills, which is really good because what does that doing that's training you for these weird situations? You know? And that's another issue. Like with training Jujitsu with Jeff Glover. He puts himself in these weird positions and does these crazy things that when it happens to him, he just has better reaction because he's used to being in these strange positions. And when we work with corporations, um, and work with companies, we'll, we'll do role playing with these CEOs are mid level managers and we'll, we'll play, you know, Lafe and I will play the unruly old, you know, uh, job site foreman that knows more than you do and how are you going to deal with them? And we put them in these hostile situations and do things and say things and that, that throw them for a loop that make them uncomfortable, that, that they don't know the solution to and they

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       have to think on their feet. And that's, that's one of the, you know, one of the pieces of training that I always like to go back to you is how can we, how can we do things that surprise people in training so that, so that we exercise their brain, not now what they know. We don't, we got to get what you know, you gotta train, which you know, you got to practice what, you know, how do we train what you don't know, which you don't expect. Yeah. It's like a deeper, it's like almost like a level deeper in the training. Like it's like, it's real beneficial I think. I think Henry guys talk about this training. Jujitsu, a good way to train for self defense is trained with a real athletic guy who's a white belt so he won't do predictable things that you've been training every day.

Speaker 4:          00:27:29       He'll do unpredictable things where you won't be super easy. Um, and at the same time it won't be something that you have full knowledge of and full experience of it. If you get the 280 pound powerhouse that shows up to the gym that's never trained before, the first time you train with them, it's going to be harder to catch him then it will three months later. Now, maybe, maybe three months, it'll be about the same. But like a month into it where he kind of knows what he's supposed to try and do. Right. But you know exactly what he's going to do, then it's easy to catch him. It's easier. So you're, you're right, it definitely is a, is a transitional time and it is good to train with people that you have no idea what they're going to do. Yeah. And it's not even to say that, that, and it does, it gives you experience with these unorthodox things for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:28:18       But that's not what you're talking about as far as what's being trained, what's being trained is not to be so dogmatic in your actions and your, you know, your, your plan is to this, this sounds really cliche. It's to expect the unexpected. Right. But it trains you to think that way. Well, it's true. And I don't know if this is cliche or not. I'm pretty sure it is, but I say this and people kind of freak out when I say it because I'm like, uh, a structured, disciplined person. But I say it all the time. Free your mind. You know, you got to free your mind. That's why when I talk about this stuff, I hate when I find myself in a situation where my mind is not free to see what's going on and I can't detach from what's known. Yeah. And, and go and enter the unknown and, and, and deal with the unknown. Yeah. You know, another thing that can affect this is our ego and how our ego can prevent us from learning or listening to other people or other schools or other martial arts or other gyms or other perspectives. So it, in this book, the last hundred yards, he talks about that, uh, even giving

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       a sister organization with the same manuals, credit for knowing anything can be difficult. Pride in one's unit can help to build cohesion, but it can also stand in the way of learning. Learning must always take priority over pride. How readily, how readily a military organization can assimilate new information, establishes how easily it's component elements can acquire new knowledge. The Germans of World War One are generally credited with developing the application parameters that define modern infantry tactics. Here's how they did it. The German army of 1914 was the most decentralized in Europe, free from all book, the most general supervision and relieved by a promotion system that based based strictly on seniority of the need to constantly please superiors. The German battalion or company commander was free to train his troops according to his own lights. So they way they advanced people is just how it wasn't based on how well you did on this particular thing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       So they weren't kissing ass the whole time. It was just oh you and rank you, now you get promoted. So they were free to kind of operate and do the best they could and that had a big, big impact for, for example, by 1918 the Germans had line infantry squads that could penetrate ally defense lines almost at will as opposed to, you know, the, the allies who would always try and coordinate these big giant massive attacks at the same time. And you have to get everyone aligned and you have to execute perfectly with thousands of people. That's obviously very challenging. Rather than just saying, okay, our goal is to break through the lines, go and figure it out. Think of all the different creative ways that go to figure that out. And it's, it's crazy and that's why it was so successful. Now the Germans lost, they obviously made some mistakes on those strategic level and as a matter of national policy, they made some pretty big mistakes too.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       But that's kind of a, that's kind of a whole nother, a whole nother story. Most military leaders agree that doing nothing to prepare an infantry squad for combat also does little to enhance its chances for success. Most can also agree that providing guidance that is too restrictive may cause the squad to disregard unforeseen circumstances. The answer to that must lie somewhere in between. That's what we've been talking about. And you see this with fighters as well, and you see fighters that prepare for a specific attack from somebody, but then that other, somebody decides to mix it up and comes out and does something that's, it's happen to me when I was cornering fighters before where I've gone out and said, oh, I didn't expect that. Here we go. This guy just took, you know, Jon bones just took down a DC, you know, like, where'd that come? Why did he do

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       that? So we see that kind of, that, that mentality that throws things off and it puts people in a, in a predicament. Yeah. And you mentioned John Jones. He, um, he actually even admitted that some of the stuff that he does, he just, he's never trained for, he just did it. Yeah. But it's, man, it's that different, that separate element of your mind or that are training, I don't know if you had training doing that are just a creative person or whatever. Um, just that separate element. It's a whole different part of this strategy, you know? Yeah. On other asset. Yeah. And also you can see that he's encouraged by Greg Jackson. He's encouraged and he does things, you know, he, he has an open mind, right? It's got a free mind and that goes a long way for your mind. That is kind of a cliche by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       There's a, like a song isn't free of mine in the rest of the flight hollow or something else will fall out. In other words, I'm not familiar with that. Let's not say. Uh, so finally to talk about decentralized command and, and what I would see happen with decentralized command as I tell some junior leader, okay, you know, you need to decentralize command, you'll need to let your guys go out and do what they need to do. And they go out on the battlefield and this is, you know, getting in training where there no one's going to die. They'd go out and all the little leaders would get their own ID and they'd go and try and make all the stuff that happened and the commander would lose control and everyone would get crushed in, shot up with paint ball and the whole nine yards. And they come back and still utilize a deduce which was community does work and I would say no, you did decentralized command but you missed the key part of decentralized command, which is guidance, parameters, understanding of the mission, Commander's intent, standard operating procedures, limits of advance, all these nice little restrictions that you put on the guys.

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       Now they're, they're wide restrictions. I shouldn't have said little. They're wide restrictions. They give them a lot of mobility but they understand what the objective is, what the end state is, what their parameters are, how far they can maneuver, like they can know they can, hey, if you can't go past this building, you can't go past this road. You can't go wherever you draw those lines so that they can operate freely within those lines and that's how they're made. That's how you maintain control with decentralized command. Would you call them like guidelines or, cause when you say operate within those lines, is it pretty encouraged to stay within those lines with their creativity or does the creativity, is that allowed to kind of overflow? Like if you say, you know how far you can engage there, are you saying that there are no exceptions, no subjective, you know, if I call you up and say Echo, I'm a building 14 right now we see enemy moving to building 27 I want to push down this road. Are we good to do that? And you say, all right, let me check the map.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Let me check where I'm other forces are at. Yep. Where you're good to go. You can move. So there are times where I have to check back with you to make sure we're good to go and make sure that you understand. But I'm, I'm going beyond what parameters were set and that's why I have to communicate to you. But I went all the way up to that point. I maneuvered on the battlefield for, you know, three, four, five, six hours. Maybe it was a day, maybe it was two days without having to say Echo, I need some guidance here. Echo, I'm going to push beyond what you told me. Yeah. So these guidelines are kind of, you go in with the knowledge that there are exceptions as long as they're responsible. Yes. As long as what you do that you'd be responsible about making those exceptions and communicating.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       I know that's when bad things happen. When bad things happened is when you go outside the, the limitations that you're supposed to be in and you don't tell anybody, you know, that's a very, very problematic now, um, when we, when we talk about why it's so why you have to maintain that flexibility. The reason is because combat is infinitely complex and it's one of those dichotomies because it's infinitely simple, but it's infinitely complex. And believe me, the complexity of it got me, got the best of me on many occasions where I was, where I lost it. I did not, could not fall the complexity situation. I had two bad things happen. I had to regroup. I had to try and figure them out, had to assemble these thoughts in my head as all this thing. All of these things are happening. Go into the book as it relates to combat. The term situation encompasses many variables. Mission, enemy, terrain, weather troops and fire support, time, space, logistics. Each category has many facets. Disregarding a seemingly inconsequential sort put circumstance can invalidate an otherwise logical solution. One must continually study the possibilities, continually study the possibilities.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       And I've seen that where one little problem can escalate into all kinds of problems. And that's something that whether it's a unit that we dealt, we did just what we just talked about, which is, you know, you get a unit that goes where they weren't supposed to be and they didn't tell anybody. That can become very problematic as you can imagine, because all of a sudden, you know, you've got people shooting from a building where there's not supposed to be any friendlies. Well guess what? You're going to shoot back at him, right? So that's a horrible situation. Things with communication where you know some radio frequencies go down or for whatever reason you lose communications with people and all of a sudden you're in a black hole and you don't know what's happening. That's another situation where one little tiny piece can really throw massive complexities into the situation. Going back to Rommel and back to training.

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       The best form of welfare for the troops is first class training. This saves unnecessary casualties. And I think I did talk about this before, but taking care of your people, you know and how taking care of your people, it can mean a, that means we're were to cut them loose early because that means you're taking care of them. But the reality is the way you take care of them is to train them art that'd be disciplined. So I'll, I'll, we'll never lose sight of that one. This is a skipping around a little bit, but I wanted to throw this in there because because of the fight we had in Ramadi, and it's just talking about how the fighting and the urban environment is so challenging and it says in the book built up areas, meaning cities should be bypassed wherever possible. In urban terrain, the attacker may need as much as a 10 to one manpower advantage and Sun Zoo who wrote the art of war, the worst policy is to attack cities.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       And if troops or attacking cities, their strength will be exhausted. That's just a for time immortal. Trying to fight in cities is absolutely the most challenging of all environments. Why? Cause they're, they're dug in and their, you know, their little strategy kind of is established. They're dug in. They, they are 360 degrees around you. Oh yeah. They are above you. They are to the left, to the right in front of you. They're behind you and they're beneath you. They're in the sewage systems, they're in the basements. So you're in this 360 degree fire zone. And on top of that, just about every building is a hardened fighting position. Yeah. So, so all you have to do is enter a building and you've got a pill box, you've got a, you've got a bunker. And so therefore it's very, very challenging. And I just talked about having a enemy machine gunner and a bunkered fighting position. That's a nightmare. It's a little less of a nightmare when you have tanks to come in and blast them. Sure. So God blessed the tankers. I love those guys. We uh, worked side by side with those guys. One, one a d guys crushed it for us and we appreciated it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       Respect for one and one's enemy is crucial to success on the battlefield. He is not a coward, he is not stupid and he probably has comparable weaponry. That's from the book how to focus on the enemy and make sure that you are, you are respecting the enemy. Flexibility to a changing situation. Again in the book, having the ability to detect and then react to a changing situation can have great value in war. What manuals contain is mostly technique, not doctrine. This technique is merely a framework around which to build common sense solutions and what that translates to is discipline equals freedom. You have these standard operating procedures, you work them, you refine them, you practice them, you get good at them but you don't get stuck with them. You free your mind by having discipline and it means that you can adapt these strict standard operating procedures. You can adapt them instantaneously and do something else with them because you're a maestro and you can make that happen.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Now we get into this, and this is going a little bit deep, but we start talking about something called mission type orders. And that is different from let's say what would be called a directive, where I say, Echo, you're going to move down this street. You're going to take this building number 27 you're going to set security in there and you're going to hold that position. That's different because now I've told you exactly what to do. I've said, okay, echo, you're gonna move down this street. So I'm telling you which way you're going to go. I'm going to tell you exactly which building you're gonna take down. And I'm telling you just to set security in there. Now what I really want to say is that that means you have to do what I just told you because you have no choice. I mean, I didn't give you any other options. I told you exactly what to do. Now what if I were to say Echo, we think the enemies over in this area, we want to be able to hold security on them from an elevated position.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       Find a building down there and make that happen. So now you've got all kinds of freedom. You might pick 27 cause maybe it was the best building, but maybe 36 wasn't, maybe 32 was maybe 27 was hardened. Maybe it wasn't tall enough. But you have this organic flexibility in your mind because you've been given a goal of why you're doing the mission, not just what to do. So it's very important when you're dealing with people, you know in any walk of life that you tell them not just what they're trying to do, what to do, but what they're trying to accomplish, what the mission is, why they are doing it. And that is incredibly important. Just like aggressiveness is important. And going back to the book from General Howland, Mad Smith, since I joined the marines, I have advocated aggressiveness in the field and constant offensive action hit quickly, hit hard and keep right on hitting. Give the enemy no rest, no opportunity to consolidate as forces and hit back at you. This is the shortest road to victory.

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       Do I need to even expand on that? I mean, I think how [inaudible] Mad Smith just hit the nail on the head. Next point, controlling subordinates only to the extent that surprised momentum are not sacrificed. Personnel should become so familiar with their leader's intent that they can be trusted to act on their own initiative. They should never be required to ask permission to respond to crisis situation. Seconds count and close combat. Subordinates must be trusted to act appropriately and Rick only required to inform the leaders of decisions that might affect others. That's it. That's decentralized command. Now you're going to think at first that this is a little bit of a stretch, but it's not so controlling subordinates only to the extent that surprise and momentum are not sacrificed. I'm going to relate that to Jujitsu. Believe it or not, in Jujitsu and in any sport, you have to train your standard operating procedures so that your body can execute them without directives, right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       If you have an instinct to defend the arm lock, you will escape the arm lock. If you do not have that instinct because you haven't trained it enough, you will get caught in the arm lock. If you have to think about the move, it is too late. And that's exactly what decentralized command is. If echoes out on the battlefield and he gets flanked and he has to ask me what to do, he's going to get killed. If Echo's on the mat with me and I slap a Kim, you're on him and he has to think about the defense. It's too late. He's already tapping. Whereas if I go for the Camaro and his instinct moves him out of that position, then you survive.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       The, uh, one more thing that I, when I think about that type of training is something we used to do was called blender drills. When you take your seal squad or your seal platoon and you start making calls on them, plank left and you know, push right strong, right center pool. You just do the most random calls. So that meeting calls, uh, like you're making tactical calls, you got, you got 16 guys, they're called immediate action drills. And for instance, if you are patrolling through the desert and you can start getting shot at from the front, then you do a what's called a contact drill. You're going to react to that contact. The contact is the enemy. You're going to do a maneuver as a group and they're all kind of choreographed maneuvers where squad one goes over here, a squad to goes over here.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       We lay down a base of fire. You start to move, cover and move out, but what we would do is we would mix up those calls in the middle of one maneuver, we'd call for another for it. In the middle of that one, we'd call for another one in the middle of that one we'd call for another one and what it did was it trained the mind. It trained the minds of the leaders and if the guys to expect the unexpected, as you said earlier in that cliched way, but something that's completely necessary, trained them to be reactive and open minded to things that were going to happen. Now when we talk about learning, and this is a it, the title of this chapter in, in the book, the last hundred yards, it's called old habits may get in the way. Then I think it's pretty obvious what that means.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       Adults learn. Here it is. Adults learn within the context of what they already know. Ideas that are too far removed from their personal frames of reference are hard for them to accept. How often do we see that? We see it in life. We see it in the business world. We see it in combat. We see it in training. Ideas that are too far removed from people's personal frame of reference are hard for them to accept. Unfortunately, when one gets dropped into a hot landing zone on his first day in combat, it's often too late for him to learn anymore. For this reason, infantry must continually reassess and expand their frames of reference. Boom. Hello life. For this reason, infantry men and everybody else in the world must continually reassess and expand their frames of reference. Everybody when one survival's at stake the other way can hold as much appeal as the established way.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       So clearly we see people in the business world stuck in that Rut all the time. We see people in their personal lives, they get stuck in a Rut all the time. So everybody has got to continually reassess and expand, expand their frame of reference. Going back to the boat, what adults know comes primarily from two sources, what they have been told and what they have experienced personally. Okay. That's pretty clear, right? I think that's pretty obvious, but this is when it gets pretty cool. They sometimes have difficulty keeping the 2 cents of ideas separated, becoming convinced that what they have been told is true even though they have never personally experienced it. And that is something that you see in the military, you see in the military where guys kind of, they hear something, they make it into something that they think that they've experienced. I know it sounds crazy, but they do it and it's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       It's dangerous. And I never, when I realized that that happened, when I realized that that was going on, I was very suspect of everything that got said. Uh, you know, I was very suspect and said, well let's, let's make sure that we confirm these ideas before we just run out and do them. Cause that kind of like those, those martial arts demonstrations. Right? Exactly, exactly. And you can imagine that before the UFC and before you actually putting to humans in a cage to brawl, it was all theoretical. Right? And if someone said, you know what, if you strike the person here in the neck, they will fall down. And, and this is the, people legitimately believed that, hey, if you hit the person in the neck, there's a brachial nerve and it'll go down to just go and stuff a are wrong and they will immediately fall down. And people believe that. But they never tried it, but they believed it. And there was a lot of the times those stories were mixed in with someone that had been told that they'd seen it one time or they experienced it or whatever. And so that's a good point. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:51:44       um, and this is when you get into people that are not telling the whole story. And this is something I'm very careful of is when I know something like no, I never claim to know anything 100% and now I will always caveat everything with you know, like a 99.9% but there's sometimes where I'm giving information and I'm saying, look, this is not 100% I don't know this for sure, but this is what I've seen and this is what I've experienced. Sometimes I'm like, hey listen, I know this and I have experienced it and this is what will work. And I definitely, when I was instructing in the seal teams, I was very clear when I was saying, Hey, I have not done that type of mission before or I have not done this in combat or I have not seen how this would really work.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       But here's what I think cause that's a lot different than this is what you need to do. Because I have seen it, I have done it and I do know confidently that barring the common sense, this is how you should execute this. So sources back to the book, sources have many reasons for not disclosing every facet of an issue. One is to propound more convincingly their perspective. Infantry men can't afford to harbor points of view that aren't well founded. They need continually to reassess their viewpoint and expand their frames of reference to encompass infantry knowledge from around the world and across centuries.

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       Awesome. Free your mind does that kind of like, I'm looking something up on Google or on the Internet and then the difference between just going with that first answer and going with the, you know, a bunch of, a bunch of results. Bunch of websites. Yeah. Right? Yeah. And, and people that see something on the Internet and then talk about it as if they know it firsthand. Right. When they read it on there for that first result they got, they clicked on and boom, there's your answer. Yeah. Those people out there, we don't like you. You're clouding the truth. Okay. Getting into some leadership and really life choices that you can apply these to life. You can play as a business. Um, here are some choices that humans have to make. Protect the status quo or take risks necessary to win decisively that that's, that speaks on its own.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       Protecting the status quo can be easier than changing it to take action. One, risks making mistake. So that's a choice and it's not a black and white choice. There's a lot of shades of gray in there. And how can you modulate that choice? But it is a choice that you have to be aware of. Focus inwards to prevent mistakes or on the enemy to keep pace with a changing situation. This is an interesting professional. Professionals of all types try to minimize errors. Unfortunately, trying to do, trying too hard to do so in the military profession has some serious tradeoffs initiative, ability to surprise one adversary perspective on the overall picture and learning just the name of true. And I would say that those are the exact same in any profession. That when you, when you are only focused on not making mistakes, how are you going to make any risks Jujitsu the minute that you're just like, Hey, I'm going to go with what I know and I am so guilty of this.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       I am the guiltiest of all in that I'm very, um, set in my ways in, in the moves that I do. You know, I do for submissions maybe even to, you know, uh, but you know, they're, they're like what I'm good at. So I do them a lot and I go through phases and I shouldn't even say it's phases. I go through days where I take a lot of risks and I learned more. And then I go through days where I'm just there because I have to train and I'm going to do what I do and I'm gonna what I'm gonna do, what I do well. But that's not what I learned. That's not what I get better. I get better when I'm trying something new. And that applies to everything in life.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       Key to an infantry man's ability to react to whatever confronts him is his authority. To exercise some initiative, you got to give your people the freedom to maneuver. You have to, in combat, the leader must personally supervise only those actions that jeopardize the overall mission and then allow subordinates to exercise initiative and make a few mistakes on everything else. Those subordinates must be able to identify mistakes as they happen without fear of punishment or the same mistakes will happen again. This is making mistakes without fear of punishment. You know a dean are, you know buddy dean lister, he does these drills that he calls consequence free drills where he just says, okay, you're going to start. You know that someone's going to be on your back and you're going to try to escape, but doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what happens if they submit you. It doesn't matter to just doesn't matter. Consequence free drills. It's just to take chances because all of us, you know, we all hate getting tapped out. We all hate giving up position, so you do these consequences. Regionals. You Go, okay, I look at the guy in, I'm like, okay, you're going to tap me out. It's no big deal. You know, so do, I'm going to try crazy stuff. And that's what they're saying here. You've got to give people the chances to make mistakes

Speaker 5:          00:57:20       and that's an accident, an important one because, um, how that applies to life, that applies to life.

Speaker 3:          00:57:28       Mm.

Speaker 5:          00:57:28       Right when you're born, when you're, when you're a bit like if you, let's say your parenting style, if you have that parenting style where I can make some mistake, he spills his milky or he's trying something new, he makes a mistake and he gets punished for it and that's how he's raised. When he grows up, he's going to be very reluctant to try new things in life and, or, or explore a certain, you know, aspects of, of creativity, namely like starting his own business. That's why most people don't start their own business because they've lived that kind of, I think most of us have lived that kind of life where if you make a mistake when you're a kid, you get punished for it. Even in school, when you make a mistake on your test, you get that red x on the thing. You got five wrong out of 10 you've got a 50% you've got an f, there's your punishment, your f, oh wait, I don't know these five things. Can I learn to all take the test again and show you that, oh no, no, you got an APP. There is your punishment. Repeat the grade. [inaudible] sucks. There's your problem. So you didn't even want to make any mistakes. You don't want to try anything new. You don't want to. And you just have that mindset. And that's what most people are like that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       There is however, a point where people, you know, you could be raised in a way where you're not responsible for your own actions because there's no consequences to what you do. So if you don't study and you get the Red Xs all over your test and you don't receive any punishment for it, then you will never learn because only only he who suffers remembers.

Speaker 5:          00:58:57       Right? But there the difference in you this, I know it always comes back to that dichotomy that you talk about where it's, it's really in the middle area. So I think that it has to be leaning towards that what you were saying. Let them give them freedom to operate. If you make a mistake, but they're putting effort into it, that should be commended. Don't, if you get one wrong, too wrong,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       don't give them this trophy that says, Hey, congratulations. You've failed. A failure should, should be. I mean, the goal right, is to make successful people. I will, I will. Despite what I said or in, in conjunction with what I said about there needing to be consequences, I agree that the correct answer or the correct reaction would not be you failed your horrible, but you failed. What did you learn? Yeah. How can we improve? Yes, exactly. Exactly right. So you notice that was exactly, exactly double. Exactly. Exactly right. Yes, for sure. So yeah, they kind of get the best of both worlds where they get get that, that the fact that they failed, they understand that. And of course, no one's just like, no one's goal is to fail. So they know that they failed. They understand that they failed, but encouraged to improve and encouraged to understand.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       But I think in a lot of ways people don't get that. Yeah. You definitely, you definitely don't see it when in businesses you definitely don't see it in the military. Um, and so yeah, you're right. You've got to encourage that. Yeah. And it, and I think it could get, and this is just me speaking from zero experience, but I would imagine that it would get really rigid in the military because the stakes are a lot higher. Well, that's why this is talking about training. Yeah. You don't want to let people make those kinds of mistakes in combat. You won't give them that much rope where they can get somebody killed in combat. Yeah. When, yeah. In a training in, in, in life, in a learning situation or a developing phase, which in life really is your whole life. But so always learning, always learning. So I think to stick to that, I don't know, format, whatever you want to call it, to stick to that where understanding your mistakes don't like a mistake, a legitimate mistake.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       The punishment should not be the significant part of that experience. The learning, the learning should be, and hey look, I understand this. Different philosophies. You know, there's gotta be, there's gotta be some consequence. Some people don't learn without consorts. You see that for these days with these, some of the new generation, which your, you might even be a part of a, but the new, you know, the new generation that grows up, consequence for use and they don't take any responsibility for their actions. They don't take ownership of anything that goes wrong because they've been raised in a way where failure doesn't matter and there's no consequences to their actions. Yeah. So absolutely true. Um, not to beat a dead horse on this subject. I had some notes in here around this from the book trying too hard to follow the book while solving battlefield situations makes one fairly predictable even to enemies who haven't read the book. These don't you have to make some changes and back to the book, these don't have to be drastically different from what's in the book. Often it's enough just to very amount of speed, stealth or deception with which the standard method is executed.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Standardizing what subordinates practice in peace time may make those subordinates easier to control, but does not help them learn the alternative alternative techniques needed to develop momentum and battle. So that actually supports your last statement. Is it standardizing? Standardizing what subordinates practice in peace time may make those subordinates easier to control. So if you're trying to control someone by beating them down and saying, you failed, you need to do it this way and this is the only way you're going to get more control over them, but you're going to not allow them to operate in the real world where they have to think of new ideas and take out. I think you'd have to free their mind. Yeah, and in a way you might, I would hypothesize, you might not even get the best out of them really. I believe you are correct. We could get that, that rigid standard of, of output. And that's Kinda it. And, and going to a quote from the book supporting your hypothesis from Colonel Merit a Edson, he goes on about how you need to fight the Japanese and he closes with encourage your individuals and bring them out, which is just a beautiful statement.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       Now this is, this is kind of to close out this section here. Um, we are talking about, and this, this definitely applies to life. Human beings are always trying to structure the chaos of battle and that may be the root of the problem.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       Human Beings, human beings want to have structure. They want things to be orderly and combat is not orderly nor his life, nor our relationships, nor our business deals. Yup. Nor is the chain of command, nor our personalities and Egos and everything that we try and do to control this chaos. The idea that we can control it is false. Yeah. What you have to do is you have to deal with it, right? You have to let that thing squirm underneath you. You have to let it move and see where its weaknesses are and grab hold of what you can and let go of what you can't. Kind of like. Um, you know the physio balls? Yeah. They're kind of, they're not rigid or nothing. Why are we talking about when I'm training with someone that's bigger than me? You know, you get on top of, you can't hold them down. You have to let them move underneath you. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what this reminds me of. Yeah. I'll add this to your list of things that aren't controllable. Um, all of the existence this way, like you think of a leaf or a U. Dot. K Con. Consider something that's control. That's why we invent rulers. That's why we invent thermometers. You

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       know, temperature is so dynamic. I can walk right five feet away. The temperature, when you really come down to the temperature's going to be different. There's no

Speaker 4:          01:05:26       set controlled anything. Everything is so ambiguous and slippery. And we were saying everything, everything, all of existence does. But, but like how you said people try to control. That's kind. I think that's in our nature though. That's what you smell with rulers and mile markers and it is and it can drive you crazy. If you try and control the chaos of combat, you're going to get destroyed. And if you try and control everything in your life, things that are not controllable than you're going to destroy it. If you try and control the relationship and aspects of relationship that are not controllable, you know what? You control them. The relationship you control you yourself in a real ambiguous way, by the way, because you're always adapting. Ideally from an ideal standpoint, you're always adapting as well. So yes, like this kind of Lens, you know what control you try and control the relationship by controlling the other person when reality, you need to control yourself because most people don't do that. [inaudible] most people don't exercise the beauty of mind control that they can control your mind. You can think what you want to think. You can put those thoughts into your head. You can eliminate the bad ones. You can bring forth the good ones with mind control. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       And I almost want to close on that because that's such a good thing to remember, but I will follow it up with this. It says complex instructions are at best premature during what is usually an inaccurate assessment of the situation. So when you're looking at something and you're going, okay, here's the plan, here's what we're going to do at best that's premature and inaccurate, what your plan is. So when you're trying to figure out what you're gonna do with that business deal and you're trying to create this very detailed plan around it, at best, it's premature and inaccurate.

Speaker 4:          01:07:17       At best. It's premature and accurate. So don't get locked around. You're gonna make these plans are going to be rigid. And here's the way we're going to do it. At best, it's premature to accurate. So think about what you can control and what you can't and move forward from there. A good example of recognizing, or a good way to recognize if you're not practicing these types of thoughts are, you know, ways of looking at things is when you make a plan and the plan and it doesn't go according to plan. And you get mad about it, your [inaudible] and your red flag, red flag right there. That is a red flag. Yeah. And, and when your relationship isn't going the way you want it to be, it's because you should be a newsflash that you can't control this other human being. Yeah. You can only control you. So don't, and this goes back to what we talked about on the last show when we talked about, you know, your family, your close friends

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       and you know, we kinda got to the point where I think I was saying, hey, you can't worry about them. Then you said the same thing. And I think this is a little bit more clarity on that point is you cannot control them, right. So you need to grab what you can, you know, keep it in, keep it as under control as you can, but you're not going to get the solid control that you went. Thank you that you desire. Yeah. It's kind of like if you have this big like trashcan lid and then you have this blob of mercury, you're trying to keep it in the center but don't try to like squeeze it with your hand if something cause it's going to come out of your fingers, you know? Yeah. And, and that what if your co host of a show comes up with examples like a trashcan lid and mercury.

Speaker 1:          01:09:07       You can't control that. All you can do is listen, nod your head and say good point. It's more of a is an analogy, you know, it's like this comparison of, you know, using metaphors check. So moving on, moving on to some questions that we've got from Twitter, from Facebook, got some really good questions. And as a matter of fact, these are a continuation of questions I didn't even ask this time because we didn't get through many of them from the last time I asked for input. So these are a continuation, which means I apologize once again, I don't have the names collected of who gave these questions. So my fault, I apologize if you, if we answer your question, we appreciate you giving us the question so that we could answer it. First one, let's get down to it. So in regards to Jujitsu, this is kind of a common question, but your input, GI or no GI, do you train both?

Speaker 1:          01:10:12       It's that job. The answer is ghee and Nogi. I definitely train both. I like to train both. I don't care which one they're both fond of me and just as we've been talking about a lot tonight through the book, the last hundred yards, I want my training to be different and surprising and be uncontrollable. And when you change it definitely affects you when you change from g and then all of a sudden you take off your game and you're sliding all over the place, you have to be a better grappler to be able to deal with that. So I want to be a better grappler. So I do that. And you know there's, there's something else that's in between gay Nogi and that's when you put MMA gloves on, you put MMA gloves on and it is somewhere in between g and Nogi because you can get legitimate risk control. It's hard to sneak in a choke on somebody when they're wearing gloves. So there's, there's benefits to them all. And I try and do them all. Yeah. What

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       do you find any benefit to doing one and or the other? You know, like if you treat it in the g there's certain benefits and training with a G. I think if, if he trained with a g you, your defense has to be better because there's more friction. And so if you're going to escape an arm lock with the on, you have to do it very well. If you're going to escape a knee lock with the g on, there's a lot of friction. It's a lot harder to get out to. Your defense has to be better with Nogi, your office has to be better because there are no handles to grab. It's slippery that people can slide out of the exact opposite reasons. So you, you, I think you improve your offense more. And I will say this, my game is compatible with both where I don't do a lot of crazy lapel weaving in between your legs then up over your back and then back over your right arm pit and around your neck.

Speaker 4:          01:12:10       I don't do a lot of that. I don't disagree with it. I think it's fine. But I like to most of the moves that I do, um, are compatible with both or there's very small differences between the way I have the games set up. Yeah. At the end, Dean originally told me that same thing where when you train in the Gi, your defense starts to develop a little bit more cause you got to like arm lock, you're in the arm lock, you can't just spaz out of an arm lock. It's easy. And even more important actually is not the just the submission but across side or amounts. What's as a cross side on you with a Gian, they've got those candles and it's very difficult to control risk control, all that stuff. And it's easier to hold them down. Yeah. So if you train Nogi and you're trying to hold some down Nogi, it actually takes more technique to hold somebody down with no GI than it does with Ge.

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       Even though sometimes I hear people say that g is more technical rep, I don't actually agree with that. I think they're both technical in their own aspect. Yeah. So, and even in holding someone down, that's more of an offensive move. Yes. Right. So if you're being held down with the ghee, you got to understand that concept in those techniques to get out or whether it be being held down or submission or whatever. You have to understand those concepts and when you understand the concepts, then you can be successful as opposed to like a Nogi situation. You don't necessary, I mean, you should understand the concept for sure, but you don't necessarily certainly have to because you could just spazz out of it or like an arm lock. You can, if you're sweaty, you get spazz out of an arm lock. We little technique, you know, if you're strong, um, with the gets going to be way harder to do that. So you'll, you'll kind of in a way learn more and flip flop when you go on offense to defense. The same kind of thing with the Nogi offensive stuff. You got to understand where you got to control his shoulder, otherwise he's gonna, you know, have enough room to slide it up. So you have to have that perfect control to execute a good submission if the guy's good. So, um, and I think, you know, with life,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       what I do in life is I try and put myself in tough situations. So I'm practicing them to him, he used to them and you know, that's what, that's what the physical aspect of life is to do. In order to improve, you gotta challenge yourself and put yourself in the worst scenarios and go and try and get through them. You know, whether that's a weight room with a squat rack or whether that's a run or whether that's a swim or whatever that physical challenges you want to, you want to make it as difficult as possible or putting yourself out there or putting yourself out there. As I have challenged myself to be outside my comfort zone into the world of humans. Multimedia. Yes.

Speaker 5:          01:14:54       They say, well I've heard that public speaking is the number one fear of people. I have heard that as well. Yeah. And, and I, it's hard for me to relate to. I have no, I do, I'm not afraid of getting up and talking in front of people. Like he, like he doesn't, I don't understand that. I don't understand what that must feel like. You know? So you understand why though I, it's really hard for me to understand. It's hard for you to relate, right. Well, cause man, it's, do you get nervous talking in front of people? Yeah, yeah. To a degree. I mean obviously it depends on the mood, depends on the people, right. But yeah. Uh, yeah I think I'm really no different than, than most people in that regard for sure. But yeah, there's a reason for that. I think it's because it's, it's almost like this subconscious feeling that everyone's judging every little thing that comes out of your mouth, every little thing that you do movement wise, you know, so your whole being is being judged by all kinds of different people with all the different standards.

Speaker 5:          01:15:58       Yeah. And when you care about that or when you've paid the price for that baby, I think, cause we, you know, when you get raised, I think he paid a price for that. If you say the wrong thing, if you do the wrong thing. Yeah. And I think that in a way ridiculed or you know, whatever, whatever you put, however that looks for you, you've paid the price for um, growing up or [inaudible] on a large scale. Yeah. And that's exactly what you got. You're in a, in a situation where that's all kind of coming. You're coming into your brain where you, you fear that price that you're going to pay. And it's times a thousand because there's a thousand people there. And I think it's kind of subconscious all you're left with consciously is this just anxiety. That's how we feel for your mind. Deco. No, you've got to put yourself in those bad situations. Yes to, you know, put your, if you're gonna public speak or if you're afraid of public speaking book a small thing or I don't know, do do something like put yourself in that situation. And if you don't want to go from zero to 10, do a small one, you know, do something like with low consequences, know, are less impactful

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       consequences and just start small and go up.

Speaker 2:          01:17:15       That's probably what you did.

Speaker 1:          01:17:19       So next question. Next question. Um, so okay. Micromanagers how do you deal with micro managers? Okay. So you worked for me and you were super squared away then I was a great boss and totally left you alone. If you worked for me and you are not squared away, I was a complete micromanager. So that's a little indicator. Now I have worked from micromanagers before. Everyone does. You run into them in the world. And the way, the best way I've figured to get out from under the, the, the, the draconian thumb of the micromanager is to try and gain their trust. And what you want to do is you want to be ahead of them. You want to, and actually this is something that I, when I was on the Tim Ferriss program, I talked about how when I told my dad I was joining the military and I was just rebellious kind of crazy kid and he said, oh, you're going to hate it because you hate authority.

Speaker 1:          01:18:24       And I did it anyways. And when I got in I was like, Damn, my dad was right. I do hate authority. I don't like listening to people. And now I have to listen to them all the time. And then I realized very quickly when I was doing my first seal platoon, I didn't want anyone to tell me what to do. And I was in charge of the radio as I was a radioman. And what I did, what I did was, you know, if the radios had to be ready, I knew they had to be ready. I just got them ready. I got them ready ahead of a time. I did everything before anyone could tell me to do it. I would come into work to be ready before anyone could tell me what to do. So I basically was completely psychotically proactive and just was ahead of the power curve on every little thing that I could be ahead of the power curve on.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       And eventually it didn't take long. The people that micromanaged me, all of a sudden we're like, Hey, I'm not going to bother with this guy anymore. He's already done it. Cause every time they say, Hey, do you have, it's already done. Mm. Hey, did you start preparing their already did them this morning. And eventually they say, okay, this guy knows what he's doing. And what you're trying to do is build up the trust. Cause that's what it is. It's a little, it's a little, a lack of trust that people have that things are going to go the way and they've probably learned that somewhere. So don't hold it against him, but it's your job to create a relationship with them of trust where they stop micromanaging you and move on to somebody else that needs to be micromanaged

Speaker 2:          01:19:52       next.

Speaker 1:          01:19:55       Okay. So what about family and uh, and people who are close to you, are they all the same? And if not, how do you deal with it? So this is the, the trials and tribulations of the Alpha personality and you're always trying to go hard and go fast and make things happen. And how do you deal with this as someone that asking this and whoever you are, thank you for asking this question.

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:20:26       People are people like me. Are they same? And if not, how do I deal with it? Well, first of all, no, there's not too many people like me. And, and as a matter of fact, there's not too many people like you echo and people that are listening this, there's not too many people like you either. People are unique and I'm not trying to make people like me or make them do the things that I do. I'm, I'm over that phase. You know, I've talked about this before. Like there was a time where I would try and convince people about things and I don't try and do any more, I'll discuss them, but I'm not here to win an argument. Um, I'm not that concerned about you. I'm not that concerned about what you think. I'll again, if, if you're someone that I'm friends with and I'm trying to help Ya, I'm concerned, but I'm not trying to change people's minds.

Speaker 1:          01:21:14       Um, but it's interesting because what I'm really trying to do is I'm trying to appreciate people's perspectives. I'm trying to learn from other people. And I thought this was actually speaking of Twitter. I'm on Twitter the other day. I posted a, a little paragraph and it's by a gay guy named Mark Rippetoe, who's a coach. He's written, you know, probably one of the best, one of the best books about weightlifting that you can get. It's called starting strength, basic barbell training, mark Rippetoe. But the opening of it is freaking awesome and I brought it with me so I could read it to you. Uh, so here's, here's this, this opening to this book about weightlifting.

Speaker 1:          01:22:09       Physical strength is the most important thing in life. This is true whether we want it to be or not. As humanity has developed throughout history, physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but no less important to our lives. Our strength more than any other thing we possess still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies. Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed. It now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings. We have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated, but we are still animals. Our physical existence is in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as the same man would be if you were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up. Now that's freaking epic, right? That is an epic call out to the passion that coach Rupp until has. Right? That's just awesome. So I put that on Twitter. I was fired up, you know, and cause somebody mentioned starting strength and I said, yeah, of course, you know, this is a classic and a, some somebody on Twitter, um, wrote back and it said, I disagree. I will avoid reading things like this.

Speaker 1:          01:24:01       And I wrote back in again, I'm not trying to argue with anybody. Um, I just wrote back, hey, when I don't agree with people on a subject, I don't avoid it. I just try and learn from it. And, and the fact of the matter is, even though I think what coach road is awesome, I actually don't agree with it. I don't think that strength is the most important thing in life. I think knowledge is more powerful. I think respect and loyalty and honor and treating people well. I think all those things are more important than strength. And there's been people that were incredibly weak in the world that have done amazing things and we're powerful leaders and we're incredible human beings. So I don't actually, you know, believe that strength is literally the most important thing.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       Now, that being said, um, if you are smart, if you are an intellectual than you realize that you should use that knowledge to be strong so you can not be physically bullied so you can be healthy so you can protect yourself. So you can be self reliant. I mean there's no doubt that strength is a, is a powerful force. But like I said, there's many other things that I think are more important now. But, but what I like about it is that hearing this opinion broadens my mind. It makes me smarter. It makes me understand how important strength is to some people. And maybe that it should be more important in my head. Because honestly, when I read that for the first time years ago, I was like, Oh, you know what? That's awesome. And I should always keep somewhere in my mind that being strong is important and being strong is good. And you know, in this day and age people actually, I think, believe that being strong is bad. As crazy as that might sound, there's nothing wrong with being strong. You know, being strong is good. Nevermind nothing wrong. It's a good thing to be strong. I wish I was stronger. I try and get stronger and I'm not a naturally strong person. I'm just kind of an average person that works out a lot. So

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       my point there is a number number one, when you get people that are different than you don't try. I don't try and change them. I try and keep an open mind. I try and learn from them.

Speaker 2:          01:26:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:26:14       I'm trying, and I talked about this earlier tonight, people have strengths and people have weaknesses and if people have strengths, I'm going to try and learn from their strengths and some people are, I have more weaknesses and I try and learn from them as well. You get someone that's an addict, you get someone that's of a social path or you get someone that's a, you know, a, a real giver or someone that helps them. There's people that one thing that I don't feel like I help people enough. Um, and so I always look at people that are very helpful and I say, okay, what can I do? What can I take away from their perspective? But you know, if I meet someone that's an addict, I learned from them. They teach me very important lessons, people that are winners, people that are losers. I'm going to learn from both of them. Now back to the original question of how do you deal with it, eight, because I'm, I'm, I'm inferring from the question that this person that asked it gets frustrated that others are not living up to their expectations. Now, this is going to sound bad when I say this initially

Speaker 2:          01:27:28       is that

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       I actually have relatively, or I shouldn't say I have, I keep relatively low expectations of humans. Meaning when I meet someone, I don't expect to get a lot out of them. I expect to be let down. I expect people, as I talked about the other day, people are crazy and, and I expect that. I expect people to do irrational things. So that's kind of my baseline. And then what's beautiful about it is I'm surprised and happy and

Speaker 2:          01:28:07       in

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       sh t pleasantly surprised when people are supportive, when people are reliable, when people are good people, when they make sense, when they're not crazy. And so I think setting the right level of expectations is important to keep yourself from going crazy, trying to change people. The other thing I like about this attitude

Speaker 2:          01:28:33       is

Speaker 1:          01:28:35       I'm not sitting there blaming on other people around me. I'm not blaming whether it's my family, whether it's my team, whether it's my people I work with. I'm not blaming them for being unmotivated or blaming them for not trying hard or blaming them for whatever. I'm just taking responsibility for what's happening in my, for me, I'm taking responsibility. If they're not motivated, I need to try and motivate me if I care about them,

Speaker 2:          01:29:00       if they're dragging

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       me down, whose fault is that? That's not their fault. I'm letting them drag me down. So I'm taking responsibility of my interactions with people to make sure I move it in the right direction. And as a leader, it's my job to get the most out of people. I mean, I always talked about that you're going to have, your whole team is not going to be studs. You're going to have people on your team that are weak and it's your job to get what you can out of that person. Take advantage of whatever strengths they might have, cover for the weaknesses where you can, that's what you're doing as a leader and you're leading, whether that's leading in business or your team or your group of friends or whatever. You're taking a leadership position and you're getting what you can out of people.

Speaker 4:          01:29:48       And that's how I deal with people that are close to me that are not the same as me. Don't want to hang around with a bunch Booyah I don't mind hanging around people that are like me. Seal teams is pretty, the seal teams has a lot of people with the similar, you know, they're like got some similar personalities in there, which is always fun too. Yeah, for sure. Um, are there, so you say you have, um, low expectations. Is there, isn't that sound bad? I apologize to people of the world right now. Yeah. That when I look at you, I have low expectations and don't think of it that way. Yeah. I'm seeing in my own mind, I'm just setting low expectations because don't expect a lot, you know? Yes. That's, I expect shittiness you expect, you just don't expect, I just thought, yes. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:41       So if someone's making this, you know, tall claim, you don't expect that claim to be fulfilled 100% or you know, or whatever I sent, I set low expectations and I look to be pleasantly surprised by those people in the world. The people that are listening to this podcast, you all out there, you're going to, you know, fire me up, you know? Um, but, but, but really that's, you know, most people that you meet you can't rely on. Right. And that's why it's important to find people that are likeminded and link arms with them and go forward into the fray. Yeah. And it's not like people are unreliable specifically. It's just that if you set your own specific expectations on people because everyone's different, you're different. Like are you saying, so if you set your specific expectations, which I think most of us do that in one way or another, we expect certain things all the way down to the language. We use. Some people, you know, some people don't like if they are called boss, you know, you're like, hey boss, it's a bus someday. I'm gonna be honest. I don't really like that when someone calls me boss, you know, if you don't know your name, you know, hey bro, same thing boss. But they meant it in a good way, you know? But I expect, yeah, I expect you never to use that word when you address me kind of thing. Got It. It's not that serious.

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       But anyway, that's just a small guy. So if you start setting your own expectations, your specific own expectations, consciously and subconsciously, yeah, you, you, you'll probably get let down. Guess what, whose fault is that? It's your fault. And you know, it's a good, good time to this is, and I run in this with business leaders where they know they're super over achievers and they expect that level of performance out of everyone. And they're not going to get it. And the way I explain it to them, I say, listen, I understand what you want to have happen. But just because as a leader, the lead, the platoon commander is able to carry a hundred pound rucksack, 10 kilometers into the target, hit the target and walk back out another 10 kilometers. Doesn't mean that everybody else in the platoon can do it. And therefore he cannot plan that mission. Right. And I would usually get Fruto him on that because they do realize that there are high performers and that they're over achievers and that they're not going to get. So how are you going to set the expectations so that you're, you've got people that can act actually achieve the expectations you've set for them. So that's right on point, boss.

Speaker 4:          01:33:08       Sorry. Yes, I did get men and set those look kind of low expectations. I know that sounds about them, be them, but let them be there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that way when you get less, if you get let down, actually you probably have a less chance of getting let down. So it's essentially you're minimizing the downside, maximizing the upside. That's a pause. Your relationship, very positive way of putting it. Yes, you are correct. Thank you for making me give him a positive spin to my negative attitude. Yeah, I think I understand what you mean. I think so part of it is denial by the way, because I don't want in every admit or think that you had low expectations of me and my functionality.

Speaker 6:          01:33:56       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:33:57       Okay. We'll go next question. Uh, okay. What are the top three, the top three to 10 business problems you're asked to solve? Good question. Interesting question because why would you say top three to 10 who wrote that? That's crazy. You know, you'd say three or four or three to five maybe, but three to 10 on, no, this is actually should be top three. We'll, we'll go for it. That being said, here's the problem. Here's the problem that we come up against in life and I deal with on a regular basis is we get called in due to either a lack of execution or desire to improve execution. And this is the same thing we dealt with, with working with leadership in the seal teams. You get teams that are not executing correctly. That's, that's the problem that we come in to solve. Now that execution could be production, that execution could be sales, that execution could be manufacturing, it could be anything that execution. So

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       that's what we always get asked to solve. That being said, why is there a problem and execution and the problems, these are where you get like the, okay, five to seven kind of common problems that we deal with. We address, we address most of, most of them, uh, own fact, we address all the major ones in the book. There's a few nuanced ones, but uh, you know, the, generally the issues are like, oh, you can't get people to buy in. We always hear that our folks aren't buying in buying into the plan, the philosophy, your strategy, whatever. Uh, do, people don't understand what's happening. They don't, they don't understand the vision. And we'd go back and we say, okay, do they understand the why or are they, is, how was the vision being communicated? How is the vision being translated up and down the chain of command?

Speaker 1:          01:35:45       Because you go down from the CEO who has a vision and the way he would speak to that vision is a lot different than the way a front line, you know, equipment operator is going to want to understand that vision. So is the strategy simple and understandable through the chain of command that can cause a lack of execution? Are there silos? Are there different elements within the company that are not helping each other and supporting each other with a good cover and move? Is there micromanagement going on? We were talking about micromanagement. Micromanagement can cause legitimate problems of execution. Is there unclear guidance that can cause problems? Is there ego interfering that can cause problem is their ego driving process instead of the best methodology driving process. Sometimes it's ego driving process. So it's all these and there's just these problems and there we've seen them all.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       I don't think I've seen a new problem yet in quite some time where I've said, oh, I've never seen this before and we, we, and there are always these problems of execution. Are leadership problems and we've seen the same thing in some way in the seal teams. So I think that's why we've been successful. It's a company going in and getting people to execute better because we've seen it, we know how to fix it, and that's what we do when. All right. Um, next question is how do you handle a buff that doesn't know as much as you and they don't understand what you do, but they're bossy but they bossy. Okay, so this is actually a normal situation. This is not abnormal. Bosses often don't know as much as the frontline troops. I can tell you right now, I was the boss of 35 or 40 seals when I was a task and you commander and I didn't know as much as they knew about their jobs.

Speaker 1:          01:37:51       I didn't know what the snipers knew about sniping. I didn't know everything that the radio about knew about the radios. I didn't know like Lafe Lafe was working with the Iraqis every, I didn't know about his Iraqi soldiers and what they were like. I couldn't pretend to know that stuff, but I was actually secure in that fact. I was okay with that. And that's what I recognized, that that wasn't my job and I was okay with it. So the question is how do you deal with someone like that? Well, let's first recognize the fact that they are insecure in their job. So the reason I was able to like let my guys run stuff just cause I was secure with myself as a leader. And then my position, when you're dealing with someone that's still bossy, they're trying to impose upon you how to do things.

Speaker 1:          01:38:46       And that is because the root of that is likely, I don't want to call it out as a hundred percent, but the root of that is likely in security. He's insecure about his authority, insecurity about his leadership, insecure about his position. So when you want to deal with it, how do you deal with it? Your job becomes in this situation to make your boss feel secure in their position. That's what your goal becomes. That means an end. Yes. You know what that means? It means nodding your head. And, and giving them credit where they might not deserve it and inflating their ego, or not inflating, but massaging their ego a little bit. And you know what that means? The hardest part of that isn't massage. And there you go. The hardest part of is checking your own ego. The hardest part of that is saying is, is you want to prove to them that you know more than they do, and that just bubbles up and over and it will ruin your relationship and it will ruin the, the job that you're trying to do of make them feel secure because you're like, hey boss, actually you're wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       It's this. Well, your ego feels good, but guess what? You just hurt his ego. Now is what they're going to do. They're going to try and pose more will upon you. So you've actually gone backwards. You win the battle, you lose the war. So what you need to do is make that boss feel secure, massage their ego. Don't try and prove that you know more. Try and prove that you're there to support and help. And in the long run that will be the beneficial way to improve that relationship. Let them recognize or let them feel secure with what they at, where they're at and then they won't impose, try and impose their will on you as the boss man yet that I'm going to add, uh, let you kind of what you were saying I think last time. Um, it's a small, tiny side note but I think it's really important when you try, when you're doing that, when you're or, or making

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       them feel more secure as a boss. Um, be sure to come off genuine and consistent. Remember how we were talking about that? Because a lot of people they'll be like, okay, that's what I'm going to do. And then they overtly want to show that that's what they're doing, whether it be to other people because you know, maybe they got scolded or, or whatever in front of other people and then so they overtly do it and it doesn't come off as genuine than it's counterproductive.

Speaker 1:          01:41:16       Yes. This is called, well, this is what I used to call in the seal teams, classic over correction and classical over correction. You know, we'd see guys go too far in one direction because we're always talking about the dichotomy of leadership. And I'd say to a guy, oh, you're doing, uh, you're doing too much. You're not doing enough decentralized command. And they do classic overcorrection and they would lose control of everything. Or they, if we told them everyone was too wild and they didn't have control of anything, they'd go into level nine micromanagement, you know, and just lock everyone down. So yeah, you don't want to do a classic overcorrection. You want to, you want to moderate and modulate your efforts to make the person feel secure, no doubt about it. Can you apply

Speaker 5:          01:41:57       extreme ownership at mid level management versus the C suite level?

Speaker 1:          01:42:04       Well, this is, this is absolutely true. Um, can you apply extreme ownership or the, the, the leadership principles that we talk about in extreme ownership, can you apply them at mid level management versus the executive level of the C suite folks? And the answer's absolutely yes. And not only that, but extreme ownership applies through the entire chain of command. The principles are meant for everyone inside the chain of command because as we talk about all the time, the leadership just doesn't mean the actual, um, designated leaders. Every person on a team needs to be a leader. And while that may sound Cliche, it is actually true. So he, not only that, but the, the senior executives at a company, the CEO that they work for, somebody, they, whether they work for a board, uh, whether it's, you know, Steve jobs in charge of apple, guess what he's reporting to shareholders.

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       So everyone has some kind of boss. Everyone's working for somebody and everybody needs to use these principles all the way up and down the chain of command. The principles of leadership don't change no matter where you are in the chain of command or what situation you're in. And that's why, you know, we're getting, we get called in to help every level of the chain of command from the frontline troops, from literally from the frontline troops, the the equipment operators, the operators in the field, the salespeople on the front lines. We work with them all the way up to the CSUITE and above.

Speaker 5:          01:43:39       Yeah. Just like how you're thinking applies to everybody and in every situation it's up. It's absolutely true. Like in life, in a relationship with your husband or wife and in the relationship

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       with your kids. Same exact thing. Yeah. Like if you're taking responsibility for everything you did wrong and right. Right. I would imagine you take responsibility for the right things he did, but if you're taking responsibility, I think that's when you can eventually function the way that, that you hope that you'll be able to function. You are correct. Just to be clear though, when you do do something right and you are in a leadership position, you actually don't take responsibility for it. You push that, you push that praise of accomplishment to the team. Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah. You never want to absorb that. That's advanced, Bro. That's actually white belt material.

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       Last question I think. Um, how do you deal with setbacks, failures, delays, defeat or other disasters? How do I deal with setbacks, failures, delays, defeat or other disasters? I actually have a fairly simple way of dealing with these situations and is actually one word to deal with all those situations. And that is good. And this is actually something that one of my direct subordinates, one of my guys that worked for me pointed out to me and he would, he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problems, some issue that was going on and he'd say, possibly got this and that and the other thing. And I look at him and I'd say, good. And finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said, I already know what you're going to say. And I said, well, what am I going to say? You said you're going to say good.

Speaker 4:          01:45:45       He said, that's what you always say when something is wrong in going bad. You always just look at me and say, good. And I said, well yeah, and, and I mean it and that is how I feel when things are going bad, there's going to be some good that's going to come from it and oh, mission got canceled. Good. We can focus, focus on another one. Um, didn't get the new high speed gear. We wanted. Good. We can keep it simple. Didn't get promoted good. More time to get better. Didn't get funded good. We own more of the company. Didn't get the job you wanted. Good. You can get more experience and build a better resume. Got Injured. I got injured. Sprained my ankle. Good. I needed a break from training. Got tapped out. Good. It's better to tap and training than a tap out on the street. Got Beat. Good. You learned unexpected problems. Good. We have the opportunity to figure out a solution. That's it. That's it. When things are going bad, don't get all bummed out. Don't get startled. Don't get frustrated. No, you just look at the issue and you say good.

Speaker 4:          01:47:24       And I don't mean to say something that's all cliche and I don't mean to sound like Mr. Positive. Find a positive, but do that. Focus on the good. Take that issue, take that problem and make it something good. It'll bring that attitude to your team too. You go forward. And lastly, like to close this out, if you can say the word good, guess what it means you're still alive. It means you're still breathing. And if you're still breathing, well the now you still got some fight left in you. So get up, dust off, reload, recalibrate, reengage, and go out on the attack. And that right there is about as good as it gets. That's all I got for today. So everyone that's been listening, thank you for your patience. Thanks for listening. Thanks for spreading the word and most of all to everyone listening to the Jocko podcast. Thank you for getting after it.
