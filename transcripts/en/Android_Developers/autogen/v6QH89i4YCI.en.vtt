growth so Chrome OS is really strong and
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.270
growth so Chrome OS is really strong and
continues to grow but if we talk today

about optimization it's not just helpful

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
about optimization it's not just helpful
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.910
about optimization it's not just helpful
for Chrome OS so phones like the Samsung

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
for Chrome OS so phones like the Samsung

the optimizations we talked about today
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680
the optimizations we talked about today
will be helpful for that too

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
will be helpful for that too
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.650
will be helpful for that too
there's also devices that are in a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
there's also devices that are in a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459
keyboard the touchpad input so thinking
 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.550
keyboard the touchpad input so thinking
about how to optimize the Chrome OS will

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
about how to optimize the Chrome OS will
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.720
about how to optimize the Chrome OS will
help to these form factors too so it's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
help to these form factors too so it's
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.520
help to these form factors too so it's
look a little bit about desktop apps and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
look a little bit about desktop apps and
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.750
look a little bit about desktop apps and
how they're they're different from the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
how they're they're different from the
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.830
how they're they're different from the
mobile form factor so mobile apps to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840
mobile form factor so mobile apps to
 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.240
mobile form factor so mobile apps to
myself I tend to use them in short

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
myself I tend to use them in short
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520
myself I tend to use them in short
bursts maybe a few minutes maybe 20

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
bursts maybe a few minutes maybe 20
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.949
bursts maybe a few minutes maybe 20
minutes at a time and if I think about

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
minutes at a time and if I think about
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.050
minutes at a time and if I think about
buying a mobile app it's something it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
buying a mobile app it's something it
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.140
buying a mobile app it's something it
could cost a few dollars desktop apps I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
could cost a few dollars desktop apps I
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.870
could cost a few dollars desktop apps I
and maybe many of you use those for many

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880
and maybe many of you use those for many
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.630
and maybe many of you use those for many
hours at a time during the day and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
hours at a time during the day and
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.180
hours at a time during the day and
buying one of those buying that for a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
buying one of those buying that for a
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.960
buying one of those buying that for a
few hundred dollars is not unreasonable

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
few hundred dollars is not unreasonable
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.520
few hundred dollars is not unreasonable
so these simple changes from the form

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
so these simple changes from the form
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.759
so these simple changes from the form
factor a bigger screen faster input with

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769

mouse and keyboard drive a really
different kind of usage and the first

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
different kind of usage and the first
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.670
different kind of usage and the first
thing that we might think about as

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680
thing that we might think about as
 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.860
thing that we might think about as
Android developers is how do we extend

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
Android developers is how do we extend
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930
Android developers is how do we extend
our current app onto the desktop

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
our current app onto the desktop
 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.599
our current app onto the desktop
platform and then ongoing we may think

platform and then ongoing we may think
 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.250
platform and then ongoing we may think
about other opportunities to do

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
about other opportunities to do
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.110
about other opportunities to do
something very different on the desktop

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
something very different on the desktop
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.340
something very different on the desktop
platform so that different type of usage

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
platform so that different type of usage
 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.190
platform so that different type of usage

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.270
the applications the next big thing you
 

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.990
the applications the next big thing you
should really do is you should you

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000
should really do is you should you
 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.500

should use both orientations so as we

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:02.510
should use both orientations so as we
 

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.240
should use both orientations so as we
have seen earlier so the thing is most

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.250
have seen earlier so the thing is most
 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.740

there are different sizes of screens you

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040
there are different sizes of screens you
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.500
there are different sizes of screens you
might actually have something which is

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.510
might actually have something which is
 

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.030
might actually have something which is
10 inch but you might actually have

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040
10 inch but you might actually have
 

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.130
10 inch but you might actually have
something with a 40 inch or maybe

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.140
something with a 40 inch or maybe
 

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.230
something with a 40 inch or maybe
something like that I don't know where

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240
something like that I don't know where
 

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.820
something like that I don't know where
is that in the living room but it would

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:48.830
is that in the living room but it would
 

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.240
is that in the living room but it would
be nice right so and with that you

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.250
be nice right so and with that you
 

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.620
be nice right so and with that you
definitely want to show of course more

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.630
definitely want to show of course more
 

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.690
definitely want to show of course more
content and therefore by using the

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:55.700
content and therefore by using the
 

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.400
content and therefore by using the
standard mechanisms which already in

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.410
standard mechanisms which already in
 

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.560
standard mechanisms which already in
Android multiple layouts and whatnot you

00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.570
Android multiple layouts and whatnot you
 

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.260
Android multiple layouts and whatnot you
can do all these kind of things yeah and

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.270
can do all these kind of things yeah and
 

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.120
can do all these kind of things yeah and
then there is mouse and keyboard

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.130
then there is mouse and keyboard
 

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.760
then there is mouse and keyboard
well mouse and keyboard is something

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:06.770
well mouse and keyboard is something
 

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.230
well mouse and keyboard is something
which is totally useful or a notebook

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240
which is totally useful or a notebook
 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.240
which is totally useful or a notebook
but on the phone you have possibly never

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.250
but on the phone you have possibly never
 

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:16.090
but on the phone you have possibly never
really used it with a good reason so the

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.100
really used it with a good reason so the
 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.920
really used it with a good reason so the
next thing is you should actually add

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:17.930
next thing is you should actually add
 

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.820
next thing is you should actually add
stuff for for accessibility like for

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:21.830
stuff for for accessibility like for
 

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.520
stuff for for accessibility like for
example adding content descriptions so

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:24.530
example adding content descriptions so
 

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.160
example adding content descriptions so
that the user can actually hear what you

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.170
that the user can actually hear what you
 

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.440
that the user can actually hear what you
are doing there so and then they of

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.450
are doing there so and then they of
 

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.660
are doing there so and then they of
course all the usual suspects like for

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.670
course all the usual suspects like for
 

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.700
course all the usual suspects like for
example all these old API switch are

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:33.710
example all these old API switch are
 

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.440
example all these old API switch are
there already since ever like drag and

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.450
there already since ever like drag and
 

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.430
there already since ever like drag and
drop support

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440
drop support
 

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.470
drop support
it's like the hover API which we have

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480
it's like the hover API which we have
 

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.389
it's like the hover API which we have
heard earlier and all these kind of

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399
heard earlier and all these kind of
 

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.879
heard earlier and all these kind of
things by doing so you are doing a

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:42.889
things by doing so you are doing a
 

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:46.050
things by doing so you are doing a
perfect job of getting into a good

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.060
perfect job of getting into a good
 

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.600
perfect job of getting into a good
desktop experience and you know or most

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.610
desktop experience and you know or most
 

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.819
desktop experience and you know or most
of these api's are already there they

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:51.829
of these api's are already there they
 

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:53.499
of these api's are already there they
have nothing really new and by doing

00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:53.509
have nothing really new and by doing
 

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:54.970
have nothing really new and by doing
that you're also getting a much better

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:54.980
that you're also getting a much better

coming to the window management on
 

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.600
coming to the window management on
Chrome OS so we have learned some

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:04.610
Chrome OS so we have learned some
 

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.939
Chrome OS so we have learned some
lessons from our previous year so in our

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:06.949
lessons from our previous year so in our
 

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:08.949
lessons from our previous year so in our
previous year we had well our first

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959
previous year we had well our first
 

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.639
previous year we had well our first
incarnation which was built on em and

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:11.649
incarnation which was built on em and
 

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:14.139
incarnation which was built on em and
yeah it has a lot of problems we said

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:14.149
yeah it has a lot of problems we said
 

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:16.329
yeah it has a lot of problems we said
the both beta and beta it was well there

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:16.339
the both beta and beta it was well there
 

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.220
the both beta and beta it was well there
are millions of applications there are

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:18.230
are millions of applications there are
 

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.439
are millions of applications there are
many different api's well back then it

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:20.449
many different api's well back then it
 

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:24.069
many different api's well back then it
were 24 now it's 26 and if you're going

00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079
were 24 now it's 26 and if you're going
 

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.449
were 24 now it's 26 and if you're going
online you're trying to search for

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:25.459
online you're trying to search for
 

00:11:25.459 --> 00:11:27.550
online you're trying to search for
example on how to figure out what the

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560
example on how to figure out what the
 

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.470
example on how to figure out what the
size of the screen is well you will get

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480
size of the screen is well you will get
 

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.960
size of the screen is well you will get
70 different versions of how you can do

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:31.970
70 different versions of how you can do
 

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.970
70 different versions of how you can do
that or even more and the thing is

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:33.980
that or even more and the thing is
 

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.160
that or even more and the thing is
everything will be uploaded well that

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.170
everything will be uploaded well that
 

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.050
everything will be uploaded well that
tells you if something will go wrong

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.060
tells you if something will go wrong
 

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.720
tells you if something will go wrong
well can go wrong it will definitely go

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730
well can go wrong it will definitely go
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.480
well can go wrong it will definitely go
wrong there's no question there so then

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:43.490
wrong there's no question there so then
 

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.030
wrong there's no question there so then
there were the problems of of

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040
there were the problems of of
 

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.410
there were the problems of of
orientations like for example you're

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:47.420
orientations like for example you're
 

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.970
orientations like for example you're
starting an application SATs out

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:48.980
starting an application SATs out
 

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.590
starting an application SATs out
landscape then it change the support

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600
landscape then it change the support
 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.809
landscape then it change the support
rate and it jumps around and this is of

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:52.819
rate and it jumps around and this is of
 

00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:54.400
rate and it jumps around and this is of
course totally annoying for the user and

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:54.410
course totally annoying for the user and
 

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.490
course totally annoying for the user and
we had some good good ideas in mind of

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:57.500
we had some good good ideas in mind of
 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.829
we had some good good ideas in mind of
actually adding their special button

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839
actually adding their special button
 

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.269
actually adding their special button
which allows you to change the

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279
which allows you to change the
 

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.370
which allows you to change the
orientation at any point in time which

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:03.380
orientation at any point in time which
 

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.470
orientation at any point in time which
was which was well thought but the

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480
was which was well thought but the
 

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.240
was which was well thought but the
problem is that since an application

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.250
problem is that since an application
 

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.249
problem is that since an application
could at any point in time say hey I

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:09.259
could at any point in time say hey I
 

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.990
could at any point in time say hey I
really want to be portrait suddenly the

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000
really want to be portrait suddenly the
 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.929
really want to be portrait suddenly the
button was disappearing it was gone so

00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:12.939
button was disappearing it was gone so
 

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:15.460
button was disappearing it was gone so
which was of course also very confusing

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:15.470
which was of course also very confusing
 

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.660
which was of course also very confusing
to the user so then we had application

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:19.670
to the user so then we had application
 

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.780
to the user so then we had application
restarts so unexpected one so like for

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:22.790
restarts so unexpected one so like for
 

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.030
restarts so unexpected one so like for
example the window changes its eyes and

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040
example the window changes its eyes and
 

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.280
example the window changes its eyes and
it lost the state and the user was then

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.290
it lost the state and the user was then
 

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.230
it lost the state and the user was then
had to actually restart the game from

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240
had to actually restart the game from
 

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.519
had to actually restart the game from
the beginning which was of course

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:30.529
the beginning which was of course
 

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.439
the beginning which was of course
totally annoying all these kind of

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:32.449
totally annoying all these kind of
 

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:36.249
totally annoying all these kind of
things are pretty bad so and at the end

00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:36.259
things are pretty bad so and at the end
 

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:38.590
things are pretty bad so and at the end
we had then of course a problem that the

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
we had then of course a problem that the
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.299
we had then of course a problem that the
windows they didn't really expect to be

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:40.309
windows they didn't really expect to be
 

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:42.220
windows they didn't really expect to be
in a window it was to begin with which

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.230
in a window it was to begin with which
 

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.700
in a window it was to begin with which
was another problem

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:43.710
was another problem
 

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.940
was another problem
which brings me to our next thing so

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:46.950
which brings me to our next thing so
 

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.090
which brings me to our next thing so
this are in our new window manager the

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100
this are in our new window manager the
 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.160
this are in our new window manager the
special window modes we are supporting

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.170
special window modes we are supporting
 

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.740
special window modes we are supporting
so essentially we have the pre density

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:54.750
so essentially we have the pre density
 

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.019
so essentially we have the pre density
aware applications these are always

00:12:57.019 --> 00:12:57.029
aware applications these are always
 

00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:59.780
aware applications these are always
being shown fullscreen so I really hope

00:12:59.780 --> 00:12:59.790
being shown fullscreen so I really hope
 

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.550
being shown fullscreen so I really hope
that you are not programming any of

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560
that you are not programming any of
 

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.960
that you are not programming any of
these kinds of applications anymore

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:02.970
these kinds of applications anymore
 

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.370
these kinds of applications anymore
unless you want to have the biggest

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380
unless you want to have the biggest
 

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.470
unless you want to have the biggest
button of the world might be a good a

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480
button of the world might be a good a
 

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.150
button of the world might be a good a
good thing but you possibly don't want

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160
good thing but you possibly don't want
 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.000
good thing but you possibly don't want
that so the next thing is free and free

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.010
that so the next thing is free and free
 

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.530
that so the next thing is free and free
and that is something in between that

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540
and that is something in between that
 

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.440
and that is something in between that
means it includes marshmallow well we

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:15.450
means it includes marshmallow well we
 

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.699
means it includes marshmallow well we
figured out that most of the

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:16.709
figured out that most of the
 

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:18.199
figured out that most of the
applications out there they are working

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:18.209
applications out there they are working
 

00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:20.030
applications out there they are working
fine so they are they're working

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040
fine so they are they're working
 

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.130
fine so they are they're working
reasonably well but the thing is there

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.140
reasonably well but the thing is there
 

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.500
reasonably well but the thing is there
are a lot of applications which don't so

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:24.510
are a lot of applications which don't so
 

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.880
are a lot of applications which don't so
and with that we were getting a lot of

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:25.890
and with that we were getting a lot of
 

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.910
and with that we were getting a lot of
beta feedback and so on so and in order

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920
beta feedback and so on so and in order
 

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.730
beta feedback and so on so and in order
to resolve this issue we have put them

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740
to resolve this issue we have put them
 

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.980
to resolve this issue we have put them
all into Windows so they are static now

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990
all into Windows so they are static now
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.050
all into Windows so they are static now
they have always the same size it's like

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060
they have always the same size it's like
 

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.440
they have always the same size it's like
it's coming up in phone size so and it

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.450
it's coming up in phone size so and it
 

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.170
it's coming up in phone size so and it
can then be either landscape or portrait

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:41.180
can then be either landscape or portrait
 

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.820
can then be either landscape or portrait
the user has an option we can actually

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:43.830
the user has an option we can actually
 

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.620
the user has an option we can actually
then say hey I want to add that thing as

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.630
then say hey I want to add that thing as
 

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.260
then say hey I want to add that thing as
big as possible which makes it then a

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:48.270
big as possible which makes it then a
 

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.000
big as possible which makes it then a
portrait size window on a landscape

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.010
portrait size window on a landscape
 

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.650
portrait size window on a landscape
screen which is the biggest thing what

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660
screen which is the biggest thing what
 

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.110
screen which is the biggest thing what
you can do and if it rotates it's not

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120
you can do and if it rotates it's not
 

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.660
you can do and if it rotates it's not
filling the screen entirely but that is

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:56.670
filling the screen entirely but that is
 

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.030
filling the screen entirely but that is
free and if you are moving to n what I

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040
free and if you are moving to n what I
 

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.920
free and if you are moving to n what I
told you already it's a good idea to do

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:00.930
told you already it's a good idea to do
 

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.380
told you already it's a good idea to do
you have then the full freedom of

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.390
you have then the full freedom of
 

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.210
you have then the full freedom of
getting resizable you can actually be

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220
getting resizable you can actually be
 

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.000
getting resizable you can actually be
full screen you can be windowed and so

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.010
full screen you can be windowed and so
 

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.460
full screen you can be windowed and so
on and so on and if you don't want to be

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:10.470
on and so on and if you don't want to be
 

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.740
on and so on and if you don't want to be
resizable in ends you can say I want to

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:12.750
resizable in ends you can say I want to
 

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.930
resizable in ends you can say I want to
be unreliable which essentially puts you

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940
be unreliable which essentially puts you
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.660
be unreliable which essentially puts you
in the full desktop and then the last

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:17.670
in the full desktop and then the last
 

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.040
in the full desktop and then the last
thing is you can actually have an

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.050
thing is you can actually have an
 

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.320
thing is you can actually have an
application which essentially dictates

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:21.330
application which essentially dictates
 

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.269
application which essentially dictates
us hey I want to be this size and at

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279
us hey I want to be this size and at
 

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:28.490
us hey I want to be this size and at
this location and we respect that so the

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500
this location and we respect that so the
 

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.890
this location and we respect that so the
big thing the big change to previous

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:30.900
big thing the big change to previous
 

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.220
big thing the big change to previous
versions was the via happy have a new

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.230
versions was the via happy have a new
 

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.840
versions was the via happy have a new
rule and that is that the root

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:35.850
rule and that is that the root
 

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.510
rule and that is that the root
activities rules which essentially means

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:38.520
activities rules which essentially means
 

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.230
activities rules which essentially means
that the root activities is the wealth

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240
that the root activities is the wealth
 

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.389
that the root activities is the wealth
you have multiple activities which are

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399
you have multiple activities which are
 

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:47.569
you have multiple activities which are
making up the task spec and the top

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579
making up the task spec and the top
 

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:49.370
making up the task spec and the top
activity is the one which you see and

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380
activity is the one which you see and
 

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.990
activity is the one which you see and
the bottom most one that is a root

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000
the bottom most one that is a root
 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.569
the bottom most one that is a root
activity so if the root activity is for

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579
activity so if the root activity is for
 

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.250

example let's say landscape and it's

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260
example let's say landscape and it's
 

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.530
example let's say landscape and it's
resizable that

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:56.540
resizable that
 

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.390
resizable that
that every activity which goes on top is

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:58.400
that every activity which goes on top is
 

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.780
that every activity which goes on top is
also landscape and resizable it sounds a

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:01.790
also landscape and resizable it sounds a
 

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.880
also landscape and resizable it sounds a
little bit weird right because the thing

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:03.890
little bit weird right because the thing
 

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.320
little bit weird right because the thing
is that would mean that if you have an

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:05.330
is that would mean that if you have an
 

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.120
is that would mean that if you have an
application which was meant to be

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.130
application which was meant to be
 

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.150
application which was meant to be
portrait it and maybe Unruh size with it

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160
portrait it and maybe Unruh size with it
 

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.180
portrait it and maybe Unruh size with it
could suddenly become resizable and

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.190
could suddenly become resizable and
 

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.130
could suddenly become resizable and
landscape which is a contradiction in

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:15.140
landscape which is a contradiction in
 

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.710
landscape which is a contradiction in
itself right well the thing is first if

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720
itself right well the thing is first if
 

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.330
itself right well the thing is first if
you're looking on the phone and you have

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.340
you're looking on the phone and you have
 

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.190
you're looking on the phone and you have
two side by side mode the same thing is

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:21.200
two side by side mode the same thing is
 

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.500
two side by side mode the same thing is
being done there and the second thing is

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.510
being done there and the second thing is
 

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.210
being done there and the second thing is
that most of the applications which are

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.220
that most of the applications which are
 

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.540
that most of the applications which are
really locked into one mode again so in

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.550
really locked into one mode again so in
 

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.850
really locked into one mode again so in
the games they usually don't use layouts

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:30.860
the games they usually don't use layouts
 

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.260
the games they usually don't use layouts
and whatnot and therefore they really

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:32.270
and whatnot and therefore they really
 

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.790
and whatnot and therefore they really
need this treatment but once you're

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800
need this treatment but once you're
 

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.500
need this treatment but once you're
using a layout and the standard

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:35.510
using a layout and the standard
 

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.480
using a layout and the standard
framework which gives you all this kind

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:37.490
framework which gives you all this kind
 

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.580
framework which gives you all this kind
of thing it can relay out your form your

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:39.590

and with this you have no window jumping

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:44.510
and with this you have no window jumping
 

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.090
and with this you have no window jumping
everything looks much cleaner to the

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.100
everything looks much cleaner to the
 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.860
everything looks much cleaner to the
user and it's really a good experience

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:47.870
user and it's really a good experience

user and it's really a good experience
so and so and then there is well you

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.210

right promotes looks like this but you

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:01.220
right promotes looks like this but you
 

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.890
right promotes looks like this but you
know if you have not seen it you can

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:02.900
know if you have not seen it you can

also convert it into a tablet form

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:04.760
also convert it into a tablet form
 

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.450
also convert it into a tablet form
factor so what happens when you're going

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:07.460
factor so what happens when you're going
 

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.150
factor so what happens when you're going
into the tablet form factor in that case

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160
into the tablet form factor in that case
 

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.600
into the tablet form factor in that case
we are we are actually forcing the size

it is inside your view hierarchy if you
are now putting something into the root

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:33.670
are now putting something into the root
 

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.700
are now putting something into the root
of the view hierarchy you might actually

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:35.710
of the view hierarchy you might actually
 

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.010
of the view hierarchy you might actually
mess up something they are so for the

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:38.020
mess up something they are so for the
 

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.320
mess up something they are so for the
time being we should really encourage

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.330
time being we should really encourage
 

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.180
time being we should really encourage
you to not do this kind of thing and

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.190
you to not do this kind of thing and
 

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.310
you to not do this kind of thing and
according to the framework teams isn't

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320
according to the framework teams isn't
 

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.330
according to the framework teams isn't
something what you shouldn't do it

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.340
something what you shouldn't do it
 

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.430
something what you shouldn't do it
anyways so therefore try to avoid that

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440
anyways so therefore try to avoid that
 

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.950
anyways so therefore try to avoid that
if possible the next thing is you should

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960
if possible the next thing is you should
 

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.290
if possible the next thing is you should
actually always make sure to not assume

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:52.300
actually always make sure to not assume
 

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.060
actually always make sure to not assume
that the top left corner of your window

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.070
that the top left corner of your window
 

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.640
that the top left corner of your window
is at 0 0 it's most certainly not

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:56.650
is at 0 0 it's most certainly not
 

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.890
is at 0 0 it's most certainly not
because they source the caption and then

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:58.900
because they source the caption and then
 

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.230
because they source the caption and then
comes your content so always try to get

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240
comes your content so always try to get
 

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.750
comes your content so always try to get
your coordinates relative to the content

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760
your coordinates relative to the content
 

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.560
your coordinates relative to the content
or region and if you have the window

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.570
or region and if you have the window
 

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.230
or region and if you have the window
size from your application you will

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240
size from your application you will
 

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.750
size from your application you will
actually get the window size including

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760
actually get the window size including
 

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.280
actually get the window size including
the caption so essentially that means

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:14.290
the caption so essentially that means
 

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.960
the caption so essentially that means
that your content is a little smaller

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:15.970
that your content is a little smaller
 

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.160
that your content is a little smaller
than the real full window when you're

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.170
than the real full window when you're
 

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.720
than the real full window when you're
resizing has a lot of hurdles

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:21.730
resizing has a lot of hurdles
 

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.840
resizing has a lot of hurdles
unfortunately so as I mentioned earlier

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:24.850
unfortunately so as I mentioned earlier
 

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.940
unfortunately so as I mentioned earlier
to make it seamless you should really

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:26.950
to make it seamless you should really
 

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.350
to make it seamless you should really
have the save and restore fun

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.360
have the save and restore fun
 

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.510
have the save and restore fun
gee and again this thing is something

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520
gee and again this thing is something
 

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.980
gee and again this thing is something
which has to also in the Android world

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:31.990
which has to also in the Android world
 

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.690
which has to also in the Android world
this is not really only something for

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:33.700
this is not really only something for
 

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.850
this is not really only something for
Chromebooks you should have that anyways

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:35.860
Chromebooks you should have that anyways
 

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.840
Chromebooks you should have that anyways
either way so and and if you are using

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:39.850
either way so and and if you are using
 

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.520
either way so and and if you are using
on configuration change and you are

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:41.530
on configuration change and you are
 

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.640
on configuration change and you are
doing dynamic layouting please add that

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:44.650
doing dynamic layouting please add that
 

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.419
doing dynamic layouting please add that
there as well

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:45.429
there as well
 

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:48.180
there as well
if you don't want to be resized you can

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.190
if you don't want to be resized you can
 

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.430
if you don't want to be resized you can
actually put into your activity resize

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440
actually put into your activity resize
 

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.830
actually put into your activity resize
word for word which is for the most part

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840
word for word which is for the most part
 

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.960
word for word which is for the most part
true there are some edge cases where you

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:54.970
true there are some edge cases where you
 

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.690
true there are some edge cases where you
can get resized but usually this is true

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:57.700
can get resized but usually this is true
 

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.919
can get resized but usually this is true
and your window size will not be the

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:01.929
and your window size will not be the
 

00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:03.450
and your window size will not be the
display size for sure

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:03.460
display size for sure
 

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.590
display size for sure
so therefore always use get activity get

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600
so therefore always use get activity get
 

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.690
so therefore always use get activity get
resources get configuration screen width

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:09.700
resources get configuration screen width
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.490
resources get configuration screen width
and height in DP in order to figure out

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:11.500
and height in DP in order to figure out
 

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.470
and height in DP in order to figure out
what's the real size of your window is

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480
what's the real size of your window is
 

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:22.890
what's the real size of your window is
oh yeah so then the next thing is to get

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:22.900
oh yeah so then the next thing is to get
 

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.870
oh yeah so then the next thing is to get
the current configuration of the screen

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880
the current configuration of the screen
 

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.150
the current configuration of the screen
and the matrix and everything you should

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:27.160
and the matrix and everything you should
 

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.340
and the matrix and everything you should
use get resolves get configuration which

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:29.350
use get resolves get configuration which
 

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:33.270
use get resolves get configuration which
was more less responsive already so the

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.280
was more less responsive already so the
 

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.190
was more less responsive already so the
window bounds can change at any point in

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200
window bounds can change at any point in
 

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.470
window bounds can change at any point in
time so be aware of this that you are

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480
time so be aware of this that you are
 

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.419
time so be aware of this that you are
not really statically caching the size

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:39.429
not really statically caching the size
 

00:24:39.429 --> 00:24:42.090
not really statically caching the size
of the screen or the window somewhere we

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.100
of the screen or the window somewhere we
 

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.799
of the screen or the window somewhere we
have seen that also in some applications

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:43.809
have seen that also in some applications
 

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:45.630
have seen that also in some applications
which are simply first time they run

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640
which are simply first time they run
 

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.820
which are simply first time they run
they simply get then the size of the

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:47.830
they simply get then the size of the
 

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.620
they simply get then the size of the
screen they store it somewhere in their

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:49.630
screen they store it somewhere in their
 

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.150
screen they store it somewhere in their
own data and I never look at it again

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.160
own data and I never look at it again
 

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.549
own data and I never look at it again
they scale everything and thereafter

00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559
they scale everything and thereafter
 

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.620
they scale everything and thereafter
when you resize the window everything is

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:55.630
when you resize the window everything is
 

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.980
when you resize the window everything is
looking funny you don't really try to

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:58.990
looking funny you don't really try to
 

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:06.210
looking funny you don't really try to
avoid that as well so and then yeah if

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:06.220
avoid that as well so and then yeah if
 

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.380
avoid that as well so and then yeah if
you're using the layout system

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:07.390
you're using the layout system
 

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.549
you're using the layout system
everything will be done automatically

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559
everything will be done automatically
 

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.440
everything will be done automatically
otherwise you have to take care of it

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.450
otherwise you have to take care of it
 

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.130
otherwise you have to take care of it
yourself

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.140

you can do that via OpenGL which is when

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:13.330
you can do that via OpenGL which is when
 

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.150
you can do that via OpenGL which is when
resizing pretty nicely but yeah so if

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:18.160
resizing pretty nicely but yeah so if
 

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.980
resizing pretty nicely but yeah so if
you have a native application you should

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:19.990
you have a native application you should
 

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.240
you have a native application you should
actually get the fat size looking at em

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.250
actually get the fat size looking at em
 

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.270
actually get the fat size looking at em

it's very hard to see I'm going to go

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:17.619
it's very hard to see I'm going to go
 

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:19.169
it's very hard to see I'm going to go
ahead and resize the app and again I

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:19.179
ahead and resize the app and again I
 

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:21.149
ahead and resize the app and again I
could typically do that by hitting this

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159
could typically do that by hitting this
 

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:22.469
could typically do that by hitting this
little maximize button or the

00:26:22.469 --> 00:26:22.479
little maximize button or the
 

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:24.599
little maximize button or the
full-screen key but I actually have a

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:24.609
full-screen key but I actually have a
 

00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:26.430
full-screen key but I actually have a
developer option enabled that lets me

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.440
developer option enabled that lets me
 

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.859
developer option enabled that lets me
perform freeform resizing by dragging

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:28.869
perform freeform resizing by dragging
 

00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:35.629
perform freeform resizing by dragging
the borders of the window so see that

00:26:35.629 --> 00:26:35.639
the borders of the window so see that
 

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:38.450
the borders of the window so see that
the content scales really well and very

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460
the content scales really well and very
 

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.669
the content scales really well and very
beautifully and the content also updates

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679
beautifully and the content also updates
 

00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:43.469
beautifully and the content also updates
dynamically so if you're able to do

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:43.479
dynamically so if you're able to do
 

00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:45.239
dynamically so if you're able to do
something like this into your app you'll

00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:45.249
something like this into your app you'll
 

00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:47.009
something like this into your app you'll
be giving your users much more control

00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:47.019
be giving your users much more control
 

00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:49.139
be giving your users much more control
over their desktop real estate and with

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:49.149
over their desktop real estate and with
 

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:50.459
over their desktop real estate and with
that I'm going to send you back over to

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:50.469
that I'm going to send you back over to
 

00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:52.169
that I'm going to send you back over to
sip on to talk about just how you can

00:26:52.169 --> 00:26:52.179
sip on to talk about just how you can
 

00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:53.729
sip on to talk about just how you can
enable these developer options so that

00:26:53.729 --> 00:26:53.739
enable these developer options so that
 

00:26:53.739 --> 00:26:58.759
enable these developer options so that
you can also try these on your apps to

00:26:58.759 --> 00:26:58.769
 

00:26:58.769 --> 00:26:59.999
suite

00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:00.009
suite
 

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:02.999
suite
Thank You Margaret so to get to the

00:27:02.999 --> 00:27:03.009
Thank You Margaret so to get to the
 

00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:04.560
Thank You Margaret so to get to the
developer options all you have to do is

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:04.570
developer options all you have to do is
 

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.169
developer options all you have to do is
you have to go first into the chrome we

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:07.179
you have to go first into the chrome we
 

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:09.690
you have to go first into the chrome we
know you go into the settings and you

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:09.700
know you go into the settings and you
 

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.659
know you go into the settings and you
type in Android and then you will see

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:12.669
type in Android and then you will see
 

00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:15.719
type in Android and then you will see
the highlighted Android section and you

00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:15.729
the highlighted Android section and you
 

00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:18.180
the highlighted Android section and you
click on Android settings a side tip

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.190
click on Android settings a side tip
 

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:19.799
click on Android settings a side tip
usually actually now go into yourself

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:19.809
usually actually now go into yourself
 

00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:21.659
usually actually now go into yourself
right click on it and pin it to the

00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:21.669
right click on it and pin it to the
 

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:23.369
right click on it and pin it to the
cells so that you can access it later on

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:23.379
cells so that you can access it later on
 

00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:27.019
cells so that you can access it later on
quicker when you need to and with that

00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:27.029
quicker when you need to and with that
 

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:29.609
quicker when you need to and with that
so there are currently two developer

00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:29.619
so there are currently two developer
 

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:31.649
so there are currently two developer
options of interest for you the first

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:31.659
options of interest for you the first
 

00:27:31.659 --> 00:27:34.739
options of interest for you the first
one is the dynamic resizing option so

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:34.749
one is the dynamic resizing option so
 

00:27:34.749 --> 00:27:36.329
one is the dynamic resizing option so
you should definitely turn that on and

00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:36.339
you should definitely turn that on and
 

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:38.940
you should definitely turn that on and
try to test your application sees that

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:38.950
try to test your application sees that
 

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.219
try to test your application sees that
it's actually first dynamically fluidly

00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:41.229
it's actually first dynamically fluidly
 

00:27:41.229 --> 00:27:43.289
it's actually first dynamically fluidly
resizing everything so if it's not

00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:43.299
resizing everything so if it's not
 

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:45.509
resizing everything so if it's not
resizing fluidly what you should do is

00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519
resizing fluidly what you should do is
 

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:46.799
resizing fluidly what you should do is
you should actually look into your

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:46.809
you should actually look into your
 

00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:49.629
you should actually look into your
activate so if it is not dynamically

00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:49.639
activate so if it is not dynamically
 

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:51.729
activate so if it is not dynamically
doing that and you're using the layout

00:27:51.729 --> 00:27:51.739
doing that and you're using the layout
 

00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.919
doing that and you're using the layout
system and you are getting restarted you

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:53.929
system and you are getting restarted you
 

00:27:53.929 --> 00:27:55.359
system and you are getting restarted you
should actually make sure that all the

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:55.369
should actually make sure that all the
 

00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:56.859
should actually make sure that all the
resources which are which you are using

00:27:56.859 --> 00:27:56.869
resources which are which you are using
 

00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:59.259
resources which are which you are using
they are cached that you're not trying

00:27:59.259 --> 00:27:59.269
they are cached that you're not trying
 

00:27:59.269 --> 00:28:00.999
they are cached that you're not trying
to reallocate them again because that

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:01.009
to reallocate them again because that
 

00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:02.889
to reallocate them again because that
takes time and that makes the whole

00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:02.899
takes time and that makes the whole
 

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:06.039
takes time and that makes the whole
process much Legia and it doesn't look

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:06.049
process much Legia and it doesn't look
 

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:08.229
process much Legia and it doesn't look
that good so as you have seen just in

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:08.239
that good so as you have seen just in
 

00:28:08.239 --> 00:28:10.119
that good so as you have seen just in
our demonstration it can be really

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:10.129
our demonstration it can be really
 

00:28:10.129 --> 00:28:12.759
our demonstration it can be really
really smooth so therefore a smoother at

00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:12.769
really smooth so therefore a smoother at
 

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:15.430
really smooth so therefore a smoother at
neither this and that the next thing is

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440
neither this and that the next thing is
 

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.249
neither this and that the next thing is
well as I said earlier we have this kind

00:28:18.249 --> 00:28:18.259
well as I said earlier we have this kind
 

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:19.989
well as I said earlier we have this kind
of route rule and you don't really know

00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:19.999
of route rule and you don't really know
 

00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.969
of route rule and you don't really know
exactly what your window is doing and if

00:28:21.969 --> 00:28:21.979
exactly what your window is doing and if
 

00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:23.680
exactly what your window is doing and if
you ever come to the point where you are

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:23.690
you ever come to the point where you are
 

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.779
you ever come to the point where you are
not really sure what you see you can

00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:25.789
not really sure what you see you can
 

00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:27.279
not really sure what you see you can
always turn on the second option with

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:27.289
always turn on the second option with
 

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:31.119
always turn on the second option with
this to show the content while the the

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:31.129
this to show the content while the the
 

00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:33.430
this to show the content while the the
state of the window manager which is

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440
state of the window manager which is
 

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.369
state of the window manager which is
then presented in the window title wise

00:28:36.369 --> 00:28:36.379
then presented in the window title wise
 

00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:38.709
then presented in the window title wise
you can see here for example there's an

00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:38.719
you can see here for example there's an
 

00:28:38.719 --> 00:28:42.940
you can see here for example there's an
resizable lu which means that it's the

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:42.950
resizable lu which means that it's the
 

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.159
resizable lu which means that it's the
state you means it can do both it's

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:45.169
state you means it can do both it's
 

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:48.129
state you means it can do both it's
currently in landscape and it's an N

00:28:48.129 --> 00:28:48.139
currently in landscape and it's an N
 

00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:50.979
currently in landscape and it's an N
resizable application which is the best

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:50.989
resizable application which is the best
 

00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:53.680
resizable application which is the best
thing what can happen so in the second

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:53.690
thing what can happen so in the second
 

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.229
thing what can happen so in the second
or P no actually I was joking there's a

00:28:56.229 --> 00:28:56.239
or P no actually I was joking there's a
 

00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:59.680
or P no actually I was joking there's a
third option so there is another one if

00:28:59.680 --> 00:28:59.690
third option so there is another one if
 

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.899
third option so there is another one if
you want to also test already maximize

00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:01.909
you want to also test already maximize
 

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:04.599
you want to also test already maximize
you can actually turn on an option which

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:04.609
you can actually turn on an option which
 

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:07.180
you can actually turn on an option which
is named something like default size and

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.190
is named something like default size and
 

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.099
is named something like default size and
orientation yada yada yada and you put

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:09.109
orientation yada yada yada and you put
 

00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:11.769
orientation yada yada yada and you put
that thing into use phone-sized window

00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:11.779
that thing into use phone-sized window
 

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:13.629
that thing into use phone-sized window
and default to portrait orientation and

00:29:13.629 --> 00:29:13.639
and default to portrait orientation and
 

00:29:13.639 --> 00:29:15.539
and default to portrait orientation and
allow portrait only application to

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:15.549
allow portrait only application to
 

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:19.449
allow portrait only application to
maximize so if you select that thing you

00:29:19.449 --> 00:29:19.459
maximize so if you select that thing you
 

00:29:19.459 --> 00:29:21.489
maximize so if you select that thing you
can also maximize your portrait

00:29:21.489 --> 00:29:21.499
can also maximize your portrait
 

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:23.589
can also maximize your portrait
applications which gives you them the

00:29:23.589 --> 00:29:23.599
applications which gives you them the
 

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:26.529
applications which gives you them the
control bar everything as I said so we

00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:26.539
control bar everything as I said so we
 

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:28.149
control bar everything as I said so we
have not turned that on yet by default

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159
have not turned that on yet by default
 

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.009
have not turned that on yet by default
but it'll come soon or later so

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:30.019
but it'll come soon or later so
 

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:31.479
but it'll come soon or later so
therefore you can already go ahead and

00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:31.489
therefore you can already go ahead and
 

00:29:31.489 --> 00:29:35.739
therefore you can already go ahead and
try that as well so then if you are

00:29:35.739 --> 00:29:35.749
try that as well so then if you are
 

00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:37.659
try that as well so then if you are
using a camera you have most certainly

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:37.669
using a camera you have most certainly
 

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:39.339
using a camera you have most certainly
already seen something and our previous

00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:39.349
already seen something and our previous
 

00:29:39.349 --> 00:29:43.569
already seen something and our previous
experiments with with this M that was

00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:43.579
experiments with with this M that was
 

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:45.219
experiments with with this M that was
you were starting an application and

00:29:45.219 --> 00:29:45.229
you were starting an application and
 

00:29:45.229 --> 00:29:47.039
you were starting an application and
suddenly everything was like somehow

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:47.049
suddenly everything was like somehow
 

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:49.419
suddenly everything was like somehow
rotated which was not really that great

00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:49.429
rotated which was not really that great
 

00:29:49.429 --> 00:29:52.779
rotated which was not really that great
so and for the question is how can you

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:52.789
so and for the question is how can you
 

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:55.209
so and for the question is how can you
fix these kind of things well the first

00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:55.219
fix these kind of things well the first
 

00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:57.190
fix these kind of things well the first
thing what we want to tell you is if you

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200
thing what we want to tell you is if you
 

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.469
thing what we want to tell you is if you
are moving to at least N and you make

00:29:59.469 --> 00:29:59.479
are moving to at least N and you make
 

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:01.269

your window resize will we take care of

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279
your window resize will we take care of
 

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:01.900

you
 

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:04.390
you
so with that we should be able to make

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:04.400
so with that we should be able to make
 

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.270
so with that we should be able to make
everything work for you but without that

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.280
everything work for you but without that
 

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.960
everything work for you but without that
unfortunately you might actually need

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:07.970
unfortunately you might actually need
 

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.210
unfortunately you might actually need
some edge cases which don't work so

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:10.220
some edge cases which don't work so
 

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.100
some edge cases which don't work so
therefore to be doing that will fix

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.110
therefore to be doing that will fix
 

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.460
therefore to be doing that will fix
everything

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.470
 

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.049
so from window manager to input related

00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:17.059
so from window manager to input related
 

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:19.930
so from window manager to input related
topics well the thing is as I said

on a desktop do you expect a little bit
 

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.180
on a desktop do you expect a little bit
more than that so by using for example

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.190
more than that so by using for example
 

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.520

more about how to utilize some other
 

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.269
more about how to utilize some other

you're using already the motion event

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:02.690
you're using already the motion event
 

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.590
you're using already the motion event
that is all fine if you are on the other

you're getting one of these events only

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:21.340
you're getting one of these events only
 

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.130
you're getting one of these events only
per frame which means like you're

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:23.140
per frame which means like you're
 

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.050
per frame which means like you're
missing out on all the position what we

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:25.060
missing out on all the position what we
 

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.820
missing out on all the position what we
can give you so in order to get

everything you want to have the
presentation movement and for that you

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.100
presentation movement and for that you
 

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.410
presentation movement and for that you
should actually have an additional look

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:31.420
should actually have an additional look
 

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.020
should actually have an additional look
and to get historical XY and pressure

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.030
and to get historical XY and pressure
 

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.940
and to get historical XY and pressure
and excess value which gives you then

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:35.950
and excess value which gives you then
 

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:38.970
and excess value which gives you then
the full path so that the other thing

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:38.980
the full path so that the other thing

what we have is a very sophisticated
palm rejection which means like even

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.090
palm rejection which means like even
 

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.640
palm rejection which means like even
though when you're using your palm on

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:44.650

as I'm kind of drawing but the problem
is first you're already getting some

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:51.250
is first you're already getting some
 

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.250
is first you're already getting some
kind of event so in order to make

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:53.260
kind of event so in order to make
 

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.680
kind of event so in order to make
everything work you're getting first

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:55.690
everything work you're getting first

eight pin goes down or four finger goes

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:58.510
eight pin goes down or four finger goes
 

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.630
eight pin goes down or four finger goes
down and then you're moving maybe a

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640
down and then you're moving maybe a
 

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.400
down and then you're moving maybe a
little bit and then you get a cancer

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:02.410
little bit and then you get a cancer
 

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.230
little bit and then you get a cancer
call which is essentially canceling the

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240
call which is essentially canceling the
 

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.390
call which is essentially canceling the
entire path which is a signal for you to

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400
entire path which is a signal for you to
 

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.770
entire path which is a signal for you to
remove the entire thing Margaret will

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:10.780
remove the entire thing Margaret will
 

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.410
remove the entire thing Margaret will
show us now and I see more father thank

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:13.420
show us now and I see more father thank
 

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.660
show us now and I see more father thank
you okay let's go over an app that has

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:15.670
you okay let's go over an app that has
 

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.880
you okay let's go over an app that has
really utilized stylus input well and

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:17.890
really utilized stylus input well and
 

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.040
really utilized stylus input well and
also implemented some specific stylus

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.050
also implemented some specific stylus
 

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.110
also implemented some specific stylus
features so first I'm going to go ahead

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:22.120
features so first I'm going to go ahead
 

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.790
features so first I'm going to go ahead
and put my Chromebook into tablet mode

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800
and put my Chromebook into tablet mode
 

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:30.650
and put my Chromebook into tablet mode
because it's much easier to write on

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660
 

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.109
okay then I'm going to go ahead and take

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119
okay then I'm going to go ahead and take
 

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:35.870
okay then I'm going to go ahead and take
out my trusty stylus device and let's

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880
out my trusty stylus device and let's
 

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.020
out my trusty stylus device and let's
get started okay where does an app that

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.030
get started okay where does an app that
 

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.690
get started okay where does an app that
usually lets me draw and sketch and you

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700
usually lets me draw and sketch and you
 

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.430
usually lets me draw and sketch and you
can see here that as I put my palm

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440
can see here that as I put my palm
 

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.049
can see here that as I put my palm
across the screen there are no marks

00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:45.059
across the screen there are no marks
 

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:47.589
across the screen there are no marks
from it at the same time I can write

00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599
from it at the same time I can write
 

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:54.260
from it at the same time I can write
with my palm on the screen and there are

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.270
with my palm on the screen and there are
 

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.650
with my palm on the screen and there are
no marks from that from my palm this is

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660
no marks from that from my palm this is
 

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.170
no marks from that from my palm this is
because the system is detecting the palm

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180
because the system is detecting the palm
 

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.150
because the system is detecting the palm
in aborting the event path and in the

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160
in aborting the event path and in the
 

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.789
in aborting the event path and in the
app picks that up in undoes the line

00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:04.799
app picks that up in undoes the line
 

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:06.500
app picks that up in undoes the line
that has been drawn so far from my palm

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.510
that has been drawn so far from my palm
 

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.720
that has been drawn so far from my palm
so one thing foot has also done is

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:08.730
so one thing foot has also done is
 

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.819
so one thing foot has also done is
they've implemented a pressure

00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:10.829
they've implemented a pressure
 

00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:12.470
they've implemented a pressure
sensitivity feature which you can see

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480
sensitivity feature which you can see
 

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.710
sensitivity feature which you can see
here so what that does is that allows me

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720
here so what that does is that allows me
 

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.539
here so what that does is that allows me
to make lighter or darker lines based

00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:17.549
to make lighter or darker lines based
 

00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:19.520
to make lighter or darker lines based
off of how hard I press on the screen

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:19.530
off of how hard I press on the screen
 

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.020
off of how hard I press on the screen
this means that lighter lines are from

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.030
this means that lighter lines are from
 

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.480
this means that lighter lines are from
lighter pressure and darker lines are

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:26.490
lighter pressure and darker lines are
 

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.539
lighter pressure and darker lines are
from darker or heavier pressure so with

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:29.549
from darker or heavier pressure so with
 

00:36:29.549 --> 00:36:30.710
from darker or heavier pressure so with
that I'm going to send you back over to

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720
that I'm going to send you back over to
 

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.210
that I'm going to send you back over to

next thing is input compatibility mode

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:38.450
next thing is input compatibility mode
 

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.849
next thing is input compatibility mode
so the thing with the compatibility is

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859
so the thing with the compatibility is
 

00:36:40.859 --> 00:36:42.319
so the thing with the compatibility is
well very simple

00:36:42.319 --> 00:36:42.329
well very simple
 

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:44.900
well very simple
no one was accusing Mouse yet right so

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:44.910
no one was accusing Mouse yet right so
 

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.269
no one was accusing Mouse yet right so
therefore the scroll wheel has a special

00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:47.279
therefore the scroll wheel has a special
 

00:36:47.279 --> 00:36:49.160
therefore the scroll wheel has a special
input it is defined by Android since

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.170
input it is defined by Android since
 

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.140
input it is defined by Android since
ever but no one is using it on the

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:51.150
ever but no one is using it on the
 

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.519
ever but no one is using it on the
Chromebook this is of course pretty bad

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:52.529
Chromebook this is of course pretty bad
 

00:36:52.529 --> 00:36:54.470
Chromebook this is of course pretty bad
because if you're using then for example

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480
because if you're using then for example
 

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.539
because if you're using then for example
your mouse nothing will move when you're

00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:56.549
your mouse nothing will move when you're
 

00:36:56.549 --> 00:36:58.700
your mouse nothing will move when you're
trying to scroll in order to solve this

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:58.710
trying to scroll in order to solve this
 

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.220
trying to scroll in order to solve this
we have a compatibility mode so and what

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.230
we have a compatibility mode so and what
 

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.049
we have a compatibility mode so and what
we do is we look at that thing we have

00:37:03.049 --> 00:37:03.059
we do is we look at that thing we have
 

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:04.700
we do is we look at that thing we have
the event and we are converting it

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:04.710
the event and we are converting it
 

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.849
the event and we are converting it
automatically in a touch touch scroll

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859
automatically in a touch touch scroll
 

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:11.599
automatically in a touch touch scroll
event and that is usually done under the

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:11.609
event and that is usually done under the
 

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:12.950
