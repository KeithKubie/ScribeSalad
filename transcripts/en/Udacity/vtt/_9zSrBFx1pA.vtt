A recent article published in the online

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.300
magazine Slate, brought to light the unexpected possibilities

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.490
when you participate in services like 23andMe.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.860
The story was about a woman named Jackie

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.595
and her brother Alex who participated in

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.970
23andMe in the spring of 2012. Jackie and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.460
Alex opted in to the relative finder

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.450
program that 23andMe offers. The result would turn

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.360
out to shock them. 23andMe listed Alex, Jackie's

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.730
brother as Jackie's uncle because they shared 25%

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.539
IBD. Now Jackie and Alex had spent their whole lives together growing up. And

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.770
and Jackie knew Alex couldn't be her uncle. Or could he? Choosing from this list

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.450
of possible family member options, I want you to tell me which of the following

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.470
relationships could even share 25% relatedness or IBD with Jackie.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.360
Remember to check any and all options that you think apply.
