intense laser and by the time we were
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.130
intense laser and by the time we were
finished we had to rethink how intense

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140
finished we had to rethink how intense

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
same speeds now this flies in the face
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.960
same speeds now this flies in the face
of light being a wave if you can imagine

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
of light being a wave if you can imagine
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360
of light being a wave if you can imagine
walking on a beach that's stony Beach

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
walking on a beach that's stony Beach
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.570
walking on a beach that's stony Beach
and if you just have small sea I know I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580
and if you just have small sea I know I
 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.490
and if you just have small sea I know I
talk to a lot I don't need a mic

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500
talk to a lot I don't need a mic
 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.010
talk to a lot I don't need a mic
so when you walk on a beach and there's

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
so when you walk on a beach and there's
 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.590
so when you walk on a beach and there's
stones and you just have little ripples

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600
stones and you just have little ripples
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600
stones and you just have little ripples
in the waves the stones don't even move

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
in the waves the stones don't even move
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.180
in the waves the stones don't even move
but if the waves are really crashing in

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190
but if the waves are really crashing in
 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.130
but if the waves are really crashing in
you will see those stones flying up the

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140
you will see those stones flying up the
 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.170
you will see those stones flying up the
beach and this is how waves would

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180
beach and this is how waves would
 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.390
beach and this is how waves would
usually move objects and so when we

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400
usually move objects and so when we
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.980
usually move objects and so when we
turned up the power of the light we

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990
turned up the power of the light we
 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.840
turned up the power of the light we
certainly expected that the electrons

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850
certainly expected that the electrons
 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.620
certainly expected that the electrons
would fly off faster and yet they didn't

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630
 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.900
so it's this man here Albert Einstein

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910
so it's this man here Albert Einstein
 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.910
so it's this man here Albert Einstein
who probably thought of almost all of

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920
who probably thought of almost all of
 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.550
who probably thought of almost all of
physics all on his own what he won the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560
physics all on his own what he won the
 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.070
physics all on his own what he won the
Nobel Prize for though was explaining

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080
Nobel Prize for though was explaining
 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.930
Nobel Prize for though was explaining
this effect and so we and optics are

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
this effect and so we and optics are
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.280
this effect and so we and optics are
pretty proud of the fact that this is

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290
pretty proud of the fact that this is
 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.340
pretty proud of the fact that this is
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what
 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.220
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what
he figured out was that light actually

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230
he figured out was that light actually
 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.770
he figured out was that light actually
is quantized in its energy there is a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780
is quantized in its energy there is a
 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.800
is quantized in its energy there is a
minimum energy unit of light that we now

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
minimum energy unit of light that we now
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.210
minimum energy unit of light that we now
call the Photon

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220
call the Photon
 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.800
call the Photon
it's a wave-like particle so what it

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
it's a wave-like particle so what it
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.310
it's a wave-like particle so what it
says though is that the total energy in

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320
says though is that the total energy in
 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.220
says though is that the total energy in
your light is then the energy of an

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230
your light is then the energy of an
 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.230
your light is then the energy of an
individual photon multiplied by the

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
individual photon multiplied by the
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.570
individual photon multiplied by the
number of photons the other thing that

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580
number of photons the other thing that
 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.910
number of photons the other thing that
he figured out then is that each photon

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920
he figured out then is that each photon
 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.180
he figured out then is that each photon
has an energy given by this wavelength

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190
has an energy given by this wavelength
 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.730
has an energy given by this wavelength
and so I'm going to do an analogy

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
and so I'm going to do an analogy
 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.890
and so I'm going to do an analogy
because it's harder for us to feel the

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900
because it's harder for us to feel the
 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.310
because it's harder for us to feel the
energy of light so we'll use gravity

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320
energy of light so we'll use gravity
 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.080
energy of light so we'll use gravity
that we all know about standing on the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090
that we all know about standing on the
 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.450
that we all know about standing on the
earth and that if we drop the ball from

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460
earth and that if we drop the ball from
 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.940
earth and that if we drop the ball from
higher up it would be faster when it hit

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950
higher up it would be faster when it hit
 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.540
higher up it would be faster when it hit
the ground the higher up you can drop it

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550
the ground the higher up you can drop it
 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.640
the ground the higher up you can drop it
so now a red photon is a small photon so

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650
so now a red photon is a small photon so
 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.870
so now a red photon is a small photon so
we're going to imagine playing

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880
we're going to imagine playing
 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.250
we're going to imagine playing
basketball with a child size basketball

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260
basketball with a child size basketball
 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.130
basketball with a child size basketball
depth and so if it's a red photon

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140
depth and so if it's a red photon
 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.770
depth and so if it's a red photon
playing basketball no matter how they

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780
playing basketball no matter how they
 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.080
playing basketball no matter how they
try even up on their tippy toes they

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090
try even up on their tippy toes they
 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.570
try even up on their tippy toes they
cannot reach that net to drop their

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
cannot reach that net to drop their
 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.240
cannot reach that net to drop their
electron through and no matter how many

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250
electron through and no matter how many
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.210
electron through and no matter how many
of these childlike photons there are the

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220
of these childlike photons there are the
 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.890
of these childlike photons there are the
electron is never going to get through

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900
electron is never going to get through
 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.490
electron is never going to get through
that basketball net now if you have a

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500
that basketball net now if you have a
 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.020
that basketball net now if you have a
green light that's like an adults

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030
green light that's like an adults
 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.090
green light that's like an adults
playing with a child size basketball net

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100
playing with a child size basketball net
 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.300
playing with a child size basketball net
and they can actually dunk through but

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310
and they can actually dunk through but
 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.830
and they can actually dunk through but
only barely they're only staying

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840
only barely they're only staying
 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.600
only barely they're only staying
slightly taller than the basketball net

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610
slightly taller than the basketball net
 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.030
slightly taller than the basketball net
and so when they drop their ball through

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040
and so when they drop their ball through
 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.610
and so when they drop their ball through
ups we have to go back you can only you

see so slow because it's just slightly

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870
see so slow because it's just slightly
 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.860

your pro basketball player they're the
 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.270
your pro basketball player they're the
very tall good people and so they're

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280
very tall good people and so they're
 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.490
very tall good people and so they're
well above the net and when they drop

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500
well above the net and when they drop
 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.310
well above the net and when they drop
their balls through the net boom a lot

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.320
their balls through the net boom a lot
 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.110
their balls through the net boom a lot
more speed but it wouldn't matter how

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120
more speed but it wouldn't matter how
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.320

many of these violet photons they had

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330
many of these violet photons they had
 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.300
many of these violet photons they had
they would all be dropping at the same

it's about quantum mechanics but that's
not what I want you to concentrate on

what it really told us about how light

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.450
what it really told us about how light
 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.870
what it really told us about how light
interacts with matter is that it's

00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880
interacts with matter is that it's
 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.510
interacts with matter is that it's
always one photon meeting up with one

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520
always one photon meeting up with one
 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.820
always one photon meeting up with one
atom at a time and they meet with each

atom at a time and they meet with each
 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.010

can then send the electron on its way

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.590
can then send the electron on its way
 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.620
can then send the electron on its way
and when there's more photons coming

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:15.630
and when there's more photons coming
 

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.320
and when there's more photons coming
they interact with more atoms but always

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.330
they interact with more atoms but always

she thought about this right maybe she

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.420
she thought about this right maybe she

brought her woman's way of looking at
 

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.130
brought her woman's way of looking at
science and thought why don't photons

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140

together right because if two photons

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540
together right because if two photons
 

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.510
together right because if two photons
would just come into that atom at one

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:08.520
would just come into that atom at one
 

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.180
would just come into that atom at one
time they would share their energy and

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.190
time they would share their energy and
 

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.180
time they would share their energy and
two little red photons would have the

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
two little red photons would have the
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.550
two little red photons would have the
same energy as one violet photon and

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560
same energy as one violet photon and
 

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.230
same energy as one violet photon and
then the there we go it would have an

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240
then the there we go it would have an
 

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.120
then the there we go it would have an
electron come through with pretty high

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.130
electron come through with pretty high
 

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:23.630

this is what we now call multiphoton

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640
this is what we now call multiphoton
 

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.660
this is what we now call multiphoton
ionization because there's more than one

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:29.670
ionization because there's more than one
 

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.900
ionization because there's more than one

to call it that I don't know what she

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380
to call it that I don't know what she

to call it that I don't know what she
called it it was all in German um so so

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.110
called it it was all in German um so so
 

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.870
called it it was all in German um so so
now we could understand that but nobody

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880
now we could understand that but nobody
 

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.210
now we could understand that but nobody
had seen it don't forget I Stein was

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220
had seen it don't forget I Stein was
 

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.720
had seen it don't forget I Stein was
actually sitting there wondering why the

actually sitting there wondering why the
 

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.320
actually sitting there wondering why the
experimentalists were seeing what they

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.330

nobody had seen anything like this so I

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.290
nobody had seen anything like this so I
 

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.960
nobody had seen anything like this so I
don't know what made this woman think

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:53.970
don't know what made this woman think
 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.290
don't know what made this woman think
about it but in fact nobody would see

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300
about it but in fact nobody would see
 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.890
about it but in fact nobody would see
this effect for another thirty years it

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:00.900

this effect for another thirty years it
was Peter frankenz group at the

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000
was Peter frankenz group at the
 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.030
was Peter frankenz group at the
University of Michigan and I know I have

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040
University of Michigan and I know I have
 

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.490
University of Michigan and I know I have
a lot of Michigan people in the audience

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
a lot of Michigan people in the audience
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.950
a lot of Michigan people in the audience
that were the first people to see a

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:09.960
that were the first people to see a
 

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.640
that were the first people to see a
multiphoton effect now they were doing

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:13.650
multiphoton effect now they were doing
 

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.430
multiphoton effect now they were doing
their experiment not and with atoms that

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440
their experiment not and with atoms that
 

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.670
their experiment not and with atoms that
would eject electrons but what happened

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680
would eject electrons but what happened
 

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.660
would eject electrons but what happened
was that two red photons were

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:23.670
was that two red photons were
 

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.380
was that two red photons were
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.390
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then
 

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.790
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then
when the atom wanted to let that energy

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800
when the atom wanted to let that energy
 

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.920
when the atom wanted to let that energy
go it didn't let it go as two red

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:30.930
go it didn't let it go as two red
 

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.550
go it didn't let it go as two red
photons it let it go as one photon with

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560
photons it let it go as one photon with
 

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.040
photons it let it go as one photon with
twice the energy so you'll see then that

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.050
twice the energy so you'll see then that
 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.250
twice the energy so you'll see then that
the wavelength here is half well does

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260
the wavelength here is half well does
 

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.810
the wavelength here is half well does
that looks less than half what whatever

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820
that looks less than half what whatever
 

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.200
that looks less than half what whatever
look all of a half can't have everything

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.210
look all of a half can't have everything
 

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.270
look all of a half can't have everything
right anyway so this is that what we

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:47.280
right anyway so this is that what we
 

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.210
right anyway so this is that what we
call second harmonic generation all

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220
call second harmonic generation all
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.620
call second harmonic generation all
right and we now see it more routinely

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.630
right and we now see it more routinely
 

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.770
right and we now see it more routinely
but this was something to see in 1961 so

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:57.780
but this was something to see in 1961 so
 

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.410
but this was something to see in 1961 so
then it begs the question why did it

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420
then it begs the question why did it
 

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.160
then it begs the question why did it

what was special about 1961 well so

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:10.350
what was special about 1961 well so
 

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.840
what was special about 1961 well so
we've been mentioned in the previous

we've been mentioned in the previous
 

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.440
we've been mentioned in the previous
talk what was special about 1961 is that

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:15.450
talk what was special about 1961 is that
 

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.880
talk what was special about 1961 is that
in 1960 the laser was born so because

for developing the maser the maser came

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220
for developing the maser the maser came

microwaves rather than light in lasers
 

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.690
microwaves rather than light in lasers
and logically it was easier to make a

and logically it was easier to make a
 

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.550
and logically it was easier to make a
maser than a laser and so that was done

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560
maser than a laser and so that was done
 

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.080
maser than a laser and so that was done

how a laser works a laser as I'm using

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.280
how a laser works a laser as I'm using
 

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.590
how a laser works a laser as I'm using
right here and I'm going to shine on the

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600
right here and I'm going to shine on the
 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.750
right here and I'm going to shine on the
wall over there you will see that the

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760
wall over there you will see that the
 

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.760
wall over there you will see that the
light only goes in the one direction

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:49.770
light only goes in the one direction
 

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.980
light only goes in the one direction
where I shine it you don't see it going

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:51.990
where I shine it you don't see it going
 

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.960
where I shine it you don't see it going
over there because the light's not going

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:53.970
over there because the light's not going
 

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.910
over there because the light's not going
into your eyes the light's going over

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920
into your eyes the light's going over
 

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.790
into your eyes the light's going over
there so we already have it concentrated

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800
there so we already have it concentrated
 

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.310
there so we already have it concentrated
into one beam you'll also see that the

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320
into one beam you'll also see that the
 

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.110
into one beam you'll also see that the
laser is just one color and in the case

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120
laser is just one color and in the case
 

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.080
laser is just one color and in the case
of the laser pointer just green they

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.090
of the laser pointer just green they
 

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.930

also the photons in the laser all talk

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940
also the photons in the laser all talk
 

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.880
also the photons in the laser all talk
to each other and when one's out of

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:10.890
to each other and when one's out of
 

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.310
to each other and when one's out of
crest they're all at a crust and so each

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320
crest they're all at a crust and so each
 

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.200
crest they're all at a crust and so each
of these photons are going together and

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.210
of these photons are going together and
 

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.640
of these photons are going together and
so they are making themselves to be a

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:16.650
so they are making themselves to be a
 

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.340
so they are making themselves to be a
giant wave and a giant wave means

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.350
giant wave and a giant wave means
 

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.560
giant wave and a giant wave means
there's the density of photons is

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:21.570
there's the density of photons is
 

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.500
there's the density of photons is
greater so let's go back and think about

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:24.510
greater so let's go back and think about
 

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.410
greater so let's go back and think about
the linear case here's what they saw

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420
the linear case here's what they saw
 

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.280
the linear case here's what they saw

is not very high so also when you may be

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:42.960

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.250
in sunlight down to a point I'll tell
you it's not going to a point we can

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260

only focus light down

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.250
only focus light down
 

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.990
only focus light down
to a wavelength so the light that we see

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000
to a wavelength so the light that we see
 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to a wavelength so the light that we see
is about half a micron the laser eye

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.010
is about half a micron the laser eye
 

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.620
is about half a micron the laser eye
bildt's one micron so we're gonna go

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:58.630
bildt's one micron so we're gonna go
 

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.780
bildt's one micron so we're gonna go
with that one micron is a thousandth of

with that one micron is a thousandth of
 

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.330
with that one micron is a thousandth of
a millimeter and so you can't focus your

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:03.340
a millimeter and so you can't focus your
 

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.240
a millimeter and so you can't focus your
beam any smaller than that to

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.250
beam any smaller than that to
 

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.250

dimension of an atom is an angstrom but

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.230
dimension of an atom is an angstrom but
 

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.390
dimension of an atom is an angstrom but
we're not really supposed to use that

we're not really supposed to use that
 

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.100
we're not really supposed to use that

1/10 of a nanometer all right so this

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:25.450
1/10 of a nanometer all right so this
 

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.780
1/10 of a nanometer all right so this

than you can focus the light so when you
 

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.980
than you can focus the light so when you
blow up that atom because of the

doing nonlinear optics but to me it was
a very subtle difference so this man

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.310
a very subtle difference so this man
 

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.160
a very subtle difference so this man
wanted for nonlinear optics so here we

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.170
wanted for nonlinear optics so here we
 

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.470

go we now have a chance of two photons

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480
go we now have a chance of two photons

go we now have a chance of two photons
so this gets me to my PhD Sherrard gave

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160
so this gets me to my PhD Sherrard gave

so this gets me to my PhD Sherrard gave
me a paper written by Stephen Harris of

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:47.200
me a paper written by Stephen Harris of
 

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.920

Stanford University and he had this idea

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:49.930

that lasers were sort of stuck in the

that lasers were sort of stuck in the

that lasers were sort of stuck in the
visible to the infrared but we might

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120
visible to the infrared but we might
 

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.420

the energy you need to cut glass and yet
 

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.020
the energy you need to cut glass and yet
it doesn't hurt my hand at all and so

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.030
it doesn't hurt my hand at all and so
 

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.419
it doesn't hurt my hand at all and so
what's the difference well if I had

00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:52.429
what's the difference well if I had
 

00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:54.910
what's the difference well if I had
shown that one second pulse of light out

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:54.920
shown that one second pulse of light out

to where the moon is and I have no idea

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:56.870
to where the moon is and I have no idea
 

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.020
to where the moon is and I have no idea
where the moon is but and and I couldn't

00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.030
where the moon is but and and I couldn't
 

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.540

do it anyway it would be the beginning

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:01.550
do it anyway it would be the beginning
 

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.919
do it anyway it would be the beginning
part of the pulse would actually be this

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:05.929
part of the pulse would actually be this
 

00:18:05.929 --> 00:18:07.960

oh there we go the front part of the
 

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.060
oh there we go the front part of the
pulse would actually be 2/3 of the way

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.070
pulse would actually be 2/3 of the way
 

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.640
pulse would actually be 2/3 of the way
to the moon before the end of the pulse

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:15.650
to the moon before the end of the pulse
 

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.080
to the moon before the end of the pulse
would leave the laser

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.090
would leave the laser
 

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.490
would leave the laser
that's how fast

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:18.500
that's how fast
 

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.890
that's how fast
light travels and so now in our

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:20.900
light travels and so now in our
 

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.049
light travels and so now in our
one-second pulse we have one mill a

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:23.059
one-second pulse we have one mill a
 

00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:25.810
one-second pulse we have one mill a
jewel of energy in this one second long

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:25.820

first multiphoton effect they had light

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:37.610
first multiphoton effect they had light
 

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.590
first multiphoton effect they had light
that was one millisecond long so that's

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600
that was one millisecond long so that's
 

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.020
that was one millisecond long so that's
a thousand times shorter still 300

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.030
a thousand times shorter still 300
 

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.169
a thousand times shorter still 300
kilometer long line of light I will tell

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:47.179
kilometer long line of light I will tell
 

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:48.490
kilometer long line of light I will tell
you they had more than a millage oh they

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:48.500
you they had more than a millage oh they
 

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.289
you they had more than a millage oh they
had a Joule so they had a thousand times

00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:50.299
had a Joule so they had a thousand times
 

00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:52.960
had a Joule so they had a thousand times
shorter and a thousand times more energy

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:52.970
shorter and a thousand times more energy
 

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.180
shorter and a thousand times more energy
and then with that million fold they

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.190
and then with that million fold they
 

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.149
and then with that million fold they
were to see the odd time an atom grab

00:18:58.149 --> 00:18:58.159
were to see the odd time an atom grab
 

00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:01.090
were to see the odd time an atom grab
two photons at once the laser that we

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:01.100
two photons at once the laser that we
 

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.370
two photons at once the laser that we
built in Rochester though was shorter

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:03.380
built in Rochester though was shorter
 

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.580
built in Rochester though was shorter
than that we squeezed it down some more

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:06.590
than that we squeezed it down some more
 

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.120
than that we squeezed it down some more
and in fact we squeezed it down so that

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.130
and in fact we squeezed it down so that
 

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.039
and in fact we squeezed it down so that
one milli Joule of energy was in one

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:12.049
one milli Joule of energy was in one
 

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:14.320
one milli Joule of energy was in one
picosecond or just a third of a

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.270
there I am back in the day now inside
 

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.169
there I am back in the day now inside
this laboratory for laser energetics was

00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:02.179
this laboratory for laser energetics was
 

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:04.870
this laboratory for laser energetics was
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it
 

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.480
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it
was red and green and as I said it just

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:07.490
was red and green and as I said it just
 

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.340
was red and green and as I said it just
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:09.350
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I
 

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.320
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I
wanted to work with Gerard in this

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.330
wanted to work with Gerard in this
 

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.230
wanted to work with Gerard in this
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye
 

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.720
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye
laser is a type of short pulse laser in

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:16.730
laser is a type of short pulse laser in
 

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.180
laser is a type of short pulse laser in
fact this laser the pulses were actually

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.190
fact this laser the pulses were actually
 

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.070
fact this laser the pulses were actually
ten times shorter than what I'm talking

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080
ten times shorter than what I'm talking
 

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.230
ten times shorter than what I'm talking
about so only a 30th of a millimeter

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240
about so only a 30th of a millimeter
 

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.649
about so only a 30th of a millimeter
long so we had short laser pulses

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:25.659
long so we had short laser pulses
 

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:28.240
long so we had short laser pulses
problem is dye lasers don't like to grab

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.250
problem is dye lasers don't like to grab
 

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.220
problem is dye lasers don't like to grab
their energy and hang on to it and so

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:30.230
their energy and hang on to it and so
 

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.750
their energy and hang on to it and so
that you can't get a big energy diet

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760
that you can't get a big energy diet
 

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.320
that you can't get a big energy diet
laser

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330
laser
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.540
laser
so you can have short pulses but the

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:34.550
so you can have short pulses but the
 

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.130
so you can have short pulses but the
reason that the laboratory for laser

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.140
reason that the laboratory for laser
 

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.990
reason that the laboratory for laser
energetics was there was to study laser

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000
energetics was there was to study laser
 

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.090
energetics was there was to study laser
fusion and to study laser fusion you

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.100
fusion and to study laser fusion you
 

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.770
fusion and to study laser fusion you
need a big laser and they had a big

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:41.780
need a big laser and they had a big
 

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.110
need a big laser and they had a big
laser this was known as the mega laser

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120
laser this was known as the mega laser
 

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.720
laser this was known as the mega laser
it was 24 beams and it could produce a

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:46.730
it was 24 beams and it could produce a
 

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.180
it was 24 beams and it could produce a
kilojoule of energy not a millijoules

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.190
kilojoule of energy not a millijoules
 

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.100
kilojoule of energy not a millijoules
a kilojoule that's a million times more

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:51.110
a kilojoule that's a million times more
 

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.130
a kilojoule that's a million times more
energy so in the laser lab we had short

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.140
energy so in the laser lab we had short
 

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.560
energy so in the laser lab we had short
pulses and we had big energy lasers but

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:56.570
pulses and we had big energy lasers but
 

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.600
pulses and we had big energy lasers but
we couldn't put them together more than

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:58.610
we couldn't put them together more than
 

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.180
we couldn't put them together more than
one problem one the dye laser had red

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.190
one problem one the dye laser had red
 

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.310
one problem one the dye laser had red
photons and this one wants to amplify

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320
photons and this one wants to amplify
 

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.840
photons and this one wants to amplify
infrared photons so they wouldn't have

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:04.850
infrared photons so they wouldn't have
 

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.790
infrared photons so they wouldn't have
spoken to each other but there was a

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:06.800
spoken to each other but there was a
 

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.680
spoken to each other but there was a
bigger problem when people tried to put

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:08.690
bigger problem when people tried to put
 

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.870
bigger problem when people tried to put
slightly short pulses even into these

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880
slightly short pulses even into these
 

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.660
slightly short pulses even into these
lasers what they found was that the rod

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:13.670
lasers what they found was that the rod
 

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.000
lasers what they found was that the rod
would actually get drilled all the way

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.010
would actually get drilled all the way
 

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.190
would actually get drilled all the way
through and you were left with a very

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200
through and you were left with a very
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.990
through and you were left with a very
expensive piece of glass that wasn't any

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000
expensive piece of glass that wasn't any
 

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.660
expensive piece of glass that wasn't any
good so that did so they had a stop

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:22.670
good so that did so they had a stop
 

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.820
good so that did so they had a stop
trying to put short pulses down their

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:24.830
trying to put short pulses down their
 

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.010
trying to put short pulses down their
laser rods because these nonlinear

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.020
laser rods because these nonlinear
 

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.140
laser rods because these nonlinear
optical effects were happening inside

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.150
optical effects were happening inside
 

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.120
optical effects were happening inside
the laser rods and they were drilling

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.130
the laser rods and they were drilling
 

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.760
the laser rods and they were drilling
holes all the way through them so that

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:33.770
holes all the way through them so that
 

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.500
holes all the way through them so that
was the conundrum that we were in in the

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:35.510
was the conundrum that we were in in the
 

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.740
was the conundrum that we were in in the
early 1980s and then gerard had his

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:38.750
early 1980s and then gerard had his
 

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.930
early 1980s and then gerard had his
beautiful idea so there are no pictures

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:40.940
beautiful idea so there are no pictures
 

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.280
beautiful idea so there are no pictures
because I hate having my picture taken

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.290
because I hate having my picture taken
 

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.170
because I hate having my picture taken
I've had to get used to it since October

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:44.180
I've had to get used to it since October
 

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.570
I've had to get used to it since October
2nd but there are no pictures which are

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.580
2nd but there are no pictures which are
 

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.010
2nd but there are no pictures which are
not you together so we were out of

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.020
not you together so we were out of
 

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.630
not you together so we were out of
meeting a few years back and took this

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:49.640
meeting a few years back and took this
 

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.290
meeting a few years back and took this
picture so this is a very simple

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:53.300
picture so this is a very simple
 

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.290
picture so this is a very simple
beautiful idea this is what we want here

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.300
beautiful idea this is what we want here
 

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.020
beautiful idea this is what we want here
we want a lot of energy we want it in a

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.030
we want a lot of energy we want it in a
 

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.450
we want a lot of energy we want it in a
very short pulse we just don't want that

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:01.460
very short pulse we just don't want that
 

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.820
very short pulse we just don't want that
in our amplifier so if we don't want

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:03.830
in our amplifier so if we don't want
 

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.650
in our amplifier so if we don't want
that in our amplifier what can we do

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:05.660
that in our amplifier what can we do
 

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.040
that in our amplifier what can we do
just start with a short pulse strategy

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.050
just start with a short pulse strategy
 

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.920
just start with a short pulse strategy
to make it a long pulse amplify it up

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:11.930
to make it a long pulse amplify it up
 

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.330
to make it a long pulse amplify it up
and then about the end compress it all

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:16.340
and then about the end compress it all
 

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.120
and then about the end compress it all
the way back down and here you have what

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.130
the way back down and here you have what
 

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:24.060
the way back down and here you have what
I like to call a laser hammer

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.070
 

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.999
so now how did we actually do it we're

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:27.009
so now how did we actually do it we're
 

00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:28.590
so now how did we actually do it we're
going to go back to this lab because

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600
going to go back to this lab because
 

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.139
going to go back to this lab because
this was the lab by now you'll see I've

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:31.149
this was the lab by now you'll see I've
 

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.519
this was the lab by now you'll see I've
changed the title of it even though I'm

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:32.529
changed the title of it even though I'm
 

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:35.099
changed the title of it even though I'm
showing you the very same laser and so

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:35.109
showing you the very same laser and so
 

00:22:35.109 --> 00:22:36.899
showing you the very same laser and so
the green beam is actually not a green

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:36.909
the green beam is actually not a green
 

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:38.879
the green beam is actually not a green
laser this is the laser back here it's

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:38.889
laser this is the laser back here it's
 

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:41.219
laser this is the laser back here it's
infrared you can't see the beam coming

00:22:41.219 --> 00:22:41.229
infrared you can't see the beam coming
 

00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:42.899
infrared you can't see the beam coming
out of the laser because it's infrared

00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:42.909
out of the laser because it's infrared
 

00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:44.639
out of the laser because it's infrared
and we can't see it neither can the

00:22:44.639 --> 00:22:44.649
and we can't see it neither can the
 

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:47.460
and we can't see it neither can the
camera the kind of mirrors that we use

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.470
camera the kind of mirrors that we use
 

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.129
camera the kind of mirrors that we use
in a laser lab direct just the color we

00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:50.139
in a laser lab direct just the color we
 

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:52.229
in a laser lab direct just the color we
want to direct and so this green light

00:22:52.229 --> 00:22:52.239
want to direct and so this green light
 

00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:54.149
want to direct and so this green light
bent at this mirror but the infrared

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159
bent at this mirror but the infrared
 

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.519
bent at this mirror but the infrared
came on through it would have gone to a

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:56.529
came on through it would have gone to a
 

00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:58.950
came on through it would have gone to a
beam dump to protect all of us from I

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960
beam dump to protect all of us from I
 

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.080
beam dump to protect all of us from I
feeling the heat of that very strong

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.090
feeling the heat of that very strong
 

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.070

laser and so that laser how the same

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080
laser and so that laser how the same
 

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.369
laser and so that laser how the same
wavelength as the big neodymium glass

00:23:07.369 --> 00:23:07.379
wavelength as the big neodymium glass
 

00:23:07.379 --> 00:23:10.019
wavelength as the big neodymium glass
amplifiers that we wanted to use so that

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:10.029
amplifiers that we wanted to use so that
 

00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:13.229
amplifiers that we wanted to use so that
was the laser I was to use you can also

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:13.239
was the laser I was to use you can also
 

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:15.149
was the laser I was to use you can also
see there's simply no room in the end

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159
see there's simply no room in the end
 

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:19.859
see there's simply no room in the end
for me there was one packed lab but they

00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:19.869
for me there was one packed lab but they
 

00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:21.749
for me there was one packed lab but they
shoved me into that corner where the

00:23:21.749 --> 00:23:21.759
shoved me into that corner where the
 

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:24.560
shoved me into that corner where the
infrared came out and there I am in 1985

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.570
infrared came out and there I am in 1985
 

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.529
infrared came out and there I am in 1985
with up 1.4 kilometers of optical fiber

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:28.539
with up 1.4 kilometers of optical fiber
 

00:23:28.539 --> 00:23:32.190
with up 1.4 kilometers of optical fiber
so why did we need this fiber well there

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200
so why did we need this fiber well there
 

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.659
so why did we need this fiber well there
was one advantage of it's not why we

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:33.669
was one advantage of it's not why we
 

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:35.339
was one advantage of it's not why we
needed it because there was no room for

00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:35.349
needed it because there was no room for
 

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:37.289
needed it because there was no room for
me here once we had the light going down

the fiber that fiber then went through

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.070
the fiber that fiber then went through
 

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.919
the fiber that fiber then went through
the air ducts down the length of the

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:40.929
the air ducts down the length of the

that was one thing but two other reasons

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440
that was one thing but two other reasons
 

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.589
that was one thing but two other reasons
that we needed this fiber is that the

00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:49.599
that we needed this fiber is that the
 

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:51.960
that we needed this fiber is that the
laser the pump the dye laser was not as

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:51.970
laser the pump the dye laser was not as
 

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.909
laser the pump the dye laser was not as
short as we wanted and we needed more

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919
short as we wanted and we needed more
 

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:55.529
short as we wanted and we needed more
colors I'm going to explain why we

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:55.539

00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:57.479
colors I'm going to explain why we
needed more colors I don't have time to

00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:57.489
needed more colors I don't have time to
 

00:23:57.489 --> 00:23:59.219

the component though what we really

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:05.590
the component though what we really
 

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.830
the component though what we really
needed the fiber for this was our pulse

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840
needed the fiber for this was our pulse
 

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.619
needed the fiber for this was our pulse
stretcher so first to understand pulse

00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:10.629

stretching we have to know why do we

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200
stretching we have to know why do we
 

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.229
stretching we have to know why do we
need a lot of colors in order to make a

00:24:16.229 --> 00:24:16.239
need a lot of colors in order to make a
 

00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:19.019
need a lot of colors in order to make a
short pulse if you watch just one of

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:19.029
short pulse if you watch just one of
 

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:20.489
short pulse if you watch just one of
these colors and we can just do the red

00:24:20.489 --> 00:24:20.499
these colors and we can just do the red
 

00:24:20.499 --> 00:24:23.759
these colors and we can just do the red

wave would go on forever now if you take

00:24:26.729 --> 00:24:26.739
wave would go on forever now if you take
 

00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:28.529
wave would go on forever now if you take
more colors and you say that you want

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:28.539
more colors and you say that you want
 

00:24:28.539 --> 00:24:31.049
more colors and you say that you want
all of them to start here you'll see

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:31.059
all of them to start here you'll see
 

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:32.999
all of them to start here you'll see
that each wavelength starts to come

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:33.009
that each wavelength starts to come
 

00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:35.960
that each wavelength starts to come
apart you don't have to go very far

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:35.970
apart you don't have to go very far
 

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.740
apart you don't have to go very far
until some

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:37.750
until some
 

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.260
until some
pekes while others are troughs and so if

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:40.270
pekes while others are troughs and so if
 

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.030
pekes while others are troughs and so if
one waves a peak and the other waves of

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:42.040
one waves a peak and the other waves of
 

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.010
one waves a peak and the other waves of
trough they cancel each other out to be

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:44.020
trough they cancel each other out to be
 

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.560
trough they cancel each other out to be
nothing and so the more colors you can

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.570
nothing and so the more colors you can
 

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.500
nothing and so the more colors you can
add in the quicker you will get to where

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:49.510
add in the quicker you will get to where
 

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.690
add in the quicker you will get to where
it's zero and so the more colors you

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:51.700
it's zero and so the more colors you
 

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.870
it's zero and so the more colors you
have the shorter pulse you have so we

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880
have the shorter pulse you have so we
 

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.090
have the shorter pulse you have so we
created the colors in the fibre and now

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.100
created the colors in the fibre and now
 

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.860
created the colors in the fibre and now
it's time to stretch it how does that

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:01.870
it's time to stretch it how does that
 

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.350
it's time to stretch it how does that

photon decides to come by so then you

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:39.850
photon decides to come by so then you
 

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.840
photon decides to come by so then you
can have a photon come along and meet up

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:42.850
can have a photon come along and meet up
 

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.630
can have a photon come along and meet up
with an atom and because we've excited

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640
with an atom and because we've excited
 

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.340
with an atom and because we've excited
these atoms so they have the very same

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.350
these atoms so they have the very same
 

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.080
these atoms so they have the very same
energy as the photon that we're going to

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.090
energy as the photon that we're going to
 

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.539

try to amplify they meet each other

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:51.549
try to amplify they meet each other
 

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:53.609
try to amplify they meet each other
the photon says to the atom I'll take

00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:53.619
the photon says to the atom I'll take
 

00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:56.159
the photon says to the atom I'll take
your energy with me and now we have two

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:56.169
your energy with me and now we have two
 

00:26:56.169 --> 00:26:58.739
your energy with me and now we have two
photons and that atom lost its energy

00:26:58.739 --> 00:26:58.749
photons and that atom lost its energy
 

00:26:58.749 --> 00:27:01.680
photons and that atom lost its energy
those two photons are marching and step

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:01.690
those two photons are marching and step
 

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.899
those two photons are marching and step
together and they meet two more atoms

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:03.909
together and they meet two more atoms
 

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:07.529
together and they meet two more atoms
and now we have four photons and we've

00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:07.539
and now we have four photons and we've
 

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:10.229
and now we have four photons and we've
given up two atoms of energy and by the

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:10.239
given up two atoms of energy and by the
 

00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:13.499
given up two atoms of energy and by the
end we'll have eight photons and they've

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:13.509
end we'll have eight photons and they've
 

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:15.720
end we'll have eight photons and they've
given up the out four more atoms of

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:15.730
given up the out four more atoms of
 

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.639
given up the out four more atoms of
energy now this is actually very

00:27:17.639 --> 00:27:17.649
energy now this is actually very
 

00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:19.499
energy now this is actually very
wasteful because you'll see that by the

00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:19.509
wasteful because you'll see that by the
 

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:22.049
wasteful because you'll see that by the
end of it we've left most of the energy

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:22.059
end of it we've left most of the energy
 

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:23.609
end of it we've left most of the energy
there in the amplifier so that's a

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:23.619
there in the amplifier so that's a
 

00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:25.080
there in the amplifier so that's a
complete waste and we don't want to do

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.090
complete waste and we don't want to do
 

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.299
complete waste and we don't want to do
that if it was a laser we were putting

00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:27.309
that if it was a laser we were putting
 

00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:28.889
that if it was a laser we were putting
mirrors on either end and have it go

00:27:28.889 --> 00:27:28.899
mirrors on either end and have it go
 

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:30.810
mirrors on either end and have it go
back and forth until we steal all of

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:30.820
back and forth until we steal all of
 

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.869
back and forth until we steal all of
that energy and this is then why we have

00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:33.879
that energy and this is then why we have
 

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:36.779
that energy and this is then why we have
to keep building huge lasers if we want

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:36.789
to keep building huge lasers if we want
 

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:39.690
to keep building huge lasers if we want
a lot of energy the laser rod itself

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:39.700
a lot of energy the laser rod itself
 

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.269
a lot of energy the laser rod itself
determines the energy per unit area that

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279
determines the energy per unit area that
 

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:44.549
determines the energy per unit area that
you can take and if you want to grab it

00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559
you can take and if you want to grab it
 

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.859
you can take and if you want to grab it
all you actually have to put in almost

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:46.869
all you actually have to put in almost
 

00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:49.409
all you actually have to put in almost
that much energy to start to snowplow

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:49.419
that much energy to start to snowplow
 

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:52.249
that much energy to start to snowplow
through and take the energy so each

00:27:52.249 --> 00:27:52.259
through and take the energy so each
 

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:54.539
through and take the energy so each
amplification gets a certain energy per

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:54.549
amplification gets a certain energy per
 

00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:56.849
amplification gets a certain energy per
unit area if you want more energy you

00:27:56.849 --> 00:27:56.859
unit area if you want more energy you
 

00:27:56.859 --> 00:27:59.369
unit area if you want more energy you
must get make your beam bigger you must

00:27:59.369 --> 00:27:59.379
must get make your beam bigger you must
 

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:01.229
must get make your beam bigger you must
make your amplifier bigger and you plow

00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:01.239
make your amplifier bigger and you plow
 

00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:04.019
make your amplifier bigger and you plow
through again the other thing I want to

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:04.029
through again the other thing I want to
 

00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:05.549
through again the other thing I want to
point out that is that the laser

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559
point out that is that the laser
 

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.680
point out that is that the laser
material decides what's the energy per

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:07.690
material decides what's the energy per
 

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.139
material decides what's the energy per
unit area but the nonlinear things that

00:28:10.139 --> 00:28:10.149
unit area but the nonlinear things that
 

00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:11.879
unit area but the nonlinear things that
can cause damage is the energy per unit

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:11.889
can cause damage is the energy per unit
 

00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:14.070
can cause damage is the energy per unit
volume so once you know what laser

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080
volume so once you know what laser
 

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.499
volume so once you know what laser
you're using that determines how much

00:28:16.499 --> 00:28:16.509
you're using that determines how much
 

00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:18.659
you're using that determines how much
you must stretch the pulse so that you

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:18.669
you must stretch the pulse so that you
 

00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:20.849
you must stretch the pulse so that you
keep it below any kind of damage

00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:20.859
keep it below any kind of damage
 

00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:22.919
keep it below any kind of damage
threshold so that's why we would have to

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:22.929
threshold so that's why we would have to
 

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:24.869
threshold so that's why we would have to
chirp based on the type of laser that we

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:24.879
chirp based on the type of laser that we
 

00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:28.139
chirp based on the type of laser that we
used so now that we're amplified up it's

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:28.149
used so now that we're amplified up it's
 

00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:30.960
used so now that we're amplified up it's
just time to compress and so with a pair

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:30.970
just time to compress and so with a pair
 

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.599
just time to compress and so with a pair

like prisms that send different colors

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679
like prisms that send different colors
 

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.129
like prisms that send different colors
of light out to different angles and so

red because it was stretched it's
further ahead than the green and the

has managed to get to the grading the

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:53.409
has managed to get to the grading the
 

00:28:53.409 --> 00:28:55.950
has managed to get to the grading the
red one had to travel all the way back

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960
red one had to travel all the way back
 

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.950
red one had to travel all the way back
here and could get here so that when

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960
here and could get here so that when
 

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.049
here and could get here so that when
they all leave the second grading

00:29:01.049 --> 00:29:01.059
they all leave the second grading
 

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:03.659
they all leave the second grading
they're all going together and we've put

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:03.669
they're all going together and we've put
 

00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:05.280
they're all going together and we've put
all of the photons back

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.290
all of the photons back
 

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.470
all of the photons back
to gather in time and so we have a short

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480
to gather in time and so we have a short
 

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.930
to gather in time and so we have a short
pulse so then it was just time to

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:09.940
pulse so then it was just time to
 

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.470
pulse so then it was just time to
measure it my colleague Steve Williamson

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480
measure it my colleague Steve Williamson
 

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.360
measure it my colleague Steve Williamson
came into my lab with history camera one

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.370
came into my lab with history camera one
 

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.390
came into my lab with history camera one
night and together we measured did I or

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:18.400
night and together we measured did I or
 

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.670
night and together we measured did I or
did I not actually have an intense short

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:20.680
did I not actually have an intense short
 

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.160
did I not actually have an intense short
pulse and the answer was yes so we were

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.170
pulse and the answer was yes so we were
 

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.730
pulse and the answer was yes so we were
very happy that night in 1985 so what

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:26.740
very happy that night in 1985 so what
 

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.700
very happy that night in 1985 so what
did we do with it well remember I wanted

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:29.710
did we do with it well remember I wanted
 

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.260
did we do with it well remember I wanted
to study well I want to study harmonic

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.270
to study well I want to study harmonic
 

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.850
to study well I want to study harmonic
generation that proved too difficult so

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:32.860
generation that proved too difficult so
 

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.410
generation that proved too difficult so
we're going to go back to the idea of

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:34.420
we're going to go back to the idea of
 

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.260
we're going to go back to the idea of
multiphoton ionization and we thought

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:37.270
multiphoton ionization and we thought
 

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.570
multiphoton ionization and we thought
that we would just kick that electron

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:39.580
that we would just kick that electron
 

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.300
that we would just kick that electron
and give it so much energy that it would

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.310
and give it so much energy that it would
 

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.040
and give it so much energy that it would
be able to come out of this well that it

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.050
be able to come out of this well that it
 

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.740
be able to come out of this well that it
sits in in the atom and so all those

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:46.750
sits in in the atom and so all those
 

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.960
sits in in the atom and so all those
photons would come up and kick that

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:48.970
photons would come up and kick that
 

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.630
photons would come up and kick that
electron out that's what we were

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640
electron out that's what we were
 

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.150
electron out that's what we were
expecting to see but that's not what we

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:54.160
expecting to see but that's not what we
 

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.330
expecting to see but that's not what we
saw we have made such an intense laser

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:57.340
saw we have made such an intense laser
 

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.360
saw we have made such an intense laser
that the photons were packed in there so

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:00.370
that the photons were packed in there so
 

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.030
that the photons were packed in there so
tight we no longer had to worry about

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:03.040
tight we no longer had to worry about
 

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.940
tight we no longer had to worry about
them being photons it was back to being

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:05.950
them being photons it was back to being
 

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.420
them being photons it was back to being
just one giant wave now although it's a

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:09.430
just one giant wave now although it's a
 

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.730
just one giant wave now although it's a
short pulse wave so each crest gets a

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.740
short pulse wave so each crest gets a
 

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.500
short pulse wave so each crest gets a
little bit more intense and a little bit

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:13.510
little bit more intense and a little bit
 

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.110
little bit more intense and a little bit
more intense and so what happens when

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120
more intense and so what happens when
 

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.690
more intense and so what happens when
you have a giant wave is that it

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:18.700
you have a giant wave is that it
 

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.000
you have a giant wave is that it
interacts with the atom that was sitting

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.010
interacts with the atom that was sitting
 

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.530
interacts with the atom that was sitting
in its potential my head can be the

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:22.540
in its potential my head can be the
 

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.720
in its potential my head can be the
electron and it would the wave would

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:24.730
electron and it would the wave would
 

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.760
electron and it would the wave would
push it this way and then the wave would

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:26.770
push it this way and then the wave would
 

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.650
push it this way and then the wave would
push it that way and then it pushed it

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:28.660
push it that way and then it pushed it
 

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.080
