please diabetes you have the implication

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:52.779
please diabetes you have the implication
 

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:55.650
please diabetes you have the implication
for diabetes that we know is insulin is

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:55.660
for diabetes that we know is insulin is
 

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.689
for diabetes that we know is insulin is
produced in the pancreas and it's

00:15:57.689 --> 00:15:57.699
produced in the pancreas and it's
 

00:15:57.699 --> 00:16:00.119
produced in the pancreas and it's
released in a calcium sensitive manner

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:00.129
released in a calcium sensitive manner
 

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:03.660
released in a calcium sensitive manner
and so this machinery operates in the

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:03.670
and so this machinery operates in the
 

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.960
and so this machinery operates in the
release of insulin into the bloodstream

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:05.970
release of insulin into the bloodstream
 

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.269
release of insulin into the bloodstream
the machinery also works in tissues that

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279
the machinery also works in tissues that
 

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.980
the machinery also works in tissues that
respond to insulin the hormone that

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:10.990
respond to insulin the hormone that
 

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.799
respond to insulin the hormone that
mediates sugar uptake and so it's a

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:13.809
mediates sugar uptake and so it's a
 

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:17.699
mediates sugar uptake and so it's a
fundamental process in in all cells and

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:17.709
fundamental process in in all cells and
 

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:19.290
fundamental process in in all cells and
that has really led to a greater

causes potentially fatal disease or a
 

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:10.470
causes potentially fatal disease or a
fatal disease and we can actually use

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480
fatal disease and we can actually use
 

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.919
fatal disease and we can actually use
this toxin also to treat children that

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:16.929

when this great so understanding the
 

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.550
when this great so understanding the
treatments better would allow you to

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560
treatments better would allow you to
 

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.010

okay so if you can imagine that you were

00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:39.069
okay so if you can imagine that you were
 

00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:41.160
okay so if you can imagine that you were
gonna go to school and you were gonna

you where it was going to take you all
those signs on the buses disappeared so

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:51.369
those signs on the buses disappeared so
 

00:39:51.369 --> 00:39:53.370
those signs on the buses disappeared so
you'd get into the bus without having

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:53.380
you'd get into the bus without having
 

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.650

any idea of where it might take you it

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:55.660
any idea of where it might take you it
 

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.630
any idea of where it might take you it
might take you to your school but it

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640
might take you to your school but it
 

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.329
might take you to your school but it
might take you to your parents workplace

00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339
might take you to your parents workplace
 

00:39:59.339 --> 00:40:02.910
might take you to your parents workplace
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and
