00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
The Earth.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.870
An inscrutable blue, green and white marble
suspended in the vacuum of space and on its

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.110
surface, teeming with life.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.179
You and me, countless animals, plants, fungi
and bacteria on the mountains, plains, rivers,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820
and oceans of our planet.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.820
But something is lurking underneath our feet.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.869
According to new research?

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.939
A whole other world.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.569
This new world that is slowly being revealed
to us is what scientists call the deep biosphere

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.500
because it lies many meters below the earth’s
surface.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.430
It’s also sometimes called the dark biosphere--just
because we like to give you the shivers...and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.220
because, yknow, there’s no light down there.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.670
The Deep Carbon Observatory is a global community
of over 1000 scientists who, for the past

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.650
ten years, have been exploring this subterranean
world and what lives in it.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.920
The latest press release from this research
community, as their 10-year long project comes

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280
to an end, reveals just how startling the
deep biosphere really is.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.760
The team sampled life forms found at mines
and boreholes that had been drilled up to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.110
5 kilometers below the earth’s surface,
and up to 2.5 kilometers below the seafloor.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.700
With hundreds of samples, they were then able
to model the size and makeup of the deep biosphere...and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.249
it is HUGE.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:23.479
The DCO estimates that the deep biosphere
is probably made up of 2-2.3 billion cubic

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.829
kilometers of living organisms, which is almost
twice the volume of all of the earth’s oceans.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.250
Just let that sink in a little bit: take the
entire water volume of the earth’s oceans,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.530
pour it into a container.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.030
Now double that container.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.869
Now fill that container to the brim with stuff
that’s alive--most of it, microscopic.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.100
But the size isn’t the only impressive thing
about the deep biosphere.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.340
It’s also incredibly diverse, with the scientists
on the project calling it the subterranean

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.219
Galapagos or likening it to the Amazon rainforest.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.409
But we’re not talking monsters like the
Kaiju from Pacific Rim or a Balrog a la Lord

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.409
of the Rings.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.030
The deep biosphere is mostly made up of bacteria
and another kind of single-celled organism

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.390
called archaea--MILLIONS of distinct types,
most of which we’ve never seen before.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.500
We have no idea what they are.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.190
But they’re so plentiful, and so distinct
that scientists think that about 70% of all

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690
of earth’s bacteria and archaea probably
live in the deep biosphere.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.250
Again, that is INSANE--as of 2016, we estimate
that there are around 1 trillion species of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.010
microbes on earth, and scientists think that
99.999 percent of them have yet to be discovered.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.500
And according to this new deep biosphere research,
that trillion microbes that we haven’t even

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.830
been able to begin to classify?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.710
That’s only 30% of the earth’s bacteria.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.820
The rest are underneath us.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.450
Some scientists even call all of this unclassified
life, microbial ‘dark matter’--we know

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.080
that it’s there, we just don’t know what
it is or how it works

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.680
Ok, besides the fact that this is mind-blowingly
awesome and kinda freaky, why are these scientists

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.190
dedicating 10 years of their life to this
research?

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.390
Why is this important?

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.620
Well, the kind of organisms that live in the
deep biosphere are pretty radically different

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.780
from those that live above the surface.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.210
They have to be able to survive with no sunlight,
withstand massive pressures and extreme temperatures

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.990
underneath the oceans or kilometers deep inside
the earth.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.010
Some of them apparently have life-cycles on
geologic time-scales...meaning they reproduce

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.190
and grow in time increments like eras and
epochs, rather than minutes or days.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.350
They get their energy from vastly different
materials than we’re used to, in some cases

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.130
subsisting on nothing more than rock.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.740
All of this is to say--the deep biosphere
is a world of extremes.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.170
With the help of advanced deep ocean and continental
drilling technologies, and the increasing

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.260
accuracy and availability of DNA sequencing,
exploring it will expand our understanding

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480
of our own world and its biodiversity.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.890
Hopefully, investigating the deep unknown
will help us answer the lingering questions

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.200
that this environment poses: did life start
below the surface and migrate up?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.210
Or was it the other way around?

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.950
How does the deep biosphere interact with
and influence the surface biosphere, if at

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.950
all?

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.799
But, perhaps most intriguingly, the Deep Carbon
Observatory has shown us that we have not

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.320
yet discovered the limits for life on our
planet.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.380
The deeper we dig, the more extreme environments
we explore, life is still there, flourishing

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.950
and strange.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.810
And if life here can be so different from
what we have imagined, what might be waiting

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.730
for us on other planets?

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.430
By familiarizing ourselves with the organisms
of extremes here on Earth, we just might know

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.750
a little bit more about what to look for when
we go searching for life elsewhere.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.639
Fun fact: the naturally-occurring organism
that holds the record for living at the hottest

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.920
temperature is Geogemma barossii, a single-celled
organism that lives in hydrothermal vents

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.940
on the seafloor and can grow and reproduce
at 121 degrees celsius.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.680
