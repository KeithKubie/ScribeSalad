00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.680
The other day, I met a friend of mine for brunch,
when she broke the news:

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.320
[high-pitched squealing]
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.280
And though I am genuinely happy for her,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.960
I also felt painfully aware that I have been single
for over a year now.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.800
I know, I know, thank you children, I have fulfilled the prophecy I made so long ago.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.780
But being single for this long has been interesting

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.460
and hard, and terribly lonely,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380
but also awfully fun.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.640
Hanging out with couples used to be...

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640
really... infuriating...

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.029
but now?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.940
I haven't had a human touch in a long time, you guys.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.200
Just let me have this.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.060
I mean yes, every time a friend has gotten engaged, there is a tinge of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.760
And thanks to my doctor, I am also hyper aware that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.160
- Your biological clock is ticking.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.460
- Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
- Woah-woah oh-oh

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.740
- Woah-woah. Oh-oh.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.860
And yes, all my friends my age who are also single are having conversations like

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.280
- Oh, I am definitely freezing my eggos

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.420
- Ugh, that's just so expensive. I think I'm just gonna adopt

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.360
- Adoption is expensive too and also really hard

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.860
- [sighs] I'll just marry a man-child then. I can have both.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.560
[laughs]

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.060
[sighs]

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.220
So in a mini freakout, I tweeted:

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.020
All of my friends are getting engaged, married or having babies, and I'm over here just

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.600
GENUINELY HAPPY FOR THEM BECAUSE I DO NOT COMPARE MY JOURNEY TO ANYONE ELSE'S

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.220
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.980
And I'm doing my best to live by this because, you know, compare and despair,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.630
and the more I embrace that the ends are in the steps I take, the more I'm able to resonate with this.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.769
It was especially enlightening when I was talking to a very happily married friend of mine

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:57.900
It was sort of this like 'I want what you have' situation,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.180
where I was very envious of her stable loving marriage

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.860
and she felt envious of my stable growing career.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.300
We were both looking at what the other had with
so much longing that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.240
we couldn't really appreciate what we had in front of us.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.620
- What are you doing?
- Just hanging out, watching TV with my husband.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.260
- Mmm, man, I'm so jelly. I remember companionship.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.539
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just hanging out with my cat watching TV

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.100
- Ugh, that sounds so great. I remember freedom.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.940
- Wanna trade?
- Wanna trade?

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.400
Plus, I have several friends who also got married,
and had kids

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.520
because they thought it was the right path 
that they should take,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.000
but in hindsight, have realized - perhaps it wasn't necessarily the right path for them at that time.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.840
Sometimes they wish they'd waited longer.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.120
Some feel trapped in unhappy marriages,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.340
and some regret giving up their careers and feel unfulfilled.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.799
And I say this not to highlight their unhappiness,

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.120
but to remind you and myself that it's really easy to look at what someone else has and idealize it.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.880
Whether you're achieving professional success or engaged to your person,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.520
there are still going to be issues to deal with,
feelings to sort through,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.440
and a constant awareness to not take for granted what is right in front of you right now.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.580
I'm Anna Akana, and we're gonna get through this, I hope.
