00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.090
Here's the clique.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.630
Now I had a hard time
finding the clique,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.650
the first time that I looked for it.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.740
But once it was pointed out to me,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.940
it was easy to confirm that
it was indeed a clique.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.040
I just had to check that there was an
edge between every pair of it's members.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.920
And this is precisely the point.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.790
Some problems, like matching for
the dating service, are easy to solve.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.470
Others, like this clique problem,
are hard to solve, but easy to check.
