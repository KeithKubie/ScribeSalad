00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:01.329
- [Voiceover] We're told,

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.412
suppose a+b=2a.

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:10.320
Which of these expressions equals b-a?

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.078
Alright, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.514
and see if you can figure that out.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:14.888
Which of these expressions

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:17.618
would be equal to b-a

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:21.453
and it's going to just involve
some algebraic manipulation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.548
Alright, let's work through this together.

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:25.296
So we are told,

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:30.322
we are told that a+b=2a

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:32.475
so the first thing I would want to do is

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.943
get all my a's in one place

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:36.353
and one way I could do that is

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:39.122
I could subract a from both sides.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:43.684
So if I subtract a from both sides

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:47.438
I'm going to be left with
just a b on the left-hand side

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.192
and on the right-hand side
I'm going to be left with

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:51.793
2a-a, well that's just going to be a.

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:53.755
If I have two of something
and I subtract one of them,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:54.997
take away one of them I'm going to have

00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:57.546
just one of those somethings equal to 1a.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.285
So we want to figure out what b-a is.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.287
Well luckily I can figure that out

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:04.464
if I subtract a from both sides.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.759
So if I subtract a from both sides

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.250
well then I'm going to
get on the left-hand side

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.228
b-a, which is what we want to figure out,

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.304
is equal to a-a=0.

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:22.518
So b-a=0 which is not one of the choices.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:29.336
Alright, so let's see if we can figure out

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:32.076
some other things over here.

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:37.076
So b-a=0 but that is
not one of the choices.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.736
Alright, so let's see is there

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:43.627
any other way to manipulate this?

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:46.631
No, b minu- I could just go straight ahead

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.325
and subtract 2a from both sides

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.805
and I would get b-a=0.

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:53.565
Oh, this is interesting,
this is a tricky one.

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:56.772
So b-a=0.

00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:00.318
Well, if b-a=0 then if we take

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:02.530
the negative of both sides of this,

00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:04.973
if we take the negative of both sides,

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.394
if we multiply both sides by -1.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.263
So x, I should write the times,
I should write like this,

00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:13.285
alright, because we don't want to

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:14.608
confuse it with the variable x,

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:16.663
so if we multiply both sides by -1

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:17.511
what do we get?

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.250
Well on the left-hand side we get a-b

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.678
and on the right-hand side we still get 0.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.788
If b-a=0 then the negative of it,

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.589
which is a-b is also
going to be equal to 0.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.021
And that's this choice.

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:33.707
That is, let me do that
in a little darker color,

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:36.833
that is this choice right over there.

00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:38.493
That was a good one.
