vulnerable half insane creature and
that's that's just an existential truth

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569
that's that's just an existential truth
 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.770
that's that's just an existential truth
and then of course even merely as a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
and then of course even merely as a
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.080

definitely be judged harshly by the
group and so to become aware of your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
group and so to become aware of your
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.869
group and so to become aware of your
nakedness is to become self-conscious

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879
nakedness is to become self-conscious
 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.509
nakedness is to become self-conscious
and and to and to know your limits and

and and to and to know your limits and
 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.699
and and to and to know your limits and
to know your vulnerability and that's

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709
to know your vulnerability and that's
 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.830
to know your vulnerability and that's

that's a very interesting idea and I

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930
that's a very interesting idea and I
 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.450
that's a very interesting idea and I
think it's particularly interesting

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460
think it's particularly interesting

think it's particularly interesting
maybe not particularly interesting but

maybe not particularly interesting but
 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.490
maybe not particularly interesting but
it's it's particularly germane I think

it's it's particularly germane I think
 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.529
it's it's particularly germane I think

Father so to speak because of the
 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.899
Father so to speak because of the
intense criticism that's directed

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909
intense criticism that's directed
 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.110
intense criticism that's directed

exposing its weaknesses and

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380
exposing its weaknesses and
 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.050
exposing its weaknesses and
vulnerabilities and let's say nakedness

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060
vulnerabilities and let's say nakedness
 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.980
vulnerabilities and let's say nakedness
and there's nothing wrong with criticism

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990
and there's nothing wrong with criticism
 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.719
and there's nothing wrong with criticism
but the thing about criticism is the

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729
but the thing about criticism is the
 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.879

purpose of criticism is to separate the

purpose of criticism is to separate the
wheat from the chaff it's not to burn

say well we're going to carefully look
at this we're going to carefully

at this we're going to carefully
 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.330
at this we're going to carefully
differentiate we're going to keep what's

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340
differentiate we're going to keep what's
 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.589
differentiate we're going to keep what's
good and we're going to move away from

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599
good and we're going to move away from
 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.450
good and we're going to move away from
what's bad but the point of the

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460
what's bad but the point of the
 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.700
what's bad but the point of the
criticism isn't to identify everything

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710
criticism isn't to identify everything
 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.459
criticism isn't to identify everything
is bad it's to separate what's good from

is bad it's to separate what's good from
 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.769
is bad it's to separate what's good from
what's bad so that you can retain what's

what's bad so that you can retain what's

good and move towards it and and to be
 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.050
good and move towards it and and to be
careless at that is deadly because

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060
careless at that is deadly because
 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.659
careless at that is deadly because
you're inhabited by the spirit of the

the spirit of the Father and to be
respectful towards that means to

respectful towards that means to
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.570

you're a cultural creation and so Pam

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060
you're a cultural creation and so Pam
 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.350
you're a cultural creation and so Pam
makes this desperate error and is

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360
makes this desperate error and is
 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.700
makes this desperate error and is
careless about exposing himself to the

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710
careless about exposing himself to the
 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.380
careless about exposing himself to the
vulnerability of his father something

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390
vulnerability of his father something
 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.880
vulnerability of his father something
like that he doesn't without sufficient

like that he doesn't without sufficient
 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.540
like that he doesn't without sufficient
respect and the judgment is that not

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550
respect and the judgment is that not
 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.340
respect and the judgment is that not
only will he be a slave but so all of

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.350
only will he be a slave but so all of
 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.100
only will he be a slave but so all of
his descendants and he's contrasted with

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110
his descendants and he's contrasted with
 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.310
his descendants and he's contrasted with
the other two sons who I suppose are

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320
the other two sons who I suppose are
 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.170
the other two sons who I suppose are
willing to give their father the benefit

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180
willing to give their father the benefit
 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.670
willing to give their father the benefit
of the doubt something like that

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680
of the doubt something like that
 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.110
of the doubt something like that
and so when they see him in a

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120
and so when they see him in a
 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.350
and so when they see him in a
compromising position they handle it

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360
compromising position they handle it
 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.440
compromising position they handle it
with respect and and and don't

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450
with respect and and and don't
 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.500
with respect and and and don't
capitalize on it and maybe that makes

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510
capitalize on it and maybe that makes
 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.870
capitalize on it and maybe that makes
them strong that's what it seems to me

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880
them strong that's what it seems to me
 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.210
them strong that's what it seems to me
and so I think that's what that story

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220
and so I think that's what that story
 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.650
and so I think that's what that story
means it has something to do with

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:55.660
means it has something to do with
 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.560
means it has something to do with
respect you know and the funny thing

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570
respect you know and the funny thing
 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.960
respect you know and the funny thing
about having respect for your culture

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970
about having respect for your culture
 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.190
about having respect for your culture
and I suppose that's partly why I'm

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.200
and I suppose that's partly why I'm
 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.560
and I suppose that's partly why I'm
doing the biblical stories is because

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.570
doing the biblical stories is because
 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.850
doing the biblical stories is because
they're part of our they're part of my

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:05.860
they're part of our they're part of my
 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.580
they're part of our they're part of my
culture they're part of our culture

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:08.590
culture they're part of our culture
 

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.469
culture they're part of our culture
perhaps but they're certainly part of my

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479
perhaps but they're certainly part of my
 

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:15.900
perhaps but they're certainly part of my
culture and it seems to me that it's

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:15.910
culture and it seems to me that it's
 

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.760
culture and it seems to me that it's
worthwhile to treat that with respect to

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770
worthwhile to treat that with respect to
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.150
worthwhile to treat that with respect to
see what you can glean from it and and

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.160
see what you can glean from it and and
 

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:32.280
see what you can glean from it and and
not kick it when it's down let's say so

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:32.290
 
 

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.750
 
and so that's how the story of Noah ends

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760
and so that's how the story of Noah ends
 

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.540
and so that's how the story of Noah ends
you know and the thing too is Noah is

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:37.550
you know and the thing too is Noah is
 

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.350
you know and the thing too is Noah is
actually a pretty decent incarnation of

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360
actually a pretty decent incarnation of
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.180
actually a pretty decent incarnation of
the spirit of the Father that which I

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:43.190
the spirit of the Father that which I
 

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.590
the spirit of the Father that which I
suppose is one of the things that makes

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600
suppose is one of the things that makes
 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.510
suppose is one of the things that makes
hams misstep more egregious is that I

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:49.520
hams misstep more egregious is that I
 

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.550
hams misstep more egregious is that I
mean Noah just built an ark and got

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560
mean Noah just built an ark and got
 

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.230
mean Noah just built an ark and got
everybody through the flood man you know

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240
everybody through the flood man you know
 

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.780
everybody through the flood man you know
it's not so bad and so maybe the fact

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.790
it's not so bad and so maybe the fact
 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.190
it's not so bad and so maybe the fact
that he happened to drink too much wine

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200
that he happened to drink too much wine
 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.100
that he happened to drink too much wine
one day wasn't enough to justify

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.110
one day wasn't enough to justify
 

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.550
one day wasn't enough to justify
humiliating him and you know I don't

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560
humiliating him and you know I don't
 

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.350
humiliating him and you know I don't
think it's pushing the limits of

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360
think it's pushing the limits of
 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.200
think it's pushing the limits of
symbolic interpretation to note on a

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.210
symbolic interpretation to note on a
 

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.150
symbolic interpretation to note on a
daily basis that we're all contained in

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160
daily basis that we're all contained in
 

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.420
daily basis that we're all contained in
an ark right and that's the ark that you

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.430
an ark right and that's the ark that you
 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.950
an ark right and that's the ark that you
could think about that as the Ark that's

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:14.960
could think about that as the Ark that's
 

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.450
could think about that as the Ark that's
being bequeathed to us by our

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:16.460
being bequeathed to us by our
 

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.390
being bequeathed to us by our
forefathers that's the tremendous

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:19.400
forefathers that's the tremendous
 

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.000
forefathers that's the tremendous
infrastructure that we inhabit that we

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.010
infrastructure that we inhabit that we
 

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.010
infrastructure that we inhabit that we
take for granted because it works so

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:24.020
take for granted because it works so
 

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.410
take for granted because it works so
well that protects us from things that

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420
well that protects us from things that
 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.630
well that protects us from things that
we can't even imagine and we don't have

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640
we can't even imagine and we don't have
 

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.980
we can't even imagine and we don't have
to imagine because we're so well

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:29.990
to imagine because we're so well
 

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.740
to imagine because we're so well
protected and so one of the things

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:32.750
protected and so one of the things
 

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.810
protected and so one of the things
that's really struck me hard I would say

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:34.820
that's really struck me hard I would say
 

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.630
that's really struck me hard I would say
about the disintegration and corruption

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640
about the disintegration and corruption
 

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.790
about the disintegration and corruption
of the universities is the absolute

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800
of the universities is the absolute
 

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.640
of the universities is the absolute
ingratitude that goes along with that

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.650
ingratitude that goes along with that
 

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.180
ingratitude that goes along with that
you know what

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.190
you know what
 

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.000
you know what
criticism as I said it's a fine thing if

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.010
criticism as I said it's a fine thing if

criticism as I said it's a fine thing if
it's done in the spirit in a proper

it's done in the spirit in a proper
 

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.470
it's done in the spirit in a proper
spirit and that's the spirit of

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480
spirit and that's the spirit of
 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.480
spirit and that's the spirit of
separating the wheat from the chaff but

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:52.490
separating the wheat from the chaff but
 

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.100
separating the wheat from the chaff but
it needs to be accompanied by gratitude

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.110
it needs to be accompanied by gratitude
 

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.860
it needs to be accompanied by gratitude
and it does seem to me that anyone who

and it does seem to me that anyone who
 

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.370
and it does seem to me that anyone who
lives in in the West in the West culture

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380
lives in in the West in the West culture
 

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.180
lives in in the West in the West culture
