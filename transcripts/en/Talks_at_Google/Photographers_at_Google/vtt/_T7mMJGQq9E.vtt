LAURIE: Welcome to
Photographers at Google.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.100
And we're very pleased to have
Tamara Lackey with us today.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.160
She is going to be
discussing embracing

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.610
self-consciousness, authentic
expression in portrait

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.950
photography.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.660
Now she is a keynote speaker,
a fantastic photographer.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.730
She's been on the Martha Stewart
Show, Extreme Makeover, Home

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.700
Edition, NBC's Today
Show, and she's also

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.830
been in many publications
including "O" magazine, "Men's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.090
Journal," "Parenting"
magazine, and she's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.220
the author of four books.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.530
I got the pleasure of
interviewing her about a month

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.940
ago, and we are kindred
spirits, I would say.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.050
I love her photography.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.100
She actually photographs
children and portrait

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.107
photography, and
it's breathtaking.

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.190
We have different types
of photography that we do,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910
but I think we connected
because photography

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.800
is about capturing that moment,
and she does it so well.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.239
And I'm so pleased to be able
to present Tamara Lackey.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.530
Please give her a warm welcome.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.940
TAMARA LACKEY:
Thank you very much.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.110
That was very
verklempt, that intro.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.080
Thank you.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.520
And thank you, Laurie, for
putting all these talks

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.030
together.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.710
For inviting me.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.460
For all your work.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.300
I really appreciate it.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.326
And congratulations to all
of you for working here.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:20.510
I just did a mini-tour
of the campus,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.110
and we had an incredible lunch.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.140
And, wow, what a
wonderful place to be.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.080
I'm truly honored
to be invited here.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.300
I have been shooting now
for more than 11 years,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.315
professionally.

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:35.440
Obviously, I photographed
people a lot before that,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.700
but they were horrible,
horrible pictures.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.070
And in that time, I've shot
thousands of portraits.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.880
And I've come to
realize that I wanted

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.020
to speak on this subject.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.120
When Laurie said, what
do you want to speak on?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.330
I kind of thought about
a lot of the topics

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.280
I do talk about, which has to do
with photography, and business,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.540
and even work/life balance,
and the idea of how

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.697
you pull all this together.

00:01:57.697 --> 00:01:59.530
But what stood out to
me, when I was looking

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.820
through a lot of
my favorite images,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.560
is this idea, Embracing
Self-Consciousness.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.240
Every single shoot I've
done, professionally--

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.430
and that's children, adults,
well-known celebrities,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.990
athletes-- there's
been self-consciousness

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.100
that's been a part of it.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.880
Every single one.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.470
So how many people
here would say

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.920
that you recognize
that on your shoots?

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.090
I should actually wait.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.040
How many people here
are photographers?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.780
Most of you.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.820
And how many people
have been in a situation

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.490
where you're either lifting the
camera or being photographed,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.500
and you feel that sense
of self-consciousness?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.000
Yes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.190
OK.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.689
Good.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.550
I'm in the right room.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.290
And the reason that
stands out to me

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.860
is because, even though I
think all these other facets

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.140
of photography are so
important-- color balance,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.400
proper exposure, metering,
foreground, background,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.830
everything-- it's everything
about the entirety of the look

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.090
on someone's face that
matters to me the most.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.240
And the reason
for that is that I

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.980
believe that expression is
the conduit to connection.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.740
I think expression is the
conduit towards connection.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.690
And feeling
disconnected, feeling

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.420
like you're not connecting
with other people, for me,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.230
is one of the worst parts
of being a human being.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.980
That feeling of aloneness.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.540
Now when I talk
about being alone,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.805
I don't mean having a cup
of tea and taking a bath,

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:24.180
and shutting the
door and saying,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.780
everybody leave me alone.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.490
That's an amazing feeling.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.647
I mean the feeling
of aloneness you have

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:32.230
when you're in a
crowded room, and you

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.620
feel like you can't
communicate with other people.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.750
You can't connect to them.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.870
That you're not
feeling understood.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.280
That's that feeling that's
the lack of connection.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.230
And so I look for
expression because I

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.190
think it's that
conduit to connection.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.960
So how do you find expression
that feels real and honest,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.880
when you're photographing people
who are feeling self-conscious?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.470
And you're bringing
self-consciousness

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.450
to the table.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.920
How do you put someone at ease?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.116
So to begin with,
when I'm talking

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:01.740
about self-consciousness,
let's discuss

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.680
the sensation a little bit.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.779
Can anybody here give
a very good example

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.320
of the time they
felt self-conscious?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.497
Come on.

00:04:11.497 --> 00:04:14.980
AUDIENCE: Right now, or being
in front of [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.136
TAMARA LACKEY: When
you've been where I am?

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:17.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.085
And even-- and
also me, right now.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.270
TAMARA LACKEY: Yes.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.960
Or a time when you are going
for the job of your dreams.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.924
Something that you
think would be amazing.

00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:30.340
And you're standing
there in front

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.555
of the interviewer,
the person who

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:33.346
is going to make the
call on whether or not

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:34.910
you get that job of your dreams.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.826
And for a moment, they're
just looking at you,

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:38.000
and they're evaluating you.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.255
And you feel kind of
naked and exposed.

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.760
Hopefully not literally naked.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.010
But exposed.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.600
That feeling,
that's the sensation

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.720
of self-consciousness.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.010
Or you're on a
date, and you feel

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.620
like, god, I've seen
a lot of people.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.950
And this one, there's
something about them

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.950
that I feel like this
could really be something.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.660
And if we could get past
this jangle of nerves

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.700
and awkwardness, this could
really be something significant

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.980
for the rest of my life.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.940
But in that moment, where
it feels just uncomfortable,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.950
that's the sensation
of self-consciousness.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.550
Or when you've had a dozen
portraits taken yourself,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.160
and they all are horrible.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.001
They're terrible.

00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:12.250
They don't represent you well.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.699
You don't feel
like you look good.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.240
You feel like you
spend a lot of time

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.100
online de-tagging yourself.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.700
And you're sitting down to have
your portrait taken one more

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.360
time.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.680
That feeling is
self-consciousness.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.750
It's how do I appear?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.760
How do I look?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.170
How am I doing?

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.690
How am I coming across
in this situation?

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.620
So I believe that the job
of a portrait photographer

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.200
starts with making other
people feel at ease.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.370
Actively trying to use
thoughts, feelings, and energy

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.470
to eliminating discomfort.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.020
So how do you put
somebody at ease?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.290
It depends on three factors.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.710
One, who the person is.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.940
Two, how long you
need them at ease.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.320
This is the coolest
part of photography.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.780
I'll get back to
that in a second.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.530
And three, who you are.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.176
So who the person is.

00:06:01.176 --> 00:06:03.050
If you're dealing with
someone who just feels

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.500
a little bit uncomfortable, all
you need to bring to the table

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.040
is some calming energy to
slow the situation down,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.640
some distraction
techniques, and you're good.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.360
You do more than
that, and you're

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.420
going to make someone
feel more uncomfortable.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.670
In a situation
like this, where I

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.150
have two brothers who are
very different individuals.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.950
And I want to have them at ease
with each other and with me.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.950
I know that I've got to
deal with a few things.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.450
First and foremost,
I've got to deal

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.160
with a child who thinks
it's hilarious to never look

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.320
at the camera.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.000
Has anybody
photographed this child?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.747
I also need to deal with his
brother, who's not sure of me,

00:06:43.747 --> 00:06:45.330
not sure of the
situation, and doesn't

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.530
want to be photographed
in the first place.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.280
And before I can get this
moment here of the two of them

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.590
together, I have to set them up.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.160
I've got to have a sharp
side of a reflector just out

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.540
of the frame on this
gray, rainy day,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.930
shining just the perfect
amount of fill light on them.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.892
I've got to set them in a
pose that I think starts

00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:04.350
out a little stilted,
but then they

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.490
turn it into something that's
a lot more comfortable.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.579
And I have to get them engaged
with each other and with me,

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.120
because I'm the one
holding the lens,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.360
and once they're
comfortable with me,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.443
they're going to be
comfortable-looking to anybody

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:17.870
who views this image later.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.990
But I can't do any
of that if I have

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.106
them feeling uncomfortable.

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.980
So first and foremost,
I've got to figure out

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.520
how to get them at ease with me.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.520
Another type of person
that you might photograph

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.895
is the person who
feels like they

00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:34.250
know exactly what to do once
the camera is trained on them.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.951
They're just going
to do their thing.

00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:37.200
And you get this a lot, right?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.500
That kind of cheese look.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.490
That preconditioned response.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.110
And that's why I
never say things

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.505
like, say cheese or smile.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.130
Because I feel like people will
bring something that they think

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.330
works.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.710
And if you just spend a
little bit of extra time,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.610
employ some
distraction techniques,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.290
you get something authentic.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.800
And it's worth the wait.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.260
But it often takes a
little bit of time.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.650
Some good-natured prompting.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.520
One of the things I try
never to do with my subjects

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.450
is use negative terminology.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.400
I try to not ever say something
like, God, that is not working.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.430
That does not look good.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.830
Don't do that again.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.940
We'll start with,
great, fantastic,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.560
it's amazing what
you just did there.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.240
Let's try this.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.940
Let's try this.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.980
And then slowly, we
work our way through.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.460
What else does it depend
on, putting someone at ease?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.840
Depends on the amount of
time you need them at ease.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.530
This, for me, is the
coolest part of photography.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.070
All I ever need to
make a great photograph

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.500
is literally a
fraction of a second.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.179
That's it.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.654
I can create a great
collection of portraits

00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:39.320
by having a fraction of a second
here and a fraction of a second

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.820
there.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.010
And that's all I need.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.780
And that takes so much
pressure off of me

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.240
when I get into
a situation where

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.236
I feel kind of
uncomfortable, or I

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:48.860
feel like it's going
to be a challenge,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.100
and I don't know what to do.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.780
So, to me, the idea of
taking all that pressure off

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.040
is fantastic.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.380
Because the other individual
you'll come up against

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.000
is the one who is overwhelmed
by the energy of the situation,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.820
or finds it torturous
to be photographed.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.630
And if I just need one
second, one moment where

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.400
he can lift his eyes
towards me, and I

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.020
can get one shot where his
eyes are the widest they are,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.570
I've done my job.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.070
This was literally
that situation.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.044
I'm in my studio.

00:09:17.044 --> 00:09:18.460
This little boy
is a very nervous.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.940
He won't look up at all.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.710
I'm on the back wall
with my 7200 lens.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.720
And I got one click.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.310
It was this click, before
he went back down again.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.770
And that's the cover
of my first book.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.560
So to me, that's
a really big deal.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.750
I only need one second.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.280
That moment just after
the toddler has a tantrum

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.990
and just after he
falls over the dog,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.330
you get that one shot
before you aid the child.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.860
That's all I need.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.610
By the way, no
animals or children

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.510
were harmed in the making
of this photograph.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.200
I think that when you give
it that extra second, when

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.730
you realize I don't need this
to be a great experience all

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.140
the way through, if you watch
sometimes, my shoots on video,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.570
it kind of looks like,
is she getting anything?

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.510
I know I'm getting things here
and there, but on the whole,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.750
it may not look like that.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.416
You only need a
hair-breadth of a second

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:16.200
to get something
richer than what

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.740
they are giving you before.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.330
And it may not last long.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.760
Which brings me
to my next point.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.125
These images don't need to be
full of laughter and joyful.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.650
And they don't
need to be smiles.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.770
And they don't even need
to be dramatic or powerful.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.712
They may not last very long,
and you need to be ready.

00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:36.170
This is where the technical
proficiency of the photographer

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.500
comes into place.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.940
I always make sure I
have everything set up

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.882
before I even think
about expression.

00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:43.340
And that means I
have the lighting,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.700
I have the composition,
I've got the framing.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.410
I know that in any given moment,
I might get what I want to get.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.110
I get all the
little details done

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.290
in terms of face-leaking,
snot, the things that

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.730
happen with children.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.310
I make sure all of that is
taken care of, so at the moment

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.850
the shot happens, the expression
is there, and I get it.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.440
I'm happy.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.060
But otherwise, the
amount of times

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.470
that I'll witness in workshops
or mentoring sessions, where

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.880
I'll watch a photographer
and something unbelievable

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.300
has unfolded, and they don't
have a camera even near them,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.090
or it's down hanging
around their neck.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.450
I'm always holding it up here.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.760
We'll share a bit
of that in a second.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.650
The last part, the question of
how you put someone at ease.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.760
It depends on who you are.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.160
I strongly suggest
that anybody here

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.630
who's a portrait photographer
or wants to become a better

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.270
portrait photographer spend
some serious time trying

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.420
to figure out what's
going on in your own head.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.370
I think we'll get to
that a little bit more,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.282
about self-awareness.

00:11:41.282 --> 00:11:43.490
But these are the factors
I care about the most, when

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.360
it comes to putting
someone at ease.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.100
Who the person is, the amount
of time I need them to ease,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.580
and what I'm bringing
to the table.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.680
What I can help my
subject transcend,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.490
or what I can worsen, if
I'm not paying attention.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.480
When I have the chance
to photograph President

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.210
Obama, who's not a child,
I had the experience

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.320
of being with
someone who was very

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.360
comfortable in every situation.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.757
That's part of what
you'll find sometimes.

00:12:08.757 --> 00:12:11.340
That someone who already brings
great expression to the table,

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.660
because they're already very
comfortable with who they are.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.500
I had, I think, 1/125
of a second with him.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.880
And I had a speed light bounced
off the wall next to us.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.120
And I'm shooting this at a 4/5.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.030
In this rare case, the
subject was significantly less

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.200
self-conscious than I was.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.380
When I'm photographing two women
that I found very impressive,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.510
Michelle Obama and
Maya Angelou, I

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.260
had about five minutes of time.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.920
And I'm sitting
there photographing

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.010
one woman I greatly admire, and
another woman whose poetry I'd

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.634
been gobbling up
since my childhood.

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:49.050
The woman who wrote, "When
someone shows you who they are,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.101
believe them the first time."

00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:53.100
And she also wrote, "I'm
grateful to be a woman.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.523
I must have done something
great in another life."

00:12:55.523 --> 00:12:56.290
I like that.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.680
Oh.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.370
Lots of men in the room.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.400
Just noticed that.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.150
So I see these two women
looking back at me,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.105
and I recognize that
the only person who

00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:11.830
is going to screw
this shot up is me.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.997
Because they are composed.

00:13:12.997 --> 00:13:13.830
They look beautiful.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.110
Again, I have a
speed light on this.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.630
I'm shooting at ISO 800, 1/125
of a second, 3/5 aperture.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.880
Everything is kind of set up.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.770
And the only thing
that's going to go wrong

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.100
is if I can't stay natural
and engaging with them.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.150
When I'm photographing Hillary
Clinton, this was about,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.280
I think, 10 minutes of time
that I had alone with her.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.770
And she'd just left
a press pit, where

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.804
she'd been smiling
for quite some time.

00:13:40.804 --> 00:13:42.470
And if you've ever
photographed somebody

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.390
who's done the smile
for a very long time,

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.950
it's really hard to
get them refreshed

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.540
and get that smile
back in their eyes.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.050
No matter how well-trained
they are at facing a camera.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.880
And it wasn't-- I think I had
about eight or nine frames that

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.380
I took.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.000
And it wasn't until
this very last one

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.177
where that smile finally
got back into the eyes.

00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:02.760
It's not always a
home run that you're

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.070
going to capture a very natural
expression with someone who's

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.260
very comfortable
with themselves.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.560
There's all the other
factors of how they're doing.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.090
But at the end of
the day, it was

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.870
me who needed to get
comfortable in this situation

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.010
and bring some ease back to her.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.860
The reason I feel like it's very
important to manage yourself

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.410
in these situations is
one of my favorite quotes,

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.090
"It's hard to fight an enemy
who has outposts in your head."

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.050
For us, as portrait
photographers,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.540
our nerves, our
awkwardness, our temptation

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.680
to get lost in the technical
details of what's going on,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.800
can help us miss the subject
that's right in front of us

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.850
and leave them
feeling very alone.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.015
I think these issues are the
little outposts in our head,

00:14:44.015 --> 00:14:46.010
as portrait photographers.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.440
All that being said,
most of the time,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.120
I'm the one managing the
fears, and the awkwardness,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.230
and the pure discontent
of some of my subjects.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.630
He doesn't want to be here.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.562
He doesn't want me to be there.

00:14:58.562 --> 00:15:02.110
But, to me, this is a successful
image because it's real,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.050
it's authentic.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.290
It doesn't have to be the
perfect smile every time.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.170
It just has to be real.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.460
Most of us would recognize
a huge difference

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.870
between this image-- this is a
pained, strained, sweet, sweet

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.980
effort of a nine-year-old boy.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.880
And this image, where it's
relaxed and comfortable.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.699
What would you say, outside
of the obvious, one looks

00:15:24.699 --> 00:15:26.740
like an uncomfortable
smile and one doesn't, what

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.490
would you say is the difference
here between these two images?

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.370
One person who's comfortable.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.330
AUDIENCE: The second one
is a neutral posture.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.240
TAMARA LACKEY: The second one
has a more neutral posture.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.740
Yep.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.570
And his body feels more relaxed.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.858
Anybody else?

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:44.844
AUDIENCE: Distance
from the subject.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.510
TAMARA LACKEY: Distance
to subject, yes.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.770
So the two major things there.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.550
One, he was so aware
of the lens that it

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.180
was breaking any ability
for him to be comfortable.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.130
So what I had to do was pull
the lens away from my face,

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.170
step backwards, switch to--
actually, in this case,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.510
I switched angles and lenses.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.240
And that's actually one of
the techniques I employ often.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.440
I switch my distance
to subject and lenses

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.260
as much to manage things
like perspective distortion

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.840
or focal length as I do to
give my subjects space from me.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.800
To give them a break from me.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.430
And sometimes I
find I have to do it

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.810
the other way, where
I need to get closer.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.280
That they want more nearness
to feel more comfortable.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.089
But that is something
I often think

00:16:28.089 --> 00:16:29.630
about when I'm
choosing my equipment.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.830
It's not just, what will
this do for me technically,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.230
but how will this be able
to engage my subject better.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.570
I think one of the biggest
bonuses of being a portrait

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.210
photographer that
I have found is

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.070
that we are training
ourselves to find

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.830
more beauty in our subjects.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.590
And that means the
angle the head,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.590
the way they're lit, all
that sort of thing, sure.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.490
But it also has to
do with how do you

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.480
make someone look their best?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.410
How do you make them
shine and feel more lively

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.590
and seem more engaged?

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.600
And how do you interact in
a way that brings them out?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.690
To me, it's kind of difficult
to think that you do that,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.297
but pretty much stop once
you put the camera down.

00:17:08.297 --> 00:17:10.130
Like it's like the job's
over because you've

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.470
lowered the lens.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.440
I think that you've
trained yourself not only

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.460
to see people's better
angles, but their better

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.270
moments in the
rest of your life.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.258
And that's been just
such a huge perk,

00:17:19.258 --> 00:17:20.674
for me as a portrait
photographer,

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:24.390
that that skill doesn't go
away because we lower the lens.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.420
You start to recognize that
people's self-consciousness

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.650
appear in all kinds of ways.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.220
Appear as like awkwardness,
and sometimes cattiness,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.250
even cruelty,
silence over talking.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.270
And the odd amount
of ways we clumsily

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.730
navigate our own
feelings, when people

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.770
are paying a lot of attention
to us, and we feel off.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.460
This question, so what
do you want from me?

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.400
Is pretty much what most
people ask when you lift a lens

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.699
and you point it at their face.

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:56.990
They may not say that out loud.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.823
Although some people
literally will be like,

00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:00.870
what do you want from me?

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.540
Most of the time,
they don't say that.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.751
That pained, strained
expression on that boy's face,

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.750
that's what he's asking.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.510
What do you want from me?

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.260
How does this go?

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.570
What do I do now?

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.900
Even well-trained,
professional models,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.830
who have been perfectly trained
on how to pose, and look,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.330
and turn this and that
way, don't necessarily

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.700
have what it takes to
bring warmth and engagement

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.430
and spirit to a shoot.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.830
I recently had a great
time down in Puerto Rico.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.280
I was able to bring my whole
family, which was wonderful.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.170
This was about six
or seven weeks ago.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.650
Photographing this
professional model

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.210
for a spa and cosmetics company.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.170
And there were about
10 of us all together.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.387
I think we came from about
four different states.

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:42.220
Down to Puerto Rico.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.850
Specifically chose that
location for the waterfall.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.830
They have a product company
that deals with fresh waters

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.300
and healing waters,
and they wanted

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.510
to have this kind of
look for the campaign.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.540
So we all come down
from all these places,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:01.140
and we hike two miles down from
the rain forest, El Yunque.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.020
And we hit these waterfalls.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.350
And it's the model, myself, the
client, all my gear, the outfit

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.450
changes, our assistants,
stylists, etc.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.800
We all get down to the
spot, we start shooting.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.110
We've got a beautiful woman.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.950
We've got beautiful posing,
a beautiful location.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.860
And what we're starting out
with is this kind of look.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.610
This kind of look.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.210
This trained model.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.950
And she's beautiful.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.910
But what she's giving us is
these kind of fill-in-the-blank

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.710
expressions.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.390
The look that she's
been trained to give.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.780
What my client wanted was
warm, welcoming, friendly,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.170
approachable.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.470
And we were having a
big disconnect right out

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.229
of the gate.

00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:43.520
Not just right out of the gate.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.300
Quite a ways into the shoot.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.670
Where she looked lovely,
the location looked lovely,

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.775
but it was missing the
whole feel of all the ad

00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:53.860
words in their campaign.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.050
So what we had to do was
move from sexy to soft.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.750
From this fill-in-the-blank to
sweet, warm, and approachable.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.860
And what I found while
I was shooting her,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.050
all the thought I have about
self-consciousness when

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.120
it comes to people who
aren't trained to be models

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.820
is that self-consciousness
doesn't always

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.000
look like self-consciousness.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.270
So we stopped, and we took
a break, and we rehearsed.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.880
We slowed down, and
we kept emptying her

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.550
of these empty looks.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.151
If that makes sense.

00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:24.900
Literally, no, no.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.400
Stop.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.910
Too sexy.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.481
Stop it.

00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:27.980
Breathe.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.710
Let's start again.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.470
And what she found was
that warm and approachable

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.800
requires her to dig a lot
deeper than this steely kind

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.170
of open jaw look.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.970
And we got to it.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.590
We got smile.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.298
We got welcoming.

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:41.960
We got warmth.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.780
She laughed, and we all
genuinely enjoyed the shoot.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.880
And my client was thrilled with
the images we were getting.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.110
We ended up getting a
lot of natural looks.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.180
Enough to meet the entire
campaign for the year.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.760
But it didn't
start out that way.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.090
It didn't start
anything like natural,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.550
when all we were
going for was natural.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.390
Self-consciousness
doesn't always

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.390
look like self-consciousness.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.940
So we know what it feels
like, that sensation

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.100
that we talked about,
self-consciousness.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.280
And we know what
it can look like,

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.880
the various ways it shows up.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.140
But what exactly is
self-consciousness?

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.280
We start out baby, toddler-hood
finally recognizing

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.150
that the person in the
mirror is actually--

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.710
thanks for staying--
the person in the mirror

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.900
is actually not someone
perfectly mimicking us.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.400
It takes a while
to figure that out.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.340
That this is actually ourselves.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.180
That we're a stand-alone
thing in the world.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.960
We stand apart.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.960
We can actually see
ourselves reflected back

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.350
at this very early age.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.122
That standalone thing, I
think, is pretty fascinating.

00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:49.830
Because back to the
beginning of my talk,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.920
I talk about what I think is
one of the worst parts of being

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.900
human, that feeling of standing
apart, and standing alone,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.560
and feeling like
you can't connect.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.040
The reason why I
think expression

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.120
is so vastly important.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.970
This idea of self-consciousness
starts very early

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.370
as just a recognition.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.940
But as we move into it, as
babies, that same question of,

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.920
what do you want from me
starts out with, who are you

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.980
and why are you here?

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.550
And to be able to work through
the self-consciousness that

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:25.150
even comes at this age means
putting someone at ease.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.230
One of the techniques
I use often,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.630
if you look right here with the
camera and my face, is I hardly

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.890
ever have it up
to my eyes when I

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.430
know I'm working with a young
child, because all I'll do

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.900
is block connection.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.050
I frequently am here,
here, here, here, and over.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.580
And this works wonders with
having someone look back

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.330
at you, and look very
friendly and engaged.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.534
The other thing I do often is
I hold my camera down here.

00:22:50.534 --> 00:22:52.450
Even when I'm not shooting,
it's at the ready.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.991
And I'll pull it up
in just a second.

00:22:53.991 --> 00:22:57.620
But a lot of my
shoots are like this.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.530
So with children this age,
their self-consciousness

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.010
is more focused on understanding
that technically they

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.300
stand apart, and they know
that their image is actually

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.010
themselves, but they're
not interested in getting

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.240
their image photographed.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.850
That's why containment
is so important.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.180
Looking at this pose,
what do you see here?

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:21.330
This pose, what is one of the
main things you see mom doing?

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.000
Containing the child.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.540
Look at all the ways, too.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.090
We've got both legs pulled back.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.840
We've got the belly pulled in.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.850
We literally have the elbow
pulling the shoulder back.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.380
This is a pure
containment thing.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.990
And the only reason
mom's got her legs

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.640
crossed is so we can mirror
it, and make it look more

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.530
like a pose and
less like a jailing.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.780
That's it.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.070
The other reason we have
mom's legs pulled back,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.710
and I think about
this a lot, is I'm

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.570
shooting from a
lower angle, and I'm

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.770
shooting with a wider
lens-- I think in this case

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.530
I'm shooting with probably a
24 millimeter focal length--

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.370
and because I'm right down, if
her legs are out in any way,

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.190
they look huge.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.939
Because they're right
up against the lens.

00:23:58.939 --> 00:24:00.659
So I'm constantly
having, depending

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:02.450
on the angle I'm shooting
from, making sure

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.580
that people tuck legs
and lean back and such.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.780
Another great example, we have
this one and two-year-old boy

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.910
in my studio.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.179
They're brothers.

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:12.470
They're extraordinarily grumpy.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.660
They don't want to be there.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.490
Mom really wanted to have
the session in a studio,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.040
so we did that.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.200
But I'm using another device
to basically contain them.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.190
In this case, it's these two
four-by-eight foam boards,

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.760
these art boards, that are
taped together, normally

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.730
to reflect light
back on my subjects.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.410
Here, we've turned them into
interplanetary, alien-operated

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.060
trapping devices.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.050
And Dad is managing the hatch.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.180
And whereas before, we
were getting really grumpy,

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.680
didn't want to be
there, didn't want

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.280
to stand there, just really
flat expressions, now they're

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.050
completely off the
studio backdrop.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.150
I've pulled the soft box over
into our trapping device,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.330
and as Dad let each one of
them run out and run free,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.440
I'm getting this expression from
them as they're running out.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.660
The change in the set,
the change in the game,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.770
the change in mood
changed everything

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.050
about their expressions.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.680
Another great technique
I use for containment

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.940
is physically kicking
my subjects back

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.070
into place underneath me.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.516
It's not as violent
as it sounds.

00:25:11.516 --> 00:25:14.770
I actually shared this image
with Laurie for our Women

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.360
in Google Photography Series.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.270
But that's what I'm
doing with these.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.670
I'm shooting directly over them.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.960
I'm literally taking each
leg and kicking them back.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.250
And I'm shooting with
a 35 millimeter lens.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.220
And they find it hilarious
that some stranger

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.420
is kicking them, which is how
I get the expressions I get.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.670
We moved from that
into this next stage.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.830
Ages four through eight--
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.120
sometimes nine.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.010
This stage is huge.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.490
And if you ever were a
child, if you know a child,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.030
if you have a child,
you know this stage,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.694
which is all about watch me.

00:25:48.694 --> 00:25:50.610
This is when you're at
the pool, and someone's

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.760
going to go up the
diving board, and it

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.660
doesn't count unless
someone's watching.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.160
Right?

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.368
Or across the monkey bars,
and you hear watch, watch,

00:25:56.368 --> 00:25:57.350
watch, watch, watch.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.620
This is the "watch me" stage.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.730
And even the very
shy, reserved child

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.280
has elements of this in their
personality at this age.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.230
It's very natural.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.820
So this idea of putting
on a show, pulling out

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.620
poses, pulling out ideas,
they want to show you,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.380
and they want to see
what it looks like.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.590
We have the back of
the camera trained

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.590
kind of mentality going on.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.210
So it's watch me,
notice me, look at me.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.660
And my subjects are
forming themselves

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.490
into something worth watching.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.590
That's what they're doing.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.760
They think, I'm going to
put something together

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.950
that's worth watching.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.800
And that's what I get
a lot of at this age.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.340
One of the things that's
fantastic about that is you

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.140
get this amazing engagement
if you play along.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.140
And you go ahead and you
goad them, and say, OK.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.170
Well, can you do this?

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.950
Show me if you can do this.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.902
And I find myself
saying things like, I'll

00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:45.860
lay flat on the ground.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.651
Jump right over me.

00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.184
Try not to kick my head.

00:26:49.184 --> 00:26:50.850
Sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.558
This is a perfect
example of another time

00:26:52.558 --> 00:26:55.090
like, if you reach me before I
leave, you can knock me over.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.790
And you can knock me over hard.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.120
That's the shot I got.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.850
Again, 35, 1/4 lens right
before I did get knocked down.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.430
In desperate situations,
I'll say if you can catch me,

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.430
you can put leaves in my
hair or sand in my hair.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.920
Or anything that's nearby.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.547
This is a perfect
example of that.

00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:14.130
He reached me.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.088
I got the great shot I
wanted right beforehand.

00:27:16.088 --> 00:27:19.880
And these like dried-out,
clean leaves, these were awful.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.130
These don't come out after
one, two, three showers.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.690
They're just in there.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.550
But basically what
they're saying

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.180
is watch me be something
worth watching.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.020
That's what this
whole age is about.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.520
There's a lot of
people who probably

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.900
argue that social media
extends this stage for us.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.070
For quite some time.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.910
But that's the discussion
for another platform.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.470
And either way, it's often
very present at the stage.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.724
So engagement's funny.

00:27:48.724 --> 00:27:49.640
Watch me do something.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.970
That's funny.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.900
How do you move
past that to create

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.720
stronger portraits at this age?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.330
So you get this.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.130
You get the watch me do
something sort of thing.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.370
Then you find out
who they are and what

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.215
particular distractions
will work for them.

00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:04.590
And it's different
for everybody.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.627
Some people are very
interested in things

00:28:07.627 --> 00:28:08.710
that peak their curiosity.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.751
Some people are interested
in facts, and details,

00:28:10.751 --> 00:28:14.180
and numbers, and saying
something rapidly in Spanish.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.690
Some people are
interested in you,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.700
if you can be
interesting enough.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.370
You move beyond that, and
then you bring in humor.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.050
And you get that natural smile
that you wanted all along,

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.040
but you kind of
have to start there.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.880
This is a really
natural pattern for me.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.830
It comes up time and time again.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.840
The idea of, what
do you want from me?

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.750
Let's be silly.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.500
Let's respond in a fun way.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.990
And then the authentic look.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.400
Even really shy children--
I keep going back to this

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.380
because I feel like
the whole stage sounds

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.590
like all these kids are
playing and racing around,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.210
and we all know children
who don't do that.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.030
They're quieter, they're
softer, they're more reserved.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:55.140
So even the shy child who
shows more vulnerability,

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.540
they're still wondering
that same sort of question.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.310
What is it that
you want from me?

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.750
What am I supposed to do?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.980
And there's some beauty
in that delicate look.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.980
There's so much beauty in that.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.480
If I want to elicit
the very shy smile,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.470
I may get it for that fraction
of a second we talked about.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.930
How long you need it.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.860
And this is another
great example

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.731
of a time where I'm holding
the camera over here,

00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:20.730
and she's looking at me.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.960
The way she is looking
is at me, at my face,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.109
but the camera's all
the way over here.

00:29:25.109 --> 00:29:27.150
And all I'm doing is
ensuring that I'm setting up

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.270
the composition so that her
eyes skim across the frame.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.590
So it's a more natural
framing of the subject.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.910
But I have this sweet look
that I get, and it doesn't

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.930
last long, but
that's all I need.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.880
This is another
time where I'm doing

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.320
the exact same sort of thing.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.820
I'm actually running with
her, through the leaves,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.910
and the camera is at my waist.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.210
Completely at my waist.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.120
Her expression,
she's looking at me.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.856
Her eyes are meeting my eyes.

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:55.280
I'm taller than her.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.767
And I'm shooting,
and I'm maxing--

00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:58.850
this is later in the day,
so the light's dropping,

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.810
so I'm maxing my ISO.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.490
Something like a
5,000, I think is

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.030
what I've got, on a Nikon D4.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.040
Thank you for making
those ISO capabilities.

00:30:08.846 --> 00:30:11.220
The sensitivity
of ISO in cameras

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.090
has allowed me so
much more flexibility

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.120
with fast-moving subjects,
because now I can constantly

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.260
pop my shutter speed up
without additive light.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.780
It's fantastic.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.590
So I think I'm at about a
5,000 ISO and a 5/0 aperture,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.030
because I want to keep her
in focus as we're moving.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.390
I'm shooting this with
the 24/70/28 lens, which

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.270
is the lens I always grab when
I'm on the move with children.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.640
And I want to keep up with her.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.930
And I want that playfulness.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.890
And I want that kind of
performance and that silliness.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.975
And this is a lot of how I get
it when I'm with my subjects,

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:46.410
is I make sure the
camera is the least

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.760
apparent part of the shoot.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.680
I'm aware that these children
are aware of the lenses,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.150
and I try to slowly eliminate
it in every way I can.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.990
So we've got a
lot of engagement,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.820
a lot of playfulness, this
again is part of every shoot.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.240
Another thing I really
like is the quiet part.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.120
The simple part.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.830
The slow it down.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.880
After enough of that
rush of engagement,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.490
this becomes kind of a welcome
relief when you're actually

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.640
delivering a
collection of images.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.520
Every session I do is probably
about 60 images I turn around.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.800
And they're all this kind
of spectrum of expression,

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.490
a lot going on, a
lot of activities.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.250
But there's always
this quiet part.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.990
It's kind of when you watch a
movie, and you get to the part

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.800
where it slows down
and lets you catch up.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.100
Or you're reading a book, and
you can take a deep breath.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.225
That's what I think of when
I capture these images.

00:31:32.225 --> 00:31:34.120
I'm trying to find these.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.350
So the way I'm
able to do this is

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.260
I become exceptionally boring.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.810
On purpose.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.440
And probably in real life.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.340
But the idea of becoming
background noise.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.047
Becoming the hum
in the restaurant

00:31:49.047 --> 00:31:50.880
while other people talk
about something more

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.380
interesting above it.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.040
You do that by wearing them out,
by playing at the max level,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.340
and they eventually want to move
away from you for a little bit.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.090
I photographed this portrait in
Clearwater Beach a month ago.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.860
I think 3 and 1/2 weeks ago.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.930
And I was playing with
two children, two girls

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.530
and their mom.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.696
And we were in the sand,
and we were rolling around,

00:32:09.696 --> 00:32:12.160
and we were literally in the
waves, this close to losing

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.830
my phone again in the ocean.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.870
And I'm shooting this.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.990
I step back because the energy
is kind of calming down.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.520
And they just ignore me.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.590
And they're just silencing
down a little bit.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.560
I shot this with spot
metering, because I'm

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.880
shooting into the sun.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.690
This is an F9.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.020
That's how I keep
the detail in the sky

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.020
is the aperture and
the metering option.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.080
I don't need any fill
light on this shot,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.890
because I've got a very
small subject who's

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.360
got this huge bounce of light on
this bright, bright sand coming

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.670
right back up at her.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.420
One of the reasons I do love
beach photography quite a lot,

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.320
I can bring a lot
less equipment.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.980
If you've ever held a reflector
on the beach with the wind,

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.350
you become a kite.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.515
So I don't need that
on days like this.

00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:59.720
And this idea of bringing
this in is so important to me.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.760
Another image from around
the same time, this dreamier

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.890
expression.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.540
Part of why I think these are
really powerful to capture

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.250
is we go back to the idea of
embracing self-consciousness.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.560
When these moments happen,
when people zone out,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.380
when they get dreamy, they're
not feeling self-conscious,

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.540
are they?

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.780
You kind of let that go.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.650
Have you ever done that,
where you're just zoning out?

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.300
And like your brain goes
to sleep for a second,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.690
and your eyes go to
sleep for a second,

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.189
and then somebody's
like [SNAPPING].

00:33:25.189 --> 00:33:26.200
It's like stop it.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.360
That felt so good.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.480
That moment of being able
to just kind of power

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.830
down a little bit.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.340
When I see that
in my subjects, I

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.980
find that so alluring
because it just

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.770
seems like we get so much
less of that in the world.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.580
This is another perfect
image of the same girl.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.760
This is about two seconds later.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.490
Back up with focus and delight.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.070
I'm actually shooting this
from inside the bushes,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.170
peeking through the
bushes with my long lens.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.580
And she finds that so dorky.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.030
And that's the shot I get.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:59.160
But this age, this age
between four and nine,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.930
this is most of the
area I focus my work on.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.760
Is this age of child.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.800
And I work with a
lot of photographers

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.560
who photograph only adults
and say, why do you do it?

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.540
Why would you want to
bring all your gear

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.230
and chase some kid who's
snotting everywhere?

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.230
Who won't listen to you?

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.115
What do you want to
even do that for?

00:34:18.115 --> 00:34:19.739
For me, I find that
I'm extraordinarily

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.920
drawn to this kind of age
group, and beyond actually.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.400
But it does seem to
be a lot of my focus.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.600
Because self-consciousness at
this age is so malleable still.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.909
They're still very open.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.110
They understand that they
stand apart in the world.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.239
They understand that they
can perform and do something.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.860
They're having ideas
of who they are.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.897
But they also are really open
to anything you say, too.

00:34:40.897 --> 00:34:41.980
You'll say, I'm beautiful.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.303
And they'll say, yeah, totally.

00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:44.969
Like, of course.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.010
Like, why wouldn't I be?

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.850
I don't think I've ever,
ever flipped the camera over

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.924
and shown a five, six,
seven-year-old girl

00:34:50.924 --> 00:34:54.630
her picture, and she said, oh,
I look-- all the bad words,

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.239
right?

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.010
Ugly, this, blah, blah.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.510
No.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.182
I look great.

00:34:58.182 --> 00:34:58.890
That's hilarious.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:34:59.910
What a good jump I did.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:00.690
And that's it.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.750
That's as far as it goes.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.460
To me, there's something
so refreshing about that.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.870
It's so easy.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.277
And I love the idea
of thinking that we

00:35:09.277 --> 00:35:10.360
could do that with adults.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.700
That you could photograph.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.320
I'm trying to think if I've
ever photographed an adult

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.780
and shown them the back of the
camera, and they haven't said,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.920
oh, that one thing
on my one thing.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.190
Like, whatever it is.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.770
The amount of people
walking around

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.870
who are convinced that they
have eyes too close together,

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.710
legs too short, one arm's
longer than the other.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.890
I don't know.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:29.750
It astounds me.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.760
It really does.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.530
We absorb so much negative
information about ourselves

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.910
from others, or our perception
of ourselves in the mirror.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.480
And the beautiful
beauty industry.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.950
This how do I look idea
is so easy at that age.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.700
But it starts getting tougher
as children get older.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:53.140
Ages nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.870
Suddenly the question of
watch me, how did it look?

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.020
Becomes how do I look?

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.910
Like, literally, how do I look?

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.690
And for the first time
ever, at this age,

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.525
children start wondering,
am I presenting

00:36:05.525 --> 00:36:08.670
the image I want of
myself to others?

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.890
Isn't that crazy?

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.280
That never before in
their self-consciousness

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.490
has that come up.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.480
You've never seen that.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.260
And suddenly it becomes a thing.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.300
How did I look?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.150
Did I look pretty?

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.900
Did I look cool?

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.890
Did I look fashionable?

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.290
Did I look sporty?

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.850
Am I someone that others
will find popular?

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.970
If you put this on Instagram,
how many likes will I get?

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.830
What will this mean?

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.320
Is this the image I want
to present to others?

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.530
And suddenly you start
taking these images

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.220
and self-consciousness
becomes so much more raw.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.270
There's so much more
vulnerability now.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.480
It reminds me a lot of
walking through and learning

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.160
a lot about Google.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.240
When you build technology,
it works really well up

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.780
until a certain point.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.500
Right?

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.990
You reach a capacity threshold,
a certain number of hits.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.330
Something happens, and
you need to re-tool

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.160
it to make it work
again at this new level.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.720
Correct?

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.720
With human beings,
it's the same way.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.970
The same techniques that
work and work and work just

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.500
stop right about when
you hit this age.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.290
So now you have to
find a way to work

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.120
with these new sensibilities,
these new raw feelings,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:14.960
these new questions.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.610
And you have to
ask yourself, how

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.560
do I, as a portrait
photographer who

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.110
is really interested in
getting a real, authentic image

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.340
of this person, how do
I make them feel sure

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.120
when they're starting
to feel so unsure?

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.010
How do I meet this new
level of self-consciousness?

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.260
First and foremost, it
helps to recognize it.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.710
You look at an image like
this, and she's smiling.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.630
And she looks pretty.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.420
And she's not making that
kind of painful grin any more.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.370
She's not looking
at me like she's

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.790
strained or uncomfortable.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.360
Right?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.381
Seems like it's a
nice sort of smile.

00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:51.880
But you realize when you look
at it a little bit more, well,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.040
there's certainly no real
smile around the eyes.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.300
Yes, we've got catch
lights, and that helps.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.740
But there's no real
crinkle around the eyes.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.230
And she's got a tightness
around her jaw, right?

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.350
This is her real smile, by
the way, is what she tells me.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.300
She's got a tightness
around the jaw.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.640
And the way she's holding
herself completely straight

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.240
up and down doesn't indicate
much in the way of engagement.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.580
You compare that to a couple
seconds later, a few more bits

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.150
of conversation, a little
bit more distraction.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.985
Same sort of smile, but
now it's reached her eyes.

00:38:24.985 --> 00:38:27.110
And you can see that in
the way they're positioned.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.730
Just the way that they
crinkle up just a bit.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.900
You've got a lot more
softness around the jaw.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.870
Do you see the difference
in the jaw line?

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.000
And the smile?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.940
We've got the natural
tilt of the head, which

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.140
you see all the time when
people actually engage.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.010
The difference between
this and like I'm

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.540
actually welcoming
and interested in you.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.130
It's just a hair-breadth apart,
but it's massively different.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.692
It makes a big, big difference.

00:38:52.692 --> 00:38:53.400
It's interesting.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.770
I was recently filmed by Nikon.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.700
They came down to North
Carolina, where I'm from.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.300
And they did five
different shoots

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.770
of me photographing portraits.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.540
And right before they
came, they sent me a clip

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.730
that they'd just done with this
great adventurer photographer.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.230
And they showed me one of
the series they did with him.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.490
And I'm looking at
this beautiful film.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.060
They did such a
great job with it.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.530
And they're up on this mountain.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.680
It's these mountain vistas.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.290
And there's a rock climber.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.140
And he's like hanging
off the mountain,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.500
and there's this gorgeous sun.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.640
And it's just this
huge, beautiful scene.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.610
As I'm watching
this, it struck me

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.160
that I wanted to make sure I
communicated to the producer

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.250
that in so many ways,
we're kind of going

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.880
to be doing the same
thing with my shoot.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.010
It's just the canvas is
now right on the face.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.850
And the body.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.560
And the tension that one
holds or doesn't hold.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.570
And it's still so beautiful,
and it's still so dramatic,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.970
but it's going to be different.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.860
But I want people to
know that between right

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.030
there, the forehead, and
right there, the chin,

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.340
there are all these
intricate details.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.669
And if you tune in, you pay
attention, you really feel it,

00:40:02.669 --> 00:40:04.460
and you don't accept
the image on the left.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.400
You say, that's fine, but we're
going to keep going for a while

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.150
so we get something more real.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.010
After that, you
start moving along.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.830
And suddenly it's like you've
been able to build a bridge

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.170
where someone's not
trying at all anymore.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.840
They feel very comfortable.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.400
Again, you have to move
past lens awareness,

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.230
where they're so
conscious of the lens,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.610
to the fact where they're
just engaging with you.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.090
It takes a while,
but it's always

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.690
worth the work of doing so.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.120
So self-consciousness, of
course, ages well past this.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.660
Many people have probably
their own personal stories

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.660
of what their own
self-consciousness turns into.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.140
But we have all this feeding
into us in terms of how I look.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.210
We see more and more
pictures every day.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.420
We have more negative
information every day.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.900
And we end up learning more
negative things about ourselves

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.140
than we've ever heard before.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.400
I read this the other day.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.160
At any day of your life, you
now know more negative things

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.182
about yourself than you ever
did in your whole life before.

00:41:01.182 --> 00:41:02.890
Kind of crazy to think
about it that way.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.570
And really, really depressing.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.220
So what agreements do you make?

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.300
Anybody here ever read "The Four
Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz?

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.380
Part of it?

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.160
A very simple, easy read.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.800
And without going into
detail on the book,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.300
I want to share
with you a take-away

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.330
I got from it that has given
me a huge advantage in portrait

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:24.830
photography.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.371
And I'd love for
you to have it, too,

00:41:26.371 --> 00:41:28.331
if you're going to be
photographing people.

00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:29.830
The take-away from
the book, and I'm

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.890
totally, totally
paraphrasing this

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.150
based on how I perceived
it and how I applied it.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.940
So someone might read
the book and say,

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.410
what are you talking about?

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:40.150
But this is the
take-away I got from it.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.700
Is that you have the choice
to agree, each and every time,

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.980
with anything that's ever
being said about you.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.690
And if that sounds overly
simplistic, let me explain.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.710
If you were told once, when
you were a teenager, that you

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.670
should never smile in pictures
because it didn't look good,

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.940
you have the opportunity
right there at that moment

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.050
whether you agree or not.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.940
And that changes
everything about the way

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.580
you may or may not
smile for pictures

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.230
for the rest of your life.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:07.430
That idea that you can agree.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.145
Or if you were told
by a friend that you

00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:11.221
don't look good in red.

00:42:11.221 --> 00:42:12.720
You have an opportunity
right there,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.287
whether or not
you want to agree.

00:42:14.287 --> 00:42:16.620
If you were told by a coach
that you weren't good enough

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.770
for varsity, you could choose to
go on and have Michael Jordan's

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.010
career.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.340
Because he was cut
from his varsity team.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.910
Or you could sit there
and agree and be done.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.480
If a crowd of
publishers told you

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.290
that your book wasn't
worth publishing,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.620
you could still be JK Rowling.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.570
So you always have this chance
to agree or not to agree.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.260
Why this matters to me
with portrait photography

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.960
is that I have so
many of my subjects,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.850
my adult subjects
especially, but really

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.540
over that age of nine,
10, who have come in

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.750
with these agreements
that they have already

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.630
made with every negative
thing they've ever

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.910
heard about themselves.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.320
They've already come in and
decided that this is true.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.020
And what I'm saying is
you look at that person,

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.984
and I'm going to have a
totally different agreement.

00:42:59.984 --> 00:43:01.400
I've already agreed
that everybody

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.160
who comes and sits down is
ridiculously good-looking.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.200
They're seriously,
seriously attractive.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.590
And by having that
one small shift,

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.560
by knowing that it's
already there, and all

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.900
I have to do is use lighting,
the right equipment,

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.640
good posing, to show
what I already see.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.420
It makes all the
difference in the world.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.270
It truly does.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.510
By coming in and
saying, I have already

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.690
agreed that you are
seriously good-looking.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.190
And we're going to
start from there.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.090
And good-looking is a
fun term to say anything

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.580
in the way of just beautiful.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.900
I just need to show that.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.250
My friend, Barb.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.220
I had the opportunity to
photograph her in the hospital.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.590
Again with this huge advantage,
as a portrait photographer,

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:44.330
of knowing that
she is beautiful.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.350
She was born with a condition,
an auto-immune disease,

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.400
that basically gave her
sever muscle weakness.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.980
And her whole life,
she couldn't even

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.800
speak throughout her whole
childhood, it was so severe.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.230
And in her '40s, was
diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.180
And as she's going
through, this was

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.340
being checked into
the hospital for

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.360
a radical double mastectomy.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.600
And as she is going
through chemo,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.930
a really crazy thing happened.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.520
Which was, her
symptoms that she'd

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.320
had her whole life with
this auto-immune disease

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.580
started lessening and
lessening and lessening.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.270
Because the auto-immune
disease attacked her body

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.380
when she was in
better health, and it

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.840
lessened when she
was in worse health.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.240
And so when she was in what
many people would think

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.250
the most unfair, cruel situation
possible, she was at more peace

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:35.080
than she'd ever been
in her whole life.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.550
I'm coming in as a photographer.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.470
And I am starting
out with saying,

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.680
OK, you're already beautiful.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.179
But you honestly
look more beautiful

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.850
than I've ever seen you before.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.200
Right now, as I'm
sitting across from you.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.280
All I have to do, all
my job is right now,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.250
is to light this, pose
this, and shoot this.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.980
And that's it.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.770
Because I've started out
with this first part.

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.070
This first agreement.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.330
And people just keep
proving me right,

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.190
when I start from that place.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.220
Which makes my job a lot easier.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.720
I don't even have to-- there's
a great example of most

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.910
of the time, when I'm
photographing children

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:15.000
of this age, all they want to
do is get as far away from me

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.840
as possible.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.430
They want to be anywhere
that my lens is not.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.770
I don't have to
agree with them when

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:22.570
they don't want to
be photographed.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.650
I've already agreed that they're
going to get photographed.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.590
That's how important that kind
of agreement is in my job.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.430
So all I need to do is capture
them, contain them, and shoot

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.880
them.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.920
So self-consciousness.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.830
We've talked a lot
about that subject,

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:40.860
all the different forms.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.900
How is that different
than self-awareness?

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:47.530
And why does that
matter in photography?

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.514
Self-consciousness
and self-awareness

00:45:49.514 --> 00:45:50.680
are actually the same thing.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.360
Psychologists say these
are the same exact thing.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.440
Self-awareness is just
self-consciousness

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.140
taken to the next level.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.510
Where you see more
than just yourself,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.840
you see your place in the world
from an overall perspective.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:07.140
And I would argue you have a
lot more humor about yourself

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.880
and the rest of the world.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.980
But the way we address
self-consciousness

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.280
and self-awareness
as a society is we

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.120
think of self-consciousness
as a weakness.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.220
It's an adjective we use to
negatively describe somebody.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.400
We'd say things like, oh my
god, she's so self-conscious.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.960
That's like a negative thing.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.270
But about somebody
who's very self-aware,

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:32.510
we'd say, oh, he's very
self-aware, very enlightened.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.430
This is a compliment.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.230
This is a positive.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.060
When in fact, it's
kind of the same thing.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.520
How it differs in
photography is this.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.940
When you think about a
celebrated war photographer,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.970
how often do you think one would
see some heart-wrenching scene

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.470
and not lift his
camera because he's

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.970
afraid of how he might be
looking as he photographs them?

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:52.834
It doesn't happen.

00:46:52.834 --> 00:46:54.750
When you're that good,
you get past that level

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.920
of self-consciousness.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.820
Self-awareness is
not stepping in front

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.650
of the guy with the gun
to get a better shot.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.060
That's kind of a difference.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.380
To put it in everyday terms,
as a wedding photography,

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.030
self-consciousness
might be standing

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.730
in front of a group
of 100 people,

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.780
and all eyes are on you,
and you're directing them.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.870
Getting past self-consciousness
allows you to do that.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.700
Getting past
self-consciousness and not

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.740
practicing self-awareness
means you walk up

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.073
to the front of the church
in the middle of the ceremony

00:47:22.073 --> 00:47:23.720
and you throw an
iPad at the couple,

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.370
and you photograph
the most sacred part

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.810
of the whole experience.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.143
Which I don't know if you
guys have been to any weddings

00:47:29.143 --> 00:47:31.420
recently, but I've
actually seen that.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.160
That's getting past
self-consciousness

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.280
and not practicing
self-awareness.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.500
Where self-awareness helps
you in portrait photography

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.924
is back to having that
kind of sense of humor

00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:42.840
about the whole thing.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.910
Like, at the end of the
day, seriously, it's OK.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.760
This image, I
photographed in my studio.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.070
And again, I have
everything set up

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.570
before I even think about taking
the shot or the expression.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.694
So the lighting's in place.

00:47:55.694 --> 00:47:58.120
We had soft box as a main light.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.520
A constant soft box.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.290
We had a fill light on the side.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.860
And my exposure was set.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.740
I think it was at ISO 1,000.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.450
I'm at 1/500th of a second.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.607
And I'm shooting within a
Nikon D4, and the 85 1/4 lens.

00:48:11.607 --> 00:48:13.690
So everything's all set,
and all we're going to do

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:16.290
is add a little bit of
wind with the intention

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:18.260
of having her hair
blow back a little bit.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.400
And this happened the
second we turn on the fan.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.234
Now there's two ways
to go about this.

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.650
One is to think, the shot got
ruined, let me fix her hair.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:27.670
And let me start again.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.810
The other is to say,
this is the shot.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.831
Based on your idea of
humor and self-awareness

00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:35.330
and your level of
self-consciousness

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:36.234
you're bringing in.

00:48:36.234 --> 00:48:37.650
I've actually shown
this to people

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:39.652
who said, oh, it didn't
work out, did it?

00:48:39.652 --> 00:48:40.360
What do you mean?

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.300
I think it's
absolutely charming.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.675
It depends on how you view it.

00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:47.133
I think of this as an endearing
image, not an imperfection.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.620
So my good friend, King
Solomon, said this.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.940
"In all thy getting,
get understanding."

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.250
To me, I think
starting with yourself,

00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.950
getting a better
idea of what you're

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.515
bringing to the table in
portrait photography, is huge.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.280
If there's anything that most
limits you from freeing others

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.750
from their
self-consciousness, it's

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.710
you being trapped in yours.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:17.730
I'll say that again.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.790
If there's anything that most
limits you from freeing others

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.490
from their
self-consciousness, it's

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.670
you being trapped in yours.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.040
If you can't stand in
the middle of a shoot

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.360
and completely forget
about yourself, and just

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.700
do whatever it takes.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.880
Go ahead, kick me in
the head, spit on me,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.819
let me roll on the
ground with you.

00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:37.360
Hopefully I'm talking
about children.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.104
But however you need
to photograph adults.

00:49:41.104 --> 00:49:43.950
If you can't do
this, you're going

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:48.640
to miss an opportunity to get
some real dynamic expression.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.720
We have some time for Q&amp;A. Yes?

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.440
AUDIENCE: So all you need
is that 1/25 of a second

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.520
to capture that
right expression,

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.780
but can you actually.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.350
Like, I agree, but I never
see that 1/25 of a second.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.750
Like it comes and
it goes, and I never

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.180
know if I've got it
until I get home,

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.360
and I look through all
my 200 photographs.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.220
So are you able to do that?

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.131
TAMARA LACKEY: While
that moment's happening?

00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:14.630
Yes.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.790
AUDIENCE: How do
you have a good time

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:15.956
and know that you've got it?

00:50:15.956 --> 00:50:18.840
And what advice do you give
people who aren't getting it?

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.590
TAMARA LACKEY: No.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.757
That's a wonderful question.

00:50:20.757 --> 00:50:23.048
So the question is, how do
you know that you've got it?

00:50:23.048 --> 00:50:24.210
Do you see it on the spot?

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.250
One of the things I try to do
is get all the technical stuff

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.150
done, just done.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.980
So I don't have to
pay attention to that.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.660
So I could be solely,
obsessively, ridiculously

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.280
focused on my subject.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.370
And so I'm going to be,
if I'm photographing you,

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.470
I'm looking at every
nuance on your face

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.540
to the point where you're
probably way uncomfortable.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.430
But then you're going to
laugh out of discomfort.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.070
And I'm going to get a wonderful
1/125 of a second shot of you.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.170
And that is a lot of it.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.294
So because I'm not really
worried about how I sound

00:50:52.294 --> 00:50:55.320
or what I'm doing or what I look
like, I'm just focusing on you.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.760
AUDIENCE: I mean are you
firing at 10 frames a second?

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.510
TAMARA LACKEY: No.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.347
AUDIENCE: Because
expressions move, right?

00:51:00.347 --> 00:51:01.180
TAMARA LACKEY: Yeah.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.130
I would say in a normal
portrait session.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:06.450
A normal portrait session for me
lasts about two to three hours,

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.010
on average.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.840
And that's building
in a lot of breaks

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.670
and letting the energy kind
of ebb and flow a little bit.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.870
And in that time, I'm
probably capturing

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.640
a total of 300 images.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.200
300 raw images.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.800
And when I take that
back and cull them down,

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.820
I'm delivering about 60 images.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.770
So the only time I do any
sort of burst shooting

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:29.080
is if I have someone
rapidly moving

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.130
or, you know, a kid
racing across the thing

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.080
or coming at me.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.530
And I'm thinking
about, again, I'm

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.420
still thinking about
the technical aspects.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.210
So I know that if I
have a subject who's

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.030
racing towards me, it's
significantly harder

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.262
to get a focused shot
of them than if they're

00:51:43.262 --> 00:51:45.220
racing across the camera,
simply because of how

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.430
the technology works.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.390
So if I do that, I
change my angle and say,

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.500
you run that way and
circle back to me.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.510
And I might do a
burst mode, then.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:56.350
But I'll still do still frame
by still frame of an individual,

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.410
because I feel I can
better measure it.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.640
Better measure that expression.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.000
AUDIENCE: How do
you keep your focus?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.457
TAMARA LACKEY: Literally
the technical focal point?

00:52:05.457 --> 00:52:06.082
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:06.082 --> 00:52:08.890
On your subjects?

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.730
Because I get these
moments, but then

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.323
I don't quite have the focus.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.989
It's blurry.

00:52:17.989 --> 00:52:18.780
TAMARA LACKEY: Yes.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.500
So it's a very good
question about focus.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.736
There's actually
about four steps

00:52:22.736 --> 00:52:24.360
in a row I'm constantly
thinking about,

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.490
when I'm thinking about
literally getting focus.

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:29.330
Obviously, so much of this
talk is about emotionally

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.030
staying focused.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.490
And for me, that's so important,
because you could take

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:35.190
two great shots like the ones I
showed you of that girl, frame

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.800
by frame next to each other,
and the one just feels off,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.580
and the other one
feels so significant.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.330
But technically, the
way I am achieving focus

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.900
is first of all, I
do single shot focus.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.407
And I focus right on
the eyes every time.

00:52:47.407 --> 00:52:48.240
Each and every time.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.406
If I have a group, I focus
on the eyes of the person

00:52:50.406 --> 00:52:51.380
most in the middle.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.180
I watch my distance to subject.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.330
I know that if I'm
photographing you from here,

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.485
I have a significantly
better shot at getting you

00:52:57.485 --> 00:52:59.592
in focus at an F28
aperture than I

00:52:59.592 --> 00:53:01.550
would if I were standing
right in front of you,

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.540
where I might get
one eye in focus.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.740
Or if I'm leaning in toward
you with a micro lens,

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.710
and it's not going to
adapt the aperture for me.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:11.580
I'm going to get an
eyelash in focus.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:15.280
So keeping my distance from you
basically lets my focal plane

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.047
widen.

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:18.630
And I'll have more of a chance
of getting everything in focus.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:21.230
And the closer I get to
you, the more that narrows,

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.550
and the less likely I am
to get things in focus.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.090
So keeping distance
to subject is one.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.120
Number two has to do with how
many people I'm photographing.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.730
If I'm photographing a group,
like a family or organization,

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.780
or any sort of
collective of people,

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.580
I'm keeping in my
distance to subject.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.270
And I'm also making sure I have
an extended field of focus.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.260
And I'm keeping them on
the same focal plane.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:47.250
So if I have five people,
I liken it to saying,

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.570
imagine there's a thin plane
of glass in front of you.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.540
I want all of your noses
to be in the vicinity

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.990
of that plane of glass.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.670
So I don't have to worry about
somebody a foot behind them

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.079
or a foot in front of them.

00:53:58.079 --> 00:54:00.120
Either the person in the
foreground or the person

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.910
in the background
is going to be soft.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.870
So thinking about that helps
significantly with focus,

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.520
is the focal plane.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.274
And then lastly is going
to be my lens choice.

00:54:09.274 --> 00:54:11.440
Certain lenses are always
going to be sharper for me

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.110
than others.

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:14.500
And then I pick
them accordingly.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.540
Actually, I said lastly.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.050
There's one more
thing, which has

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.980
to do with-- I hardly
ever tripod things.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.680
I hardly ever do.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.450
This is me using a
hand-held 105-28 lens.

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:27.760
And I'm shooting down.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.340
And I'm shooting
relatively close.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.330
But because I'm shooting
relatively close,

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.510
my aperture has
to be extended so

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.110
that I get more of
her face in focus.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.440
Because of that, I
have to tripod myself.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.520
Which is what I do a lot.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.770
When I talk to you about
running with the little girl,

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:43.740
I'm keeping my
camera very steady.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.320
I'm moving, but I'm keeping
my camera very steady.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.310
So user error is another issue
that comes up for me a lot

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:50.490
with focus.

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:54.279
Is to make sure that I'm keeping
everything strong and in place.

00:54:54.279 --> 00:54:55.820
AUDIENCE: So what
AF mode do you use?

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.987
Do you use single
shot or continuous?

00:54:57.987 --> 00:54:58.820
TAMARA LACKEY: Yeah.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.720
I use single shot nearly always.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.100
I've recently been doing a
little bit more with the 3D

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.480
and the continuous on
the new Nikon cameras.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.540
But even though they're
doing well for me,

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.260
I still am not sure of them.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.530
AUDIENCE: And do you manually
select a focus point,

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.157
or do you just let the camera?

00:55:15.157 --> 00:55:16.240
TAMARA LACKEY: Auto-focus.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:16.739
Yeah.

00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:18.664
So I shoot everything
in manual exposure.

00:55:18.664 --> 00:55:20.330
So I'm constantly
using manual exposure,

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.454
which means I'm setting my
own aperture and shutter

00:55:22.454 --> 00:55:24.150
speed and ISO.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:27.179
But I'm always using the
auto-focus on the lens.

00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:29.220
AUDIENCE: I mean, letting
the camera decide which

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.916
focus point to
use, what I meant.

00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:32.040
TAMARA LACKEY: Single shot.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:32.790
Auto-focus.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:37.530
So I don't like the 45
focal points jumping up,

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.630
or the one bumping
around a million times.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.450
This goes back to
what I'm trying

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:43.850
to achieve from
expression perspective.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:46.530
If I feel like there's 45 red
focus dots that just came up

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.290
between me and you,
I can't see you.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.580
I can't even look for what
the right expression is.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.220
If I do single shot
focus and re-compose,

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.179
I can constantly keep
you right in front of me.

00:55:55.179 --> 00:55:56.886
And I know what I'm
looking for with you.

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.750
And that no longer
is a distraction

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.720
between me being able
to achieve what I want.

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.386
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:56:01.386 --> 00:56:02.950
So it's always the center point?

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:04.210
TAMARA LACKEY: Correct.

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:05.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:05.881
TAMARA LACKEY: Yes.

00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:07.060
With a few exceptions.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.395
One exception might be,
I have an experience

00:56:09.395 --> 00:56:11.020
where I know I'm
photographing somebody

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.859
in the upper right hand
third of the image.

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.900
And they're going to be
zooming across the frame.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.580
Then I might switch to the
joystick approach, where

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.750
I'll put the focal
point here so I

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.890
know I get them sharp as
they're moving through.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.265
Because focusing
and re-composing

00:56:24.265 --> 00:56:26.790
when they're moving and I'm
moving is a lot more difficult.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:27.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.630
TAMARA LACKEY: You're welcome.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:34.290
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the adult portrait.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.480
Once an adult has become
negative of the photograph.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.630
Like he or she becomes
self-conscious of his or her

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:44.130
fitness.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:47.160
If there are any
suggestions about how do you

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.895
smooth them or make them relax?

00:56:48.895 --> 00:56:50.270
TAMARA LACKEY: So
what techniques

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:52.050
to help an adult relax?

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.250
Yeah.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.930
AUDIENCE: Like have
the photograph session

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:57.869
went smoothly.

00:56:57.869 --> 00:56:58.660
TAMARA LACKEY: Yes.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.050
That's a great question.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:03.860
With adults, I find that the
name of the talk, Embracing

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.066
Self-Consciousness, it's
always going to be there.

00:57:06.066 --> 00:57:07.440
The sooner I
embrace it, and what

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.780
I mean by that is literally
state, isn't this so weird?

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.060
I'm taking your picture.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.750
You came to this place just so
I could get your photograph.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:19.760
I will start by acknowledging
the discomfort in a situation.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.150
And then what
happened over here,

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:23.410
what people naturally
do when you do that,

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.320
is they laugh self-consciously.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:29.500
And the self-conscious laugh
is beautiful in a still frame.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.110
It looks so raw and
honest and sweet.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.139
It's a really lovely
image to capture.

00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:36.680
And so even though someone might
feel a little uncomfortable,

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.490
or like look away a little
bit, kind of shy or awkward,

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.420
those looks in stills end up
being really strong images.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.160
So even though that
person might not

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.840
feel like they're so comfortable
with the shoot you're getting,

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.040
as long as the frames look
good, that's what I care about.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.520
So one of things I'll do is
I'll address the fact that this

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.579
is an awkward situation,
especially when we're

00:57:56.579 --> 00:57:57.620
in front of other people.

00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.530
There's a lot of times where
I'll do urban portraits,

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.113
or I'll do an editorial
portrait where

00:58:01.113 --> 00:58:02.330
there's other people around.

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:04.310
And then it's just like
that self-consciousness

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:05.830
goes through the roof,
because not only am

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:06.830
I being photographed by you.

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:08.455
But all these people
are staring at me.

00:58:08.455 --> 00:58:09.830
And this is so weird.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.559
So by just taking into
account those factors

00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:15.100
and addressing them, and even
playing with them a little bit,

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.110
like no one's watching, no one's
watching, no one's watching.

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:17.943
And then I'll click.

00:58:17.943 --> 00:58:19.520
And so again, we're engaging.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.646
And it's kind of you and
me against everybody else.

00:58:21.646 --> 00:58:23.645
Like we're not going to
let them make fun of us,

00:58:23.645 --> 00:58:25.130
we're going to do it ourselves.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:28.300
That sort of thing ends
up engaging with them

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.770
in a way that just
meets them where

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.690
they are, in terms
of those feelings.

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:33.732
That goes a long way.

00:58:33.732 --> 00:58:35.940
The amount of times I find
that in social situations,

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.160
people don't address
the weirdness that's

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.680
in front of them.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.090
Why don't we just talk about it?

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:42.930
This is weird.

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:45.600
I find that just doing
that offers somebody

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.420
a sense of relief.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.210
So one of the things
I wanted to do

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:57.240
is, first, to get
you guys all to agree

00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.820
that you're all
seriously good-looking.

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.590
You do agree with that, right?

00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:02.310
Good.

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.850
The other thing I wanted to do
was show a small animodo video

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:08.920
of some of these images
that I've been collecting,

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.910
outside of the ones
I just showed you,

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:13.950
for years that showcase a lot of
what I'm talking about when it

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:17.360
comes to self-consciousness
and expression.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.124
This is actually
the song I'm going

00:59:19.124 --> 00:59:21.150
to be using from
Triple Scoop Music,

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.830
was an original song
written by Tyler Stenson.

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:26.340
And it's called,
aptly, "We Grow."

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.230
So a couple minute slide show.

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.539
Hopefully this works OK.

00:59:31.539 --> 00:59:32.955
[MUSIC - TYLER
STENSON, "WE GROW"]

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:05.640
TAMARA LACKEY:
Thank you very much.
