00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.630
We are asked to approximate
the principal root,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.617
or the positive square root of
45, to the hundredths place.

00:00:06.617 --> 00:00:08.950
And I'm assuming they don't
want us to use a calculator.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.640
Because that would be too easy.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.950
So, let's see if we can
approximate this just

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.640
with our pen and
paper right over here.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.880
So the square root of 45,
or the principal root of 45.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.370
45 is not a perfect square.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.437
It's definitely not
a perfect square.

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:31.520
Let's see, what are the
perfect squares around it?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.650
We know that it is
going to be less

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.990
than-- the next
perfect square above 45

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.800
is going to be 49 because
that is 7 times 7--

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
so it's less than
the square root of 49

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.020
and it's greater than
the square root of 36.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.150
And so, the square root of
36, the principal root of 36

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.930
I should say, is 6.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.450
And the principal
root of 49 is 7.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.430
So, this value right over here
is going to be between 6 and 7.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.130
And if we look at it, it's
only four away from 49.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.050
And it's nine away from 36.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.690
So, the different
between 36 and 49 is 13.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.330
So, it's a total 13 gap between
the 6 squared and 7 squared.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.410
And this is nine of
the way through it.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.864
So, just as a kind of
approximation maybe-- and it's

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:33.280
not going to work out perfectly
because we're squaring it,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.450
this isn't a linear
relationship--

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.780
but it's going to be closer to
7 than it's going to be to 6.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.880
At least the 45 is
9/13 of the way.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.970
Let's see.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.930
It looks like that's
about 2/3 of the way.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.980
So, let's try 6.7 as a guess
just based on 0.7 is about 2/3.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.450
It looks like about the same.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.259
Actually, we could calculate
this right here if we want.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.800
Actually, let's do
that just for fun.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.510
So 9/13 as a decimal
is going to be what?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.130
It's going to be 13 into 9.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.910
We're going to put some
decimal places right over here.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.980
13 doesn't go into 9
but 13 does go into 90.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.690
And it goes into 90-- let's
see, does it go into it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.160
seven times-- it goes
into it six times.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.910
So, 6 times 3 is 18.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.850
6 times 1 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.620
And then you
subtract, you get 12.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550
So, went into it almost
exactly seven times.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.490
So, this value right
here is almost a 0.7.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.500
And so if you say, how many
times does 13 go into 120?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.780
It looks like it's
like nine times?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.020
Yeah, it would go
into it nine times.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.384
9 times 3.

00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:51.050
Get rid of this.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.590
9 times 3 is 27.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.820
9 times 1 is 9, plus 2 is 11.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.340
You have a remainder of 3.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.900
It's about 0.69.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860
So 6.7 would be a
pretty good guess.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.650
This is 0.69 of the
way between 36 and 49.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.520
So, let's go roughly 0.69
of the way between 6 and 7.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.270
So this is once again
just to approximate.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.561
It's not necessarily going
to give us the exact answer.

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.100
We have to use that to
make a good initial guess.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.880
And then see how it works.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.580
Let's try 6.7.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.720
And the really way to
try it is to square 6.7.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.190
So 6.7 times-- maybe I'll
write the multiplication symbol

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.080
there-- 6.7 times 6.7.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.230
So, we have 7 times 7 is 49.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.840
7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.520
Put a 0 now because we've
moved a space to the left.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.580
So, now we have 6 times 7 is 42.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580
Carry the 4.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.730
6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.640
And so, 9 plus 0 is 9.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
6 plus 2 is 8.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.050
4 plus 0 is 4.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.710
And then we have a
4 right over here.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.001
And we have two total numbers
behind the decimal point.

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.960
One, two.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.790
So this gives us 44.89.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.000
So, 6.7 gets us pretty close.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.615
But we're still not probably
right to the hundredth.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.740
Well, we're definitely not
to the hundredths place.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.680
This since we've only
gone to the tenths place

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.810
right over here.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.020
So, if we want to get to 45, 6.7
squared is still less than 45,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.520
or 6.7 is still less than
the square root of 45.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.570
So let's try 6.71.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.790
Let me do this in a new color.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.940
I'll do 6.71 in pink.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.540
So, let's try 6.71.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.610
Increase it a little bit.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.720
See if we go from 44.89 to 45.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.544
Because this is
really close already.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:56.460
Let's just try it out.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.440
6.71.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.781
So once again, we have to
do some arithmetic by hand.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.280
We are assuming
that they don't want

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.850
us to use a calculator here.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.510
So, we have 1 times 1 is 1.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.870
1 times 7 is 7.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.520
1 times 6 is 6.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.480
Put a 0 here.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.210
7 times 1 is 7.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.990
7 times 7 is 49.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.580
7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.140
And then we have two 0s here.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.800
6 times 1 is 6.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.320
6 times 7 is 42.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.810
Just have this new 4 here.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.280
6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.050
Plus 40.

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:38.870
It's interesting to think
what we got incrementally

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.274
by adding that one
hundredth over there.

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:45.440
Well, we'll see actually
when we add all of this up.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.600
You get a 1.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.720
7 plus 7 is 14.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.300
1 plus 6 plus 9 is
16, plus 6 is 22.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.780
2 plus 6 plus 2 is 10.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.470
And then 1 plus 4 is 5.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.590
And then we bring down the 4.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.180
And we have one,
two, three, four

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.554
numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:10.040
One, two, three, four.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.050
So, when you we squared 6.71.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.300
6.71 squared is
equal to 45.0241.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.720
So 6.71 is a little bit greater.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.340
So, let me make it clear now.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.660
We know that 6.7 is less
than the square root of 45.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.764
And we know that
is less than 6.71.

00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:36.180
Because when we square this,
we get something a little bit

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.220
over the square root of 45.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:45.490
But the key here is when we
square this, so 6.7 squared

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:55.220
got us 44.89 which
is 0.11 away from 45.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.740
And then, if we look
at 6.71 squared,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.440
we're only 2.4
hundredths above 45.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.000
So, this right here is closer
to the square root of 45.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So if we approximate to
the hundredths place,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.590
definitely want to go with 6.71.
