00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.490
Find the slope of a
line perpendicular

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.510
to the line 3x plus
2y is equal to 6.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.560
So if I have one line-- so let
me draw some quick axes here.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.420
So that's my y-axis,
and that is my x-axis.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.920
And let's say I have a line
here that has a slope of m,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.360
so the slope over
here is equal to m.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.900
A line that is
perpendicular to this line

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.000
would intersect
it at 90 degrees,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.900
so it would look
something like this.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.290
This would be a 90 degree angle.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010
And the slope here-- and I
won't prove it in this video,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.480
we talk about it in other
videos-- the slope here

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.430
is going to be equal to
the negative reciprocal

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.520
of this line slope.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.470
So it's going to be the negative
reciprocal of that slope,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.610
or another way it's going to
be negative 1 over this slope,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.062
or the negative reciprocal.

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:57.270
Now, with that out of the
way, if we could figure out

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.070
the slope of this
line right over here,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.960
we would just have to take
the negative reciprocal,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.760
and we would have the slope
of the perpendicular line.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.125
So let's figure out
the slope of this line.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.000
So let me rewrite it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.400
3x plus 2y is equal to 6.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490
And the easiest thing
to do is to solve for y,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.670
so we get it into y
equals mx plus b form,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.930
and then the slope
will be pretty obvious.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170
So let's get rid of the
x on the left-hand side,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.120
so let's subtract x-- 3x from
both sides, I should say.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.860
And then the left-hand side,
we're left with just a 2y.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.350
The right-hand side, we
have a negative 3x plus 6.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.046
Now we can divide
both sides by 2,

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:38.420
so we have to divide all the
terms on the right-hand side

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.610
by 2.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.490
We get y is equal to
negative 3/2x-- that's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.220
that part right
over there-- plus 3.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310
So the slope of
this line right over

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.050
here that they give us--
the slope of this line, now

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.870
that we've put it in mx plus
b form, slope-intercept form,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.300
we know that the slope of
this line is negative 3/2.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.490
That is the slope.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.200
So the slope of a line that
is perpendicular to this

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.850
will be the negative
reciprocal of this.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.210
So the negative of a
negative is a positive,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.810
so it's going to be a positive.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.690
And then the reciprocal
of 3/2 is going to be 2/3.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.630
So the negative
reciprocal of negative 3/2

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.920
is positive 2/3, so we're done.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.510
That's the slope of a line that
is perpendicular to this one

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.650
right over here.
