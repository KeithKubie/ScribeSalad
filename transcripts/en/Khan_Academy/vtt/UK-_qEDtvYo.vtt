00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.567
Voiceover:Let's think
about another scenario

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.766
involving ratios.

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.863
In this case, let's think about the ratio

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.733
of the number of apples.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:12.333
Number of apples to ...

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.033
Instead of taking the ratio of the number

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.700
of apples to the number of oranges,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.567
let's take the number of apples to the

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.333
number of fruit.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:25.000
The number of fruit
that we have over here.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.166
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.067
and think about that on your own.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.633
Well, how many total apples do we have?

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.934
We have 2, 4, 6, 8 apples.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600
So we're going to have 8 apples.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.533
And then how much total fruit do we have?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.367
Well we have 8 apples and we have

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:41.733
3, 6, 9, 12 oranges.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.333
So our total fruit is 8 plus 12.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.933
We have 20 pieces of fruit.

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.933
So this ratio is going to be 8 to ...

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.066
8 to 20.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.833
Or, if we want to write
this in a more reduced form,

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:59.266
we can divide both of these by 4.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.600
4 is their greatest common divisor.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.200
And so this is the same thing as a ratio.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.666
8 divided by 4 is 2 and
20 divided by 4 is 5.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.433
So 2 to 5.

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.633
Now, does this make sense?

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:16.333
Well, if we divide ...

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.333
If we divide everything into groups of 4.

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:21.433
So ...

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:23.133
Or if we divide into 4
groups, I should say.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.266
So 1 group, 2 groups,
3 groups, and 4 groups.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.100
That's the largest number of groups

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.566
that we can divide these into

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.233
so that we don't have to cut up the apples

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.466
or the oranges.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.767
We see that in each
group, for every 2 apples

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:45.534
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces of fruit.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.466
For every 2 apples we
have 5 pieces of fruit.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.433
This is actually a good opportunity for us

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.866
to introduce another
way of representing ...

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.700
Another way of representing
ratios, and that's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.467
using fraction notation.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.233
So we could also represent this ratio as

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:04.601
2 over 5.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.200
As the fraction 2 over 5.

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.166
Whenever we put it in
the fraction it's very

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.267
important to recognize
what this represents.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.433
This is telling us the fraction of fruit

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.133
that are apples.

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.867
So we could say 2/5 of the fruit ...

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.267
Of the fruit ...

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
Of the number of fruit,
I guess I could say.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.668
Of number of fruit ...

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.333
Of fruit is equal to the number of apples.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.033
Right, I'm just going to say 2/5 of fruit

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.201
if we're just speaking
in more typical terms.

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.467
2/5 of fruit are apples.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:45.333
Are, are apples.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.367
So, once again, this is introducing

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.001
another way of representing ratios.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.633
We could say that the
ratio of apples to fruit,

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:55.666
once again, it could be 2 to 5 like that.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.900
It could be 2, instead of putting

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.300
this little colon there we could literally

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.600
write out the word to.

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.066
2 to 5.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.967
Or we could say it's
2/5, the fraction 2/5,

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:09.400
which would sometimes be read as 2 to 5.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.501
This is also, when it's written this way,

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.366
you could also read that as a ratio,

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:14.566
depending on the context.

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:16.166
In a sentence like this
I would read this as

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:20.467
2/5 of the fruit are apples.
