00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.240
Turns out humans have a natural fear of almost
everything around us.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.210
I guess we're all just a bunch of wimps!

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.550
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
live your life in constant fear, you're not

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.550
alone!

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
A new study from the University of Chicago,
finds that all humans have an innate sense

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.960
built in, that makes us fear things that are
moving closer towards, rather than moving

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
away.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.710
Now in evolutionary terms, this makes sense.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.309
Early humans were nowhere near as equipped
to deal with danger as we are now - so a wild

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.130
animal or a person we don't know approaching
us, could be a sign of potential danger.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.289
Nowadays, we don't have to worry about that
as much.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.929
But even so, that aspect of our personalities
has apparently stuck around.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.850
And modern humans continue to experience what
we call "approach avoidance" - even when the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.679
things or people approaching us, are non-threatening.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.420
For this study, researchers conducted eight
different tests, using everything from sounds,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.550
to videos of people walking towards you - even
objectively innocuous things, like letters

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.830
of the English alphabet getting bigger and
bigger.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.650
The goal was to see if objects that looked
or sounded like they were getting closer,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.420
would elicit fear within a group of test subjects.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.890
And they did.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.940
All of them.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.380
But this doesn't just apply to physical objects.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.150
It also extends to events that are approaching
in time, or increasing in likelihood.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.000
The example they used, was an impending visit
from your cousin.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.480
Which reminded me of a hilarious - and aptly
timed - article I read on the Onion recently,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.990
entitled "Friend's Threats To Come Visit Becoming
Disturbingly More Genuine."

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.230
Obviously that article is satire, but it's
a perfect encapsulation of what we're talking

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.350
about here.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.020
Even things we we're looking forward to - can
still paralyze us with fear, for no ascertainable

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.020
reason.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.200
In more serious cases, they can put a severe
damper on our day-to-day lives.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.870
According to Christopher Hsee, the researcher
who authored the study, "Approach avoidance

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.480
is a general tendency."

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.920
And for one reason or another, humans can't
seem to adequately distinguish between times

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.350
they should use it and times they should not.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.600
So what can we do about this, aside from constantly
living in fear?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.879
Well, from our end - not much.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.870
Although there are select groups of people
who could benefit from this information.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.160
Marketers, for instance, may wanna consider
how they're placing their products - so they

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.810
don't unintentionally create fear in consumers.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.629
Public speakers could also use it to their
advantage, by making sure not to get too close

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.010
to their audience - unless, of course, fear
tactics are PART of their presentation, in

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.010
which case nothing is sacred.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.480
What do you guys think about this?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.920
Are you naturally fearful of the world around
you?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.510
