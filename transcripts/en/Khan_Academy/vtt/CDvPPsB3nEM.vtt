00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.640
The perimeter of a rectangular
fence measures 0.72

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.270
kilometers.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.670
The length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.550
What is its width?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.280
So we have a rectangular
fence.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.950
Let me draw it.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.710
So that is a rectangle.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.880
You can imagine we're
looking from above.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.540
This line is the top
of the fence.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.470
And if you take its perimeter,
the perimeter is the distance

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.520
around the fence.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.820
If you take this distance plus
this distance plus that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
distance plus that distance,
it's going to be 0.72

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.920
kilometers.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.350
That's the total distance
of all of the sides.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.510
Now, the length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.640
Let's call this the length.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.120
So this distance right
here is 160 meters.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.960
Since it's a rectangle, that
distance over there is also

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.510
going to be 160 meters, and we
need to figure out its width.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.560
They want us to figure
out the width.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.650
The width is this distance right
over here, which is also

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.120
going to be this distance
right over there.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.050
Now, what is the perimeter
of the fence?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.810
The perimeter is the sum of this
length plus this length

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.270
plus that length plus
that length.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.600
So the perimeter-- let me write
it in orange-- is going

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:34.260
to be equal to w, the width,
plus 160 meters, plus the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:44.650
width, plus 160 meters.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.990
And let's assume
w is in meters.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.100
So we could add it all up.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.010
So if you were to add all of
these up, you'd get a certain

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.800
number of meters.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.690
If you were to add all of these
up, you have a w plus a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:07.100
w, so you'd be 2w, plus-- 160
plus 160 is 320-- so plus 320.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.550
And this whole thing
is in meters.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.120
We're assuming that
w is in meters.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.610
Now, they also told us that the
perimeter of the fence is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.200
0.72 kilometers.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.240
So the perimeter-- let me do it
in that same orange color.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:31.400
The perimeter is also equal to
0.72 kilometers, and we can

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.580
abbreviate that with km.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.560
Now, if we wanted to solve an
equation, if we wanted to set

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.530
this thing equal to the
perimeter they gave us, we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.260
have to make sure that the
units are the same.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.390
Here it's in meters.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.430
Here it's in kilometers.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.470
So let's convert this 0.72
kilometers to meters.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.530
And the way to do that, we want
the kilometers in the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.260
denominator so it cancels out
with the kilometers, and you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.330
want meters in the numerator.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.900
Now, how many meters
equal a kilometer?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.720
Well, it's 1,000 meters
for every 1 kilometer.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.890
1 kilometer is 1,000 meters.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.200
Now, if you multiply these
two things, the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.870
kilometers cancel out.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.160
You're just going to be
left with the meters.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.820
And then when you multiply 0.72
times 1,000, you could

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.490
just first say, OK, let's
take 72 times 1,000.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.050
72 times 1,000 would
be 72 with three

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.110
zeroes: one, two, three.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.860
And then out of the two numbers
that you're taking the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.070
product of, we have two
numbers behind the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.620
decimal: one, two.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.360
So you put two numbers behind
the decimal, one, two, right

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.350
over there.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.380
So 0.72 times 1,000 is 720.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.230
And that makes sense.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.520
0.72, it's not quite 1, but
it's getting close to 1,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.720
almost 3/4 of a whole, and this
is almost 3/4 of 1,000.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.740
So it makes sense.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.510
So the perimeter, this
information right here, 0.72

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.400
kilometers, is the same
thing as 720 meters.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.910
So if you take 2 times the width
in meters, and add that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.700
to the combined lengths-- it's
160 and 160, that's 320, and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.019
all of this is in meters-- that
is going to be equal to

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.790
the total perimeter, which
is 720 meters.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.990
Now that we have the units
right, we can solve for w, and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
w will tell us this
width in meters.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.780
So 2w plus 320 is
equal to 720.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.790
We can subtract 320 from both
sides of this equation.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.620
Remember, an equation is saying,
that is equal to that.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.120
If we want them both always to
be equal, whatever we do to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.670
the left-hand side, we have
to do the right-hand side.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.915
So we subtract 320
from both sides.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.190
The left-hand side,
that cancels out.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.100
That's why we subtracted 320.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.000
And you just have left 2 times
the width is equal to 720

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.550
minus 320, which is 400.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.585
Now you can divide both
sides of this by 2.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.030
And then you're left with
the w is equal to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.820
400/2, which is 200.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.790
And we said that w was
in meters, so the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.350
width is 200 meters.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.610
Let's see if it makes sense.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.680
200 plus 200 is 400,
plus 320 is 720.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.200
So the total perimeter is 720
meters, which is the exact

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.020
same thing as 0.72 kilometers.
