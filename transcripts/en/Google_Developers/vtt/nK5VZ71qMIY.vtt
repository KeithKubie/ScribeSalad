&gt;&gt; 
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Google

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:19.980
Chrome Project Management Director Brian Rakowski.
&gt;&gt; RAKOWSKI: Hello, everybody. It’s so nice

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.570
to see everybody here to hear about extensions.
It looks a little bit crowded back there.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.340
There’s lots of room up here. Don’t be
shy. There’s room in the front if you need

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.890
a little bit more space. We have a lot to
talk about here. We’re going to talk about

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.620
extensions and what we released yesterday.
But before we do that, I want to take a couple

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.680
of minutes to talk about the browser in Chrome
and what it means to us at Google. So we set

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.910
out to build a browser because browsers are
so important to us. We think that a browser

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
is the most important piece of software on
your computer. We spend all day in front of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.340
browsers everyday. I’m sure a lot of you
do, too. All of our users come to us to through

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.059
the browser, and we wanted to make sure that
there was a really rock-solid set of fundamentals

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.009
that supported the browser and gave us a great
platform to build on, and also a great user

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.650
experience. So, with that in mind, we set
out to make a browser that was fundamentally

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.750
faster, safer, and more stable than what we’ve
seen before. So, with that in mind, we’ve

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.970
put a lot of effort in to some of our core
technology. V8 helps us with speed. Our multi-process

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.650
architecture helps us with stability. And
our sandboxing technology helps us with security.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.409
All these things are very, very important
to us. They also help us with extensions.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.810
And you’ll hear more about that as we get
a little bit further into the presentation.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.130
So far, the response to Chrome has been amazing.
We’ve been overwhelmed by how positively

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.930
people have responded. We’ve got over 40
million regular users of Chrome. We’re blown

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.820
away by the response there. We have continued
to improve on our core fundamentals of speed,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.070
security, stability. You can see here that
our performance on JavaScript execution has

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.170
improved by 150% since we first launched the
browser; something we’re very proud of.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.590
We’ve also worked on DOM manipulations.
For pages that try to manipulate the DOM through

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.250
JavaScript, we’ve made huge strides in the
last release; so we’re very proud of that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.569
as well. We’re also rounding out the feature
set. There’s a bunch of features that we

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.900
consider to be basic features that a browser
needs. And we’ve been rounding those out

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.890
for the last four releases of the browser.
We’ve also added a little bit some more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.610
frivolous features, I guess; something a little
bit more fun in themes. In case you have an

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.280
urge to put Mariah Carey's face on your browser,
you can now do that. People seem to really

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.152
like that feature. So, we’ve made a lot
of progress in the last year. We’re really

00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:50.290
proud of what we’ve done. A big gap for
the last year has been our lack of support

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.849
for Mac and Linux. We can finally cross that
off the list. And, of course, the other big

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.340
gap is extensions. And that’s what we’re
here to talk today. We’ve also made a huge

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.930
investment in the platform. We want the platform
to be more powerful in terms of what users

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.420
can see and what developers can deliver to
users on the platform. So we’ve made a huge

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.740
investment in HTML5. We're delivering lots
of capabilities there. We’ve also made a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.590
big investment in developer tools, and that
team is to deliver some cool enhancements

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.410
to developer tools. And you’ll see some
of that in the talk that Aaron and Erik are

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.950
going to deliver. But we’re going to spend
all of our--the rest of the time talking about

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.740
extensions. And extensions are incredibly
important to us. When we built Chrome, we

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.420
wanted to focus on creating a very simple
user experience that evoke the Google aesthetic

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.780
of being very powerful but didn’t have a
lot of features that got in your way. It wasn’t

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.099
intimidating in any way. And that was our
core--one of our core principles of simplicity,

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.440
or as we like to say, content not Chrome.
But when we started to work on extensions,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.019
we wanted to adhere to that same aesthetics.
So you’ll see throughout the talk some of

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.110
the work we’ve done to make sure that that
stayed as simple as possible. Now, one of

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.440
the things we learned as we started to hear
our users’ feedback after the first year

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.580
of Chrome was that every user has the handful
of extensions or handful of features that

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.250
they cannot live without. But those same features
to 90% of users are called bloat. So, our

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.569
answer to that is extensions. And this is
an area we’re very serious. We’re going

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.400
to put a lot of effort into making extensions
more and more powerful over time. But the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.900
start we have is phenomenal. And without anymore
background, I’m going to hand it over to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.779
Erik and Aaron to talk about what we set out
to build, how we built it, and how it all

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.871
works. So, here, we have Aaron Boodman and
Erik Kay to talk about the rest of it.

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:37.879
