00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:38.133
OK, let's get down to business.
One announcement: tomorrow will be

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.400
weekly quiz number 11 based on
homework 11. And then,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.600
of course Thursday and Friday there
will be no academic exercises in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.800
connection with the Thanksgiving day
holiday. So, last day we started

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.000
talking about polymers,
macromolecules.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:55.420
These are chemicals that have a very
high molecular weight with a

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.850
repeating chemical structure.
I've given an example here of vinyl

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.280
chloride as the individual molecule.
And, by addition polymerization, we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.710
can break the double bond,
have it propagate, and we end up

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.140
with something which is the
polyvinyl chloride.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.570
N numbers can be very large,
and we can get molecular weights in

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:35.806
the vicinity of 1,000,000
grams per mole.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:26.710
We further looked at tailoring
properties by control of molecular

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.420
architecture. We saw that we could
look at bulk composition and form

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.140
such things as copolymers,
which are to polymers what alloys

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.850
are to metals.
Another way of tailoring properties

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.570
is to vary the arrangement of the
side groups on the backbone.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.280
This is the tacticity of the
polymer. And it is to a polymer

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:08.960
what the stereoisomerism is to
individual molecules.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:58.520
And that lastly,
we looked at the shape of the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.050
backbone itself,
different conformations,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.580
and this is owing to the rotational
capability of the carbon-carbon bond.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.110
And, at the very end of the lecture,
we looked at two forms of formation.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.640
One is addition polymerization,
which is shown here.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.170
We have the three stages.
We start with initiation here.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.700
You see hydrogen peroxide, which
has turned into the radical.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.230
And that triggers this reaction,
which then moves the unpaired

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.730
electron to the end here.
And this is sticking out like a hot

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.190
poker. And other gas molecules in
this case, ethylene that come in

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.660
contact with it will,
in turn, have their double bond

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.130
broken, and so on,
and so on. And finally,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.590
we get to the length that we want.
We terminate the reaction, and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.060
that's the end of the process.
The second one was condensation

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.530
polymerization.
And condensation polymerization is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:03:07.260
stepwise, where you take
two different mer types.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:54.860
And here's a cartoon showing an
example of the formation of PET.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.730
This is the material that's used
for soda bottles,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.590
and many of the clear plastic
containers that you find in the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.460
supermarket or the drugstore.
So, this one vividly indicates that

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.330
it, in fact, is an acid-base
reaction. I said last day,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.190
you had an R1, which is a proton
donor, and an R2,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.060
which is a hydroxyl donor.
Those are classical Arrhenius

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870
definitions.
And so, in this case,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.620
you start with terephthalic acid,
which is basically benzene, with

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.370
this carboxylic acid on the end.
The COOH is carboxylic acid. We'll

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.120
see that repeatedly.
It's a basic group. Basic is the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.870
wrong term. It's a group intrinsic
to proteins. It's an acidic group.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.620
It's not a basic group. But, basic
meaning a different way.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.370
So, here's terephthalic acid.
Here's ethylene glycol. This is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.120
what you put in your cooling system.
This is the same thing as Prestone

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.210
2 Antifreeze.
It's a double alcohol.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.640
It's got hydroxyls at both ends,
it gives up one of those, combines

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.070
with the proton here to form water.
And then we form the amide bond,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.490
which then starts the polymer here.
And, it in fact is a polyester

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.920
because in the end,
you've got this COO that the O acts

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.350
as a bridging oxygen.
So, bridging oxygens we've seen in

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.780
silicates, borates,
as critical in covalent network

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.070
formation.
And, they are operative here.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.210
When they are operative in polymer
systems, that type of polymer is

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.350
termed a polyester because the ester
linkage is this oxygen with a double

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.490
bond. So, this is polyethylene
terephthalate,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.640
PET as you know it.
And, the other thing that I wanted

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.780
to point out is that if you look
carefully at the structure of these,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.920
last day we studied cross-linking.
And, cross-linking depended upon a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:05:07.306
covalent bridge between two chains.
And in this case,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
it's typically made with sulfur.
So, we have sulfur attacking

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
residual double bonds in the
backbone to form single bonds

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
between backbones.
So, we have two chains linking.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Well, if you look at the features
of the polymers that are made by

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
condensation polymerization,
you'll notice that in many instances,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I think here's a good one to look at,
Kevlar. You see the carbonyl group

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
here, the C with the double
bond to the oxygen.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:24.420
And, on this side,
you have an amino group: nitrogen

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.850
with a hydrogen.
And, what can happen is adjacent

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.280
chains can hang the aminos on one
side opposite carbonyls from the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.710
other side. And,
look at the situation that we've set

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.140
up. Here's the oxygen off the
carbonyl group.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.570
And, it's sitting opposite the
hydrogen off the amino group.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:06:05.673
And, you know what that can lead
to: hydrogen bonding.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:55.140
And so, in many of these
condensation polymers,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.280
nylons, silicones, hydrogen bonding
acts almost as a

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.420
pseudo-cross-linking.
It's nowhere near as strong as a

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.560
true covalent cross link.
But what we do observe is that the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.710
nylons, Kevlars,
things like this have much,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.850
much higher strength. And, we're
going to learn a little bit later.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:35.900
They have a higher melting point
owing to this hydrogen bonding.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:26.660
So, I think we want to just document
that: hydrogen bonding operative in

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.330
nylons and silicones.
And, this leads to some additional

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.990
strengthening of the material.
Well, what I wanted to do today was

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.660
to take up this concept that we
talked about with regard to ordering

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.610
versus disordering last day.
We talked about low density

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.840
polyethylene versus high density
polyethylene. So,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.070
I want to just revisit influences on
ordering, and actually what favors

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.300
crystallization,
factors favoring crystallization.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.530
And, remember, we are not talking
about perfect crystals here.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.760
We're talking about local ordering
over certain lengths of chain which

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:36.653
give rise to some strengthening
of the material.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:28.230
And so, I'm just going to go back
and revisit one,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.460
two, and three above.
I'm going to ask, how does

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.700
composition, how does tacticity,
and how does conformation enhance

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.930
crystallization?
So, first thing: let's look at

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.170
composition. The way to favorite
crystallization is to make materials

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.410
more nearly uniform.
The higher the degree of uniformity

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.640
in the polymer,
the greater the chances are that it

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.880
can zigzag back and forth and in a
predictable manner,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:17.560
set up these zones of crystallinity.
So, if this is a straight chain or a

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
linear chain polymer,
if it's made homogeneous of the same

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
composition, then the chances of its
folding back and forth on itself and

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
setting up this local sort of
semi-crystalline region are greater

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
than if the polymer has some random
variation in composition.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:31.830
So, the factor that favors
crystallization is having single

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.660
composition. So,
homo-polymers are much more easily

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.490
crystallized. So,
as an example, polyethylene oxide

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.330
can form crystalline polymer,
whereas if you take the polyethylene

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.160
oxide, block copolymer with,
say, polypropylene oxide. The

00:08:51.160 --> 00:09:09.120
second case is more likely
to be amorphous.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:09:01.550
The second factor we want to look at
is tacticity. You've got the three

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.110
forms of tacticity: isotactic,
syndiotactic, and atactic. And,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.660
the one that's more readily willing
to pack is going to be isotactic.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.220
So, isotactic version will be
favored from the standpoint

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:24.100
of crystallization.
And, we have evidence that isotactic

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.300
polystyrene is highly crystalline.
So, when you see some of these hard

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:47.833
polystyrene containers,
they are predominately isotactic,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.700
whereas atactic polystyrene is
dominantly amorphous.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.900
So, there's the influence of
tacticity. And the third

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:54.330
one is conformation.
How does conformation act?

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.990
Well, we've got the linear chains.
We've got branched chains, and

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.660
we've got cross-linked chains.
And clearly, following this

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.330
paradigm, the linear chains are
favored when it comes to the

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.990
formation of ordered structures.
So, if you look at something like

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.660
high density polyethylene,
that's shown here, this is the

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.230
opaque milk jug.
This has a high degree of linearity

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.690
in the chains,
whereas branching or cross-linking

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.150
are going to make things very
difficult from the perspective of

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.610
forming crystalline structures.
And, in fact, here's something

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.070
that's volume versus temperature.
It should remind you of the unit

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.530
that we have just covered in
silicate glasses.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:11:03.593
We see the cooling curves here at
two different rates.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:53.710
And, fast cooling as a knee in the
curve at a higher glass transition

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.420
temperature than slow cooling.
And, similarly, with fast cooling,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.140
there is a higher degree of quenched
in free volume.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.850
So, all those ideas apply.
The other thing I want to look at

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.570
now is on the basis of what we've
seen so far, what are the properties

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.280
of polymers? We can tailor things
to a great extent.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:36.026
But there are certain properties
that they all share.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:28.180
So, let's document those.
First one: electrical insulators.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.360
Why? Whenever I ask why, we have
to look at electronic structure.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.540
Here, we have strong covalent bonds
up and down the backbone.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:46.720
And, we have relatively weak van
der Waals bonds with some hydrogen

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.900
bonding in between.
In no case are we looking at free

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:59.710
electrons.
So: strong covalent bonds internally.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:07.140
These are intramolecular bonds,
no free electrons. With covalent

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:14.570
bonds, we have electron sharing and
we have octet stability and the

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:30.006
electrical insularity that
accompanies that.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Second, optically,
optical behavior, while they're

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
transparent to visible light,
again, the high-strength covalent

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
bonds transparent to visible light,
and in the case of amorphous, when

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:52.350
amorphous, they are clear.
When amorphous,

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:57.050
they are clear. And,
when we have the semicrystalline

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.760
setup, regions of higher atom
density, which translate into

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.460
regions of higher refractive index.
And since the refractive indices

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.170
are not matched between the
amorphous and the semicrystalline

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.880
regime, this acts effectively as an
interface that can scatter light.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.580
So, the semi-crystalline, although
they are formally transparent to

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.290
visible light,
these in fact prove to be opaque as

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:43.780
you can see from the appearance
of that milk jug.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:34.360
Now, the question you've got to ask
is, could you generate

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.720
semicrystalline zones that were
either index matched or on a length

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.090
scale shorter than that of visible
light? We saw that in the inorganic

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.450
case with the difference between
Pyroceram glass and visions.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.810
The only difference was that the
crystallites in visions were

00:13:51.810 --> 00:14:08.953
much, much smaller.
And as a result,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
we were able to get the
strengthening effect without

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
incurring the penalty of opacity.
The third one is chemically inert.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Polymers are chemically inert.
Again, the strong covalent bonds,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
octet stability, same reasons. And
this leads to their extensive use in

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
packaging, packaging especially of
foods and beverages.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:32.070
Foods and beverages exploit this
property. And,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.150
lastly, they are solid at room
temperature. The long molecules,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.220
even though they're only weak van
der Waals bonds operative between

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.300
molecules, remember,
the strong covalent bonds are within

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.380
the molecule. If you want to ask
the question, is something solid,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.460
liquid, or gas, you have to ask, how
does one molecule bond to another

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:15.920
one of identical composition?
And for that, we got not strong

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
covalent bonds,
but we've got weak van der Waals

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
bonds. But, they are operating over
such large contact areas.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
These molecules are very,
very long.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So, the long molecule presents a
high surface to volume ratio,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
very high surface to volume ratio.
And, that leads to strong bonding.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And ultimately, it leads to
entanglement.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:57.590
So, we have entanglement.
We have weak van der Waals bonds

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:04.190
over high surface to volume ratio.
And, that leads to solidity at room

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:10.790
temperature. And,
we recognized last day that absent

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:17.390
cross-linking can reprocess these by
reheating. This gives us

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:33.313
thermoplastics that
can be reprocessed.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:28.330
And even in the case of hydrogen
bonding, although the nylons have to

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.660
go slightly higher temperatures.
We are able to reprocess the nylons.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.990
In the case of cross-linking,
of course, we have to go to other

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.330
measures because heating to very,
very high temperatures capable of

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.660
breaking the cross links would also
break the backbone.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:17:04.653
So, these things become not very
easily recyclable.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:54.610
And, in fact, what I've got here is
the recycle codes which you see on

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.220
products today.
The first one is the polyethylene

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.840
terephthalate which we just saw the
reaction for. And that's used in

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.450
these clear plastics for many of the
things such as,

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.070
in this case, it's dishwasher
detergent. The two-liter soda

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.690
bottles and so on are this.
High-density polyethylene, that's

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.930
this one here.
The next one, V,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.810
is the reaction I showed at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.680
polyvinyl chloride. The fourth one
is low density polyethylene,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.550
which is the stretch and seal and so
on. And, I want you to note that

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.430
all of these have names associated
with them. And,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.300
these are inventions.
All of these materials that I'm

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.180
showing you are inventions of the
modern era. They all came as a

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.060
result of research,
patenting, etc. So,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.060
you see this one: 1940, 1951.
These are very,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.190
very recent materials.
Polypropylene: 1951. Polystyrene

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.330
technically was isolated by a German
apothecary in 1839 who didn't

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.460
realize what he had.
He had some material that he got

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.590
out of this resin,
and it was around 1922 when Herman

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.730
Staudinger reasoned that in fact
this was as long chain of styrene.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.860
It was polystyrene. He wrote
extensively on it,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:36.453
and eventually won the Nobel Prize
for it.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:26.230
Technically, Simon isolated
polystyrene in 1839.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.460
And then, seven is everything else.
So if you see a seven at the bottom,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.700
it's, who knows?
So, that's the chain of events.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.930
So, what I'd like to do now is I
want to show you a few

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.170
demonstrations.
And in years past,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.400
I had someone come in here and do
this. But, she has since graduated

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.640
and there is a whole bunch of other
factors involved.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.880
So, what I want to do is I've got
some video footage of the

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.710
demonstration as it was done.
So, what you're going to see is

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.140
several things.
The first thing I'm going to show

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.570
you is the synthesis of nylon.
And, this is beaker synthesis of

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.990
nylon 6,6. It's condensation
polymerization.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.420
And, we're going to use
hexamethylene diamine.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.850
So, that's the base, and adipic
acid, which is obviously an acid.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.280
So, acid plus base gives water,
plus in this case the

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.300
neutralized polymer.
This is only done for demonstration

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.920
purposes. In industry,
nylon is not synthesized this way.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.530
They typically go up to around
300。. So, they're going to take

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.150
each of these ingredients.
And, they're going to dissolve them

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.760
in different solvents.
So, in one case, we're going to

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.380
dissolve the hexamethylene diamine
in an aqueous solution,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:20:06.693
and then the adipic acid is going to
be dissolved in hexane.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Hexane is aliphatic.
It's nonpolar. It's immiscible

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
with water. So,
you're going to see two liquid

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
phases: an aqueous phase and an
organic phase.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
So, one ingredient is in an aqueous
phase. The other ingredient is in

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
the organic phase.
The only place they come in contact

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
with one another is at the interface.
So, you're going to see nylon

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
synthesized at the interface between
the two liquids. And,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.500
here's the reaction.
This is Heidi Birch speaking.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:21:04.000
[VIDEO BEGINS]

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Oh, shut up. [LAUGHTER]

00:21:15.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Train your eye right here.
 [VIDEO ENDS]

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:28.840
I'm going to show you,
we had a close-up of a previous year

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.690
when she did it and we actually had
a camera focused right on the beaker.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.530
So, you get a better scene of the
formation of the nylon.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.380
It's happening right here at the
interface between the hexane and the

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.230
aqueous solution.
So, the nylon is forming right here.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.070
And, as soon as the nylon forms,
and seals off the reaction so no

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.370
more reactants can get here.
What she does is she pulls this up.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:57.120
And as she pulls the nylon up, she
exposes fresh interface.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.870
So, everything is occurring at this
interface. It's a self-limiting

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.620
reaction. So this next one,
I think, shows it just a little bit

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.000
better. [VIDEO PLAYS]

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:31.190
OK, the second one I'm going to show
you is a demonstration of the role

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.390
that the glass transition
temperature plays in rubbers.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.590
Rubbers are materials that are
cross-linked. And,

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.790
they gain their bounce from the fact
that if you pull on the rubber these

00:23:43.790 --> 00:24:02.513
cross links will cause
you to have to recoil.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:52.190
But if you cool the rubber below the
glass transition temperature,

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.380
the entire structure becomes a rigid
solid. And so,

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.570
the rubber loses its bounce.
In our lab, if we have to make,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.760
for example, a hole through a rubber
stopper, if you take that rubber

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.950
stopper, put it on a drill press and
try to drill, it's very dangerous to

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.140
do because the rubber will grip on
to the drill bit.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.330
If you quench the rubber in liquid
nitrogen, take it below its glass

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.520
transition temperature,
the rubber behaves as a brittle

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.710
solid. And then,
you just drill right through,

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.900
get a nice, clean hole, and then the
material heats back up above its

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.220
glass transition temperature.
So, Heidi is going to show you two

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.660
different rubbers,
one that has a glass transition

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.110
temperature above room temperature.
So, room temperature is already

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.550
down here, and the rubber ball,
I'm saying in quotation marks, the

00:24:47.550 --> 00:25:07.833
ball is going to act like a billiard
ball. It's solid, very poor bounce.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:55.230
The other one has a glass transition
temperature of negative degrees C.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.460
and so, at room temperature it
bounces well. So,

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.690
she's going to, in one case,
heat both of them above the glass

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.920
transition temperature,
put them in boiling water.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.150
The other case, she's going to put
them in liquid nitrogen.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.380
So, she'll turn both of them into
solids, and both of

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.000
them into liquids.
 [VIDEO BEGINS]

00:25:14.000 --> 00:27:27.000
He did. He did.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Did you see that?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Pay attention.
 [VIDEO ENDS]

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
OK, the last thing I am going to
show you is something very peculiar

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
with macromolecules.
I'm going to show you two beakers

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
that contain liquids that are clear
colorless, but in this case,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
green food coloring has been added.
The first one is water. And, when

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
the propeller spins,
you get a vortex. In the case of

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
polymers, at low spin rates,
the same thing happens. At a low

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
spin rate, you'll get a vortex.
At a high spin rate, when the spin

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
rate goes faster, and
these are liquids.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:33.190
We are above glass transition
temperature. But if you try to spin

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.390
too quickly, you get shear dependent
behavior. It's peculiar with long

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.590
chain molecules.
And what happens is,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.790
at very, very high shear rates,
the molecules actually won't slip

00:29:45.790 --> 00:30:05.246
fast enough and they essentially
behave as an elastomer.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:55.400
So, at very high shear rates,
instead of seeing the vortex trough,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:14.533
you see quite the opposite. And
this is called the Weisenberg effect.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.200
And it has to do with the inability
of the molecules to move quickly

00:29:46.200 --> 00:30:11.600
enough over one another.
Let's see what this one looks like.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:28.533
This is a short one. 
[VIDEO BEGINS]

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:30.000
That's water.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:53.520
So there's the Weisenberg effectct.
And this is a very, very high shear

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.050
rates so, the one thing I wish she
had done is turn the speed down.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.580
At a very, very low speeds you
would actually see the vortex form

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.110
because you're asking the molecules
to shear over one another in a slow

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.640
enough rate that they can keep pace.
So, this is very different from

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.170
Newtonian fluids.
This is non-Newtonian flow.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.700
In this, you have to understand if
you're doing such things as

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.230
injection molding of polymers
because they do weird things at very,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.230
very high shear rates.
And let's face it,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.690
if you're in business to make money,
you're not going to be gently

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.150
plunging the piston into the mold.
You want to pop these things out

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.610
quickly. So, there's a lot of
esoteric physics involved.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:40.070
OK, I'm going to hold that there.
What I want to talk about now for

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.530
the last few minutes as the cultural
impact of the advent of polymers.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:32:04.460
In fact, many of these come under
the general rubric of synthetics.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:53.620
These are man-made materials.
These are synthetics. And the real

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:58.240
burst occurred at the dawn of the
20th century. And what I'd like to

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.870
talk about is the pattern of
adoption. And this is something

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.490
that occurs with other materials,
but certainly in the case of

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:12.120
polymers. At first,
it's wonder. They have these

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.740
strange properties that we've seen
some of here. And then,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.370
people go crazy with substitution.
And what we find is that, for

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:40.073
example, the first commercial
polymer was Bakelite.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:30.800
And, Bakelite was used for such
things as billiard balls,

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.600
piano keys, and so on. So you have
what I call the fake everything.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.400
So you have faux ivory, which then
means you can have ivory free

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:58.733
billiard balls,
ivory free piano keys and so on.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.000
With the advent of nylon, you have
fake silk.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:54.610
And so, you have,
instead of using silk,

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:59.220
silk stockings were a luxury
afforded only by the rich.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.840
With the advent of nylon stockings,
there's a democratization. Price

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.460
plummets. Huge social changes take
place. So, all sorts of things take

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.070
precedence that previously couldn't
happen. I think I've got some shots

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.690
here. This is an ad from something
like a Look magazine.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.920
This is Bakelite.
And if you go to grandma's house,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.780
you may even see some of these large
coffee urns. And the handles on the

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.640
side are typically sort of brownish.
These are made of Bakelite. And

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.490
it's a phenolic resin that's made by
carbolic acid with formaldehyde.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.350
So, it's a condensation
polymerization.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:41.210
And, the note the symbol here for
Bakelite. Bakelite,

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.070
there's a B with an infinity sign
underneath it, the material

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.180
of a thousand uses.
And, these are all substitute parts

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.560
that were previously made of metal
or wood now being made of Bakelite.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.930
By now, I mean 1910, 1915. So: big
change. And, plus,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:02.300
certain parts that used to be made
of metal are now being made of

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.680
Bakelite, which is an electrical
insulator. And for electrical

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.050
applications in certain instances,
you do not want the ability of that

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.430
part to conduct electricity.
So, that's the sort of thing that

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:19.810
takes place. And then,
we have new uses, new products,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.810
new devices.
And then, here's a shot from Fortune

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.430
Magazine, 1940,
referring to them as plastics.

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:31.060
And I'll explain why in a second.
But all of these new products,

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.680
you've got the telephone here,
fashion, auto parts, footwear, all

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.300
of these different things.
There is LP records. You know this

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.930
is, but years ago there was an
electromechanical device called a

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.560
tone arm with a needle in it.
And it used to play records. Yeah,

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.180
well they were made of vinyl.
Actually they were made

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:53.420
of polyvinyl chloride.
And look at this thing here.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.280
You see this thing? That's a film
strip. Photography had been

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:03.140
invented back in the early 1800s.
The mere fact that you can go to

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.990
the movies is a result of the advent
of macromolecular chemistry.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.850
Without celluloid, there's no way
you could take glass plates and move

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.710
them at 24 frames a second and watch
Star Wars. You just can't do that.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.570
You have to have the ability to put
halide on something that is flexible

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.300
and can be made in long strips.
And, there was no material until the

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.900
advent of polymers.
Why plastic? The general public

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:51.433
refers to these as plastics.
If I go to Shaws, and I'm checking

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:41.100
out and ask me what kind of bag I
want, sometimes I slip and I say I'd

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.690
like the polymer bag.
And they look at me and I say that

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.130
one. [LAUGHTER]
So, it comes from the Greek word

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.390
meaning to shape.
It's a cognate of the word potter.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.660
So, plastikos really means
something that can be shaped.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.930
And, many of these products are
made by processes that involve

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:07.190
starting with polymer that the shape
is changed. And that's it makes it

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.460
so easy to stamp things out.
This is also from the 1940 Fortune

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.730
Magazine. This is A Whole New World.
I don't know if you can read this

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:34.593
definition, but here's an
area called cellulose.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:25.330
There is Nylon Island over here.
There's cast phenolic. I mean, the

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:30.660
whole world: there's the Acrylic
Mountains. Everything is polymer.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.990
I recall seeing in an antique shop
a ladies Waltham watch made here in

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:41.330
Waltham, MA in 1922: platinum case
encrusted with diamonds.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:46.660
The crystal was made of acrylic.
Acrylic has very poor scratch

00:36:46.660 --> 00:37:04.520
resistance, but acrylic was
an advanced material.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
And by golly, there were going to
make it out of acrylic.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
It's an advanced material.
And it keeps going and going.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Here we are after World War II.
This is Plastics: the Future Has

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Arrived. First,
it doesn't look like anything.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It looks like abstract art.
Actually, this is a room.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
This is an entire room made of
sprayed polyurethane foam.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
This is 1968, people going crazy
over polymers.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:24.880
But then, people come to their
senses and this book here documents

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.770
quite nicely sort of the next stage
which is the chagrin.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.660
And for that I want to take you to
a piece of iconic filmmaking when

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.550
people are starting to wonder what's
the real future of polymers?

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:52.100
[VIDEO BEGINS]

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:53.600
This could be you three years from
now. He's just graduated from

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:59.190
college and he's coming home.
[LAUGHTER] That's a young Dustin

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.446
Hoffman in 1968.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:13.000
OK, now this is the scene. Watch.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:39:13.000
That's Angela Lansbury.
 [VIDEO ENDS]

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:37.220
Well, in point of fact,
that's so ironic. By 1968,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.440
it's not true to say that there was
such a great future in plastics

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.660
because people started to realize
the next thing about,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.880
which is the concern. And,
what's the concern? Well, I've

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:55.300
already talked about recycling.
But, there are other concerns.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:01.900
And they all come from this:
environmental safety and health.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:19.500
We know about the environmental,
the difficulty to recycle. And,

00:39:48.500 --> 00:40:15.100
that's a challenging problem to this
day when it comes to thermosets.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:21.690
And, even the ones that are
recycled, there's this concept:

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:27.250
recycle as opposed to reuse.
We recycle polyethylene

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:31.750
terephthalate.
But I hope you didn't think that

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.250
this goes back on the supermarket
shelves in about 20 days as another

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.750
bottle containing dish wash
detergent. There is a

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:53.766
cascade of utility.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:54.660
So, you start off with something of
high-value, and it gets shredded

00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:00.330
maybe as carpet fiber.
Then you end up with something that

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.990
could get molded into a park bench.
But, the value keeps going lower,

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:11.660
and lower, and lower.
So, this is still a thorny issue

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:17.330
when it comes to much of polymers.
And then, of course, they are not

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:34.993
degradable in landfill.
Why? Strong covalent bonds.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:27.610
Very difficult: so that's the E.
And, let's talk about the H -

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:32.220
health. We saw the Weisenberg
effect. In order to facilitate the

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.840
processing of polymers,
we add lubricants, what is

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.460
effectively a lubricant to enable
the polymer, the long chain

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.070
molecules to more easily slip over
one another. And,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.690
these additives are called
plasticizers. So, they

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.070
facilitate slip.
And, these are low molecular weight

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.210
organics. So,
if they are low molecular weight,

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.350
and they are organic, they have
vapor pressure.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.490
They have a very,
very low melting point,

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.640
low boiling point. So, they are
volatile. And,

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.780
when you are finished processing,
you like to get most of them out.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.920
But, they are embedded inside
macromolecular solids.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.260
And they take time.
That new car smell that you smell,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.790
that's plasticizer. And, you'll
smell it until the last of the

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.330
plasticizer is out.
And the trouble with some of these

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:37.860
plasticizers is that they have
structures that are similar to

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.390
certain hormones.
And, so they can be ingested and

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.930
over certain periods of time could,
I underline could, it's very

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:51.460
difficult to prove direct
cause-and-effect,

00:42:51.460 --> 00:43:11.120
but they are becoming increasingly
suspect in genetic disorders.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:43:00.730
So down the road,
25 years down the road,

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:05.470
you might find that people who have
been exposed to these could be the

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.200
bearers of more tumors than the
general population.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.940
One commonly used one dioctyl
pthalate. This is one of the most

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.680
commonly used lubricants.
And, I talked about the

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.410
democratization,
the faux silk, giving rise to nylon

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.150
stockings for everybody,
but those early pictures of polymers

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:33.890
as this wonder material,
by the time this movie was made,

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.630
people were starting to use the term
plastic to be synonymous with cheap,

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.250
with shoddy, with junk.
Plastic didn't have the connotation

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.750
that it had when the watch with the
acrylic crystal was made.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:52.250
Things had changed a lot.
And part of it had to do with this

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.750
recyclability.
Look at this. This is the annual

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.250
production of polymers: about 100
billion pounds,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:05.750
50 million tons,
and only about three to four million

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:10.250
tons recycled.
And, by recycled I mean returned.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:14.750
You might ask me, well, why is it
that if you can't reuse this

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.250
directly do they make it recyclable?
And, the answer is if this were not

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:23.750
recyclable and the aluminum can is
recyclable, people would not buy

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.080
aluminum cans bearing soda.
They would buy only polymer because

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.240
they wouldn't want to pay the five
cent deposit. This is human nature.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.410
So, once we decide to recycle any
beverage container we must demand a

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:40.580
five cent, or whatever it is,
deposit is across the board.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.740
Otherwise people will base their
purchases on the one that is least

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.910
environmentally friendly because it
doesn't have the deposit on it.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.930
That's a policy issue for you.
Three to four million tons recycled.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.790
Steel, US annual production is 140
million tons, about three times that.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.660
80 million tons is virgin metal,
and about 60 million tons recycled

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.530
scrap, a lot of recycling.
Steel is the most recycled material

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:08.390
by far. You might say,
well, what about aluminum?

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:12.260
I heard aluminum was. Yeah,
you heard it from the aluminum

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.130
industry. There is 4 million tons
of aluminum capacity in the United

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:34.860
States, about one million
tons recycled.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:24.280
And most of it is thanks to the used
beverage containers.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.570
But this is a very special
situation because this is made of

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:32.850
three different alloys that were
designed for the environment,

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:37.140
DFE, designed for the environment.
They were chosen, the constituents

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.420
of those alloys were chosen to allow
for recycling.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.710
So, they contain only aluminum,
silicon, and magnesium. And these

00:45:45.710 --> 00:46:05.420
will melt down and allow to be
reprocessed very, very easily.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:54.710
But, I like to give the example,
I could take the door off a 1928

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:59.420
model T Ford, throw it into an
electric arc furnace,

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.140
melt it down, reshape it,
and put it on a 2005 t-bird,

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.850
the same steel. I cannot take the
wing off a McDonnell Douglas DC-3

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:13.570
aircraft, it's aluminum,
melt it down, and put it on

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.280
tomorrow's Boeing 777 because
different alloys are used in the top

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:36.093
of the wing and the
bottom of the wing.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.500
One set contains copper aluminum.
The other set contains zinc

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.000
aluminum. And when you co-melt that,
you end up with a mix that's neither

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.500
fish nor fowl,
and aluminum's reactivity is so

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.000
great that to separate the copper
and the zinc is either impossible or

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.500
too costly. So,
too costly is equivalent to

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.000
impossible, OK?
So, what's the conclusion?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.500
You end up with the virgin metal.
So, I think this is a good place to

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.833
stay with these wonderful materials
and I'll see you on Wednesday.
