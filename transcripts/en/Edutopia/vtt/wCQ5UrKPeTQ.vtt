00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.900
- We're testing for tilapia, right?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.870
And you should have about the same volume

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.920
in everything, right?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.343
I think the impact of having
my students do citizen science

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.130
and investigations that are connected

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820
to the real world, the knowledge sticks.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.130
There's something that relates to them.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.500
They learn that knowledge is bigger

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.671
than just academic classes.

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:25.504
(equipment clicks)

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.600
- [Female Student] So
just click Run Test now?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.403
- [Sheri] Yep, and now just leave it.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:37.180
- So the string theory model

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.600
of education is a discovery process

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.430
for kids to be exposed to both
the arts and the sciences.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.250
The students interact
with artists in residence,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.140
scientists in residence, and
entrepreneurs in residence

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.030
to give them real world experiences

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.950
they wouldn't receive elsewhere.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.090
- In STEM, we do a lot of things

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.260
that connect with the real world.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.410
This year, we started to do DNA and PCR,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.140
which is polymerase chain reaction.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.863
We bought fish from local restaurants.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:06.650
- And we were just testing whether or not

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.950
the restaurants are actually serving us

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.710
what they are saying they're serving us.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.780
- Last week, we picked eight

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.560
different restaurants that you guys go to,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.410
many of them are in south Philadelphia.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.930
And over the weekend we picked up samples

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.020
of white tuna and red snapper.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.330
So this is a unit about our food

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.100
and what might be in our food

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.521
or how our food is produced.

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:35.010
Overfishing and replacement
of different types of fish

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.660
in seafood is becoming a very big problem.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.270
- Tuna is commonly replaced with escolar,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.680
red snapper is commonly
replaced with tilapia.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.290
And people don't know about that.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.670
- Some people can have a very
adverse reaction to escolar.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.020
So that's why it's a
little bit problematic.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.450
The idea is to apply a lot

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.350
of the molecular biology
techniques that we learned

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.820
to their own environment.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.970
We're gonna use the Biomeme devices.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.320
We have a partnership

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.120
with a start-up

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.850
technology company called Biomeme.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.530
They have a very mobile device

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.790
that they use for a lot of
field work and citizen science.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.470
- It's a portable thermocycler

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.990
that allows you to test
DNA wherever you are.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.620
So you don't have to be a scientist

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.100
to test the environment.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.870
The person with the swab
is going to gently touch

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.530
the clean cut surface of the fish.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.045
You're going to stick it into the tube

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.980
and you're going to
twirl it around a bunch.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.400
This is the most crucial part

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.900
to make sure that you get enough DNA.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.334
Now, hold up your strip of tubes.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.000
We're gonna take 10 microliters

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.480
of the DNA you just extracted
and put it in the middle well.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.160
- We want to make sure
that students understand

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.022
that you need to control your experiments.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:43.640
So they have a positive control,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.250
we have escolar DNA
that they put in there.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.824
Their middle one is their sample,

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:50.568
and then the one on the right is water.

00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:53.630
- Once you've pipetted
it into that last well,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.873
our samples are gonna sit in here.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:59.860
- The Biomeme device pulls
the DNA from each sample.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.620
You can hook up your phone to it

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.037
and there's an app where you
can run it in half an hour

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:07.450
for the test results to come back.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.540
- DNA is double stranded.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.460
Through the process, we heat it up,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.470
and it splits apart into two even strands.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.498
So we have the base pairs of one strand,

00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:18.580
and the we test it with one
strand of the escolar DNA,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.588
and if it matches together
to make two whole strands,

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:23.003
it's positive for escolar.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.590
- So our positive control
is positive, which is good.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.920
So now here's our test.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.753
What do you think?

00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:30.235
You tested positive for what?

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:31.590
- [Female Student] Escolar.
- [Other Students] Escolar.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.550
- [Sheri] Escolar, okay.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.262
- [Dominque] So overall,
over 50% of our tests

00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:39.864
came back positive for mislabeling.

00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:42.570
That corresponds with a bunch of articles

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.160
that we've been reading up on.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.260
Other people have been
doing the same experiment,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.400
and they're getting the same result.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.380
- So is that what you guys expected?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.213
- No.

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:53.611
I thought they just
wouldn't switch that much.

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:56.450
- [Sheri] It's a pretty big number, right?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.430
- Say I was allergic to tilapia
and then they replaced it,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.230
and I thought I was buying red snapper.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.560
Can I sue them for that?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.410
- They might not know,
and they're skating--

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.505
- Maybe they're getting fooled

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:06.338
by the people--
- Yeah, they're getting fooled

00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:08.170
rather than us.
- Who're giving them the fish.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.270
- Because these were
restaurants that they go to

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.400
or they have some sort
of personal connection

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.980
to the people that work there,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.460
I think that brings this extra piece

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.560
into figuring out what to do with data

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.896
to be ethical and
thoughtful and have empathy.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.030
- I wouldn't want to ruin the business,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.577
I would wanna inform them.

00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:29.224
But if they know about
that, that's a problem.

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:32.820
- That does matter, what we did today.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.200
People have the right to know
what they're actually eating.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.540
- I think that is pretty
interesting that kids

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.830
in a classroom are able to find
out such great information.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.500
We could do something that could change

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.560
how restaurants produce their food,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.440
where they get their food
from and label everything.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.340
- You can design different primers

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.640
and investigate beef patties

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.435
or identify genetically
modified organisms.

00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:59.679
The whole idea about citizen science

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.688
that you can actually do
your own investigations.

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:06.070
They understand the value
of what we're doing,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.657
that it's not just in the classroom,

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:10.472
it applies beyond the classroom.

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:12.303
- Great, yes that looks excellent.
