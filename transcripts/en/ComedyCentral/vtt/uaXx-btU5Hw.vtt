LITTLE GAME-- AND BY THE WAY,

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.974 line:91%
ALEX WAGNER HAD THE RUN, SO WE
HAVE THE LOVELY LINDA PICATTI

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:12.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
FROM OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE JOINING
US.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.014 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT, LINDA,
WHAT'S YOUR LAST MEAL?

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:20.586 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MY LAST MEAL WOULD HAVE TO BE
POPEYE'S SPICY.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
&gt;&gt; Larry: I LIKE THAT.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.559 align:start position:0% line:91%
I LIKE THAT YOU WENT FOR THE
SPICY FOR YOUR LAST MEAL BECAUSE

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE LIKE INDGESTION, WHO
CARES?

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.996 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.863 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT WAS YOUR CRIME?

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.866 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'M A VERY LOW-TECH
PERSON.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.503 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I HATE IS
BEING IN CROWDS, FAMILY,

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
FRIENDS-- WHATEVER-- AND
EVERYONE'S CONNECTED TO THEIR

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.007 align:start position:0% line:85%
PHONE.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.845 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO ONE'S, YOU KNOW--
&gt;&gt; WE'RE LIKE BONNIE &amp; CLYDE.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:46.612 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I KNOW.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.082 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO ONE IS TALKING TO EACH
OTHER.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.050 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYONE IS CONNECTED TO THEIR
PHONE.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.187 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOU KNOW THAT EXPRESSION TO
BLOW UP THE PHONE.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.556 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL I DID.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD!

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:04.063 line:85%
SHE BLEW UP HER CONTACT LIST.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.398 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN!

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.168 align:start position:0% line:91%
GO AHEAD AND REACH IN AND SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.137 line:85%
REACH INTO THE "BAG OF DEATH."

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.607 size:84% position:42% line:85%
LICKED TO DEATH BY PUPPIES.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, LICKED TO DEATH BY
PUPPIES.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start position:0% line:85%
AT LEAST IT'S NOT CATS.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.045 align:start position:0% line:85%
BECAUSE THAT'S-- YEAH.
