&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.250
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
Good afternoon.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.550
Buenas tardes.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.020
My name is Georgette
Dorn and I'm the head

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.270
of the Hispanic Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.380
It is a great pleasure to
welcome this wonderful symposium

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
to the library and a great
honor for the Hispanic Division

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.230
to have you all here,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.810
and especially welcome is
Professor Serge Gruzinski,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.270
who is an eminent historian.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.140
The Hispanic Division
is the home of 170--

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.840
The library has 170
million items.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.300
Of those, 14 million
relate to up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330
to Latin America,
Spain and Portugal.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.720
The Hispanic Division is
also the home of the Handbook

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.500
of Latin American Studies,
which is a scholarly resource

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.120
to study Latin America.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.830
It is also the home
of the Archive

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.130
of Hispanic Literature on Tape.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.730
We have recorded 750 authors
until today and we're adding 50

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.260
of those a year online.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.510
Welcome. Thank you.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:20.140
[ Applause ]

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.440
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: Thank
you, Georgette.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.520
Thank you all for coming on this
[inaudible] Friday afternoon

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.750
in the last day of March.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.050
I'm Ralph Bauer.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.530
I'm at the University
of Maryland

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.990
and I'm currently the convener

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.440
of the Early Americas Working
Group, which is a group

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.790
of local Early Americanists
that coordinates

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.540
and organizes events relating
to the early Americas.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.010
So it's my distinct pleasure
to welcome you to the symposium

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.760
"Mestizaje, Hybridity and
Cultural Entanglements

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.060
in Colonial Latin America"

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.270
with a keynote addressed
by Serge Gruzinski.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.220
First of all, I'd like
to thank Georgette Dorn

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.430
and Talia Guzman-Gonzalez
and the Hispanic Division

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.780
of the Library of Congress,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.490
as well as the Hispanic
Cultural Society

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.870
for hosting this event today.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.400
Also, I'd like to thank the
Kislak Family Foundation

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.600
for their generous
support of this symposium,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.820
as well as of our initiatives,
the group's initiatives here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.190
over the last several years.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.300
And of course, also, I'd like to
thank the Early Americas Working

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.260
Group for helping to
co-organize this event.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.270
Finally, also the University
of Maryland at College Park

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.220
for their administrative
support.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.710
So, we're going to proceed
in two different panels today

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.380
and then those will be--

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.460
We'll take a break in
between the two panels

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.190
and then we'll finally conclude

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.590
with our keynote
address at the end.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.880
So I think-- Are we all
set with the PowerPoints?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.180
That's great.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.870
OK. So I think we'll just stick
with the original order then.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.170
So our first speaker
today in the first panel,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.520
which will be dealing with
Mesoamerica in the first panel,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.620
our first speaker will be Joan
Bristol, an associate professor

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.020
of history at George
Mason University.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.940
She's the author of numerous
articles that have appeared

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.520
in edited collections
and such journals

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.940
as "Boletín del Archivo General
de la Nación" and the "Journal

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.310
Of Colonialism And
Colonial History" as well

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.590
as of a monograph entitled,
"Christians, Blasphemers,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.910
and Witches: Afro-Mexican
Ritual Practice

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.730
in the Seventeenth
Century" which was published

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.590
by the University of New
Mexico Press in 2007.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.150
She's now working on a
new book about pulque.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.970
And I think this presentation
is drawn from that new project

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.940
as her presentation is
entitled "Mixing Pulque

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.410
and Drinking Coyotes
in Colonial Mexico".

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.710
So, Joan.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.010
&gt;&gt; Ralph?

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.310
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: Yes.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.330
[Inaudible] Maybe
later for the Q&amp;A.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.400
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.370
We're ready.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.670
So--

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.780
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: OK.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.080
Which one?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.380
Thank you very much for coming.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.820
Thank you, Ralph,
for inviting me

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.560
and I'm really happy to be here.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.060
Today I'm going to talk
about the way that pulque,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.540
a fermented beverage, was used
as a way to talk about race

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.740
and especially about indigeneity
in the colonial period in Mexico

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.840
in a way that has
resonance for the present.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.800
And I should say that the
remarks are drawn from a chapter

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.160
that I wrote for
an edited volume

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.610
that I think Marcy [assumed
spelling] wrote the introduction

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.120
for, called "Substance and
Seduction: Ingested Commodities

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.260
in Colonial Mesoamerica, the
Atlantic World and Beyond"

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.510
which was edited by Kathryn
Sampeck and Stacy Schwarzkopf.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.300
So it will be coming
out in print.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.600
But it's also a work in progress

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.960
because it is part
of a larger book.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.770
So, pulque is an alcoholic
beverage, which is made

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.080
by fermenting the sap
of the maguey plant,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.690
which is also called the agave,
and here we have a picture.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.110
And then this is--
And then this is a--

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.380
This is a picture
of a [inaudible],

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.290
a person who is taking the
sap from the maguey plant

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.150
through a gourd and then the
sap will be made into pulque.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.530
Mesoamericans have been drinking
pulque for probably millennia.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.860
There is some debate
about how old it is.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.710
Although its popularity has
waxed and waned, particularly

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.600
in the past hundred years or so.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.430
Pulque is quite perishable
so it usually only last

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.310
for a few days, maybe
up to a week

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.410
after it's finished fermenting.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.970
Although recently some
companies have begun canning it

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.940
for export.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.570
And so here we have
Pulque La Lucha,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.870
and we'll come back to that.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.810
The alcohol level varies,
so I think it can be

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.780
as low as 2 to 3% alcohol.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.220
I looked at public health
records from the early nine--

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.370
the early 20th century in
Mexico City, and there,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.330
the alcohol content
seemed to be like 3 to 4%.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.130
I think that this canned
pulque is 5% alcohol.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.760
So probably for as long as
people have been talking

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.880
about pulque, they've
been arguing about issues

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.670
of moderation and abuse.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.420
So in the 1540s, friar
Toribio de Motolinia said

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.090
that pulque made indigenous
people "violently drunk

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.970
and accordingly more
cruel and bestial".

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.030
Although he then went on
to say, actually, however,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.460
if taken with moderation,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.110
pulque is wholesome
and very nutritious.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.750
And this is this
contrast you see

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.110
in a lot of-- I have
many examples.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.370
So you can see here
in this quotation,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.270
in addition to the issues
of moderation and abuse,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.140
you can see that Spaniards,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.520
as well as indigenous people saw
this as an indigenous product

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.430
that was consumed by indigenous
people, although in fact

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.980
like everybody drink it in
many different settings.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.540
This multilinea quotation
also points to the fact

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.340
that colonial chroniclers
tended to discuss pulque

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.660
through categories of
order and disorder,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.910
purity and mixture
and health and vice.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.490
So as Mary Douglas and
others have explained,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.150
these sorts of ideas
about purity

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.110
and pollution are often
used to maintain boundaries

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.290
and reinforce social
hierarchies.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.780
And this connection
between purity

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.130
and social order is
particularly obvious

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.120
in colonial debates
over mixed pulque.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.450
So, pulque sellers mixed pulque
with all kinds of things,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.680
with fruit, with meat,
occasionally with peyote

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.370
and with herbs and
different kinds of roots.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.150
And so for Spanish
officials, pure pulque,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.580
which they called pulque blanco
or like literally white pulque,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.740
pulque blanco was tolerable.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.820
I mean, sort of more or less
tolerable in different times,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.500
but overall, generally
tolerable.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.120
But mixing it with
anything made it bad

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.020
in the eyes of Spanish
officials.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.130
As early as 1529, Spanish
officials prohibited the sale

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.170
of pulque mixed with
any other ingredient

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.990
and this regulation continued
throughout the colonial period.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.650
So viceregal decrees of 1535,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.850
1671 and 1792 prohibited
yellow pulque and which--

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.680
and they called yellow
pulque corrupt.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.270
And they defined this yellow
pulque as having "the root,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.360
the raiz that strengthens
it, causing drunkenness

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.200
that is dangerous to health
and to good customs and from

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.930
which come the crimes,
sins, and abominations

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.640
that we see continually."

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.250
So these decrees proclaimed

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.180
that public stands must sell
only pulque that was "pure

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.120
and clean" of all confection,
mixture, root or corruption.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.420
And the root that
they were talking

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.720
about was palo de timbre.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.260
And this is well
not-- like I googled.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.900
I googled palo de
timbre and this came

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.900
up on a culinary website.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.650
So this is a plant that is still
used to speed up fermentation.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.360
And according to this culinary
website, all different parts

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.540
of it can be used to speed
fermentation, still are used.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.100
So it could be the leaves,
it could be the branches.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.310
So I don't know, when they
say raiz or root, I don't know

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.610
if they're really
talking about the root

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.910
or if the branch maybe was used.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.210
It don't look like a
root, but they're talking

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.510
about this palo de timbre.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.940
So, palo de timbre was
mentioned in many other texts,

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.600
including the 1681 Recopilación
de leyes de los reinos de

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.240
Indias, the compilation
of the colonial laws.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.510
And the Recopilación warned
against the damaging effects

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.650
of "introducing ingredients
to pulque that are noxious

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.000
to spiritual and
temporal health".

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.170
Legislators describe the
Indian practice of "mixing it

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.390
with certain roots, boiling
water and lime which makes it

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.980
so strong that it makes them,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.840
indigenous people,
lose their senses".

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.150
Then they went on--
"Then being alienated,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.050
they commit idolatries,
make ceremonies

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.680
and Gentile sacrifices."

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.260
So it's not just that Spanish
officials tolerated the

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.240
consumption of pure
or white pulque,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.450
but they actually made money
from its sale, so they had like,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.030
you know, skin on the game.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.320
In 1668, the crown established
the asiento de pulque.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.090
They named an administrator
to collect pulque taxes.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.670
And then in 1763,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.560
pulque taxation became
the responsibility

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.520
of the Real Hacienda
or the royal treasury.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.110
So this seems somewhat
paradoxical.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.310
So if collecting tax money was
the primary concern of crown

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.260
and viceregal authorities,
why would they ban the sale

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.840
of mixed pulque, from which
they could also make money?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.800
So it's not surprising
that officials would want

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.250
to prohibit the sale of pulque
with like things like peyote

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.840
or maybe other kinds
of materials

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.360
that had obvious
pharmacological properties.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.400
And in fact Daniel Nemser, who
has written about these issues

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400
for the late 17th century,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.960
has shown that Spaniards
actually thought of pulque

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.760
that had been mixed
with certain materials

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.220
as fundamentally altered and
different from pulque blanco.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.520
So he quotes a theologian

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.310
as using the term
transubstantiate

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.610
to talk about this.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.240
So this is a material
that's totally different.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.390
But we might ask what's the
problem with adding fruit

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.690
or meat or other kind--

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.990
you know, adulterating it
in other kinds of ways.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.460
So the fact that officials were
not profiting from all pulque

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.000
but were in fact trying to
discourage the consumption

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.140
of some pulque suggest that
pulque regulations have to do

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.700
with concerns that were
not strictly financial.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.940
So I want to suggest
that the reason

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.280
that Spanish officials
prohibited mixed pulque was

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.050
at least in part because
of its mixed nature.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.350
So we know very well

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.370
that Spaniards valued
purity of blood.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.190
So to have high status or
to occupy certain positions,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.970
you had to prove that you had
limpieza de sangre or, you know,

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.390
translated as purity of blood.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.710
Meaning, really,
that you could prove

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.210
that you are an old Christian
but it's sort of in--

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.180
in sort of in fact kind of meant

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.080
that you could prove
you're of European descent.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.830
Presumably, Spaniards also look
for purity in the substances

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.120
that went into physical bodies.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.830
And so my favorite example
to describe this conjunction

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.200
of ideas about pulque and
ideas about blood lineage comes

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.400
in a set of responses to a
survey of drinking habits

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.830
that the viceregal
government sent out in 1783.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.940
And so there is a survey, what
do you drink, what's it made

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.240
out of, when do you drink it.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.600
And so this yielded a great list
of alcoholic drinks, you know,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.290
saying where these things were
drunk and what went into them

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.590
and this kind of thing.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.110
And so most of these
recipes were sort

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.550
of neutrally explanatory.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.710
So, for example, to make a drink
that is called mantequilla,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.740
which in this period I think
would translate literally

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.040
as lard.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.340
I don't know why it's
called mantequilla.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.610
But informants reported that
they "mixed" aguardiente

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.240
or distilled alcohol,
and pulque and sugar

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.540
or some other sweetener.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.580
So this was a mixture but
this is reported in a sort

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.260
of matter of fact way.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.880
In this list, a drink
called coyote stands out.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.370
So, coyote was "composed of
inferior pulque, dark honey

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.270
and palo de timbre," this plant,
"and putting it in an infusion,

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.540
it gets stronger and people
drink it although it's

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.840
very harmful".

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.140
And the term is nocivo.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.130
The term always-- I
translated it I think as noxious

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.260
at one point and then I
translated it as harmful

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
but it's always-- it's
almost always nocivo.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.560
So that's interesting.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.470
You know that this word is
like through the century sort

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.020
of repeated in relation to
this mixed, mixed pulque.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.680
So the name of this
drink, this--

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.470
the name coyote is striking.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.380
In the eight-- as
you I'm sure know--

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.730
In the 18th century the
term coyote was used

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.830
to describe a person of mixed
descent, theoretically one

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.680
who is three quarters indigenous
and one quarter Spanish.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.080
So liquid coyote-- and OK, I did
have a slide, I can remember.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.900
So liquid coyotes and human
coyotes then were both

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.760
characterized by mixture.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.520
So the description of the
beverage coyote as harmful

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.330
and low grade recall some
contemporary Spanish ideas

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.650
that castas or people of
mixed racial background,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.570
including so called
coyotes were inferior,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.120
dangerous and disorderly.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.190
So in 1763, the Capuchin
chronicler Francisco de Ajofrín

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.980
wrote, "lobos, [inaudible]
and coyotes,"

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.320
these are these categories
of mixed people,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.410
"are fierce people
of bizarre customs."

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.260
This is not the only kind
of depiction of these castas

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.560
or these mixed people.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.070
So I brought these
caste paintings

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.600
because they show people
drinking pulque so you can sort

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.760
of see what it might have,
you know, been like in action.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.920
But you can also see that these
are paintings of mixed people

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.970
but they show the sort of
harmonious family unit.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.750
And then those of you to whom
I spoke before this know--

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.720
and was like sort of confused
because the caste painting

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720
that we have on our program
today actually doesn't have

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.020
[inaudible] so I don't
know what that means,

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.200
but we can talk about that.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.160
So the connection
between lineage--

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.030
sorry, liquids and
lineage is clear

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.670
in the 1611 Spanish dictionary
in which the noun mezcla

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.170
or mixture was defined as
"the incorporation of a liquid

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:53.140
with another" and its verb form,
this dictionary defined mezclar,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.830
the verb to mix as meaning
"to unite diverse things".

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.660
And then the example
was "to mix lineages

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.000
when some lineages are mixed
up with others that are not

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.760
of the same calidad or quality".

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.010
The dictionary went on to say--

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.190
and we say it is a thing
without mixture when it's pure.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.220
So, purity, mixture, process.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.680
Calidad use-- the word
used in the 1611 dictionary

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.250
in a general way, meaning sort
of quality or type was also used

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.540
to indicate social status
in the colonial period.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.370
So there are several ways to
approach the Spanish fears

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.340
about these mixed drinks.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.230
So first, these kind of--

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.710
these rules in legislation
reflect a sort

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.600
of material solution
to fears about mixing.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.310
So Spanish officials feared
that the mixing of liquids

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.190
and other ingredients
in pulque drinks

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.130
because of resulting inebriation
could lead to the mixing

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.070
of bodies, and ultimately the
mixing of blood, both in terms

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.980
of like the bloodshed
that comes from violence,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.730
and also the mixing of
lineages that could, you know,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.530
happen when people had
sex with each other

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.370
and had kids together.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.420
So possibly through pulque
fuel the sexual relations.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.320
So we've seen example of
these in the ban of sales

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.400
of all pulque after the 1692
bread riots in Mexico City.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.120
So in this-- right after
these riots, officials claimed

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.360
that the insurrection had
been planned in pulquerias

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.930
and then they banned
pulque briefly.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.800
There was like a little bit of
a disagreement between the crown

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.050
and the viceregal government.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.460
And Daniel Nemser, this person I
have mentioned before has talked

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.450
in at length about this-- he
wrote an article about this.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.760
He said the study of mixed
pulque offered a lead

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.040
to language for talking
about race mixing, mestizaje,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.680
while simultaneously
constituting pulque consumers

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.040
as a seditious collective
subject, a plebe defined,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.410
like pulque, by mixing.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.580
So he's talking about
this issue in this period.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.670
So as Nemser's work indicates,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.520
this worry about mixing pulque
was also a manifestation

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.650
of biopower, biopolitics
in the way

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.500
that Foucault has
talked about it.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.870
So by claiming to
protect colonial residents

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.130
from the disorderly
effects of mixing pulque,

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.370
the state was trying to control
their bodies and their actions

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.170
and it was then also
another way to sort

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.870
of perpetuate this discourse as
of-- about mixing as undesirable

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.590
and corrupting and bad.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.220
Spanish officials
were not only worried

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.590
about Spanish identity
being adulterated, however,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.890
but they were also worried

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.630
about indigenous identity
being adulterated.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.120
And we see this like
all over the place.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.470
So we see this in regular
decrees prohibiting Spaniards,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.510
blacks and castas, mixed people,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.980
from living in indigenous
villages.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.090
And we also see this in
the two republic idea,

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.040
the idea that the colonial
world should be split up sort

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.430
of juridically and
also spatially

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.370
into the republica de indios
and the republica de Espanol.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.330
Although it's like only a
fantasy, it never works.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.970
So, ideas about pure
Indianness and pure pulque

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.060
and the importance of
maintaining the purity

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.650
of both were linked in crown

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.600
and viceregal policies
limiting the sale

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.920
of the permitted white
pulque to indigenous sellers.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.840
Decrees from 1608, 1635 and
1639 restricted licenses

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.310
for selling pulque
to indigenous women,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.180
although in practice
Spaniards, as well as men

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.980
of different groups were
involved in the trade

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.540
in Mexico City certainly by the
18th century or possibly before.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.420
Religious leaders were
specifically worried

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.750
about Spanish cultural
polluting indigenous people.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.590
In the mid 16th century,

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.300
the friar Diego Duran condemned
mixed pulque writing "today,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.090
what is called pulque made by
Spaniards from the black honey

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.990
and water with the root
in it was never known

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.350
to the ancients," meaning sort

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.020
of the Nahua people
before contact.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.790
He's writing in Central Mexico.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.100
"Nor do they know how to
concoct it until the blacks

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.940
and Spaniards invented it."

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.570
And so this seems to be
the recipe for coyote

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.850
that we see later, much later,
200 years later in the 179--

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.500
in the 1783 text that
I talked about earlier.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.740
Duran and-- goes on to
describe white pulque

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.290
as "their own native wine"
which is lighter and medicinal,

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.470
meaning Nahua people's
native wine,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.700
and then describes this
mixed variant as "diabolical,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.670
stinking, black, potent, rough,
without flavor or taste".

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.220
So, again, so mixture makes
pulque diabolical while white

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.330
pulque is both purely indigenous
and better and more wholesome

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.940
but also kind of
rooted in the past.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.540
In the 1634 Nahua to
confession manual,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.560
Bartolome de Alva addressed
indigenous Mexicans directly.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.030
I mean, sort of, lamenting
that "for a gourd of pulque,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.550
or a cup of wine, you
cast your souls to hell

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.720
and give them to the devil."

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.880
And he claimed that before
contact with Spaniards,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.680
Nahua people, "had
discretion, prudence, fear,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.710
shame and good breeding,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.920
but he said that now they
had been turned into beasts

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.540
by drunkenness and
intoxication."

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.430
So he wrote, "even though the
ancients, your elders, drink--

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.590
excuse me, it was with
moderation and restraint

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.740
as your neighbors, the
Spaniards, do today."

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.570
Which I don't really know
what to make of that but--

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.320
And if by some chance
they sometimes they used

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.620
to discover some drunkard,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.530
they immediately took
away his life for it.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.320
And now in our times, it exists
because nobody restrains you

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.620
with the death penalty.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.190
And this is actually in
reference to this idea

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.480
that comes from the Florentine
Codex that under the Aztecs,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.210
the drinking of pulque
was restricted

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.200
to ritual specialists
and the elderly.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.420
Although it seems that this
was-- this never really--

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.900
This was not really the
case, but there is this--

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.400
people think that
this is the case.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.650
So Duran and Alva then
were idealizing the past,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.820
this Nahua past, and using
pulque as a way to argue

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.310
for the need to protect
but really

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.210
to regulate native bodies.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.630
Yet in reality, of course,

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.670
people and practices
were actively mixing

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.770
in all kinds of ways.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.300
Friar Ilarione da Bergamo,
who is an Italian Capuchin

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.630
who dropped-- traveled
in New Spain

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.900
in the 1760s described
maguey in this way.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.970
So, maguey, the plant, right,
from which pulque comes.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.500
So he says, as you can read,
this plant is also held

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.190
in special esteem by the
Most Blessed Virgin Mary

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.340
because in the year
1540 she appeared

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.530
to an Indian named Juan
de Aguila on the hill

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.680
of Totoltepec, which is not far
from Mexico City, and told him

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.040
that he should look for her
image in the very same place.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.140
After initial efforts he
found in the middle of one

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.940
of these plants a small
statute of the Blessed Virgin

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.060
with her babe in her arms
though it's not known

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.710
from what material it is made.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.160
The Mexicans showed great faith
and devotion to this and in time

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.240
of greatest need they have
a special recourse to it

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.540
through public prayers.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.160
So what does this sound like?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.860
It sounds like the Virgin
of Guadalupe, right?

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.120
So the Virgin of Guadalupe just
nine years before had appeared

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.810
to Juan Diego at Tepeyac
and she, you know,

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.110
appears in this hill

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.720
where Tonantzin was
important, this earlier deity.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.020
This description also calls to
Mayahuel, who is the goddess

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.050
of maguey and pulque depicted
in both the Codex Mendoza

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.870
and then here of an image
from the Codex Borgia,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.520
as a woman with 400 breasts
nursing a baby while sitting

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.830
in a maguey plant.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:40.450
And so, you know, this is how
it's been interpreted, so.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.760
However, pulque was pragmatic--

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.930
was hybrid in a more
pragmatic way as well.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.900
So it's hybrid just because
lots of people drink it

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.290
in many different situations.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:54.090
So the same Italian friar wrote,
today consumption of pulque is

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.070
so widespread that
everyone drinks it.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.370
There are public pulquerias,

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.100
which are like our
public wine shops.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.600
A few years ago, it was not
proper for people with any kind

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.310
of social standing
to go into them

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.020
because entering a place
frequented only by drunks

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.810
and by rabble of
every ilk seemed

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.660
to undercut their
respectability.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.260
Now, people of every
rank frequent them,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.470
and during the time
of my stay in Mexico,

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.070
I observed many carriages and
coaches of gentlemen, ladies,

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.500
merchants and other respectable
people heading to these places.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.300
And this is my favorite part.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.530
As for myself, in the roughly
five years that I resided

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.890
in that country, I could not
get used to drinking that liquor

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.380
because of its foul odor.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.010
Even though Europeans,
after drinking it for two

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.930
or three days became
even more keen on it

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.300
than the local population
itself.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.800
So Bergamo here is obviously
participating in the sort

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.590
of discourse that sees Spanish
creoles as sort of degraded

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.750
because of their
American origins.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.470
But it's also interesting
because it shows--

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.580
and he's saying in this
period but I think it's true

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.320
or it's definitely true early as
well that pulque consumption was

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.510
of course not only limited
to indigenous people.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.910
However, much the discourse
about pulque revolved

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.220
around identifying them as
the primary pulque drinkers.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.520
So ultimately, I'm
interested in the way

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.270
that this colonial
pulque discourse may

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.720
or may not foreshadow
ideas about indigeneity

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.680
and Mexican identity in the
19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.450
So after 21-- I'm sorry,
after 1821, caste distinctions

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.840
and ethnic privileges and
protections were abolished

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.550
by liberal policymakers.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.520
After 1910, mixture
was celebrated.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.860
The idea the Indian as part

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.740
of the cosmic race
really became a linchpin

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.850
for Mexican national
identity and the idea here was

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.150
that the Indian was part

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.260
of the past while the
mestiza was the future.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.890
And I should say going
back to the 19th century,

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.740
Deborah Toner has written
this wonderful book,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.970
which I can't remember
the name of,

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.020
but about the representations
of alcohol and drunkenness

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.130
and the relationship to national
identity in the 19th century.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.410
So that's very good book.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.760
But so the modern-- In
the modernization products

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.290
of the early to mid
20th century,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.590
pulque sort of fell behind.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.330
So the state actually
encourages beer consumption

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.420
over pulque consumption.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.890
Beer was taxed less heavily.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.280
There weren't as many
hygienic regulations.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.740
The state was subsidizing
some of the beer producers.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.660
And in part, this is because
it's seen as sort of modern

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.080
and progressive and clean,
and pulque is characterized

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.140
as not clean in this period.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.780
Now in the 21st century,
pulque is having a resurgence

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.510
as middleclass students and all
kinds of people go to pulquerias

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.900
and it's very, very hip.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.690
That's the word that-- and so
it was used to describe it.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.240
So the New York Times and the
LA Times have had articles

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.010
in their travel sections within
the past five years or so

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.310
which emphasize how
pulque is sort

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.000
of the symbol of Mexicanness.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.370
So much of the current
pulque discourse revolves

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.480
around defining Mexico through
a purely indigenous past.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.320
And so here we have
again Pulque La Lucha.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.390
This is advertised, as you
can see it down there in that

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.580
like ribbon on the bottom, it
says it's older than tequila,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.060
stronger than beer, it's the
original drink of Mexico.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.080
And the website go-- It
claims that the drink

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.380
"survived the ravages
of the European invaders

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.610
for three centuries
prior to the formation

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:53.910
of the Republic of Mexico."

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.200
And I guess none of these
things are really not--

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.590
are untrue, you know, but it--

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.100
but it's sort of the
way they're using it

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.400
to advertise, it's interesting.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.950
The New York Times
describes pulque

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.360
in one these travel
articles, it's "a thick

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.470
and pungent 2000 year
old Aztec drink."

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.590
We know the Aztecs were
not 2000 years old.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.940
And "a toast to the Aztec gods."

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.340
So I'll end by saying
that it's tempting

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.180
to see historical continuities
between the colonial

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.080
and modern idealizations
of indigenous identity

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.500
and the effort to
discursively define Indians

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.870
as pure in both cases.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.500
And that was really where
my emphasis lay, I think,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.490
when I first started
thinking about this.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.070
But when we examine this more
closely, we see a rupture

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.870
with the colonial past as well.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.700
Today's pulque discourse
emphasizes the mixed nature

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.770
of Mexican identity and in many
ways relegates its indigenous

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.650
identity to the past.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.950
However, throughout
the colonial period,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.560
indigenous people
were a central concern

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.330
of the Spanish colonial
authorities and one of the ways

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.630
that Spanish authorities try

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.490
to contain indigenous
people and their economics.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.140
Sorry, and their economic
activities was specifically

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.880
through this pulque discourse.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.680
Thank you.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.500
[ Applause ]

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.550
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: OK.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.290
I'd like to hold the questions
until the end of the panel.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.130
So we'll proceed right
to the next speaker

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.270
who will be Garry Sparks who
is an Assistant Professor

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.330
of Religious Studies at
George Mason University.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.510
His research and teaching
focus on anthropological

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.880
and socio-cultural
and linguistic as well

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.500
as ethnohistorical
understandings

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.820
of theological production
in the Americas,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.010
particularly among
indigenous peoples.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.360
His areas include histories
of Christian thought

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.370
and the theories of
religion and culture,

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.210
religions of indigenous
American peoples,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.460
and the religion
in Latin America.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.230
Since 1995, he has done
human rights work with

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.800
and conducted fieldwork among
the Highland Maya in Guatemala

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.600
and Chiapas in Mexico.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.620
His first book, "The Americas'
First Theologies: Early Sources

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.850
of Post-Contact Indigenous
Religion" is forthcoming

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.810
from Oxford University Press
in August of this year.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.210
He is currently revising his
second book, "Domingo de Vico,

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.630
K'iche' Maya Intellectuals,
and the Theologia Indorum:

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.280
Recovering the Legacy of the
Americas' First Theology,"

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.190
which is under contract,
to be published

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.150
with the University
Press of Colorado.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:16.060
And also, he is completing
with the support of the NEH,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.620
Scholarly Translation
and critical addition

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.650
of the Theologia Indorum, which
will be published in 2020.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.070
His titled-- His talk
today is entitled,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.370
Religiously Appropriating
Indios:

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.210
20th- and 16th-Century
Theological Production from

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.230
and by...well, Indios.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.170
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: Great.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.470
Many thanks.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.770
The title is supposed to be
somewhat of a double entendre

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.790
which I hope will become a
little more clear as we proceed.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.680
And if you had never heard of
the Theologia Indorum before

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.130
in Ralph's nice introduction,
I'll unpack that as well.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:04.460
Based on the use of the term,
since at least the medieval era

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.070
and the application or perhaps
better said, the misapplication

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.230
of Indorum to the Americas,
it served as a catchall phrase

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.680
for all fantastic objects
from an exotic land,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.370
namely its flora, fauna and
peoples, and by extension,

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.630
their rights, customs and laws.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.910
Accompanied with the
emergence of the Spanish Empire

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.480
and its ideology of clean
or pure blood, the category

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.250
of Indio was further relegated
to a pejorative status socially,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.830
politically, as well
as theologically.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.900
And much of the history is
own religion in Latin America

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.550
by focusing on records of
the out of the phase tale

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.530
of early missionaries'
preoccupation for the endurance

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.920
of indigenous religions as
forms of idolatry, witchcraft

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.560
or heresy, especially when
seen as mixed with Christianity

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.730
and thus akin to a
spiritual mysticism.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.350
As a result, many cultural
theories even those sympathetic

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.130
to native peoples like
postcolonialism tend

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.370
to relegate indigenous people to
the options of a simple binary,

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.020
of only being either
overly-romanticized reactionary

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.950
resistors or passive victims

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.170
who are simply coerced
into a new religion.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.070
Thus ironically such
binary options limit

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.150
and undervalue the agency and
reasoning of indigenous peoples,

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.260
both historically and presently.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.440
And yet on the other hand,
the early paper trail written

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.080
in indigenous languages
by both missionaries

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.950
and early indigenous
peoples also drew from--

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.010
oh, excuse me, evinces a
more complex engagement

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.530
of where native peoples and
mendicant missionaries also drew

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.220
from the world views of the
proverbial other to reconfigure,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.260
if not also translate
and maintain their own.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.460
Now among the earliest of these
documents of course written

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.210
by the Highland Maya
in particular

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.620
in Quechan languages is
the Popol Vuh which serves

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.220
for Mayanists and indigenous
activists as a cornerstone

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.280
within a larger body of early
Native American literature.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.580
However, the references

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.890
to Christianity have remained
a perennial puzzle leading some

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.890
scholars to argue that the Maya
authors were resisting either

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.660
Spanish Christendom at large
or the specific practices

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.160
of missionaries in
general, such as preaching

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.950
or doctrinal teaching.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.020
And most of this confusion
lies in the opening lines.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.730
The dates of the Popol Vuh
if you're not familiar,

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.800
redaction dates are
1554 to 1558.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.460
And the first line of the Popol
Vuh, the K'iche' authors state

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.250
that their text is "the root

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.960
of the ancient word",
the ojer tzij.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.670
Only to then juxtapose
their ancient word

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.770
with what they refer to a
few lines later as the talk

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.540
about god, uch'ab'al Dios.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.080
In this way, the K'iche'
authors used Christianity

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.140
and the missionaries "talk about
god" as a foil against which

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.260
to reassert a pre-contact
Maya cosmology.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.950
However, the specific phrase
uch'ab'al Dios was not coined

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.880
by the K'iche redactors
of the Popol Vuh,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.430
but rather they lifted it
from among the writings

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.070
of a Dominican friar,
specifically Domingo de Vico.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.520
In other words, rather than
merely referring to Christianity

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.910
in general in this opening
preamble of the Popol Vuh,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.850
by this phrase the authors
of the Popol Vuh indicate

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.370
that they have read and
are responding directly

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.760
to the first theology
written in the Americas,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.500
Vico's Theologia Indorum.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.110
Of the early mendicant
missionaries,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.900
Domingo de Vico compiled
the first important works

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.500
on numerous Mayan languages
after arriving into the Americas

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.600
in 1544 with over 40 other
Dominican missionaries

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.030
and Bartolome de las Casas.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.040
Within a short time, Vico is
said to have learned no less

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.180
than seven different
Mayan languages.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.730
And one year prior to
his death, in 1555,

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.990
he completed his
Theologia Indorum,

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.930
a theology for the Indians
or theology of the Indians.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.580
Consisting of almost
1000 manuscript pages,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:19.170
divided into 218 chapters
across two distinct volumes,

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.190
Vico's Theologia Indorum
addresses a variety

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.250
of theological, moral
and cultural issues.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.800
And while no first generation

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.140
or even complete
manuscript has survived,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.040
a positively identified
a now 17 partial versions

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.760
in at least three, if not
five different Highland Maya

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.250
languages which allow

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.020
for a complete reconstruction
of the full text.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.950
This is simply a chart of the
size of those manuscripts,

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.530
so more or less, where
they reside mostly

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.870
in Paris and Princeton.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.310
As one of the first generations
of Spanish students to study

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.440
at the University of Salamanca
after the arrival or return

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.970
of Francisco de Vitoria
and the establishment

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.760
of domestic scholasticism
alongside humanism

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.470
as the curricular standard,

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.140
Aquinas's Summa Theologiae
serves

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.410
as both the general
organizing structure

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.210
of Vico's Theologia Indorum
but also the analogical method

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.570
by which Vico strove to
reconcile Catholicism

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.790
with the Maya world view, much
like Aquinas had centuries prior

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.030
but with the Jewish and
Muslim Aristotelianism.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.100
In this compendium
genre of Summa,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.270
Vico presented narrative
summaries of biblical characters

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.340
in a stylic and to the
hagiographic stories

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.970
of the popular Golden Legend.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.670
For example, volume 1 which
Vico finished in 1553 begins

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.970
with the domestic themes of
the names and being of god,

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.860
and continues with
stories and lessons

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.020
of the Catholic Old Testament
while integrating elements

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.990
of Highland Maya
religious material.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.830
The second volume, finished in
early 1554, presents narratives

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.990
of the New Testament and
incorporates standard

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.290
but much more detailed

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.550
than usual catechism material
particularly at a time

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.380
when catechisms were
becoming much more simplistic

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.360
because indigenous
peoples were deemed

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.760
as rudimentary [inaudible],
who just needed

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.700
to memorize their rudimentary
material of doctrine.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.970
In contrast, the
contemporaneous mendicant--

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.510
to other contemporaneous
mendicant text,

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.580
Vico's Theologia Indorum
distinguishes itself

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.670
in four important ways.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.810
First, Vico's theology
is not a translation

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.430
of a previously written
work elaborated in Europe

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.920
and then exported and
translated into Mesoamerica

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.190
but rather explicitly
references Maya rituals

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.870
and narratives based on his
own direct conversation with

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.930
and ethnographic
study among the Maya.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.040
Secondly, the Theologia Indorum
is never in fact ever written,

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.230
let alone translated into
Latin or Castilian Spanish,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.430
what was originally
composed in K'iche.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.900
Thirdly, the Theologia Indorum
is the first known work written

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.100
in either North or South America

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.320
to explicitly declare
itself a theology,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.430
thus intentionally
distinguishing itself in terms

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.020
of genre from its textual peers.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.690
And finally, I think
perhaps most importantly,

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.820
while apparently commissioned
as an aid for priests,

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.880
the primary readers
directly addressed

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.440
in Vico's texts are not fellow
clergy but rather literate Maya

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.680
to whom he refers as ix, you
all and numi'al, nuk'ajol,

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.800
my daughters and my sons,

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.010
by which the Theologia
Indorum then emerges

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.240
as a direct Christian
reply to the Maya

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.570
and their cosmogonic
narratives found

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.320
in text like the Popol Vuh.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.420
Now while Vico's obvious aim
pertains to the conversion

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.460
of the Maya to Catholicism,

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.680
his strategy builds
off an affirmation

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.090
of pre-Hispanic Mayan religion.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.810
In Chapter 25, he argued
against the autonomous mixing

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.300
of Mayan religious practices
with Catholic devotionalism.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.180
But it does not rule
out altogether a mixing

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.720
of Catholic theology and
indigenous devotional practices.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.390
Furthermore, he wrote not
only in the K'iche languages

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.920
in which he makes his argument

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.670
and assumes a literate
Maya readership

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.620
but also used the high register

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.340
of Maya ceremonial
discourse typified

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.190
by elaborate poetic parallelisms
and archaic turns of phrases

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.910
which are traceable to
ancient glyphic text.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.920
A common example of
this is the phrase,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.800
[inaudible] which means
literally, yellowness,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.050
greenness, but it is
more or less a couplet

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.810
or lexical parallelism
for wealth,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.080
and we find this actually
in the hieroglyphic text

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.890
of the classic period.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:36.640
Just as notably, Vico
selected motifs and phrases

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.600
from Maya theogony also
found in the Popol Vuh.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.490
He chose the Maya term for
the other world Xibalba

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.830
that mean hell, and he employed
a Mayan metaphorical language

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.990
of weaving and sewing that
we see in the beginning

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.270
of the Popol Vuh for his
narrative of cosmogenesis rather

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.130
than say, use that
of the biblical book

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.830
which is more language
of pottery

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.080
and smith making--
metalsmithing.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.810
And he selected terms for his
god, like Tz'aqol, B'itol,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.470
the Maker and the Modeler and
Alom, K'ajolom, the Bearer

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.540
and the Begetter over
other phrases also found

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.320
in Maya theogony such as
the Sovereign Plumed Serpent

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.800
or Heart of Earth, Heart of Sky.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.630
And he even refers to his
Christian god explicitly

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.580
as qachuch qaqajaw, our
mother and our father,

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.700
thus modifying the
doctrine of god, the father,

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.780
as the first person or
persona of the triune deity.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.700
Now, in addition
to the Popol Vuh,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.780
beginning in the early
1550s, most certainly 1552,

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.600
Highland Maya began to write
numerous other documents

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.770
in their own languages
and exclusively

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.070
for their own purposes.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.440
They're not for the crown,
not for the audience.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.820
They are not under
editorial control of clergy.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.460
But in the mendicant
script or alphabet

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.700
and employing the
Iberian legal genres,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.790
many of which show
further influence

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.410
of both the Theologia
Indorum and the Popol Vuh.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.370
The Title of Totonicapan
is arguably the third most

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.120
important K'ichean text.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.480
And the first seven folios, 14
pages, consist of a redaction

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.370
of key chapters directly
from the first volume

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.100
of the Theologia
Indorum and even list

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.150
and cites the specific
chapter numbers used beginning

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.560
with Chapter 30 and
the story of Genesis

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.350
in the opening line
of this [inaudible].

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.590
However, within their
autonomous appropriation

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.000
of the Theologia Indorum,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.460
the Title of Totonicapan
further contextualized

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.900
or corrected Vico's
theology by, for example,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.810
specifying that Cain was killed

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.000
in his [inaudible],
his [inaudible].

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.280
And that Moses confronts a
burning Boysenberry Bush,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.330
a toucan, a boundary--
a shrub that's used

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.210
as a boundary marker even to
this day among Highland Maya

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.390
to distinguish property lines.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.480
Details not in the
Theologia Indorum.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.090
Furthermore, by the eight folio
of the Title of Totonicapan,

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:59.440
the authors of that text begin
to integrate myths also found

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.960
in the Popol Vuh as if

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.300
to reconcile the pre-Hispanic
Maya religious narratives

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.250
with the biblical material
presented by Vico and equating,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.150
for example, the mythical
Mesoamerican city of Tolan

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.540
with the biblical
city of Babylon.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.820
Now curiously in contrast with
earlier K'iche writings of 1554,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.940
like the Popol Vuh and
the Title of Totonicapan

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.520
which dates most certainly
to 1554, that is to say both

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.080
of these texts are
written one year

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.190
after Vico finished
the first volume

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:34.090
of his Theologia
Indorum in 1553.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.520
Later independent K'iche
writings actually mentioned Vico

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.760
and his Theologia by name.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.940
For example, the third
title of the [inaudible]

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.890
which states the
1598 also argues

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.600
that the legendary mythological
Maya ancestors made of maize

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.520
by the divine grandmother,
Xmukane,

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.590
according to the Popol
Vuh, are direct descendants

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.310
of the prophets and
the patriarchs listed

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.720
in the Catholic Old
Testament as the Title

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.530
of the Totonicapan did.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.410
Thus via this supposed land
deed, the K'iche Maya argued

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.360
for the validity of their
pre-Hispanic religious

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.590
narratives, ritual
practices and authority

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.800
by not resisting Hispanic
Catholicism like the authors

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.670
of the Popol Vuh did but
rather by grafting onto it.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.230
Furthermore, this
[inaudible] explicitly cites,

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.630
if you notice the last
line, it's cited there,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:27.450
Vico's Theologia Indorum as its
source, which you didn't see

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:34.050
because I didn't advance
the slide, case in point.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.880
Now, unfortunately the
Highland Maya paper trail thins

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.830
out after the 1600s.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.330
And while there is no
evidence that clergy outside

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.130
of the Guatemala Highlands, say
other Dominicans further North

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.700
in Oaxaca, were ever aware of
Vico's theology even there.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.820
Local references [inaudible]
Guatemala and his work

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.190
in ecclesial accounts seem to
peer out by the 19th century.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:02.600
However, as recently as-- by
the mid 1960s, both Catholic

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.780
and Protestant clergy
concerned with social issues,

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.810
issues of social
justice and areas

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.980
with predominantly
indigenous populations,

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.890
like Southern Mexico and
the Andean region began

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.310
to reevaluate the role and value
of culture in large part due

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:20.300
to the influence of
indigenous activists.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.620
While clergy and theologians,
such as some Dominicans, Jesuits

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.370
and Maryknolls but also some
Presbyterians, Methodists

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.250
and Lutherans began
to elaborate a--

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.550
what's called the theology

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.140
of enculturation
alongside the theology

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.920
of liberation even prior

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.750
to the second Vatican
council in the 1960s.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.310
By the 1970s, indigenous
activists

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.590
within various Christian
denominations began

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:45.350
to produce their own
strands of enculturated

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.530
or indigenized Christian
theology

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.450
through various international,
regional

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.690
and highly local workshops aided

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.340
by sympathetic clergy
and bishops often.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.390
Indigenous activists helped to
establish an informal network

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:03.120
of centers, curricula and
publications that argue for ways

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.960
that indigenous religious world
views can constructively engage

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.120
Christian thought and practice.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.370
For example, for various
Highland Maya of Chiapas

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.960
and Guatemala, the wives of
Mayan men ordained as deacons

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.250
in the Catholic Church also
serve as unofficial deaconesses

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.370
in accord with the
cosmogonic principle

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.710
of gender complementarity.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.260
I should be very delicate
on this matter because it--

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.650
there was an incidence
that was investigated

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.940
by then Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger in the diocese

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.110
of San Cristobal de las Casas.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.020
Just-- This is public,
it didn't happen.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.890
The-- And the liturgical

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.590
and hagiographic church
calendars are integrated

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.700
in many parishes with
the 260 day Mesoamerican

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.120
ritual calendar.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.960
Clergy, in many cases Jesuits,
often don't wear habits

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.370
or even the Roman color
but rather the attire

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.780
of traditional Maya
elders in villages.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.810
The Eucharist I've seen
celebrated on a platter

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.590
or patent in the shape
of the back of a turtle,

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.740
therefore referencing the
fertile surface of the Earth

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.500
as well as the constellation
belt of Orion from which Hunahpu

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.610
and Xbalanque emerged with
the resurrected father

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.520
as the god of maize.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.590
And in certain services
scripture readings are often

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.360
paired with or accompanied
by readings

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.730
from the Popol Vuh translated
into other local Mayan languages

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:27.110
such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal and
Q'anjo'bal, thus aligning the

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:32.250
"word of the lord" with the
Maya ancient word, ojer tzij.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.190
As a liberation, this
theological movement,

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.660
but in the hands of modern
indigenous intellectuals,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.430
they struggled for a name
that would not separate them

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.580
from the class analysis
of liberation theology

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.190
or the cultural attentiveness
of enculturation theology,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.520
but simultaneously
would indicate

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.840
that their approach was
distinctively indigenous

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.210
and one shared in common
across the Americas,

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:58.080
across distinct indigenous
languages, world views

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.580
and even national histories

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.370
of oppression unique
to native peoples.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.030
In the end, the term that they
thought best indicated their

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.850
unique condition of oppression,
historical perspectives

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.660
and cultural resources
from which to respond

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.950
as indigenous peoples
that all native peoples

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:18.980
in the America shared
was the category, Indios.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.760
And so, they began a two-fold
effort of, one, reappropriating

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.190
and redefining on their terms
a pejorative category arguably

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.070
much like [inaudible] did with
term mestizo in the 19th century

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.910
for the ideology of La Raza
to elaborate a distinctively

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.230
but hemispherically
Teologia india.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.490
And two, to begin to specify
a move beyond the category

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.870
of Indio for the elaboration
of particular theologies

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:48.340
of distinct peoples like
a particular Maya theology

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:51.780
or even more specific, a K'iche
theology, a Tzeltal theology,

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.070
a Q'anjo'bal theology,
Tzotzil theology, et cetera.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.270
What has been proposed
here is not

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.450
that there is any direct link
between Vico's Theologia Indorum

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.900
and the writings of Highland
Maya elites in the 16th century

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.080
and the current efforts
by indigenous peoples

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.070
to develop Christian
understandings

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.680
on their own cultural
and spiritual terms

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.230
in the movement they
called, Teologia India.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.710
In fact I find it quite ironic
that I can literally count

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.030
on my hand, actually
a couple of fingers,

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.410
the number of academic
Latin Americans involved

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.250
in Teologia India who even know
who Vico is or was and neither

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.380
of them have actually
read anything by Vico

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.340
because they don't know K'iche.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.970
Any explicit textual dots
to connect between the 1550s

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.610
and the 1970s is too
vague and spread thin.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.990
So any legacy of Vico lies
not in the written record

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.560
of later clergy or Maya but
rather at best implicitly

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.170
in the local traditions of
how Maya leaders continued

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.400
to navigate between
their indigenous

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.600
and their Christian
understandings.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.590
But at the very least, a
thicker ethnohistorical context,

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.390
based on intratextual
analysis of the wider corpus

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.050
of K'ichean writings
by both mendicants

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.160
and Maya provides a
diachronic lens through which

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.270
to read current trends in
Latin American religion

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.820
and thus further reevaluate
the continued agency

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.510
and intellect of, well, Indios.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:25.500
[ Applause ]

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.540
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: Thank
you, Garry.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.590
Our third speaker will be
John Tutino who is a professor

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.490
of history and international
affairs as well as the director

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.970
of the Americas Initiative
at Georgetown University,

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.300
where he focuses on the
history of Mexico in the context

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.600
of the Americas in the world,
in particular the history

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.640
of popular communities as
they engaged, colonial rule

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.890
and early capitalism,
national states

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.380
and industrial challenges, as
well as revolutionary promises

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.030
and national developments.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.910
He's the author of many
journal articles, book chapters

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.760
and books including, "From
Insurrection to Revolution

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560
in Mexico: Social Bases

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.950
of Agrarian Violence,
1750 to 1940".

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.120
It's published by Princeton
University Press in 1986.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.590
"Making a New World: Founding
Capitalism in the Bajio

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.650

America" published

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.090
by Duke University
Press in 2011.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.840
And "The Mexican Heartland: How
Communities Shaped Capitalism,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.210

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.190
published by Princeton
this year.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.200
The title of his talk
today is, "An Old Regime

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.960
and a New Economy: A Dynamic
Balance in Spanish Mesoamerica".

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.270
&gt;&gt; John Tutino: Thank you
Ralph for the invitation

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:02.220
and for organizing and to
Georgette for hosting us all.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:08.630
I come as an enormous
admirer of Serge Gruzinski

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:14.170
from his early essays
to the Man-Gods book,

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.300
to colononizacion
de lo imaginario,

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.960
to "The Eagle and the Dragon".

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.550
I can just I have learned
so much and more important,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.510
always been set to
new ways of thinking.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:32.790
Early on, he and I focused I
want to say in different ways

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.120
but on social-cultural
encounters

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.960
in the Mesoamerican core.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.800
More recently, we both
turned to Spain's empire

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.210
and its global role,
again, in different ways.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.300
And I want to say
exactly as it should be.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.020
How dull life would be

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.230
if we were all doing
things in the same way.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:58.950
As to speak today, I
quickly came to two goals.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:03.130
First, I wanted to build on one
of the concepts I most admire

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:07.320
in Serge's work, the
notion of hybridity.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.220
And second, I wanted to take
the chance to offer a preview

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.560
and gain some feedback on
some of my work in progress.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.530
As I thought about it,
because when asked for a title,

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:25.970
you come up with what you think
of it the day you're invited.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.600
In certain ways, a better
title of what I want

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.980
to do today might be simply
called a hybrid political

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:37.980
economy, Spanish
Mesoamerica from 1550 to 1800.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.950
And this comes out of the
fact that I am in the process

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.890
of completing two things.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:47.580
In fact, while "The Mexican
Heartland" book has a 2017 date

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.320
on it, I am-- you have given me
a break from reading the copy

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.880
of the manuscript
today so I want

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.180
to thank you all for that too.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.040
It will not be out
until November.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.290
And because I have the
copyedited manuscript

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:04.490
in front me, if you straight
me out on something pivotal,

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.400
I still have time to tinker.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:12.270
And I simultaneously have just
finished what hopefully is the

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.060
last draft of a manuscript.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.610
I had to get it done
before the copyedits came--

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:20.070
of a book entitled
Mexico City, 1808,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:24.830
which I tell people is the book
no one will believe Tutino wrote

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:32.100
because it is urban,
political and short [laughter].

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.850
And I have never fallen into
any of those traps before.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.340
But I'm trying and I have
succeeded, it's going to publish

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.840
to less than 200 pages
of readable text.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.360
So I count it a triumph.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:52.960
"The Mexican Heartland"
book very much focuses

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.560
on the rural communities of
the basins around Mexico City,

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.820
precisely to distinguish it
from the Bajio that I wrote

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.400
about in making a new world.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.510
The Mexico City book focuses

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.660
on a pivotal moment
of regime change.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.730
From what-- And this is
really what I'm going

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.170
to focus on today.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:22.010
From a regime that ruled
primarily by mediation backed

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:28.640
by claims of divine
sovereignty to a lesser regime,

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.090
and I want to call
it more a state,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.470
that ruled by military
assertion backed by claims

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.280
of popular sovereignty.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.330
And I'm not going to get into
the transition today other

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:43.850
than to say one of the things
the book tries to do is point

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:49.060
out that the shift came in 1808,
before the wars of independence.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.940
The turn is part of the
stimulus to the conflicts.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.420
It is not a result
of the conflicts.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.230
That's not for today.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:03.790
What I want to emphasize
today is that both projects,

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:05.330
the Mexican Heartland project

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:08.400
and the Mexico City
1808 project,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:15.790
required me to push forward
on a rethinking of the nature

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:19.040
of the Spanish regime
in New Spain.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.000
Over the long haul, and
particularly prior to 1760

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.780
in the coming of the
Bourbon assertions and thus

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.760
to rethink the impact
of what we too--

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.740
we call the Bourbon reforms

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.720
that hit New Spain
hardest from the 1760s.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.770
And my emphasis there is that
that impact was far more limited

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:48.010
than we have often
taken it to be.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:52.370
But today, I want to focus
on my emerging understanding

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:58.250
of the regime of more
or less 1550 to 1750

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:01.990
and its pivotal role
in sustaining

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:09.500
and stabilizing a silver economy
that funded Spain's empire

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:15.480
that drove global
trades and focusing on it

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.680
in what I have dubbed the
Mexican Heartland a region

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.030
grounded in enduring
self-governing landed

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:27.510
indigenous communities.

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:31.210
My argument and in
the original title is

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:37.880
that it is an old
regime sustaining,

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.750
promoting a new economy.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:49.750
I use old regime very explicitly
as the English variant

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:53.990
of what Europeans would
call an ancien regime.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:59.440
An ancien regime tied

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.940
to an economy becoming ever more
capitalist and that the fusion

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.640
of them is what matters.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:15.960
And I'm going to argue that both
the ancien regime as it evolved

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.250
in New Spain was a hybrid.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.910
The new economy as it evolved

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.990
in the Mesoamerican
regions was a hybrid

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.760
and thus the fusion
is a double hybrid.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.640
Let me try to make the case.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.070
And you'll quickly see
that I am building upon

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:43.460
and giving my own twist to a lot
of work by colleagues I admire.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.040
So on the ancien regime
following the work

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:53.230
of Alejandro Caneque, following
Ernesto Sanchez de Tagle,

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:57.760
whose work is mostly known
in Mexico, following the work

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.880
of Annick Lempérière,
and also following the work

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:08.560
of my colleague Jim Collins
who has argued for decades

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.970
that what is called
absolutism in France

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:20.830
and Europe is overunderstood as
coercive and needs to be seen

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:25.950
in very different more
negotiating mediating ways.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:31.910
I see the regime that emerged
in New Spain after about 1550

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:37.100
as a classic ancien
regime in key ways.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.810
It is based on multiple
corporations

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:44.800
and institutions sanctioned
with multiple rights

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:52.000
and laws integrated and overseen
by a regime that focuses

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.110
on mediation, sometimes
judicial, sometimes political,

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.560
but everything is
a balancing act.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.650
And it does that and you can
play with the cause and effect

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.120
because certainly in the
interior of New Spain,

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.820
it is a regime with notably
limited coercive capacities.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:23.090
It has very little ability to
force anybody to do anything

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:29.580
and thus it turned to force
only as a last resort,

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.110
and it understands that
if everything I've said

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.960
to that fits the model of the
scholars I have listed I think

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.420
in terms of being an Ancien
regime in the New World.

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:51.890
But I want to emphasize, in New
Spain, it is very much a hybrid

00:55:51.890 --> 00:56:00.270
because it was grounded in the
creation of literally thousands,

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:04.600
one good Mexican scholar
has had it over 4000,

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:10.350
indigenous republics with rights
to land and self-rule built

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:15.960
on the remnants of the
indigenous altepetl ruled

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.160
by native notables
adapting variants

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.300
of what I just generically
call indigenous Christianities.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:28.340
I don't think very far from
where Garry is going here.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:33.180
And that operate with
sanctioned rights to mediations

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.360
through special courts.

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:42.890
What perhaps, this I
offer speculatively,

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:47.970
made this hybrid a
particularly unique variant

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:55.650
of an ancien regime is what--
is really the extreme dearth

00:56:55.650 --> 00:57:02.330
of military power on
the ground in New Span.

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:06.490
If-- As my colleague Jim
Collins has detailed,

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:11.220
the French ancien regime
mediated first and coerced only

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.200
when pressed when it had to.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.290
There was no dearth of
coercive force in Europe.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:24.160
War guaranteed that there
were coercive forces around

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.700
and available, sometimes one
wonders, a little more dispersed

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.690
than we sometimes think.

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:36.370
In New Spain after 1550 in
the Mesoamerican regions,

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:40.740
after 1600 in the end of what
are called the Chichimeca wars

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.470
in the Bajio and regions north,

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.610
the indigenous majority
was disarmed.

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.790
That's famously known.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:55.100
Less often recognized is the
Spanish regime essentially

00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:00.310
disarmed too and
relied on what I had--

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.880
best can call minimal
and uncertain malicious.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.290
Certainly not controlled,
funded or commanded

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:09.800
by anybody in the regime.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.070
Now, again, there
were military efforts.

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:18.330
But the Spanish empire's
military activity focused first

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:22.770
on a naval protection
of trade and on holding

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.730
in New Spain the far
northern frontiers

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:29.440
and I will quickly note that
in the latter its success was

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.180
pretty limited too.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.900
It didn't have all that
much effective force

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.670
in the far north as well.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:43.230
So if I'm right, the question
becomes, how could a regime

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:47.830
with such limited coercive
powers be sustained

00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:49.360
for centuries?

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.360
And I want to argue, there are
really two key factors looking

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.210
behind this.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:59:00.630
The first is, I don't
know how else to put it,

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:04.640
the greatest calamity of
contact and conquest was--

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.540
became the basis for the
underlying success of the regime

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.830
that followed, and that
is the depopulation.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:14.880
That by the late 16th century,

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:22.840
resources are astonishingly
ample

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:27.990
to a radically shrunken
surviving native populations

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:34.720
organized in the new indigenous
republics and also to Europeans

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.980
who are building
commercial states,

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.570
other commercial activities.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:44.940
It is in that context
that Woodrow Borah,

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:48.980
Brian Owensby have documented
for the 16th and 17th century,

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.840
William Taylor for
the 18th century

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.690
that overwhelmingly indigenous--

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:57.790
indigenous republic

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.580
to indigenous republic
relations had conflicts,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.680
indigenous republic
and Spanish officials,

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:11.560
merchant conflicts were
mediated in the court.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.060
And the ability of the courts

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.770
to mediate legitimated the
continuity of the regime.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:25.750
So the depopulation creates
an environment, a true rarity,

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:31.600
I would say in modern history,
in which resources are scarce

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.370
for almost no one
for a period of time

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:39.150
and the regime consolidates
in that context.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:42.440
Simultaneously-- and the
intersection may be even more

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.270
rare historically.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:52.070
The opportunity of silver from
the 1550s created possibility

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.680
of profits for merchant
financiers, for mine operators,

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.550
for commercial estate
growers, and no shortage

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:01.970
of resources to do it.

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:06.320
But also we sometimes don't
recognize enough opportunities

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.210
to market produce
and gain wage income

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.910
for indigenous peoples inside

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:16.140
and outside the indigenous
republics.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:22.520
And in that context, society

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.270
of Spanish Mesoamerica is
integrated by an ancien regime

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:33.940
that used negotiated processes
of petition and mediation

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:40.760
to balance interests among the
powerful and used the courts

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.950
to mediate disputes among
indigenous communities

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.920
between indigenous communities
and states and merchants,

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.590
et cetera, all backed
by exceptionally limited

01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:53.870
and uncertain militias.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:02:00.580
I have almost gotten-- it
is so regular for scholars,

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.140
students to just-- it's a
language that comes to all of us

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:09.300
so naturally, the Spanish
forced, the Spanish coerced,

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.380
the Spanish made it happen.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.120
And I say, wait a minute, tell
me-- They may have ordered,

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.680
they may have mandated but
find me the coercive power,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.460
where is it in the
neighborhood that that happened?

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.530
And I haven't gotten
many answers

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:26.030
that it's actually there.

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:29.980
Something else is going
on and I'm searching

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.380
for a way to understand it.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.170
All right.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:41.470
That hybrid ancien regime, my
argument is, sustain an economy,

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.540
I increasingly describe

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.790
as silver capitalism
by the 18th century.

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:53.920
And in Mesoamerica, I want
to emphasize, particularly

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.480
in the core basins around Mexico
City, my Mexican Heartland,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.730
that silver capitalism
was also a hybrid.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:08.700
Finance, commerce concentrated
in the capital, in the city,

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.240
as did the wealthy
families leading mining,

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.810
landed entrepreneurs, they're
concentrated in the oligarchy

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:21.590
as capitalist as any in the
world in the 18th century.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:27.750
The distinction, in the
Bajio in the regions north,

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.770
the subject of my Making
a New World, this is owns

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:34.930
with few landed self-governing
native republics.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.080
Commercial capitalist
ways, the new economy,

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:45.810
shaped life all the way to
the base, top to bottom.

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:50.990
From the 17th century
through the 18th, mineworkers,

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:53.290
tenant-growers, wage
workers in fields

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:56.040
and factories including
the thousands of women

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.310
in the great tobacco
factories in Mexico City

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:02.550
and Queretaro live
in a commercial--

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:05.930
I think rapidly becoming
capitalist society.

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:10.160
But in the Mexican heartland,
the Mesoamerican heartland

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.310
at this point, outside
the city and mining towns,

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:18.220
the vast majority
of the population,

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.360
90% live in indigenous
republics,

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.190
speaking indigenous languages,
Nahuatl or Otomi in most cases,

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:30.650
through to the end
of the 18th century.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:36.050
While their populations had
been low and lands were ample,

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:40.060
late 16th through
the 17th century,

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.380
people of the republics had
basically had the capacity

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.420
to sustain themselves and
to take wage supplements,

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:54.110
market earnings at mines in the
states providing for the city.

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:58.280
After 1700, population
begins to grow,

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.680
land becomes less efficient

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.500
but not radically
scarce in the republics.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:15.820
And it becomes less possible
for families and communities

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.040
to maintain the autonomous
production of sustenance

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.250
that had marked them
post-depopulation

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.940
through the 17th century.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:33.030
But in the 18th century, as
Spanish entrepreneurs took

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:37.680
over the commercial
production of indigenous crops,

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.850
indigenous crops, maize and
pulque, were primarily produced

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:44.640
by indigenous community
based growers

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.380
through the 17th century.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.800
From about the 1720s, major
landed entrepreneurs based

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.420
in Mexico City took
over production of--

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.880
commercial production
of maize and pulque.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.880
They took over the
Mexico City pulquerias.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:07.660
And they create-- while
they profit wonderfully,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:16.390
their capitalist utopia,
they offer increasing amounts

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.340
of wage labor at their estates

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.270
to sustain families
and communities.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:27.730
So, people are capable, are able
and they do remain residents,

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:31.600
vicino, citizens of the
indigenous republics.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.470
They produce sustenance
to the extent they can.

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:38.750
But as they can't, they
increasingly cap the income

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:43.250
of the commercial economy
through some marketing,

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.280
but ever more through
wage labor.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.600
And in the process, it
sustains the republics

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.900
and their families.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.010
And in fact through the
18th century, subsidizes

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.770
and sustains a growing
commercial silver capitalism.

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:00.460
They're actually essential

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.850
to its endurance
and profit ability.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:11.220
Simple characterization
of a complex problem.

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:17.560
Production of silver,
the-- international trade,

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.060
the internal commercial economy

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:25.740
and regime revenues all
grew more than four times

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.670
over in the Mesoamerican
regions of New Spain from 1700

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:38.750
to 1800 while the population
a little more than doubled.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.300
And what is too often
not recognized,

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:49.890
in the Mesoamerican heartland,
stability held past 1800.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:53.400
There is no major
destabilizing challenge

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.550
to this regime until 1808, 1810.

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:02.960
The break I argue came in 1808.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.370
It came in May in Spain.

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:09.980
It came July to September
in Mexico City,

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:15.890
when in the reverberations that
came from Napoleon's invasion.

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:21.240
Politics were militarized
in Spain and in New Spain.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.620
And the militarization
of politics came coupled

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.270
with claims of popular
sovereignty.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:33.010
And I will simply say, that
has set me to thinking a lot

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:36.660
about a rethinking of the
19th and 20th century.

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.960
But that's a new and different
history and I'm just going

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.510
to say thank you very much.

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:46.500
[ Applause ]

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.680
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: Thank you, John.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.960
We are running a little bit
late but maybe we have time.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.430
We'll just take a couple
of questions and then go

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:01.900
to a very short break and then
continue with the second panel

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.660
after about a five-minute break.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.260
So, are there any questions or?

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.560
Please.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.730
&gt;&gt; Right. I have
three questions.

01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:15.070
First question for you.

01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:17.680
And I was [inaudible] between

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.880
this race and this
pulque, just--

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.710
It's about Bartolome de Alva.

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.010
You-- do you--

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:25.310
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.610
&gt;&gt; Regarding Bartolome and
I would like to ask if you--

01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:29.360
if you could comment more
because he is a mestizo.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.660
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yes.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.960
&gt;&gt; So think about--

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.260
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Right.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.560
&gt;&gt; -- this [inaudible].

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.860
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.160
&gt;&gt; The second question
is for you, Garry.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.460
The link between the theology,
theology of liberation

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.660
and this theology of
enculturation in the Mayans of--

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.540
And, John, the last question.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.530
And what's the role of
religion and of the lack

01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:50.830
of secularization
in the [inaudible]

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.570
of the ancien regime
till beginning

01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:58.480
and last years of
the 19th century?

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.340
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: OK.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.640
Joan, do you want to go first?

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.020
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Well, maybe
you could help me think of that.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.780
I mean, so Bartolome de Alva
was a mestizo and he was--

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.460
I mean, I-- he was writing this.

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.120
He wrote this confession
manual for--

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.420
&gt;&gt; He's a priest.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.720
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol:
Yeah, he's a priest.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.020
Yeah. And he wrote
a confession manual

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:17.430
to be used among the
Nahua speaking people.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:24.650
So, I guess he-- I think
he was really talking--

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.230
the way-- my interest in him I

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.380
guess is the way that he
is sort of distinguishing

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:31.820
between the Nahua people in
the past and the present.

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:34.750
He's not really talking
about mixing.

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:39.530
So, he-- I mean,
so you're saying

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:43.140
because he himself is mixed and
sort of what does that mean.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.440
&gt;&gt; For us.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.740
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol:
Yeah for-- Yeah.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.040
&gt;&gt; At least for us.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.620
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yes.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.100
&gt;&gt; I don't think he comes with
[inaudible] he's a priest.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.920
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Uh-huh.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.220
So, you're-- so, you're
saying-- So what--

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.200
So he considered himself
as a Nahua or as a--

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.500
&gt;&gt; As a priest.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.800
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: As a priest?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.100
OK. Yeah. All right.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.400
So, you tell me.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.700
So, what do you think
the implications are?

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.000
&gt;&gt; No, I don't know [laughter].

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.300
I was very interested
because we--

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.600
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.900
Yeah.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.200
&gt;&gt; Bartolome de Alva--

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.500
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.800
&gt;&gt; -- is a priest.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.100
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yes.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.400
&gt;&gt; And he's a sort of mestizo.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.700
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yes.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.000
&gt;&gt; And he is the
brother of [inaudible].

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.300
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yes.

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.600
Yes.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.900
&gt;&gt; Supposed to be Indian or
a Spaniard, but just in front

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.880
of these people talking
about this topic--

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.180
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.850
&gt;&gt; -- and adding all of this
problem of defining themselves.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.150
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Right.

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:32.450
Right. Right.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.750
&gt;&gt; Or not defining themselves.

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:35.050
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: All right.

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:36.350
&gt;&gt; I have no answer.

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.650
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:38.950
Yeah. I don't have
[inaudible], but well,

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:40.250
that's a-- That is a good way.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.550
I mean, that's very interesting.

01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.850
I think I-- Because also
the way he sort of functions

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:44.150
in my paper is he sort of tacked
on to this discussion of mixing.

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:46.350
But then really, he is
saying something different.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.140
So, I think I need to think
about the connection really

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.440
between those two parts more.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.010
So unfortunately, I don't
really have an answer either,

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:52.660
but it's a very interesting
question.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.960
So, thank you.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.260
&gt;&gt; Perhaps I've been--

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.560
&gt;&gt; Joan Bristol: Yeah.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.860
Yeah. Thank you.

01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.160
No, that's a very good question.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.460
Thank you very much.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.760
I'm sorry I can't really
address it further.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.060
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks:
So, the relationship

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.360
between liberation theology

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.220
and enculturation theology
particularly in New Spain

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.840
or Latin America-- Turn it on.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.040
I don't know.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.460
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.930
It's a great question because
there is oftentimes I think a

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:18.830
false understanding that
there's these three movements

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:23.910
within current Latin America
and Christian theology initiated

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:27.050
after Vatican II
liberation theology.

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:29.560
And then, there's this
conservative reaction against it

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.390
which is the Catholic renewal
or the charismatic theology

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:38.100
which comes about a bit later in
the 1980s and then the offshoot

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:41.500
from liberation theology
particularly around 1992

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.180
and the counter-protest
in Columbus' anniversary,

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.980
the 500th anniversary by
indigenous people, the emergence

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.390
of enculturation theology.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.580
But yet if you look at
the local paper trail,

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:55.560
really enculturation theology
begins prior to the Second

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.890
Vatican Council in
places like Chiapas,

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:00.320
the Dominicans mid 1960s,

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.520
liberation theology would
be much more clear in 1971

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.550
and then charismatic renewal
also began simultaneous

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:11.280
to liberation theology and

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.920
doesn't acquire a conservative
sort of dimension to it

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.040
until late '70s and early
'80s, but they're all

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.470
in concurrent relation--

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.060
movements rather than sort of
splintering off the main trunk.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.330
The main distinction
though liberation theology

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.670
and enculturation theology is
liberation theology is first

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:30.060
and foremost concerned
with class analysis.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.570
So, that's the primary
sort of locus of oppression

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:36.230
that needs to be addressed.

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:40.790
Indigenous peoples found that
they find that rather racist.

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:42.860
And so, reading early
sort of [inaudible]

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.790
by say Leonardo Boff
really sort of tip a hat

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:50.660
to gender oppression
or ethnic oppression.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.020
For many indigenous
peoples, once said to me

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.980
by a [inaudible] colleague,
I'm poor because I'm Maya.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.500
I'm not Maya because I'm poor.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.890
And then for them, the primary--
the sort of the super structure

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:04.410
of oppression to put
it in Boff's terms,

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:09.670
Marxist terms is racism and that
the class oppression is really

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:11.250
more of the infrastructure.

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.070
And so, they sort of flip it.

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:15.230
And they also think that
the liberations theology--

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:18.800
agenda has a bit more
of an assimilationist.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.690
Most of the advocates for
liberation theology come up

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.100
with liberal political
wing of Latin America

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.320
which typically wants to sort of
assimilate and build in which--

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.820
into mainstream indigenous
people which has a tenor

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.160
of ethnocide for many indigenous

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.460
activists who are trying

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.650
to actually preserve some
[inaudible] other culture.

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:42.940
So, there's-- in that sense,
they're somewhat shared

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.150
with the common discourse
of [inaudible],

01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:46.450
the elimination of hierarchies

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:49.810
[inaudible] of egalitarian
horizontal structures as opposed

01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:54.050
to vertical structures,
political, economic, ecclesial.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:57.660
But the ways that they think
are the roots of the problem,

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.680
diagnoses, and then
prescriptions

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.670
for that [inaudible].

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:09.310
I don't know if that's
the question but-- OK.

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:10.610
Yeah.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:11.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:14.970
&gt;&gt; John Tutino: Very easily--
Religion, if pivotally central,

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:17.800
I could easily make it
the third hybridity.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.950
If I argue for a
regime hybridity

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.250
and economic hybridity,

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.440
certainly there is a
religious hybridity embedded

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.230
in all of these.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.520
And I'll first escape
the question

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.060
with the highest
praise I can think of.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.700
It made no sense for me
to add that hybridity

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.890
because that is the issue that
Serge Gruzinski has addressed

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:39.220
in such great depth and
detail for New Spain.

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.390
I don't have much to add there
other than to learn from you.

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:51.320
But I'll characterize my view
of this right now in two moments

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.270
in a pretty broad
overly general way.

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:58.260
First, looking at the end of
the 16th, early 17th century,

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.810
the moment on which I
see this system sort

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.300
of consolidating
for the first time.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.420
And two things come
together there

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.570
that have really struck me.

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:11.540
If you look at the
communities, almost everybody

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.370
in the indigenous republics,
they're not speaking Spanish.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.870
But in the areas certainly
anywhere close to Mexico City,

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:21.890
everyone is taking Cristiano.

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:27.320
They are self-defining
themselves as Christian.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.660
At the same time, the
clerical discourse,

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.870
shall we say the tired
missionary class,

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.710
is writing about their failure.

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:44.240
They have not created Christians
in their definitional sense.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.840
And to me, that mixes
everything,

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.280
that indigenous peoples
have adapted, evolved

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.900
and consolidated their
vision, their understanding

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.040
of what Christianity
is and should be

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.080
as it's meaningful to them.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:03.190
They're developing their
devotions to virgin, saints,

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:06.450
the cofradias that sustain
them, et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:08.660
And at the same time,

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:11.050
it is pretty clear
there was a resistance

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:15.040
to European notions
of sin and morality.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.130
So it is a very much hybridized
religion that I have just come--

01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:23.070
and I use it in the plural
indigenous Christianities.

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:25.330
There may be one
for every community.

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.350
This is not a broadly
shared reality.

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:36.150
And that the whole system had to
live by the religious hierarchy

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:38.690
and the regime learning
to accept all

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:43.200
of that diverse hybridity
at the local level.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.750
The classic best known
example of course is we know

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.520
when devotion to Guadalupe
emerges in the regions

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.020
of Mexico City, it is
resisted by the powerful

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.430
for the earlier century
and there's a point

01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:01.610
in the mid 17th century where
it can't be resisted so we might

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.260
as well adapt and
promote, et cetera.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.710
And the regime goes forward

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:08.030
in that mixed negotiated
hybrid way.

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:11.520
And then I'll just add,
get to the 18th century,

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.610
and here you have
what [inaudible]

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:17.290
so clearly the Magistrates
of the Sacred.

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:24.130
Yes, bourbon reformers wanted
to impose a new more moralizing,

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:29.590
more true Christianity
on the communities.

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:32.070
And what he found were
letter after letter written

01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:34.190
by those [inaudible]
saying, if I do that,

01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:35.490
they won't pay my fees.

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:37.050
If I do that, they'll
run me out of town.

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.810
I cannot do that.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.200
I have to accept
the Christianity

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.740
that is-- that is there.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:47.180
That's my short tale
of the third hybridity,

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.480
but it is very much
a hybrid too.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.840
&gt;&gt; Ralph Bauer: OK,
may-- one more question.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.480
OK, please.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:01.510
&gt;&gt; Does the hybridization of
the religion in the 20th century

01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:08.190
impact the Indian community
as it slides, you know,

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:12.880
adapt their agricultural
technology in Guatemala?

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.180
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: I'm sorry.

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.480
I missed the first part
of the question, sir.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.840
&gt;&gt; Does the hybridization
of religion

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:24.930
in the Indian communities
impact the efforts on the part

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:29.780
of the Indian community to move
towards the new agriculture?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.410
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: I
don't-- I don't think so.

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:41.300
I mean, I just say, I'm
reticent to sort of buy

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.310
into anything distinctively
hybrid

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:49.070
about the Christianity in, say,
Mesoamerica, Guatemala given the

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:50.500
fact that we put up a Yule tree

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.440
around the Roman Saturnalia
festival Christmas and look

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.400
for Easter eggs on the
fertility festival.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.700
Easter--

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.070
I mean, Christianity is kind
of a hybridity, all going down,

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.370
right, sort of all going
down in that sense.

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:05.590
So I'm not entirely convinced
Maya have ever really been doing

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:09.370
things different than say Celts
in Ireland or even Palestinians

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:15.100
for the past 2000 years,
Palestinian Christians.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:19.330
But no, I mean, if you
can look at things like--

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:22.140
I mean, just probably
like as interesting

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.440
as the text is [inaudible]
where she talked

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.150
about her father working
in the Peace Corps

01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:28.760
in order to implement new
sort of farming techniques and

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.040
yet she is trying harvest
a particular distinctively

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.510
indigenous identity with about
13 of her chapters beginning

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:41.160
with epigraphs, The
Book of Rule.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.410
And so I think for many of them,
I think they're negotiating a,

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:48.110
you know, both modern
technology, modernity

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.460
today just as they were
negotiating modernity

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:57.300
with cofradias and
[inaudible] 500 years ago.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:04.280
And many of the-- particularly
say 1950s, 1960s authors

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.580
that are bringing in--

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.900
some agents that are
bringing in modern technology,

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.730
Maryknoll priests
are also bringing

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:11.340
in liberation theology, right.

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.720
So [inaudible] cardamom
production in [inaudible] and

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.280
yet sort of what's happening
with also Jesuits in that area

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.280
of enculturation theology.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.290
And of course, Guatemala is one
of the larger producers of--

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:26.650
and exporters of
cardamom [inaudible].

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.360
Yeah, very politicized
liberationist

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.430
or you can say [inaudible],
very active with Jesuits,

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:38.180
and so they're combining
Christian identity,

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.120
that might be.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.000
So I don't think
they see them anyway

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.320
that is mutually
exclusive necessarily.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.050
Are you-- Is there a
particular concrete example?

01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:53.650
&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking the
fact that in the 16th century,

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:56.150
indigenous community, a lot

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:59.590
of different indigenous
community I know begin to look

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:04.120
at the use of fertilizer
in a different way.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:13.480
And I think that was a part of
their ability to see fertilizer

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.090
from a different vantage point
in terms of what was happening

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.110
in relation to [inaudible]

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:23.090
because at one time, it was
very difficult to get them

01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:26.260
to change their survival
agricultural habit.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.640
I mean-- Right.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.940
So that's what--

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.240
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: I think it also
have to do with the local sort

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.900
of political tension
particularly in that period

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.910
with the introduction
of Catholic action.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:38.510
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: And trying to
break the sort of political--

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:39.810
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:41.110
&gt;&gt; Garry Sparks: --
stronghold of the cofradias

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:43.940
which would see themselves
as traditional even though,

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.130
you know, their traditional
sense

01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:49.340
in the 1550s or in the 1580s.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:54.310
So I think in some way, that's
much more of a political tension

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:57.040
between those principalities
that voiced

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.040
up specific religious
hierarchy and those

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.830
that are more trying to confirm

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:06.770
a more merit-based way of
the socioeconomic access

01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:09.790
of power and circumvent that.

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:11.590
It gets couched in
religious discourse

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:13.890
but I think it's much
more of a political.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.000

of the Library of Congress.
