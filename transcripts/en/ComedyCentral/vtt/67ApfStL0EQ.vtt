00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.772
- When you're from the hood,

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.040
the first thing you're thinking,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.341
what the fuck is wrong
with this white dude?

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.110
Why his nuts hanging like that?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.880
(throbbing electronic music)

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.940

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.909
- Thank you, everybody.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.344
So, if you don't know,
here's what the show is.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.378
It's just a bunch
of funny people

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.614
telling like 100% true stories.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.116
Ladies and gentlemen, one of
the funniest women I know,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.217
Ms. Pat, everybody.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.420
Keep it going for Ms. Pat.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.855
(audience cheers)

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.590
- So I went through the
Welfare to Work program

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.925
through Bill Clinton.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.393
And I know most of
y'all don't know

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.594 align:start size:94% position:6%
what the fuck the Welfare
to Work program is.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:02.829
But it came out of your paycheck

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.197 align:start size:81% position:19%
and it helped a
bitch out like me.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.367
(audience laughs)

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.269 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, on this program
I got my GED,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.171
got off parole and
got my very first job

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.639
working at McDonald's.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.408 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I'm doing like most
people do in my neighborhood

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.378 align:start position:0%
when they get they're very
first job working at McDonald's.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.647
I'm stealing $100 a day
out of the register.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.415
(audience laughs)

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.852
What's wrong, this
too real for y'all?

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.455
So, I steal $100 and
I had just stolen it

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
and nobody in the McDonald's
but me and the co-worker.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.592
So I ease the shit in my pocket

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm just talking
to the co-worker

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.528 align:start size:81% position:19%
'cause there ain't
nobody in there

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I see this fucking
black van circle McDonald's.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.766
And you know, when
you're from the hood,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.935
you see a black van circle,
the first thing you out.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.236
That either the police

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.737
or somebody about
to shoot your ass.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.272
(audience laughs)

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.141
So, the van circled twice
and then this white guy

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.810
get out and he come in and
he got this plug in his ear.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.412
And I'm like, holy fuck.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.447
They done caught me stealing.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.316
I'm going back to jail.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.717
Two seconds later
he look around.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.986
He say, it's clear, send him in.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:04.257
Now, I tell you, this shit
shocked the shit out of me.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.060
In walk President Jimmy Carter.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.829
(light clapping)

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.833
I know his face, but
I don't know his name

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.002
and now I'm looking at him
because he got his pants

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:20.173 align:start size:97% position:3%
all jacked up and his nut
sack hanging over to the side.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.710
When you from the hood the
first thing you thinking

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.378
what the fuck is wrong
with this white dude?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.214 align:start size:81% position:19%
Why're his nuts
hanging like that?

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.850
I didn't know his
name, but you know,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.753
I was like, damn,
I think I know him.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
So he get to the register
and I went to take his order

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.290 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the Secret Service
standing there.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.559
And you know, I'm crazy
at this time in my life.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.695 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, just doing
drive bys and selling dope

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.130 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you know,
robbing white people.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.232
I'm getting my life back
together, white people.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.234
(audience laughs)

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.602
Jimmy Carter get to the register

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:53.273
and I do the most
ghetto shit ever.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.742 align:start size:81% position:19%
I look at Jimmy
Carter and I said,

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Nigger, where the
fuck I know you from?"

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.513
(audience laughs)

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.932 align:start size:84% position:16%
Secret Service
busts out laughing.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.768
(audience laughs)

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.270
I'm standing there
with a straight face

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.740
'cause this nigger
look familiar to me.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.342
Jimmy Carter turned pink.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:32.178 align:start size:81% position:19%
He said, "Young
lady, young lady."

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.586
I'm like, what the fuck do
you want to eat, nigger.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:40.720
You know?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.923
(audience laughs)

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.426 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, he ordered a
cheeseburger, a side salad

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.660
and a water.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.195
By this time the boy
on the grill was like,

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
"Patricia, that's the President
of the United States."

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
I turn around with my
ghetto ass and told him,

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.971
"Nigger, I told you I know you.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.043
"Your cheeseburger free."

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.245
(audience laughs)

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.412
Y'all, that's my
Jimmy Carter story.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.549
(audience cheers)

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.286
