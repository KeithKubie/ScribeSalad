00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:09.597
Phil: Intaglio processes
are any print making process

00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:13.263
where the image area is
below the flat surface

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.764
of your printing matrix or plate.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:18.900
Within intaglio, there are
several different types

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.322
of processes.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.794
One of those is the dry point.

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:27.676
What dry point is is a
direct scratching or moving

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:29.595
of the material on the plate.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.038
If I were to take one
of our etching tools,

00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:36.496
in this case a steel scribe,
and scratch the surface

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:40.328
of this plate, that
scratch will raise a burr,

00:00:40.328 --> 00:00:43.664
where the metal was then
moved from side to side.

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:46.384
In dry point, we're
typically not removing metal,

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:50.413
we're actually moving it
and the burr that is raised

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:53.391
from moving that metal holds ink.

00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:56.162
Where that ink is held
creates a fuzzy line,

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:59.326
which is the characteristic
line for a dry point.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.541
In working with a roulette,

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.492
now that I have my composition
laid out with basic lines,

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:07.550
I'm going to use the roulette
to start to add some tone in.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.590
This roulette is offset dots.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.245
The purpose of all of the
different types of marks

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.292
that I'm using is to
create different textures

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:18.965
and varying tones, so that the composition

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:21.412
that I'm working with doesn't feel flat

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:23.737
by something being made
from all of the same type

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:24.898
of mark.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:28.161
Steel facing increases the
strength of the surface

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.221
of the plate, which is extremely important

00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:32.308
for things like dry point
where you have a delicate

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:35.828
and fragile burr that's
raised up above the plate.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:39.161
This will help the plate remain strong

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:42.711
so that none of the burrs
break during printing.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.077
Many of the same tools
that we use for dry point

00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:51.660
are also used for etching.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.244
Etching involves several steps.

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.040
The first step is to prepare the plate,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.079
which involves polishing and cleaning,

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.830
so that there are no marks
or scratches on the surface

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.544
that could interfere with
the artist's drawing.

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:08.826
The second step would be applying a ground

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.378
to the plate.

00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:13.128
Hard ground is typically
made from asphaltum, wax,

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:14.628
and rosin.

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:17.461
It acts as an acid resist,
protecting the white

00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:20.571
or non-image areas of the etching plate.

00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.243
Preparing that ground so
that it is dark enough

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.182
to see the copper showing through

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:28.259
wherever the ground has
been scratched away.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.584
To smoke the plate, the
plate is held upside down,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:36.120
so that the ground can be
heated and absorb the soot.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.890
Once a plate has been
prepared with a ground,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.116
the surface is a jet black.

00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:45.106
Drawing a plate involves
scratching away the ground

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.799
so that copper is revealed.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.733
This is different than dry point.

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:52.276
Dry point's scratching of
the plate is to create a burr

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:53.861
or to move metal.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.775
In this case, we're actually
only barely scratching

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:59.479
the surface, just to remove the ground.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.193
Wherever copper is showing
through that black ground,

00:03:02.193 --> 00:03:05.610
it will be etched or eaten
away to create a trough

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.276
for ink to sit in.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:10.755
The copper lines become the
image that will be printed

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:12.458
onto paper.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.830
The third step in etching
is etching the plate.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.897
This is a process of eating away

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:22.401
all of the bare copper
areas showing on the plate,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:26.004
deep into recesses that will hold ink.

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:30.026
The plate is etched for 15
minutes, then it is pulled out

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.644
and rinsed and replaced back in the bath

00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:35.776
for an additional 15 minutes
to create a fine, even,

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.983
black line.

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.416
Once the plate has been etched,

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:40.884
the ground has been removed,

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:43.111
and the plate has been
cleaned, it is now prepared

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.124
for printing.

00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:48.921
All intaglio processes are
printed in the same format.

00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:52.754
Printing involves wiping the
plate with ink to force ink

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:56.922
into the recesses of the
plate, utilizing tarlatan

00:03:56.922 --> 00:03:59.807
to remove excess ink
from the raised surface

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:03.275
or upper surfaces of
the plate, and finally,

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:06.169
a small amount of hand wiping
and cleaning of the edges

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.670
so that all of the white areas
of the plate remain white.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.652
A small amount of chalk
on the fingers will remove

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.322
any residue ink from the
edges and non-image areas

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.457
of the plate.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:21.014
Once the plate has been
wiped, it is set on the press.

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:24.891
A dampened sheet of paper
is laid on top and it is run

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:28.694
through the press with
felts at high pressure.

00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:30.565
Artists like intaglio processes

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:32.970
because it's a very
sculptural way of working.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.038
That sculptural process of
manipulating a metal surface

00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:38.540
is evident in the final
print with raised ink

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.707
and embossed edges.
