00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.320
When a&nbsp;movie&nbsp;becomes an overnight hit, or
a box office bomb, it's often the&nbsp;cast&nbsp;that

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.860
gets the credit or blame. But audiences might
never ask how different things could have

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.360
been if other actors or actresses were&nbsp;cast&nbsp;-
or how close their favorite&nbsp;movies&nbsp;came

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.310
to being something completely different. Here
are Screen Rant's 10&nbsp;Amazing&nbsp;MovieCastings&nbsp;That

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.450
Almost Happened.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.009
Face/Off
The story that saw&nbsp;movie&nbsp;stars Nicolas Cage

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.800
and John Travolta swap faces is famous for
its cheesy performances, but as fun as it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.239
was, it could have been truly incredible.
The script was actually written for Arnold

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.960
Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, both
at the top of their game at the time. Other

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.039
duos like Bruce Willis and Alec Baldwin were
considered, but Michael Douglas and Harrison

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.660
Ford seemed the most likely. When director
John Woo decided on the leading men instead,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.809
Douglas remained as a producer.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.460
Finding Nemo
Even Pixar makes mistakes, since they finished

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.859
the entire undersea adventure with actor William
H Macy voicing the role of Nero's dad, Marlon.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.030
The actor is no slouch, but when Disney's
CEO saw the finished version, he famously

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.629
said the&nbsp;movie&nbsp;was nowhere near as good
as the studio believed. They soon recruited

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.070
actor Albert Brooks to revoice the entire&nbsp;movie,
and his energetic delivery made it Pixar's

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.690
biggest hit to date.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.410
The Matrix&nbsp;
It's impossible to imagine anyone other than

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.640
Keanu Reeves as the hero of this trilogy,
but there was a time when another soft-spoken,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.970
enigmatic actor was offered the part of The
One: Nicolas Cage. The Hollywood veteran turned

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.860
down the part since it would be filmed far
from home in Australia, leaving&nbsp;movie&nbsp;fans

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600
to wonder how completely different the series
- and the actors' careers - could have turned

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.500
out.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.590
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&nbsp;
It's hard to think that this mix of cartoon

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.350
and live action could have been better, but
Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis' first

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.720
choice for the grouchy detective Eddie Valiant
was apparently Harrison Ford. When he proved

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.820
too expensive, they turned to their second
choice: comedy legend Bill Murray. Since Murray

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.330
has no agent, only a voicemail for offering
roles, he didn't get the message. The worst

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.410
part? Murray later admitted that if he'd known
of the offer, he would've taken it in second.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.480
Super Mario Bros.
The video game&nbsp;movie&nbsp;proved to be a but

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.430
of a joke in Hollywood, with star Bob Hoskins
forever calling the part of Mario Mario his

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.590
biggest regret. But would you believe an even
bigger name actually pursued the role? Tom

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.920
Hanks even got himself attached to star as
the mustachioed plumber, before the studio&nbsp;cast&nbsp;Hoskins

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.230
instead, believing he was the more bankable
actor. We'll let time be the judge on that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.469
one.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.540
The Bourne Identity
He was an unlikely hero, but Jason Bourne

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.030
completely redefined the modern&nbsp;movie&nbsp;spy,
and made Matt Damon a household name overnight.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.819
The part was originally going to be played
by Brad Pitt, who decided that another Spy

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.939
thriller, Spy Game, was a better choice. It's
hard to argue Pitt would've ruined the series,

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.499
but with a fifth instalment in the franchise
coming to theatres, it was probably for the

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:35.299
best.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.209
Pulp Fiction
Quentin Tarantino's breakout film was like

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.150
a Hollywood game of musical chairs, with Bruce
Willis making it clear he wanted the lead

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.019
role of Vincent Vega. John Travolta ended
up beating him out, along with Oscar winner

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.129
Daniel Day Lewis - Rumored to be the only
role Lewis ever actively campaigned for. The

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.629
director still liked Willis for the boxer
Butch, but had promised the part to Matt Dillon.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.120
When Dillon said he needed a night to consider
the offer, Tarantino&nbsp;cast&nbsp;Willis instantly,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.430
saying that if he didn't want the part after
reading the script, the director didn't want

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.709
him either.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.829
The Avengers&nbsp;
The Incredible Hulk's big screen history hadn't

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.900
been easy, with THREE actors playing the part
in less than a decade. But that almost wasn't

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.079
the case. When talks with Ed Norton reprising
his role in The Avengers fell through, director

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.139
Joss Whedon prepared a list of replacements.
Mark Ruffalo was his top pick, knowing it

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.909
might be an unpopular choice with the studio.
They surprised him, by admitting he was at

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.180
the top of theirs, after they had tried to&nbsp;cast&nbsp;him
in the previous solo&nbsp;movie, making the change

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.319
to the shared universe... not a change at
all, really.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.200
Inglorious Basterds
Quentin Tarantino hit a home run with his

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.560
World War 2 story, but the original planned&nbsp;cast&nbsp;would
have felt completely different. It was the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.529
German actor Christoph Waltz who brought the
villain Hans Landa to life, but Tarantino

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.900
originally planned to&nbsp;cast&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio
as the Nazi officer. He also&nbsp;cast&nbsp;comedian

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.499
Adam Sandler as Donny Donowitz, a.ka. The
Bear Jewish, who dropped out. Tarantino turned

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:48.090
to his friend Eli Roth, and finally got to&nbsp;cast&nbsp;DiCaprio
as the villain in Django Unchained years later.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.340
Batman Begins
It's never easy to&nbsp;cast&nbsp;the Batman on film,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.109
but director Christopher Nolan managed to
gather some serious talent - and didn't let

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.299
them escape once he passed them over for the
part. Irish actor Cillian Murphy was a serious

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.889
frontrunner for the new Bruce Wayne, along
with Aussie Heath Ledger. Christian Bale won

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.969
the part, but the competition clearly made
an impression: Nolan&nbsp;cast&nbsp;them as the villains

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.389
of the first two films, as the Scarecrow and
Joker, respectively.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.090
Those are some the craziest&nbsp;casting&nbsp;close
calls, we know of, but which ones are your
