00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One of the most exciting aspects of the early days of a relationship

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.300
can be the sense that a lover understands us, without us needing to speak too much.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.200
With other people, we're always having to explain ourselves at length.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.280
Even when we do, they frequently struggle to grasp our drift.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.720
But a true lover, on the other hand, seems to get us almost immediately,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.340
even in the finer grained aspects of our personalities.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.840
No sooner have we tried to explain, for example, our feelings towards autumn evenings

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.700
or that bit in a song we like, when the violins start to rise, that they generously step in and say

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.960
"I know, I know", seemingly ready to confirm our every sensation and idea.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.660
This is a profoundly beautiful and exciting discovery,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.800
but it can give rise to a hugely troubling dynamic, in terms of the long term success of relationships,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.460
because the view that a good lover must intuitively understand us

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.620
is, over time, one of the most dangerous suppositions, responsible for a catastrophic outbreak of sulking.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.500
Sulking is a highly distinctive phenomenon within the psychology of love.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.320
Crucially, we don't just sulk with anyone.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
We reserve our sulks for people we believe shoud understand us,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840
but happen, on a given occasion, not to.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.480
We could explain what's wrong to them, of course,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.560
but if we did so,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.080
it would mean that they had failed to understand us intuitively,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.960
and therefore,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.440
that they were not worthy of love.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.840
A sulk is one of the odder gifts of love.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.420
Our incensed background belief,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.520
that a good lover should just know,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.740
explains why on the evening when they unwittingly cause us offense at a party

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.680
we'll sit quiety in the car on the way home

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.680
and we'll reply with a simple "nothing"

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.640
when inquired if anything is up.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.240
and when we get home,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.640
we'll disappear straight into the bathroom and bolt the door.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.880
And when they ask again "please, just tell me what's wrong",

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.460
we'll remain silent with our arms folded

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840
because we implicitly believe

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.880
that a true lover,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.340
someone really worthy of our affection,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.000
would naturally be able to read our intentions

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.200
through the bathroom panel,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.740
through our outer casing,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.100
and into the caverns of our burnt and pained souls.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.560
Sulking has its touching sides,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.260
evoking the enormous faith

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.580
that we place in our partner's capacities to interpret us.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.800
But, part of becoming an adult

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.220
must surely be to believe

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640
that we cannot fairly continue to expect others to read our minds

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.160
if we've not previously deigned to lay out their contents

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.640
through the admittedly very cumbersome medium

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.140
of words.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440
Even the most intelligent, sensitive lover

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.880
cannot be expected to continue to navigate around us

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.420
without a lot of patiently articulated

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.540
verbal indications

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.100
of our desires and intentions.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.280
Those charming, early, lucky guesses

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.700
about what our lovers feel

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.040
should not fool us for too long.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.820
Even in very successful relationships

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.600
there's only a tiny amount

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.160
that a lover should ever be expected to know about their beloved

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.120
without it having been explained in language.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.780
We shouldn't get furious when our lovers don't guess right.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.960
Rather than bolting our mouths

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.980
and retreating into the comfortable silence of a sulk,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.460
we should have the courage, always,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780
to try and explain.
