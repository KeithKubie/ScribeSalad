00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome back.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.860
So let's continue
where we left off.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.120
So we had this intuition that i
must have something to do with

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.220
these sign changes, right?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.330
The pattern of the sign changes
of i are very similar to the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.340
pattern of the sign changes in
the Maclaurin representation of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.020
cosine of x plus sine of x.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.680
And then we also saw that the
i's, whether they're positive

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.720
i's or negative i's,
correspond to the sine terms.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.310
So let's do a
little experiment.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.050
And it's not an experiment
because I know where this

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.440
leads to, but it could
have been an experiment.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.622
What is e to the i x?

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.860
Well, raising anything to the
i power really isn't defined.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.520
I mean, i, itself, was
created by a definition.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.300
We said, "i squared is equal to
negative 1 by definition." So

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.490
i is a bit of a definition.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.590
So if we haven't defined what
something to the i power is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.910
yet, we really don't know
what to do with it.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.370
But let's just say that
we can treat i just

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.820
like any other number.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.840
And we do know what happens
with i when you put

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.740
it into a polynomial.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.370
That's one thing we do know.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.400
In fact, that's one of the
reasons why i was defined in

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.810
first place was so that people
could take roots of all

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.800
polynomials, even ones that
didn't have real roots.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.170
So what happens if we
take e to the i x?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.970
Well, I don't know what that is
but we know we could put that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.030
into the Maclaurin
representation of e to the x

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.490
and actually, since you're
taking my leap of faith, that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.050
that is equal to e of x and all
of its derivatives are equal to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.870
e to the x's derivatives at x
equals 0, it's not

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.730
that hard to imagine.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.490
And actually, you could plot
the graph of this and you'll

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.000
see that they're identical.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.420
So if we take the Maclaurin
representation of this,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.060
everywhere we see an x we just
replace it with an i x, right?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:56.430
So that will be 1 plus i x plus
-- let me just write it -- plus

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.460
i squared x squared
over 2 factorial.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.110
Oops. i squared x squared plus
i to the third x to the third

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.760
over 3 factorial plus i to the
fourth x to the fourth over 4

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.280
factorial plus i to the fifth x
to the fifth over 5 factorial.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.500
I don't have to keep going.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.120
Plus, and it just
keeps going, right?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.130
So what happens when
you simplify that?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.520
So that equals 1 plus i
x -- What's i squared?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.960
That's negative 1, right?
-- minus x squared

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.410
over 2 factorial.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.250
What's i to the third?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.160
That's minus i.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.490
So it's minus i x to the
third over 3 factorial

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.310
plus i to the fourth.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.140
So what's i to the fourth?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.870
That's just 1 again.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.910
So we get plus x to the
fourth over 4 factorial.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.990
And then we have --
what's i to the fifth?

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.330
Plus i times x to the
fifth over 5 factorial.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.270
It just keeps going.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.740
We have something
interesting here.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.000
Now, all of a sudden, we have
something extremely similar to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.670
this except for only
one difference.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.790
Compare that to e to the i x.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.740
The dots on my i's
always get merged.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.970
Compare these 2 things
that I'm circling.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.710
What's the difference?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.870
Let's see the 1, 1.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.710
Well, here, I have an
x, I have an i x here.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.410
Then minus x squared
over 2 fact -- so these

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.830
terms are the same.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.330
Then on the x to the third, the
signs are right but have an i.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.850
And then, x to the fourth over
4 factorial -- that's identical

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.850
-- but then on x to the
fifth, I have an i.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.360
So the only difference between
this and this is on the terms

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.290
that involve sin of x, right?

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.030
So what are the terms
that involve sin of x?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.690
This term corresponds
to that term, right?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.140
This term corresponds
to that term.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.430
These are the terms that
correspond to sin of x

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.720
in this representation.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.070
That term corresponds
to that term.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.750
And the only difference is --
so this has all of the terms

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.330
that the sin of x would have
but they all have an i in

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.880
front of them, right?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.060
Even the sign is right.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.150
This is negative,
that's negative.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.600
But this just has an
i in front of it.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.210
So it turns out, that you
could rewrite this, right?

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.080
You could rewrite
this representation.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.160
Well, it doesn't turn out.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.360
It's pretty obvious
you could rewrite it.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.170
Let me clear this
just so we get a --

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.952
So we could actually
rewrite that e to the i x.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.600
And we could write it -- we
could separate out the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.500
imaginary terms and we could
separate out the real terms.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.240
What were the real terms?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:19.020
Well, the real terms were 1
minus x squared over 2

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:27.390
factorial plus x to the fourth
over 4 factorial minus x to the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.070
sixth over 6 factorial.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.190
And it just kept going
to infinity, right?

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.210
Those were the real terms.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.670
That's to infinity dot dot dot.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.590
This pen tool looks
like minus signs.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.280
I don't want to do that.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.760
Oh, I can't undo it.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.335
So this is just dot dot dot.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.030
So those are the real
terms, essentially.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.310
And then, the imaginary terms
-- it was plus -- well, all of

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.810
these terms are going to
have i on them, right?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.980
So let me just take the i out.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.910
So, plus i times -- and we
figured out that those terms

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.535
were x minus -- well, I don't
want to give it away too fast

00:06:14.535 --> 00:06:18.740
-- x to the third
over 3 factorial.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.070
Plus x to the fifth over 5
factorial minus x to the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.170
seventh over 7 factorial and
it just kept going on, on,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.600
and on to infinity, right?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.600
Well isn't this the Maclaurin
representation of cosine of x?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.810
And similarly, isn't this the
Maclaurin representation

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.890
of sin of x?

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.610
Well yeah, sure.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.640
And you probably realized it in
the previous screen where I

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.370
showed that all of the
imaginary terms corresponded

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.060
to the sin of x terms.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.600
And all the real ones,
likewise, were the cosine of x

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.480
when we we compared it to sin
of x plus cosine of x.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.895
So if you believe me, that the
Maclaurin representation of e

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:06.160
to the x is equal to e to the x
and the Maclaurin

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.700
representation of cosine and
sin of x are equal to those

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.080
functions, then all of a
sudden, we come up with this

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:21.400
bizarre and amazing and
mystical idea that e to the i x

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:28.880
is equal to cosin of x plus i
times the sin of x.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.160
And this is called
Euler's formula.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.660
And actually e
stands for Euler.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.890
That's where it comes from.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.930
Euler starts with an E.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.520
E U L E R.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.480
But this is amazing.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.640
Not only have we found a
relationship between this

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.980
bizarre, mystical, magical
number, e, and these

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.290
trigonometric functions that we
defined as a ratio of the sides

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.210
of right triangles, but now
we're involving this other

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.670
mystical, magical number that
we invented just so that all of

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.210
our polynomials would have some
root, whether or not

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.040
they're real or not.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.240
We have this number, i, all
of a sudden showing up.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.340
This by itself is amazing.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.890
But now we can take it one
step further and this

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.540
should blow your mind.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.850
If it doesn't, then
you have no emotion.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.600
I will just judge you.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.680
So if we take this and,
essentially, we're taking it

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.530
that when you take something to
the i power, that you can just

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.170
substitute it into this
Maclaurin repres -- but I

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.350
won't go into the details.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.770
But I think you can say
that this is a pretty

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.980
reasonable proposition.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.140
But what happens if we take
something to the pi power?

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.620
If e to the i pi power?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.310
Before, we didn't have any
way of saying, "Well,

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.930
what does that mean?

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.910
Taking something to the i pi
power?" But now we do because

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.730
we're saying that these
2 sides of this are

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.490
equal to each other.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.550
So what happens?

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.360
Let me do this in a bold color
because it deserves to be bold.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.410
e to the i pi is equal to well,
where x is pi, is equal to

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:07.110
cosine of pi plus i sin of pi.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.940
Well what's cosine of pi?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.960
This is equal to negative 1.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.090
And sin of pi, well
that's just equal to 0.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:22.140
We get e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.690
This is amazing.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:31.810
Or you could also write e to
the i pi plus 1 is equal to 0.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.520
Once again, amazing.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.100
Either of these should make you
question your take on reality

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.565
because we have the number pi,
which is a ratio of a

00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:42.260
circumference of a
circle to its diameter.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.120
We have the number, e, that
comes from a continuous

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.030
compound interest.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.750
And then we have the number, i,
which you can say the square

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.040
root of negative 1 or it
squared is negative 1.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.530
And they all come together.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.390
This formula right here
involves all the fundamental

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.370
numbers in mathematics but
they come from completely

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.640
different directions.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.190
Completely different
directions.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.190
And although we can prove this
and we can say this is true,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.210
I'll tell you no one -- no one
-- probably in the history

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.210
of mankind, fully
understands why this is.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.830
This is just a glimpse on some
type of order in the universe.
