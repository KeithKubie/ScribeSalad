00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:11.561
Welcome to our project
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:15.099
in which experts from
our Latin American communities

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.759
will teach you
how to use our tools,

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.528
developer products,

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.198
APIs and new tricks.

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:25.231
I'm glad to inaugurate this
Google Developers Hackademy

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.396
with a course created
and presented by Antonio Guzman,

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:31.495
organizer of the GDG
Androidtitlan in Mexico.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.495
This course consists
of five parts.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.858
We invite you to watch it
and learn with us.

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:37.099
Let's begin.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.924
Hello, my name is
Antonio Guzman.

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:48.990
Welcome to this
introduction course

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.693
to Google Apps Script.

00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:53.396
In this course,
our goal is to get you closer

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:55.066
to the Google Apps Script
concept,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.693
knowing the necessary elements
to start working,

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.858
knowing the services available,

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:05.627
and giving examples
with some programming.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.891
We'll work with Spreadsheet,
Document

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.396
and we'll integrate the Gmail
e-mail sending service.

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:15.726
In this first lesson,
we'll talk about 3 things:

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.726
what is Google Apps Script,

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:20.924
what is needed to build
our own scripts,

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:24.264
and which are the services
available in the platform.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.462
Throughout the lesson
we'll do an exercise,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.297
and when we finish,
we'll understand the concept

00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:32.033
of Google Apps Script

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.957
and we'll be able
to execute our own scripts.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:38.033
In business and personal
environments,

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.957
Google Apps allow us
to store, generate

00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:42.825
and transform information,

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.891
but we don't always persist it.

00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:48.231
This is where Google Apps Script
gives us the chance

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.561
to maximize the value
of our information

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:53.627
because we can exploit it
in a simple way.

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:57.066
Some of the services we use
every day

00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:01.396
have APIs, which, using
the JavaScript syntax,

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:03.759
allow us to write programs

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.528
to do all kinds of things

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:09.561
that range from something
as simple as extracting

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.957
the number of unread e-mails,

00:02:11.957 --> 00:02:14.462
to more elaborated ones,

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:18.264
like translating the information
of a spreadsheet,

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:20.594
sending it to another document,

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:23.462
and then attaching it
to an e-mail

00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:25.429
we're sending through Gmail.

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:29.132
There are several services
available in Google Apps Script

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:33.198
and they're divided
into two categories:

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:36.363
the first category is called
Google Apps Services,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:39.297
which includes Calendar,
Contacts,

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.132
Dodlist,

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:42.957
Document, Domain,

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.132
Drive, Finance,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.660
Forms,

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.759
Gmail,

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:48.792
Groups,

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:49.924
Language,

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:50.957
Maps,

00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:52.198
Sites,

00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:53.627
Spreadsheet...

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.990
And well, the other group
is the advanced services one.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.693
In this group we have:

00:02:58.693 --> 00:02:59.693
Adsense,

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:00.792
Analytics,

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:01.990
Bigquery,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.165
Prediction,

00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:05.594
Task and Urlshortener.

00:03:05.858 --> 00:03:07.825
é »hich ones have you used?

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:08.924
In this case,

00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:11.330
though we're writing
JavaScript programs,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.099
they're neither run
on the client's side

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.693
nor executed in the browser.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:17.462
These programs run
on the server's side,

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:21.066
but we don't need to configure
a specialized server either,

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.297
they run on Google's
infrastructure,

00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:25.297
they run on Google's servers.

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:28.066
So, to start the development
of Google Apps Script

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.528
we need to visit
the developers' site.

00:03:30.528 --> 00:03:33.594
There, we'll find a section
devoted to App Script

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:37.297
and we need to see the site
as an initial info source,

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:40.429
since there we'll find
the definition for App Script,

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.726
the basic and intermediate
tutorials,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.264
the documentation
for the services available

00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:46.825
in the platform,

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:49.693
and it also works
as an access route

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:52.660
to the Code Editor,
where we will start

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.066
writing our programs.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.033
And now it's time
to start programming.

00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:00.363
LET'S GET TO WORK

00:04:02.528 --> 00:04:06.198
Click on the center red button,
"Start scripting,"

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:10.330
to redirect you
to scriptgoogle.com.

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:13.825
We see a welcome window.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:17.132
The welcome window
has different elements

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.693
which are templates
to create scripts,

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:22.363
tutorials and the scripts

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.495
we've recently created.

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:28.363
We're going to choose
an empty option, Blank Project.

00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:31.891
When on the Editor screen,

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:35.825
the first thing to do
is name the project.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.792
We will name this one "gas01."

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.330
We click on OK

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.792
and we continue
building our script

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:47.231
and getting familiarized
with our environment.

00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.066
Notice that we have
several menu options

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:52.627
that facilitate the programming.

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.264
We can see the Log,
access the Help,

00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:58.726
publish the function list
we have,

00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:01.858
and, well, we now have
a function skeleton.

00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:03.792
Let's declare our variable,

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:07.429
to which a document
we'll create will be associated.

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.693
In order to create
the document, we will use

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:12.264
the "DocumentApp" class.

00:05:12.264 --> 00:05:15.429
The DocumentApp class
is part of the APIs that,

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:17.198
as we mentioned before,

00:05:17.198 --> 00:05:20.759
allow us to use the services
available in the platform.

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.033
DocumentApp has a method

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:26.957
called "create".

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:31.066
This method receives
a text chain

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.066
that is the name
for the document

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.891
we want to create.

00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:39.066
This document is created

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:41.528
into our Google Drive unit.

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:45.825
We'll give it a name similar
to the one of our script:

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:47.957
"gas -01."

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:52.792
Now, what we're going to do
is putting text

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:56.066
in our document.
For this, we get its body

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:59.462
and it's there where
we will paste the text.

00:05:59.462 --> 00:06:03.066
We use a method called
"appendParagraph,"

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.396
which needs us to give it
a text chain,

00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:10.165
which in this case will be:

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.594
"Welcome
to the world of scripts,"

00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:16.891
and this way we already have

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:20.858
a paragraph in our document;
it exists and has a content.

00:06:22.297 --> 00:06:25.495
It'd also be good
to add a second paragraph to it

00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:28.033
to keep adding content.

00:06:28.363 --> 00:06:31.627
Then, how do we do that?
Just as we did it before.

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:35.990
Document,
we get this object's body

00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:40.099
and once again, the method
is the same: appendParagraph,

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:43.297
but now we will change
the text, all right?

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:46.231
Would you like it
if it now says:

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:49.891
"Welcome to the world
of Google Apps Script?"

00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:53.297
Remember, the method
gets a text chain

00:06:53.297 --> 00:06:57.165
which is "Welcome to the world
of Google Apps Script."

00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:01.594
Semicolon, we finish
our sentence...

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:05.231
Now we save it

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:08.825
and we run our script
for the first time.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.495
In the upper bar we see
it is running

00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:16.099
and it asks something.
Every script we run

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.594
needs the user's authorization.

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:20.627
So we give it to it.

00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.198
It lets us know
which are the permissions

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:24.726
this script has.

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.429
It says it'll access our unit,

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:29.462
so we click on "OK"

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:31.759
and we already know
what our script needs:

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.858
accessing our Drive.

00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:36.693
We create a document in Drive,
so we enter:

00:07:36.693 --> 00:07:38.396
drive.google.com.

00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:41.198
We search our document.
Do you remember its name?

00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:43.231
"gas -01,"

00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:45.495
and then it opens it.

00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:48.396
And there's the text
we had written:

00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:50.528
"Welcome to the world
of scripts."

00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:53.396
"Welcome to the world
of Google Apps Scripts,"

00:07:53.396 --> 00:07:57.066
and our script worked,
it did what we asked it to do.

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:01.759
The scenarios, problems
and opportunities we have

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.495
are very diverse.

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:07.033
That's why,
when we build a script,

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.891
we have to consider
all the services available

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.462
to reach the best
possible solution.

00:08:13.924 --> 00:08:16.594
Each one of these services,
as we saw it,

00:08:16.594 --> 00:08:18.495
has its own APIs.

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:22.264
We'll have to use them
to reach that solution.

00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:26.429
So we can state
that Google Apps Script

00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:29.033
is not a way or a recipe,

00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:31.726
but the possibility to choose

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:35.363
several items
to reach a solution.

00:08:36.297 --> 00:08:38.528
RECAP

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.033
Before starting our next lesson,

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:44.990
I recommend you keep
getting familiarized

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.396
with the resources available
in the developers' site.

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:51.033
Let's remember
we have the APIs there

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:53.990
for the different services
available.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.495
Check them out,

00:08:55.495 --> 00:08:58.066
why not choose those
that correspond

00:08:58.066 --> 00:08:59.858
to the services you use more.

00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.693
Perhaps Calendar, Gmail,
Spreadsheet, Drive...

00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:05.660
When you start seeing
the API's methods

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.198
and you'll certainly come up
with things you can do

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.990
for the next scripts
you are trying.

00:09:12.264 --> 00:09:15.363
You'll be able to ....
scenarios, solutions,

00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:18.990
and well, now it's time
to getting familiarized

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.033
with the editor.
We saw it has several menus

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.957
and each menu,
several options.

00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:26.198
Start clicking here and there.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.627
You also have to remember
what we did in the beginning:

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.462
clicking on "Start scripting"

00:09:32.462 --> 00:09:34.165
in the developers' site.

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:36.957
Next time, when you want
to build a script,

00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:39.198
you don't need to do it
from there,

00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:41.792
you'll be able to do it
from Google Drive,

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:45.231
where an option to create
script-like documents

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.165
has been added, and that's it,

00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:50.693
you'll have started building
scripts from Google Drive.

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:54.099
This is it for our first lesson.

00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:57.759
In the next lesson we'll see
the different types of scripts

00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:00.495
and we will try
two execution modes:

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.330
the manual and the
time-triggered executions.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.264
See you next time.

00:10:05.264 --> 00:10:06.759
Keep on programming.
