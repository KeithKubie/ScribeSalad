1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,753
Go ahead.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,930
Okay. Is your mic on? Yeah, I'm
getting, this is making me nervous.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,870
Maybe I should get my epipen.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,980
Are you allergic to radio
greatness that I know of.

5
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:23,810
I haven't been really exposed to it
yet. Anyway, let's go. Are we rolling?

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,970
We're good. We're going,
we're rolling. Okay.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm Robert Krulwich.

8
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:33,670
This is Radiolab and today we're going
to begin with a conversation between Dan

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,720
Pashman. Okay. Um, post of a podcast
here at w NYC called the Sporkful.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,840
It's about food and Amy Pearl. Amy. Yes.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,240
A digital producer here at
the station who likes food.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,770
And the conversation they had was
about something that happened to Amy,

13
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:50,650
which she never expected,
certainly didn't want.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,620
And yet it could happen
to any of us at any time.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,210
So years ago, before any
of this happened to you,

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,480
just tell me what was your
relationship with meat?

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,050
My relationship with meat? Yeah. Well,

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,960
you know how when you're
little and your mom is like,

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,900
you could have any special
dinner for your birthday.

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,810
My dinner was meatballs and
she was like, except me.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,170
Balls are so hard to
make. So it was pot roast.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,810
And then Peter Lucchino, Peter Luger's
mistake house in Brooklyn. Yeah,

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,610
I used to go there quite often and I live
there and I have a Peter Liquor credit

24
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,790
card, so all those hard to
get I, you know, I don't,

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,400
I don't know how they give them
out, but nobody seems to have one.

26
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:36,710
I don't think they give them out anymore.
But I mean I was very interrupted.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,860
Like I was living in
Williamsburg and it just,

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,810
it opened at like one o'clock every day
and you could just walk in at one that

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,790
had an amazing bar. There's
no tablecloths on the table.

30
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,990
These old German waiters, they bring
out your porterhouse for three.

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,040
They put a little plate upside down and
then put the big platter on top of it.

32
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,560
So it's tilted and all
the juice runs to the end.

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,250
And then they like have the special
double spoon thing that they somehow like

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,780
scoop juice onto your
steak and oh, so good.

35
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,230
And also like the smell of burning
fat from a hamburger. What do I mean?

36
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,020
Dogs? Oh my God, I love hotdogs so much.

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,150
When you bite into them and they're like,

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,030
I'm have like a snap and like having a
weenie roast out in the open air is just

39
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,730
at, it's like the, Oh
God, so good. Anyway, I,

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,860
I was always very intimate.
What changed? Oh my God,

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,090
it was terrible. It was, what happened
was I was having this beautiful,

42
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,230
it was spring time.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,670
I was having a beautiful leg of lamb with
some neighbors and we'd like put it on

44
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:48,720
the grill and it was just a
delicious, beautiful dinner.

45
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,721
And I had served with it some ramps that
I foraged in my mom's yard for ramp by

46
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,590
the way, is just a wild onion. And so,

47
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,370
so we had this delicious
meal and then, you know,

48
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:04,000
I went home and I was going
to sleep at like midnight,

49
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,050
like few hours later and I
just felt weird. I was like,

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,230
Oh God, something's wrong.
I feel like really anxious,

51
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,760
like something's wrong with me.

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,300
And I went in the bathroom and I like
look in the mirror and my face was like

53
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,080
all weird looking. And I was like,
I kept laying down and be like,

54
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,450
I'll just sleep it off, whatever
it is. But every time I laid down,

55
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,270
I felt like I was going to faint. So I
was like prop myself up and I was like,

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Oh God does having terrible like stomach
cramps and just like a weird feeling of

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,030
impending doom, you know? But
just like anybody, I'm just like,

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,760
just get a good nights
sleep. This'll pass.

59
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:39,940
I like splash a little water on
my face. I mean, I'm tell him,

60
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,630
made me think this, but I
thought like maybe a snail,

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
a tiny snail was on one of them ramps
that I ate and it was like poisoning me

62
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,590
somehow, you know, snails, I
mean they probably poisonous.

63
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,560
So I called my friends in the morning.
I was like, hey, how are you guys doing?

64
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,550
How was dinner? They were
like, oh, so great. I was like,

65
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,260
really so great. Nothing
weird like panic attacks.

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,200
And they were like, and they were
like, oh, that was so lovely.

67
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,960
Thank you so much. Let's do it again.
Blah, blah, blah. I was like, wow.

68
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,050
I really had a rough night and,
but I didn't think anything of it.

69
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,510
And I went on with my life,
you know, just like whatever.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,320
And then about a week or two later I
made some cheeseburgers and I ate a

71
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:30,961
cheeseburger and I was
watching 'em goodbye Mr Chips,

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,980
really teared jerking movie
and a good book too. And um,

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,460
about a couple of hours
after I ate, I was like,

74
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,700
started to feel really weird again.
I was like feeling like I was like,

75
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,830
had to stand up. I was like, I think I'm
gonna Faint. I feel really lightheaded,

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,320
I can't catch my breath. I feel like
really woozy. But if anytime I laid down,

77
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,180
I really felt like I was going to faint.

78
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,420
So I was like trying to say sitting
upright and I was like, oh my God,

79
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,254
this is very slim.

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,190
Or I've ran into the bathroom and I was
like looking in the mirror and lo and

81
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,431
behold,

82
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,210
I had hives all over my stomach and then
they started coming out in my hands and

83
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,980
I was like, oh my God,
something's happening.

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,020
And at one point I did get up and unlock
my door because I did feel like I'm

85
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:11,890
going to pass out,

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,470
call an ambulance and then they're
not going to be able to get in.

87
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,620
So I mean I was in a little bit afraid
of what was happening and when I woke up

88
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:20,830
in the morning,

89
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,540
the first thing I did was Google sudden
meat allergy cause I was like this seems

90
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,660
like an allergy. And the only
thing that was the same was meat.

91
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,130
And I'm going through and like the second
thing that came up was this article

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,900
that was like Florida man has
sudden meat allergy. I was like,

93
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,360
oh my God, I think it's a
possible I could have this.

94
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,240
And so I made an appointment
with my doctor. I brought
in the article, I'm like,

95
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm going to be this person, but I can
do it. I had the article in my pocket,

96
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,311
you know,

97
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,340
the person who goes to their doctor
was something I found on the Internet.

98
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,560
So I brought the article,

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,680
it was in my pocket and like I got
through the like checkup and I was too

100
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:02,600
chicken. I went when I was
paying the receptionist,

101
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,530
I pulled it out and gave it to
the receptionist and I was like,

102
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,780
could you give this to the doctor?

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,840
So that was like the best I could do.

104
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,920
And then I did call my doctor and had
a conversation with them on the phone

105
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,960
asking him if I could get
tested. And he was like, no,

106
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,000
there's no such thing as a
meat allergy, blah blah blah.

107
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,650
So some people think allergies are
just like in your head and people,

108
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,450
this is science writer, Peter Smith.

109
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,830
We got in touch with him after Lee
heard Amy's story because Peter is an

110
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:36,831
investigator of many things including
strange allergies and people are like,

111
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,250
mushrooms hurt them or they think wifi
hurts them. Yeah, Wifi hurts them.

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,990
And I don't know. And
when our producer left,

113
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,220
if NASA and I got into the studio and
we told them about Amy story, he said,

114
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:51,570
yeah, all right. I know exactly who
you need to talk to. Hello? Yeah.

115
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:56,460
Hi Thomas Platts mills. This is Thomas
Plant smells. That's right. How are you?

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,390
I'm very well.

117
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,140
Dr [inaudible] Mills is down at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

118
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:04,890
He's a professor and he works at an
allergy clinic, donut allergy clinic.

119
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,900
We are constantly sifting through
stories, which not only you don't believe,

120
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,940
but are actually nonsense simply. And
he told us in the last 10 years or so,

121
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:18,030
he started hearing lots of
stories, just like Amy, right?

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,210
Somebody shows up at the office,
convinced that they're allergic.

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,880
All of a sudden for no
apparent reason to red meat.

124
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,910
The first time I heard it was probably
as early as 2004 and every single time he

125
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,580
heard the story, he would tell the patient
exactly what Amy's doctor told her.

126
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,910
Nope, no way. No, no, no.
It's not possible. Right?

127
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,430
So what was wrong with these
complaints? You know, uh, you know,

128
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,310
in an Orthodox medical way,
oh, everything. Everything.

129
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:49,311
Adults don't become allergic to something
they've eaten for 40 years out of the

130
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:54,840
blue and certainly not red meat. So
you're basically saying to these patients,

131
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,440
I think you must be making this
up because I can't explain it.

132
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,140
I don't use language like
that. I said, I say that.

133
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,570
I was saying I was trying to
give you your inner voice. Oh,

134
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,260
you don't want to know what doctors
are thinking in their inner voices.

135
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,050
You know? You often think in
the middle of an interview.

136
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:17,760
Is it possible that he's got, you know,
some ghastly disease? Mad Cow. Yeah.

137
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,760
You know, the point is that when
he'd hear a story like Amy's,

138
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,890
he just didn't believe it,
but then everything changed.

139
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,920
Thanks. Oddly enough to cancer drug,

140
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,960
this new cancer drug called
Cetuximab in New York. Today,

141
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:37,230
Martha Stewart was indicted
on criminal charges relating.

142
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,770
This is the very drug that got Martha
Stewart in all that trouble for insider

143
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,790
trading. It. Remember that I went to
jail for six months. Yeah. Anyway,

144
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,970
very promising, exciting
new drug, but then

145
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,390
doctors were giving people this injection
and I would just end up on the floor

146
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:58,080
of the doctor's office in shock. Yeah.
That would be an NF lactic shock.

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,120
Their hearts would start beating faster.

148
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,340
They'd get short of breath
and get stomach cramps.

149
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,890
Their immune system would start to
overreact to something new and alien that

150
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,250
came in with the drug. Basically
a classic allergic reaction.

151
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,870
So the industry lands on Thomas
pots. Mills his desk. Yes.

152
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,310
So we were asked to look at Cetuximab
to see if they could figure out what was

153
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:24,270
causing the reaction. And He tests
two groups of blood, a control sample,

154
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,440
and then people that have this allergy
and he quickly zeroed in on a particular

155
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,470
molecule. The sugar, it
was part of the drug.

156
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,650
This sugar Galack Toes
Alpha one three gallon toes.

157
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,960
Oh, Alpha Alpha Gal. Yeah,

158
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,200
as in a particularly great lady. Yeah.

159
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,310
Better than the Beta or gamma gallons
like Alpha male Alpha female didn't quite

160
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:50,280
have a ring to it for
Alpha. The alpha. Anyway,

161
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,380
it seemed like Alpha Gal
was the culprit. Yeah.

162
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,080
And if you'd told me four years earlier
that there's a whole lot of people out

163
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:02,400
there who are allergic to this sugar,
I'd have thought you were smoking.

164
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,170
You know vaping again,

165
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,730
because not only does this sugar
Alpha Gal show up in the cancer drug,

166
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:13,110
and this is where we get back to Amy, it
also shows up in the blood of mammals.

167
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,600
[inaudible]

168
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,510
all non primate mammals.

169
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,100
So every time you eat
lamb or beef, goat, camel,

170
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,780
even tripe or pig's kidneys,
you're also eating Alfa Gallo.

171
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,773
[inaudible].

172
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,520
So I'm reading this
article and it says like,

173
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,840
it's this thing called
Alpha lactase or Alpha gala.

174
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,480
So it made no sense that someone like
Amy who'd been eating meat all her life

175
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,790
would suddenly somehow
be allergic. The AlphaGo,

176
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,070
I just was like, this was
so stupid. The whole show.

177
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,980
One day it's getting
to be barbecue season.

178
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:56,981
I usually have like a couple of barbecues
where I'd just do a whole park bought

179
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,710
and brisket and like hang
out all day doing it.

180
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,740
And I was like very wanted
to do that and I was like,

181
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm just going to not eat meat and not
even know. So I was like, forget it.

182
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,100
My doctor all tests me,
I'm gonna test myself.

183
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,140
So I was like going to be very careful.

184
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,970
I got a thing of Benadryl and I was
like, I'm not going to do it alone.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,180
I'll do it with my mom, my poor mom.

186
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,680
And so I went up to my mom's and
she's like really into food too.

187
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:29,090
So she was like, oh this is so exciting.
I got two porterhouse steaks on Salads,

188
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:33,410
dues zoos explained to her
what testing he had dead.

189
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,590
Cause I had talked a little bit about it
with their so like fire up the grill do

190
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,650
the porter has,

191
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:44,390
I even think I like Instagram that as
a joke like ha ha ha this might be the

192
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,740
last time you hear from me.

193
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,690
But so you know we're
having a nice summer day.

194
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:52,820
Just me and my mom having our steak.

195
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:57,820
I ate like a couple of bites cause I was
slightly nervous and I was like sitting

196
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:02,500
in the grass with my dog and reading a
book and trying to think like do I feel

197
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,750
normal? Which try it folks.

198
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,751
It's hard to figure out when you start
asking yourself do I feel normal?

199
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,020
Does this, am I breathing?

200
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,130
Oh it's my stomach hurt or
something wrong. And I was like,

201
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:21,490
after a while I was like
Ugh, I feel pretty good.

202
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,840
And the neighbor came over and was
like chatting with us and it was in the

203
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,980
middle of that conversation
where I was like, oh,

204
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,250
I kind of feel like I have
to go to the bathroom,

205
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,160
but maybe I just have to go to the
bathroom. So I went to the bathroom.

206
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:37,930
I was sitting there and I was
like, Oh God, something feels bad.

207
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,910
And then I was like, Oh God, I
definitely, this is not right,

208
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,750
something's wrong.

209
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:48,751
And I went in to get the Benadryl and I
took the Benadryl and I went on my bed

210
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,240
and at the guestroom at my mom's and I
was like sitting on there and I was like,

211
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,460
oh, I just don't feel right. Oh,
maybe I just take a deep breath.

212
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,240
I'll just stand up. Maybe I just put
my hands over my head like this. Hi.

213
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:05,500
That does feel slightly better I
think. And then I was finally like,

214
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,220
I think we should go to the hospital.
And I went out side. I was like, mom,

215
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,080
I think you have to
drive me to the hospital.

216
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,750
She was like talking to her
neighbor like, what? Oh my God,

217
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,420
let me go change my
clothes, change my clothes.

218
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm like, mom, you know she's not
wearing the hospital level clothes,

219
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,920
so I'm like, okay, hurry up mom, mom,
are you ready mom? And then I was like,

220
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,720
while she was changing your clothes,
I suddenly was like, oh my God,

221
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,610
I got my wallet out and my Cell Phone
and I've like threw it towards my mom's

222
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:37,330
bedroom door and I was like,
here's my insurance card.

223
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,880
Call an ambulance and I
just like hit the floor.

224
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,820
Eventually the ambulance
arrives and I got stabilized.

225
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,020
I was strapped to the thing.

226
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:51,310
I was in the emergency room like
they were shooting. They full of,

227
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,350
I don't know what Epinephrin and
adrenaline and the little like 12 year old

228
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,940
mercy room doctor runs in and he was
like, I looked it up on the Internet,

229
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,360
Africa. Fascinating. What? That's
terrible. I've never heard of that.

230
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:07,540
Could it be true? Yes, it's true. Like
they're all having this discussion there.

231
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,870
Then when I went back to my doctor
after that and I was like, Hey,

232
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,390
just get out of the emergency room,
because they tested me for Alpha gout.

233
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,850
I'm allergic to meat.

234
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,750
So this is an allergy. Yeah.

235
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,790
So all of a sudden you're looking at the
quote crazies and they're not so crazy

236
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,110
anymore. Absolutely.

237
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:32,111
We suddenly had a blood test and of course
what turned out is all these patients

238
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,670
who'd been telling us this
story were allergic to AlphaGo,

239
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,960
but, but it's still like a mystery. Right?

240
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,730
There are Thomas Platts mills couldn't
figure out why people like Amy,

241
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:51,680
who had lived for 40 years
eating porterhouse steaks
at Peter Luger's a credit

242
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,620
card. Why would she
suddenly develop an allergy?

243
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:57,500
Now there's gotta be some
kind of trigger. Yes.

244
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,190
Two we were looking for anything that
could explain it. It could be a mold,

245
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,820
it could be a nematode worm or a fungus.

246
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,680
But then he looked again and noticed
that all the people who had had bad

247
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:13,700
reactions to the cancer drug, they were
in a particular area of the country

248
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,000
that was Virginia, North Carolina,
southern Missouri, Arkansas.

249
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,630
No cases in Salt Lake
City, no cases in Denver.

250
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:25,740
Smatterings down the west. So he turned
to his technician, Jake, and he said,

251
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,191
I said,

252
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:31,191
you've got to Google every map you can
find and say what matches that area,

253
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,370
cures or diseases that appear
where ever the allergy appears.

254
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,510
So Jake starts googling, googling
and googling and googling. Yeah.

255
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,100
And eventually he comes across a map
that matches where the cases are very

256
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:50,210
beautifully. The maximum area
for rocky mountain spotted fever.

257
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,380
So he made this little map and it's like
the shaded dark areas of the country

258
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,100
are at places with rocky
mountain spotted fever.

259
00:15:56,101 --> 00:16:00,450
And then there's like some stars where
you know this, this allergy hit appeared.

260
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah. And they, they overlap.
Ah, very interesting.

261
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,250
And then all of a sudden it clicks.

262
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,150
Rocky mountain spotted fever
is a tick borne disease.

263
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,290
This is the distribution
of the Lonestar tick.

264
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,960
And actually just a little before this,

265
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:23,020
it turns out and allergists down
in Australia, Sheryl van Noonan,

266
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,220
first name Cheryl is h Goyo, the Noonan,

267
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:30,600
v I n and then nun e n and I'm
from the Tikkun juiced. Allergies,

268
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,060
research and awareness
center in Sydney, Australia.

269
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,830
She says she was now being visited by
all kinds of people who claim suddenly to

270
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,700
be allergic to meat. And whenever
I take a history, so for example,

271
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,810
I'd ask them, was there a family
history of rhinitis, Eczema, asthma,

272
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,770
a stinging insect allergy. And they
say they've all been bitten by ticks.

273
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,780
When we started asking patients,

274
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,860
we suddenly heard the
stories just out the Kazoo

275
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,440
[inaudible]

276
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,070
but at this point, Dr Platz
Mills, all he has is a map,

277
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,750
some stories and a hunch, right?
So, so what does he do? He decides,

278
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,750
well maybe I'll just do this
to myself. He does what?

279
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,730
He decides to test it on herself. Oh my
God. He sort of like [inaudible] like

280
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,990
the nihs that he did it intentionally.
I know I had no intention. I mean he,

281
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,830
I think he also likes to walk and
amble and think about things, right?

282
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:26,520
So he goes for a long walk and
along the Blue Ridge Mountain.

283
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,960
And I knew I wanted to be off trial
because I'm actually rather allergic to

284
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:35,460
humans. So he's walking
and walking and walking.

285
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:36,840
And along the way, ah,

286
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,890
he bumps into a whole bunch of texts
and if you walk into a nest of those

287
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,370
things, oh my God, this sounds
like a nightmare. Yeah, absolutely.

288
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,490
I got 200 seat ticks a
boy and then in of that

289
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,600
year I was taken out to dinner and the
lamb chops were particularly delicious

290
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,380
and the French wine was delicious
and six hours later I woke up,

291
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,370
covered in hives.

292
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,810
[inaudible]

293
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,730
he's got an allergy to red meat all
just because of the tick by tick bite.

294
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,623
That's right.

295
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,620
[inaudible] you're right
back after this. Hi,

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,260
when the legendary rapper prodigy died
after being hospitalized for sickle cell

301
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,000
anemia last year. His friends,

302
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,840
his fans were shocked in a cemetery
like you're talking about this sunny day

303
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:44,650
right here that we have right now, man
making beats Friday g is dead right now.

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,090
It takes you inside prodigy's music and
asks why he couldn't escape a single

307
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,050
recessive gene.

I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

310
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:10,651
Now we go back to Amy just when she's
discovered that the allergy to meat that

311
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:14,110
she's developed comes from a tick bite,

312
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,320
a tick bite. Hang on a second.

313
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,570
Because like a few weeks before all
this started happening, as I said,

314
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:27,571
I was forging for ramps in my mom's
backyard and I had a tick on my,

315
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,303
on my arm.

316
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,100
Now it turns out that not only was that
tick bite a terrible thing for Amy,

317
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,630
it was a kind of double
tragedy from [inaudible]

318
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,900
amongst the trees. I
didn't, the undergrowth,

319
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,310
and I think it's only right at this
point to backup is a fascinating world of

320
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,580
wonders and consider the story
from the tics point of view.

321
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:53,900
[inaudible]

322
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,950
okay. So, uh, I'm Graham heckling.

323
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,530
I am a wildlife disease ecologist
at the University of Tennessee.

324
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,480
So I was wondering if you could help us,
uh, tell the story of a, in this case,

325
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,870
the lone star tick that
bit Amy. Oh yeah, sure.

326
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,550
So they start off on
this little pile of eggs,

327
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,000
perhaps a massive 2000
eggs under the leaves.

328
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,340
The proud mom who just
gave birth at that point,

329
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:22,850
she's just a kind of a
withered husk meaning dead.

330
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,340
But anyway, a few weeks later,

331
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:30,341
those eggs will hatch and this massive
2000 baby techs emerge from under the

332
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:34,040
leaves. Could I see
them with my naked eye?

333
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,760
If you ran into a mass
of them all up together,

334
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,540
you would feel like you've got a little
smudge of dirt and then the dirt starts

335
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,290
walking.

336
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,950
And so they'll just climb up and they'll
know potentially all be on the same

337
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,930
leaf, all the same looking
for something to feed on. Now,

338
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:54,070
one teeny little tiny problem for these
teeny little tiny ticks is that they dry

339
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:56,410
out. So when they come
up from under the leaves,

340
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,800
they come up briefly and then they
go back down, get a little water,

341
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:04,270
come back up, get thirsty, go back down.
And rehydrate. So they like commute.

342
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,790
Exactly. And we refer to the behavior
as questing Ah, restless thing.

343
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,790
So if you were one of these little baby
ticks questing for food while you're up

344
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,390
there,

345
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,920
you are essentially velcro because on
each one of your little legs you have

346
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:22,660
little kind of hook like structures.
And so you're flat against the leaf,

347
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,890
sort of sniffing in the air with your two
little front legs I can detect you see

348
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,690
a two heat movement.

349
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,930
So let's say one day you're sitting
there on your leaf and you pick up the

350
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:35,920
scent, I mean nearby mouse mice of
the potato chips or the ecosystem,

351
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,940
everything he gets them. You might
be about to have the very first meal.

352
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,740
So you basically stand up,

353
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,310
stretch out all your little
legs and do a tick dons.

354
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,540
And so it's kind of interpretive dance
like movements while you're waiting for

355
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,670
that mouse to come just close
enough that you can grab onto it.

356
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,750
So you're dancing and you're waiting and
you're dancing and you're waiting and

357
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:03,001
you're dancing and you waiting
and you're dancing on your way to,

358
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,611
to be honest,

359
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:11,611
you are probably going to wait your
entire life and die unfulfilled because

360
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,600
there are 2000 of you starting
off and a stable tick population.

361
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,230
There's only going to be two of
you that survive. Oh my gosh.

362
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,180
So 1,998 little baby ticks are
born and then that's it for them.

363
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,650
But let's say that you're one of
the lucky ones and one sunny day.

364
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,980
There you are hanging
out on your little leaf.

365
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,760
When you detect two incoming mammals,

366
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:43,000
one is a 40 year old hominid,
the other is her dog.

367
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,190
So you perk up to rest
your legs out, wave,

368
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,430
do the tech docs and say
that you're waving and you're
dancing and you're hoping

369
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,041
and you're waving you.

370
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,260
You're dancing and you're
hoping and you're waving and
you're dancing and you're

371
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:56,530
hoping and slowly the dog getting closer
and closer and closer and you reach out

372
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,000
with one of your tiny little
little, so you get [inaudible]

373
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,890
grab and eat and survive.

374
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,920
But the reason that tick ended up on me
was I slept in bed with my dog naked.

375
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,720
I mean, she's always naked, but I was
also naked. I mean, that's not gross.

376
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,860
I don't, I mean, does that
sound weird? No, but what,

377
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,000
but how do you know
that's what had happened?

378
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:26,830
Because I know that like I did a good
tick check on myself and I took a shower

379
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:27,664
and everything.

380
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,730
And then in the middle of the night I
woke up with the itching sensation and I

381
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,860
went to the bathroom and I
couldn't really see what was on,

382
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:40,200
like something was on the back of
my arm and was a tick. So it's the

383
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,150
tick is biting in the Amy,

384
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,890
what is it giving Amy that's
gonna make her allergic meat?

385
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,670
[inaudible] I need to stop you
there, Robert. Difficult one. Robert.

386
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,620
I don't know the answer to that. Um,

387
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,700
that's Peter Smith and well we joining
us is Cheryl Vanden in the scientist a

388
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,940
it's all up for speculation. We don't
really know [inaudible] here's the theory.

389
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,630
So normally when you eat a piece of meat,

390
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:07,020
you put Alpha Gal in your stomach and
your stomach digest it and it's in your

391
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:08,040
body. It is no big deal.

392
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,070
But the tick cunningly will drill into
you poke and you and inject its saliva.

393
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,750
We'll call that tick spit tick spit into
its victims, straight into its victims,

394
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:23,220
largest organ, the skin and ticks.
But it has an anti clotting factor,

395
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,170
anesthetic, anti inflammatory
compounds and we think the AlphaGo.

396
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,880
Now Peter says the thing about the
skin is the skin is like this enormous,

397
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:36,660
it's like surveillance system. It's
always on the lookout for invaders.

398
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:41,400
So when the Alf Gal comes through
your skin covered by all that bad,

399
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,270
they had tick spit stuff that's going to
really like set off your immune system.

400
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,100
The immune system freaks out like oh
[inaudible] and the Alpha Gal covered now

401
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:55,101
in bad spirit almost sort of by mistake
gets labeled bad and now it's on the bad

402
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:59,960
guy. Watch list, so therefore
the next time you eat meat,

403
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,020
the meat comes in and then the body
unleashes wave upon wave upon wave of

404
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:10,601
chemical attacks to do battle against
this AlphaGo and this reaction gets way

405
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:14,180
out of hand. You've got so many
antibodies multiplying and multiplying,

406
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,900
multiplying, making you rather in
this case, Amy feel just [inaudible].

407
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,303
Ah,

408
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,200
right. I mean it's very weird. It
sounds like a science fiction movie.

409
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,230
It sounds like the beginning of a
science fiction at least kids book,

410
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:34,750
let's not go to movie, but
like it's, it's just strange,

411
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,950
which all goes to say that this really
is a kind of double tragedy for Amy and

412
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:44,550
her tech. Yeah. [inaudible] texting
evolve to bite humans, right?

413
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,550
We're a mistake. Like we
have opposable thumbs.

414
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,870
We're either going to pull them off.

415
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,950
I actually woke my mom up and she
helped get it off. Or if they drop off,

416
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,820
they're going to drop off in a airport
terminal or a Walmart carpark or

417
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,810
somewhere like that. Shag carpet
or shag carpet in doors and,

418
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,520
and the doomed and for us,

419
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:07,521
well we lose something that historically
anyway is a big part of who we are.

420
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,490
Yeah. Because we, we have, we,

421
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,550
we adapted in the grand evolutionary
scheme of things to like eat flesh to eat

422
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,250
meat. Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,120
I mean I'm actually sitting
here picturing a steak,

424
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,860
but actually the thing,

425
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,750
I mean hot dogs like wrap
ramps around a weenie and ruts.

426
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,060
Yama sounds so good. My mouth's water.

427
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,890
We need linis and ramps. Yeah.

428
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,280
But I am going my allergist
tomorrow cause I did, you know,

429
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:46,470
I was reading this allergy a lot when
I first got it and I read that for some

430
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,420
people the allergy can fade away.

431
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,280
So I'm going to get a blood test to see
what my blood level of Alpha gala is.

432
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,740
So I'm a little already
hoping for it tomorrow.

433
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,880
I want to be normal again.

434
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,343
Hmm.

435
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,680
That was the end of the Dan
Amy conversation. She was
going to go to the doctor,

436
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,210
get herself tested, find out whatever.

437
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,980
So we asked her back in, okay,
that's fine. You know what happened?

438
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,180
So I actually did get an
appointment with my allergist,

439
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,080
Dr [inaudible] name is Dr Korn.

440
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,610
She's really nice. Um, so I got the plan
when I got the blood draw, whatever.

441
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,760
And a few days later my doctor called me
and she said that my numbers were still

442
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,460
really high and I was like,
well how high are they?

443
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,260
And she was like three and I
was like three, that's not high.

444
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,020
And she's like, they're supposed
to be like one or something.

445
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,490
So they had gone down but
they were still, you know,

446
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,260
many times more than they should be.

447
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:55,740
So when you left and you
were waiting for the call,

448
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,480
where you waiting with the hope that one
that you would soon be eating a bit of

449
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,940
hotdog? I mean honestly I was hoping,
no, no, no, I don't wish it. You are,

450
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,390
you are the big, the great you,

451
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:10,410
you now that I was afraid that
she would be like, oh my God,

452
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,500
your numbers are so low. I think
you could probably eat meat.

453
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,780
Let's do a food challenge.
I'd be like, ah.

454
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,580
Cause like that's such a scary
memory. Yeah. I don't, you know,

455
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:25,581
actually just the other night I was
eating at an Indian place and I was eating

456
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:30,651
vegetarian but like I felt something and
I pulled it out and in the dim light of

457
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,050
an Indian restaurant, like why are
they all let like that? I was like,

458
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,290
was this bacon ice? And
I suddenly, you know,

459
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,930
like you just get this drop
in your stomach. And I'm like,

460
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,610
what time is it four hours from
now if I, you know, cause it's,

461
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,000
there's something about it being delayed
that makes it so difficult at just as

462
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,390
like, like a suspense movie with,

463
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,290
it's like it could happen in the next
three hours or maybe not. I don't know.

464
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,690
I mean honestly, the only thing that,

465
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,560
the real reason I want to be able to eat
meat is so that I will be prepared to

466
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:05,220
eat it in case of emergency.

467
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,610
I mean I went on a canoe trip in
the Adirondacks and I was like,

468
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,780
well what happens if I
get to try it out here?

469
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,570
And like what if I have to hunt
but I can't even eat meat out.

470
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,750
I have to on fish, but then when the
lake freezes over, what would I eat?

471
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,180
I can't survive.
Something's wrong with me.

472
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,090
I feel evolutionary lead challenged.

473
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,790
This is what I think about
before I go to bed every night.

474
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,790
Would I be able to survive if I
had just what's on me right now,

475
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,100
upenn underwear, my dog. And so,
yeah, I mean that's a real issue.

476
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,230
It's like it's not a real issue.

477
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:40,100
Obviously it's never going to
happen and live in Brooklyn, but I,

478
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I do for some reason I always think
like I want to be prepared in case,

479
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,990
but um, yeah, you know,

480
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,080
I don't think I would go back
to eating me necessarily.

481
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,650
Like you are still more,
more frightened than game,

482
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,140
so to speak.

483
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Well also like I wish I
could be a vegetarian for
ethical reasons because it's

484
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,380
not so much just the eating meat,
but just like, you know, the, the,

485
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,180
the factory farming
and that kind of stuff.

486
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:14,260
So I feel like morally superior
now I can be like, well,

487
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:18,520
I don't eat red meat. Of course I'm forced
to not eat it. But at the same time,

488
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,810
I would, if I had the, if
I had the willpower, I'd
probably go that way anyway.

489
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,150
And then also I think it's great.

490
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,910
It's like we're all evolving
to be on this planet,

491
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,970
which is getting harder to be on and we
know that meat takes a lot of resources

492
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:36,490
and like now I don't,
now I'm not doing that.

493
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,970
So like the tic is helping me
evolve into a better human being.

494
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,813
[inaudible]

495
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,690
so one could,

496
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,930
instead of thinking of the tick as
your teeny weeny irritating enemy,

497
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,720
you could think of it as a guiding light,

498
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,040
making the world safer to share
with your fellow earthlings. Yeah.

499
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,420
[inaudible]

500
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,430
so you may have lost your
relationship with meat,

501
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,010
but at least you have
your moral superiority.

502
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,470
Yeah. I mean, hi, I'm superior.

503
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,513
Yeah.

504
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,870
[inaudible]

505
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,190
so huge thanks to Amy Pearl for
telling a story which never stopped,

506
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,570
never stopped being scary and wonderful
and to the fellow who brought her into

507
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:32,750
the room, Dan Pashman, whose
podcast the Sporkful is, it's,

508
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,550
it's all about food in
every conceivable way.

509
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,140
I key talks about eating it, preparing
it, worrying about it. As you've heard,

510
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,480
getting sick from it, getting
fat from it, whatever.
