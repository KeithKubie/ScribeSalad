00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.230
With so many villainous characters in fiction,
it's inevitable that some of their names,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.920
personalities, gimmicks and appearances will
be similar to others - there are only so many

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.130
different ways to be evil, after all.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.430
That being said, you'll probably be surprised
at just how many creators ripped off other

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140
characters and real life people when it came
to conceiving some of these well-known bad

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.140
guys.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.930
Some of the most iconic evil-doers ever to
appear in your favourite stories were actually

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.400
blatantly stolen from other sources - both
real and fictional - and this video is going

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.349
to run you through just a few of them.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.760
Here are ten superhero villains who stole
people's identity.

Stay tuned for the answer at the end of our

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.450
trivia questions and fun facts along the way.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.450
1.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.749
Thanos
Thanos is one of the most powerful villains

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.559
in Marvel Comics and is now the big-bad in
the hugely popular Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.050
However, he was actually based on a prominent
DC villain - and it's not the one you might

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.050
think.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.090
A lot of people believe that Jim Starlin took
influence from Darkseid to create Marvel's

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.650
Mad Titan, but it was actually another member
of the New Gods that influenced his creation

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.840
- none other than Metron.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.780
Thanos' sits in a chair just like Metron does
and, although Starlin did beef him up to be

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.411
more monstrous in his appearance like Darkseid
is, it was indeed the lesser-known DC villain

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:31.280
who initially inspired the writer-cum-artist.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.570
2.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.450
Sinestro
Sinestro is one of DC's most terrifying villains

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.750
- his powers are fuelled by fear, after all
- so it may come as a surprise to you to learn

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.530
that his physical appearance is based on someone
from the real world who was... less than terrifying,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.620
to say the least.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.890
That man was the late David Niven - an English
actor and novelist who passed away in 1983.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.170
Niven was the quintessential British cad,
but he was far from evil and terrifying, yet

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.920
his unmistakable pencil moustache and widow's
peak hairline are clear to see when you look

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.870
at the leader of DC's Sinestro Corps.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.149
Trivia time: True or false - Prior to his
life wielding rings of power in the DC Universe,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.149
Sinestro used to be an arcaeologist.

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.780
Find out the answer at the end of the video.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.780
3.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
Magneto
To look at Magneto, you certainly wouldn't

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.700
immediately think that his creation was inspired
by the men who actually inspired it, but when

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.150
you think about it, it actually makes a lot
of sense.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.540
The men in question were Malcolm X and Martin
Luther King Jr. - both of whom fought for

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.560
civil and human rights, particularly for the
black population - and Magneto does exactly

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.040
that on behalf of his fellow mutants (albeit
in a very different way).

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.569
In the Marvel universe, the likes of William
Stryker and Bolivar Trask represent the oppressive

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.650
forces that Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr. took a stand against, and the parallels

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.519
between the pair and Magneto are clear to
see.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.519
4.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.519
M.O.D.A.A.K.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.989
We now come to the most obscure character
on this list, as he's acually an alternate

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.930
version of the classic Marvel villain M.O.D.O.K.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.770
This version of the character exists in the
pages of Spider-Gwen, which takes place on

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.530
Marvel's Earth-65.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.519
Instead of standing for "Mental Organism Designed
Only for Killing", M.O.D.A.A.K. is an acronym

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.389
for "Mental Organism Designed As America's
King", and he's based on none other than America's

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.260
current president Donald J. Trump.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.239
M.O.D.A.A.K. is a foreigner-hating, tiny-handed
megalomaniac, and you only have to look at

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.810
him to see the obvious inspiration taken from
the orange-faced businessman-cum-politician.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.430
5.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.659
Ultron
Ultron has always been a popular villain,

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.560
but never more so than now, following his
portrayal by James Spader in 2015's Avengers:

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560
Age of Ultron.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.909
It will probably shock you to learn, therefore,
that he's actually copied from a very obscure

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.909
character in an equally obscure (and very
dated) TV show and comic book from many years

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:41.909
ago.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.310
In the late 1940s and early-mid 1950s, Captain
Video and His Video Rangers aired on the DuMont

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.310
Television Network.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.769
This was soon followed by a comic based on
the show, which was published by Fawcett Comics.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.599
Marvel writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema
admitted basing Ultron on the villainous Mechano

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.819
from the franchise - a character so obscure
that there are barely any images of him anywhere.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.900
6.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.650
Bane
Now, this entry is a little different because,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.900
in this case, we're specifically talking about
Tom Hardy's live action version of Bane from

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.260
2012's The Dark Knight Rises movie, as opposed
to the comic book version of the character.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.829
Hardy based Bane's voice, accent and some
of his physical traits on a man named Bartley

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.100
Gorman, who was the self-proclaimed king of
the gypsies, a bare-knuckle boxer, and an

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.100
Irish traveler.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Gorman died of cancer in 2002, but if you
watch any footage of the late fella, you can

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.030
clearly tell where Hardy lifted some of the
Bane persona from.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.790
Trivia time: Bane's father was a villain in
his own right in the DC Universe, but what

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.790
was the character's name?
a) King Snake.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.790
b) Firefly.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.790
c) Count Vertigo.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.790
We'll let you know the answer at the end of
the video.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.790
7.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.790
Darth Vader
Okay, so Darth Vader isn't a villain to any

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.230
characters who typically get labelled as "superheroes"
but, to many, that's exactly what Luke Skywalker

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.230
is.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.060
Moreover, Vader has appeared in comic books,
as well as movies and other media, so we feel

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.449
happy to include him here.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.030
Vader was based on both Marvel's Doctor Doom
and DC's Darkseid.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.170
Like Doom, he is scarred, wears a mask and
armour, and has "D" and "V" as his initials

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.910
and, like Darkseid, he is a warlord - one
who operates on the "dark side" of the Force,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.910
no less.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.430
George Lucas is a huge comic book fan - as
evidenced by his 1986 Howard the Duck movie

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.990
- and has credited both of these iconic villains
as being his inspiration for the iconic Lord

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.990
Vader.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.990
8.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.210
Clayface
Classically, Clayface is the name of the Batman

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.680
villain otherwise known as Basil Karlo (there
have been others, but that's the incarnation

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680
of the character we're talking about here).

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.879
Originally just a scorned actor in a mask,
he went on to obtain a malleable, clay-like

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.060
body that gave him superhuman physical attributes
and enabled him to shape-shift.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.599
Inspiration for the character actually came
from three real-life actors.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.900
He was based on Lon Chaney, who was famously
known as "The Man of a Thousand Faces", while

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.060
his name was a combination of fellow actors
Basil Rathbone's and Boris Karloff's.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.610
9.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.900
Harley Quinn
Harley Quinn is such a quirky and unique individual

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.560
that it's hard to imagine anyone in the real
world being an inspiration for her creation,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.509
but someone actually was!

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.200
The person in question is actress Arleen Sorkin
- and she even went on to voice the character

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.630
in the DC animated universe!

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.580
Sorkin is a friend of Paul Dini - one of Harley's
creators along with Bruce Timm - and both

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.689
her personality and name went partially towards
creating the iconic character.

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.729
"Partially" is the key word there, because
you have to assume that Sorkin isn't quite

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.330
as crazy as the Joker's certifiably insane
girlfriend!

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.360
Trivia time: Complete this Harley Quinn quote
from 2016's Suicide Squad movie - "Love your

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360
perfume!

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360
What is that?

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360
The stench of ?what?"

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.330
We'll reveal all at the end of the video.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.330
10.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.870
The Joker
We finish with a twofold entry now, as this

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.310
entry specifies the influence behind both
the comic book version of the Joker, and the

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.139
most iconic live action movie version of the
Joker.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.610
The story goes that a 17-year-old named Jerry
Robinson showed DC Comics' writer Bill Finger

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.509
a Joker playing card he'd drawn up from memory.

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.849
Finger then suggested they supplement this
"sinister clown" with the creepy permanent

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.819
grin featured in a silent movie called The
Man Who Laughs - a movie in which Conrad Veidt

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.629
played a man whose face has been disfigured
so it looks like he's grinning from ear-to-ear.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.530
The resemblence to the Joker is undoubtedly
uncanny, so he's not as original as some people

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.530
might think.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.789
Finally, we come to Heath Ledger's version
of the character from 2008's The Dark Knight.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.430
The Oscar-winning portrayal took influence
from a number of sources.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.020
Ledger's voice and mannerisms were mainly
inspired by musician and actor Tom Waites,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.629
but Ledger also took influence from musician
Sid Vicious and actor Malcolm McDowell's portrayal

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:18.490
of Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.490
And the answers to the trivia questions were:
False.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.490
Sinestro was an anthropologist, not an archaeologist.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.490
Bane's father was the villain known as King
Snake.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.490
And the missing word from the Harley Quinn
quote was "death".

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.490
Thanks for watching our video about ten superhero
villains who stole people's identity without

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.490
asking.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.490
Can you think of any other villains whose
identities were stolen from elsewhere?
