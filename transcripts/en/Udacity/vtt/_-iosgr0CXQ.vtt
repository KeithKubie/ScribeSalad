00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you did this right, it should be the case that all of these edge boxes are checked off,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you ended up with an actor.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now--this is the magic trick part--I'm going to tell you which actor you ended up with.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The answer is Kevin Bacon. Ta da! Pretty neat, huh? Let's try it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to follow maybe a different path than you did, but I'm going to do my best to try it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Just to try to thwart this, maybe I'll do directly to Kevin Bacon.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll visit this edge. Now I'm at Kevin Bacon.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I go to Dustin Hoffman.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I go to Susan Saradon. I go to Julia Roberts.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I can't go do Kevin Bacon now, because I'll be at a dead end.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I visited all the other edges that have gone through Kevin Bacon,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so I'll go to Dustin Hoffam to Robert Deniro to Meryle Streep again

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to Ann Hathaway back to Julia Roberts, and now I can go to Kevin Bacon and be done.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It may or may not have been the same path that you followed,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but I did end up at Kevin Bacon.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can try this a couple different ways, and you'll see that you'll always end up with Kevin Bacon.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So that's our magic trick.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This example illustrates two things that are central to this course.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The first is the idea of a social network.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We often think of social networks as being particular websites that exist these days,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but really what a social network is is connections between individuals

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that capture relationships between them.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These days, of course, they ubiquity and scope of social network data is exploding.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Clever computer software is needed to reveal interesting patterns

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and answer important questions about this data.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's a really neat area.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The second focus of this course is on the magic of algorithms.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Algorithms are just how we organize computations to solve a particular problem.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Some algorithms are really straightforward,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but other algorithms take advantage of subtle mathematical properties

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to quickly and accurately provide an answer.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Those are the ones that feel like magic.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
With that said, now I'm going to try to tell you how this trick actually worked

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and what it tells us about these kinds of structures.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let me first point out that this kind of structure where you've got a set of circles and lines

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
connecting between them is what we in computer science and discrete math call graph.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In this particular graph, the actors are playing the role of nodes, sometimes called vertices.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the movies are playing the role of edges or links.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll probably mostly say "nodes" and "edges,"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which kind of mixes a metaphor, but that's how I'm used to saying it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We can also talk about the degree of a node in a network.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
For example, this Dustin Hoffman node here is a node in the network.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's got degree 4 because there are 4 edges coming out of it--1, 2, 3, 4.
