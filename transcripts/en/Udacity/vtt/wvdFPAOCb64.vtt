00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is my implementation. It's really simple.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I execute the following loop 100 times.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I set the crosstrack error to my robot y.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The steering angle becomes minus my control parameter times the crosstrack error.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I call the move command with a steering angle and the given speed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I print as an output my robot along with the steering direction.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This simple routine just does it.
