00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.890
I'm going to multiply 78
times 65 in a little less

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.340
than standard way, but
hopefully it'll make some sense,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.180
and you'll realize that
there's multiple ways

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.370
that you can multiply.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.536
And this is actually the
way that I multiply numbers

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:12.160
in my head.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.577
So 78 times 65.

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:15.160
And then we're
actually going to think

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.076
about what the different
parts of this process

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:19.320
represent on this area model.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.600
So 78 times 65.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.892
So I'm going to start
just the way we normally

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.850
start when we multiply.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.360
I'm going to start with
this 5 in this ones place,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.850
and I'm going to
say 5 times 8 is 40.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060
And instead of just
writing a 0 and carrying

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.090
a 4 right over here, I'm just
going to write the number 40.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.630
So this was the 5 times the 8.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.100
Now, I'm going to multiply
the 5 times the 7.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.420
And we have to be a
little bit careful here

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.970
because 5 times-- this isn't
just any 7, this is a 70.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.910
So what is 5 times 70?

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.460
Well, 5 times 7 would be
35, so five times 70 is 350.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.440
So I'll write that down, 350.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.080
So just as a review, 5 times
8 is 40, 5 times 7 is 350.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.040
If you add these two together,
this is going to be 5 times 78.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.180
Now let's go over to the 6.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.370
So let's multiply
the 6 times the 8.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.970
Now we have to be careful again.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.640
This 6 is not just a regular
6, it's in the tens place.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.190
This is a 60.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.070
60 times 8.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.110
Well, 6 times 8 is 48, so 60
times 8 is going to be 480.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.920
So it's going to be 480.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.220
And then 6 times 7.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520
Well, that would be 42,
but we have to be careful.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.390
This is 60 times
70, so we're going

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.040
to have two zeroes at the end.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.060
This is 4,200, not just 42.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.320
So 6 times 7 is 4,200.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.340
And now we can add
everything together.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830
And this is a very
similar process

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.910
to what we do when we do
the traditional method

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.772
of multiplying.

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.480
I just made it a little
bit more explicit

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.240
what parts are from
multiplying which digits.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.080
But we can add
everything together.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.449
In the ones place, we have a 0.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.324
In the tens place, we
have 4 plus 5 is 9.

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:17.450
9 plus 8 is 17.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.340
And now we can carry a 1.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.400
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.382
4 plus 4 is 8.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.590
8 plus 2 is 10.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.440
Carry a 1, regroup
of 1 even, and then

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.710
you have a 5 right over there.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.735
So you get 5,070.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.280
Now, I want to
think about-- I want

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.440
to visualize what was going
on here using this area model.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.570
So once again, we had 78.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.310
So I'm going to make this
vertical length represent 78.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.160
So this distance right over
here represents the 70.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.220
That's the 70, and then we'll
make this distance right over

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.409
here represent the 8.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.950
Let me make that a
little bit cleaner

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.390
so you see what
I'm talking about.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.482
So this distance right
over here represents the 8

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.440
and then we're going to
multiply that times 65.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.640
So this distance
right over here--

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.170
it's not drawn
perfectly to scale,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.000
but it gives the
idea-- this is 60.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.100
And then this distance
right over here is the 5.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.150
So this whole distance is 65.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.380
This entire distance is 78.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.470
So when you multiply-- if
you had a rectangle that's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.210
65 units wide and
you multiplied it,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.520
and it had a height of
78 units, then its area

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.110
is going to be 78 times 65.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.480
It's area is going to be 5,070.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.480
Now, each of these
parts we can map

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.010
to one part of this area
model right over here.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.020
When we multiplied
the 5 times the 8

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.050
and got the 40, that was
this section right over here,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.130
5 times 8 is equal to 40.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.204
When we multiplied 5
times 70, and got 350,

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.370
that's this right over here.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.560
5 times 70, and we got 350.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.680
When we multiplied 60-- the 6
in the tens place-- 60 times 8

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.830
and got 480-- that's
this right over here--

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.680
this is 60 times
8 is equal to 480.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
And then finally when we
multiplied 60 times 70

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.040
and got 4,200-- that's
this area right over here--

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.900
this area is 60 wide, 70 tall.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.390
So this is 60 times 70,
which is equal to 4,200.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.074
And then when we added
everything up to get 5,070,

00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:37.490
we were essentially
just adding up

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.030
the areas of each
of these tiles.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.130
This big one is 4,200, that
makes up most of the area,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.280
and we get 480 from this
magenta one, then 350

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.890
from this greenish-yellow
one, and then

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.140
40 from this greenish-blue
one to get 5,070.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.280
So the area of this entire
thing is 5,070 square units.
