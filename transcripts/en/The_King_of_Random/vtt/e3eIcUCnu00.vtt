00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey, what's up guys! I'm back today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.660
with this mystery box,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.600
and a little bit of a disturbing

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.840
experiment today.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.220
This experiment comes from the comment request from Valentin Gjorgjiovski who asks,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:16.920
"I've heard a pig heart is really similar to humans so I think it would be cool if you cast one in chocolate! It could be a video close to valentines day! Instead of regular chocolates, you do an actual heart...."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.160
That is very disturbing Valentin, but I'm slightly intregued,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.240
so today we're doing this video for you.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.580
So I jumped on the internet and found a company that actually does sell pig hearts and they shipped me this box here

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.400
that's 5 pounds and contains two of them, I've

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.750
been keeping them in the fridge and you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.099
and I are seeing this for the first time

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.020
together.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.719
Oh my goodness... Holy heck, I had no idea

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.280
they were gonna be that big! I was

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.649
thinking like a human heart...? I don't know.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.820
How big that is like the size of your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.100
hand? But that is that's a good fistful.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.289
I mean that's giant. Now when i ordered

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.059
these things it said that they were preserved

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.920
hearts so I imagine this is formaldehyde. We

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.480
got down here that's nasty stuff so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.980
we're gonna rinse these off, clean them

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.230
up as much as we can before we cast in the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
silicon. Happy valentines day my heart

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.260
i'm not exactly sure how that compares

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.270
to a human heart I mean our hearts

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.610
really this big I have no idea i can't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.200
really see how that would fit inside but

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.360
this is fascinating

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.130
I've never actually held a heart in my

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.590
hand before was always been intriguing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.060
to me about hearts as they don't

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.409
actually look like the heart-shaped

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.630
Valentine's suppose if you got really

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.100
creative and use your imagination you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.780
could be a heart shape right here but

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.610
parts that we use for Valentine's Day

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.950
look nothing like this if everything

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.420
goes to plan today I think we're going

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.820
to have the world's first real chocolate

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.710
hard-heart dab he might be wondering

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.210
what this feels like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.829
and as I press into it's actually

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.530
amazingly firm is quite hard part of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.670
that is probably because it's been

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.350
sitting in the fridge for a couple weeks

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.540
that's probably because pressure but

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.950
yeah it's very very firm it's almost

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.479
like it's almost like pushing into

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.060
somebody's flex muscles very very very

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.399
thick a little bit rubbery that's a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.350
little disturbing kind of backed off

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010
yes the side looks a little bit nicer

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.730
that smells like biology class

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.710
yeah now both of these hearts with a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.790
little bit different but I'm kind of

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.200
favoring this one here is a little more

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000
elongated has more of the heart shape

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.140
and i think it just looks a little bit

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.809
better

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.880
if a guy's our heart is secured in the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.400
box i use 13 screw from the backside to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.320
hold hard place and that's what went

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.030
before the silicon the heart won't float

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.950
up that should hold it securely down the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.480
bottom and just for good measure let's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.130
but one strand of duct tape along the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.660
gaps and cracks of this box to the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.420
silicone doesn't leak out caution heart

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.760
surgery in progress

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.490
you did so all we have to do now is mix

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.870
up some silicone pick in the vacuum

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.310
chamber and then pour it into a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.230
container for this confirm up and give

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.000
us our heart shape mold and this time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.440
we're going to use a blue catalyst to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.360
give us a blue silicone mold that we

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.140
haven't tried doing that before

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.060
here we go guys are silicon is

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.710
completely the gas we have to do now is

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.420
let the air back in and we can transfer

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.280
to our more

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.130
that's wild now it's not super critical

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.540
that we pour this perfectly but i am

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.770
going to do it using the proper

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.910
techniques we learned in previous videos

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.490
and get for it in a little drizzle this

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.340
corner here so our first batch is poured

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.870
and it's looking nice and bubble three

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.100
but only covers the heart about

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.750
one-third of the way we're going to make

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.670
two more batches the exact same way so

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.200
we can top this thing up and cover it

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.340
completely

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.430
oh wow there's like Silicon coming

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.910
through whatever that thing is ok we

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.620
just finished our last batch of silicon

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.310
and we only have maybe a quarter inch

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.990
left we need to go up on the small so i

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.880
think we're going to get this thing done

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.860
you can see it's a little bit different

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.000
color and that's because he is clearly

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.400
more catalysts in this one I didn't

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.990
measure it out properly like I should

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.150
have done but whatever i think it's

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.530
going to get the job done so you should

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.220
be good

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.840
alright so update guys we got this thing

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.669
filled almost to the top of silicon I

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.140
thought we might have used too much but

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.880
it turned out to be perfect so we

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.040
currently have a giant pig heart sitting

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.020
in this mixture of silicon is going to

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.340
need a few hours to set up so we're

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.140
going to cut here in the next video I

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.610
will cut this open filled up with

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.870
chocolate and we're going to do a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.970
chocolate heart reveal what's it going

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.440
to look like what's going to smell like

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.600
the smell of the heart of diffuse into

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.160
the chocolate itself isn't even going to

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.820
be edible

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.290
I have no idea but we're gonna find out

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.000
in the next video so until then big

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.740
thanks to andrew Jensen for suggesting

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.479
this experiment it's a little bit creepy

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.310
from doing it for you and for the rest

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.450
of you thanks for joining me for this

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.830
video and i'll be looking for the next

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.220
one

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.979
talk to you then you always do we get

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.270
the heart back out it's freezing in

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.720
liquid nitrogen
