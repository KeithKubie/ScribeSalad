CHRIS ANDERSON: What you
want is authenticity.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.448
You want people who
care about something.

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:24.946
And even if half stammer
their way through a talk,

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:27.360
if you're learning
something, that is fantastic.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.810
JASON WU: There is
something that's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.342
so beautiful about
natural material.

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:36.770
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I decided
to sort of dig deep and make

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.085
the book very much based on all
the latest science about sleep.

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:42.752
WILL SMITH: Dave would
say, dude, come here-- cut,

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.400
cut-- and just cut her hair off.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.874
I was like (SCREAMING).

00:00:47.874 --> 00:00:49.540
CEDRIC VILLANI: In
most other countries,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.590
it doesn't work this way.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.030
And you need to train
mathematicians from young age.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.590
KARI BYRON: Every
TV show you look at,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.486
you see actual women represented
in smart scientific fields.

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:04.319
DANA SHULTZ: Then a
little red pepper flake,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.675
which I usually prefer.

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:12.070
JOSEPH ELLWANGER: The movement
for justice is never complete.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.520
It's never ended.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.950
RYAN REYNOLDS: So I'm thrilled
to talk about "Deadpool"

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.387
because I never thought
"Deadpool" would exist.

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:20.845
It's been an 11-year thing,
and it's the worst relationship

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:22.108
I've ever been in.

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:24.980
But we're happily married now.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.822
And we're expecting.

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:29.240
ELLEN DEGENERES: Because I
think if anyone knows my story,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.550
it is I had to
just keep swimming.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.840
My life has been a
lot of challenges

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.660
and a lot of different
curves and roadblocks.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.960
LUPITA NYONG'O: What was
instilled in me was this idea

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.860
that you do your best
exactly where you are.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.900
Like you challenge yourself.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.985
You compete with yourself before
you compete with anybody else.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.360
SPEAKER 12: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.070
please join me in giving
Andrea Bocelli a warm welcome

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.160
to Google.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.615
[SINGING]

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:13.495
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:36.590
MANA: And one of my
daughters asked me, hey,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.140
when was it built and all this.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.774
And I told her, go to our
friend Google and search it.

00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:42.190
PEDRO DUQUE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.048
TAKAKO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.150
MICHAEL GREGER: Let
me share with you

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.485
what's been called the best
kept secret in medicine.

00:02:58.485 --> 00:02:59.860
DAVA NEWMAN: Be
sure we know what

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.300
technology do you
think we really

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.320
needed to work on for Station.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.540
JOHN CHO: I just want
to note that I'm pretty

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.180
sure Sulu's taking a selfie.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.910
SPEAKER 19: Would you make
a Googler's dream come true

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.872
and take a picture with
me crimping DJ's hair?

00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:16.330
CANDACE CAMERON-BURE:
Yes, totally.

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:35.080
NILE RODGERS: Hey, I'm
Nile Rodgers and thanks

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.080
