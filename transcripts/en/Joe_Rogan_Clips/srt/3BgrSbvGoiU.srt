1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,000
Come up to you. I had this
guy on yesterday, this guy
who wrote this book, uh,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,650
El Narcos name is Yuan Grillo and he's a,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,310
he's an investigative journalist who
lives in Mexico and he studies the cartel,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,890
they show organs. And this is one of
the things he was saying was that they,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,080
they get these people used to killing
and they were getting in these kids and

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,770
then having these kids kill at a young
age and dismember people and they were

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,980
doing it to get fear out of their body.
So this one guy who was,

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,370
they had a nickname for him,
Tyson. He would, he was a cop,

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,140
but he was also in charge of hiring these
little kids and training these little

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,960
kids to be assassins. And he would
teach them how to dismember people.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,990
And he was going into it
and all the things they did
and all the beheadings that

12
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,620
they did.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,620
And he was saying that they'd try to
that in certain certain groups of people

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:51,050
when they have this organization, they
try to get them used to horrific acts.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Well, it's called the, she meant a blood
and that's a Heinrich Himmler term.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,180
Uh, head of the ash ash ish that the
ash ash, she'll, Hitler had about seven,

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,950
eight years.
We launched a war show.

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:06,951
He got like 12 year olds ready for war
and they would get them like having fun

19
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,220
and swimming and working out at boxing
and then they would like on there like 15

20
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,480
give super hot hooker and then give
them drugs, LSD to get discovered.

21
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,240
Switzerland. Hitler was to put
them all on DMT, everything.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,320
And they will then have these religious
experiences and say you're invincible,

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,510
you're superman.
This has all been declassified.

24
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:29,160
But it should more esoteric writings
and so they would get, I'm all wound up.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,660
And then to graduate as an SS officer.
After you'd had a dog like five years,

26
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:37,410
you had to strangle your German shepherd.
Yeah, that was a, my friend Ari.

27
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,850
His Dad was in the Israeli special
forces or one of those one brands.

28
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,990
Would you remember what branch was?

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,470
One branch of the Israeli military
and they had to kill a kitten.

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,490
They had a run and like, like, look,
Jews are just like anybody else.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
There's good people, there's
bad people. But yeah,

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,770
Israel because they got so screwed by the
Nazis and a lot of sickening ways just

33
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,410
kind of copied a lot of it. And by the
way, the policies are trying to kill them,

34
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,244
blow them up.
I'm not even,

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,330
my point is just that the Nazis got
evil down so much that like we brought

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,530
34,000 in the run, NASA, the run,
the university's operation paperclip,

37
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,080
everybody wanted Nazis.
They were learning.

38
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:12,030
They were like winning the lottery
because they were all robots and we do

39
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,970
whatever they were told. Well
one of Bron was absolutely, yeah,

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,650
just head honors and he was
a Nazi show show, show it.

41
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:22,460
What happened was first they gave him
a shacks. They gave him power. They,

42
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,670
they would really press room.
You had to go through things and then,

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,610
uh,
they would basically,

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,070
you'll just condition them to
do whatever they were told.

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,250
And they call it the cement
of blood because then, uh,

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,000
it's just like satanic cults say,
you know, kill your dog. I mean,

47
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,530
I remember when I was growing
up in Rockwall, Texas,

48
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,090
I ran into like a state
and call. I was like, God,

49
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,710
this girl's a senior in high school.
She's super hot. I'm an, I'm an, I'm in a,

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm in ninth grade and like she's picking
me up in her Mercedes and I'm taking

51
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,010
me some mansion and the
sexual there is incredible.

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,460
And I'm walking out of the house cause
I looked like I was about 16 when I was

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,300
13 and the dad goes, he likes screwing
my daughter. Yeah, I screw or two. Whoa.

54
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,670
I just, as soon as you
join us, love Lucifer,

55
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,080
you get all of them will tell you
want boy, cause we want you. But,

56
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,760
but oh yeah,
but that's yeah.

57
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,070
Then I have an incredible life
look also do now you're looking at,

58
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,830
but the point is, is that Yo Kelly,
you're in La, you know about all this,

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,710
but the point is,
is still battle that the point is,

60
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,160
is that then the satanist is that
ever really gotten to say this?

61
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,620
And they said well, they said, well what
do you want? Cause I don't want to be,

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,710
we want you to kill your dog.
Whoa.

63
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,490
And so the point is is that now all these
years later kill a loving thing that

64
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,950
serves you, cares about
you. This interface.

65
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,480
Dogs are very psychic or psyche buffers.

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,590
Dogs are able to like interface with
you and they want you to take something

67
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,560
that's way to die for you and
they want you to kill that.

68
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,650
That's like killing a child. A dog is
very similar to child, very spiritual,

69
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:49,240
very holy. You a very good dog will take
on its masters aura. It can be evil.

70
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,460
But John just totally spilling my guts.

71
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,120
Church people need to know about all
those and this is what's going on and this

72
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,830
is what's happening and show.

73
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:00,760
So they want the submit a blood is they
get people in a group and they get them

74
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,100
to do horrible evil things
during peer pressure.

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,720
And then they create the synthesis.

76
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,350
You have to know the darker elements of
the criminal networks that are inside

77
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:13,240
our government are actually running Mexico
as a laboratory test cause they know

78
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,780
native Americans are taking,
Americans aren't Gung Ho.

79
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,000
And they're tough and they're
ready to hide. Not, you know,

80
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,240
I'm part native American long,
like 6% Comanche and you know, uh,

81
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,990
Texas and just that
little bit makes me wild.

82
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,240
And so they can get them cause they're
powerful. They're smart, they're neat,

83
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:35,740
they're cool. But genetically
they go into group think really,

84
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,670
really fast. And so native Americans,
you can mind control really fast.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,250
Hmm. Why is that? Well,
it's like Vietnam. I mean,

86
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,780
you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,

87
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,790
the Bering land straight
and basically the test,

88
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:53,670
the genetics of a Mezzo Mesoamerican
is basically Chinese or hunt.

89
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,920
Cause there was always some whites and
vikings even 10,000 years ago in the area.

90
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,540
Uh, but, uh,

91
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,160
like nobody in fights like
in Korea find the Chinese,

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,960
that's who we're really fighting. There
are Vietnam, these fricking, I mean,

93
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,730
they're like, they're, they're,
they're conscious and real people,

94
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,320
but when they get into a fight,

95
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,090
they all sync up and our
robots and have no fear of,

96
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,610
you're not about psychotic killers,
you're fighting.

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,330
And so Asians or by about
the most fearless killers
there are like the Mongols,

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,600
any of them. I mean, once Asians go
to war, it's like they do not there.

99
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,790
It's in fact they're not even
crazy going wild in a battle.

100
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,210
They're like robots coming to kill you.
And so do you think that's from,

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,030
do you think that's from the heritage
of war? That they have a long list?

102
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,680
Like if you think about Japan,

103
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:40,681
Japan has a long history of being a noble
warrior culture with the Samurais and

104
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,010
well it's called the Marshall from the
nobility. It's the genetics, right?

105
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,480
But are the genetics is what creates that?
Yo,

106
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,360
it's like 500 of you load and planes.

107
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,140
[inaudible] what I'm saying is think
about a place like Japan were so much

108
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,170
martial arts came from Kendo
sword fighting a karate
above a bunch of different

109
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,620
branches of crowded judo, Jujitsu, Japan,

110
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,880
all that stuff came from
Japan. I mean that, that,

111
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,960
that is a group of people that were
obsessed with combat. I mean they,

112
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,160
they figured out a long class wash.
Well,

113
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,520
not just that the soldiers and
even the civilian. No, I agree.

114
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:21,170
But the ruling class was Samurai. Yeah.
Shoguns the ruling class was a shoguns.

115
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:21,410
Right.

116
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,410
And when you think about what a small
place Japan is and how stunning it is that

117
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,140
so much innovation, especially in terms
of like, what am I gonna work martial,

118
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,870
don't get a bell curve because you've
got black people that are smart as any

119
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,780
white person. And then he got black
people that are way better at sports,

120
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,720
whatever, that there are
genetic differences. We're not.

121
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,030
Then you've got the head of your former,
you know it was cold springs harbor.

122
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,610
Watson comes out and says blacks
aren't human, all that Bs.

123
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,050
That's just the racist crap. It's in the
government. But it's true that northern,

124
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
some groups are northern Europeans and
then the Japanese on average per capita

125
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,750
of the arch Iq. And so
they're, they're Japanese.

126
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,820
And then there are some northern
Europeans that have the highest Iq,

127
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,950
but then you can get into like say Jews
have very high accused. On average,

128
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,440
he and Jews have an extraordinary
high level social trials winners.

129
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,370
It's a bunch of, so there's not just one
type of intelligence. Yeah. Oh, for sure.

130
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:16,330
Yeah. Well, there's, there's, I mean,

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,310
there's tests that you can
run in terms of mathematics,

132
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,100
but there's no real tests you can
run in terms of social intelligence,

133
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,850
psychic connectivity,

134
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:27,710
and they've proven the DNA is a
transceiver and show my skill is,

135
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:31,280
that's why I'm usually kind of like almost
autistic is I'm just being constantly

136
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,280
like, everything's going on,
but then it actually focused in,

137
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,160
I can like figure out the
exact enemy operation.

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,630
That's why they were really pissed.
