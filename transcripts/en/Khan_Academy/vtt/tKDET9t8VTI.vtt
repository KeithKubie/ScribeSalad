00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:05.122
- ALS or Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis is an extremely

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:08.292
debilitating and usually fatal disease

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:09.521
and it's a horrible disease.

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:12.630
You have your motor neurons,
the neurons that are

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.796
essentially activating your
muscles, telling your muscles

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:19.701
when to twitch or when to
contract and that these neurons,

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:23.519
these cells that traverse,
that go from your brain

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.566
all the way to your muscles,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.060
so there's these unusually long cells.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.313
They go through your spinal
cord, they degenerate.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.681
They degenerate and as they degenerate,

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:36.166
there's no way for your
brain to send the signals

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.397
to your muscles to do the
things that your muscles

00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:42.156
need to do and so your muscles atrophy

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:45.129
and so that's actually
where the first part of ALS

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.539
comes from, the "A" in ALS, Amyotrophic.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.238
"A" means no or not or
kind of the opposite.

00:00:52.238 --> 00:00:54.986
"Myo" means, is referring to muscle

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:57.265
and 'trophic" is nourishment,
so this is one way to

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.151
think about it is "no muscle nourishment",

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.243
but what's really happening
is that the muscles

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:03.813
start to die away because
they're no longer to be--

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.972
They can no longer be activated
because, I guess you could

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:10.966
say, the wires or motor
neurons that would normally

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.042
activate them, they degenerate
and what's especially

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:17.977
horrible about this is,
obviously, it causes paralysis,

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.661
people lose control over
basic things including their

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.180
speech, is the whole time that
this is happening and this is

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.132
degenerating, the individual
in question has full mental

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.104
awareness, so they're fully
aware of what's going on in

00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:38.104
their body so you could imagine
it's a fairly horrible thing

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.478
for people to go through and
there have been many famous

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:47.478
cases of people with ALS, most
famously probably Lou Gehrig.

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:50.678
In fact, ALS in the U.S.,
at least, is often called

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:53.598
Lou Gehrig's disease, one
of the most famous baseball

00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:58.213
players of all time for
the New York Yankees.

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:02.545
He died of ALS, really,
when he was about my age

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:04.523
in his late 30s.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.968
Stephen Hawking, he is one of
the small percentage of ALS

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:11.684
sufferers who have been
able to live several decades

00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:13.837
past his diagnosis.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.019
It effects one to two out of
100,000 individuals each year.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.357
So if you were to imagine kind
of a large stadium of people,

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:27.410
in a given year you would expect to--

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.365
If you say there's roughly
100,000 people here,

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:32.132
you would expect one to two of them to

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:34.909
get afflicted with ALS.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.636
The reason why it's important
to have research behind this

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:41.302
is it's a very, a very not
so well understood disease.

00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:42.533
People know what happens.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:45.334
They know that the motor
neurons degenerate,

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:47.823
but they don't know why it's happening.

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:48.838
There is--

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:53.623
Scientists have identified some
genetic component to ALS for

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:56.759
some of the sufferers, but
for the majority, they can't

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.551
identify a genetic component
and it's unclear what

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:01.498
environmental components are causing it,

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:03.599
although people think there
must be some environmental

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.508
components, but as far as
most people can tell it just

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:11.703
randomly afflicts people once
they kind of get into their

00:03:11.703 --> 00:03:15.046
early middle age, so it's a
really, really horrible disease

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:18.350
and it's really important that
people have awareness for it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.370
and that there is an
appropriate level of funding

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.793
and in case you're wondering,

00:03:23.793 --> 00:03:26.653
yes, I did take the ice
bucket challenge as well.

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.534
I have been challenged by
Shawn O'Sullivan to do the

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.775
ice bucket challenge,
so I'm about to do it.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.696
Y'all ready?

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:36.191
- Girl: Yeah
- Boy: Yeah

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.901
- [Voiceover] : (giggling)

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:40.670
- Ah.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.464
- [Voiceover] : (laughing)

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:49.109
- I'd now like to issue the
challenge to three other people.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.368
The other Salman Khan,
famous Bollywood actor.

00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:56.744
Esther Cho, who works
with me at Khan Academy

00:03:56.744 --> 00:04:00.673
and my kids, who seemed
too happy to see myself

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.021
get doused with cold water.
