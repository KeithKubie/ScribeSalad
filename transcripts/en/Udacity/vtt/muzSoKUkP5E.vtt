00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.920
So notice back in our diagram that the object that has the dot loc property,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.990
each of these car objects in our program has not

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.430
been generated from whole cloth anymore.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.710
We passed it through a decorator function.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.860
And when it came back out,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.830
it was given the dot loc property, pointing to whatever value it has.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.120
Decorators can add more than just simple properties like this number.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.410
Remember, functions are properties too.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.870
Maybe we'd prefer to call the Move Function using method calling syntax,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.780
which means we would look it up as a property of Amy before invoking it on Amy.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.160
If we want to do this, we're going to have to re-factor our code again.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.650
So take a moment to re-factor this code in a way that would enable us to

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.730
use this method calling syntax with dot access
