numbers I don't think you do you notice
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270
numbers I don't think you do you notice
about it it's even it is even yeah do

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
about it it's even it is even yeah do
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740
about it it's even it is even yeah do
you think it's so obviously not prime

you think it's so obviously not prime
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900
you think it's so obviously not prime
then do you think which numbers in the 9

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
then do you think which numbers in the 9
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990
then do you think which numbers in the 9
times table probably not don't feel like

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
times table probably not don't feel like
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.350
times table probably not don't feel like
it is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
it is
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729
it is
yeah I've been one in nine numbers is in

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
yeah I've been one in nine numbers is in
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069
yeah I've been one in nine numbers is in
the 9 times table right so it's you

what is going on Brady what is going on
well these little tricks and well

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
well these little tricks and well
 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.440
well these little tricks and well
they're kind of inspired by actually my

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
they're kind of inspired by actually my
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.470
they're kind of inspired by actually my
own incompetence and because in our last

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
own incompetence and because in our last
 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.659
own incompetence and because in our last
video that you and I did together which

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669
video that you and I did together which
 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.309
video that you and I did together which
was about Bell figures prime if you

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319
was about Bell figures prime if you
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.589
was about Bell figures prime if you
remember we asked the following question

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599
remember we asked the following question
 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.220
remember we asked the following question
we asked is this number we had a 1 and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
we asked is this number we had a 1 and
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.729
we asked is this number we had a 1 and
then lots of zeros and then has 6 1 6

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
then lots of zeros and then has 6 1 6
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.000
then lots of zeros and then has 6 1 6
and then another bunch of zeros and then

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
and then another bunch of zeros and then
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.330
and then another bunch of zeros and then
a 1 we asked if this number was a prime

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
a 1 we asked if this number was a prime
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.069
a 1 we asked if this number was a prime
number or not we said it you know if we

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079
number or not we said it you know if we
 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.990
number or not we said it you know if we
put in enough zeros can we can we find a

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
put in enough zeros can we can we find a
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.740
put in enough zeros can we can we find a
prime number

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
prime number
 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.080
prime number
and I ran a little computer code and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
and I ran a little computer code and
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.400
and I ran a little computer code and
caught up to a hundred thousand zeros

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
caught up to a hundred thousand zeros
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.750
caught up to a hundred thousand zeros
and didn't find any attend if you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
and didn't find any attend if you
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.190
and didn't find any attend if you
remember this and I saved up to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200
remember this and I saved up to
 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.400
remember this and I saved up to
anything's 100,000 and the new programs

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410
anything's 100,000 and the new programs
 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.349
anything's 100,000 and the new programs
and of course our super smart

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359
and of course our super smart
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.619
and of course our super smart
numberphile viewers immediately saw that

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629
numberphile viewers immediately saw that
 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.909
numberphile viewers immediately saw that
this was never going to be a prime

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919
this was never going to be a prime
 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.789
this was never going to be a prime
number and the reason was well if you

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
number and the reason was well if you
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.310
number and the reason was well if you
calculate the sum of all the digits okay

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
calculate the sum of all the digits okay
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.529
calculate the sum of all the digits okay
so the cross song of this object then

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539
so the cross song of this object then
 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.330
so the cross song of this object then
you'll get 1 plus lots of zeros 4 6 plus

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
you'll get 1 plus lots of zeros 4 6 plus
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.730
you'll get 1 plus lots of zeros 4 6 plus
1 plus 6

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740
1 plus 6
 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.580
1 plus 6
bunch of zeros again plus one and that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590
bunch of zeros again plus one and that
 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.629
bunch of zeros again plus one and that
totals 15 now 15 is divisible by 3 and

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639
totals 15 now 15 is divisible by 3 and
 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.159
totals 15 now 15 is divisible by 3 and
if that number if the cross sum is

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
if that number if the cross sum is
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.110
if that number if the cross sum is
divisible by 3 then it guarantees that

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120
divisible by 3 then it guarantees that
 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.200
divisible by 3 then it guarantees that
the original number is divisible by 3 so

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210
the original number is divisible by 3 so
 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.180
the original number is divisible by 3 so
you were you were running this code

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190

the number L yeah right okay you took
 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.950
the number L yeah right okay you took
the first four numbers whatever no

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
the first four numbers whatever no
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.140
the first four numbers whatever no
combination you take these in I mean

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
combination you take these in I mean
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.779
combination you take these in I mean
these numbers 1 2 3 &amp; 4 they add up to

these numbers 1 2 3 &amp; 4 they add up to
 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.800
these numbers 1 2 3 &amp; 4 they add up to
10 so whatever order I put them in the

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810
10 so whatever order I put them in the
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.589
10 so whatever order I put them in the
cross Sun is always going to be 10 but

cross Sun is always going to be 10 but
 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.560
cross Sun is always going to be 10 but
10 is not divisible by 3 so whatever

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570
10 is not divisible by 3 so whatever
 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.899
10 is not divisible by 3 so whatever

there are all this other rules that you

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409
there are all this other rules that you
 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.659
there are all this other rules that you
can apply to other numbers and we'll get

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669
can apply to other numbers and we'll get
 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.760
can apply to other numbers and we'll get
into that but for this this cross sum

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770
into that but for this this cross sum
 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.649
into that but for this this cross sum
rule it works for threes and nines let's

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659
rule it works for threes and nines let's
 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:32.330
rule it works for threes and nines let's
see if then okay let's see the proof

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340
see if then okay let's see the proof
 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.040
see if then okay let's see the proof
let's write down the kind of number that

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050
let's write down the kind of number that
 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.149
let's write down the kind of number that
we might be interested in let's just

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159
we might be interested in let's just
 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.730
we might be interested in let's just
write it down as follows so the number n

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
write it down as follows so the number n
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.780
write it down as follows so the number n
let's just write this and

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790
let's just write this and
 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.540
let's just write this and
it's gonna be an M plus one digit number

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550
it's gonna be an M plus one digit number
 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.780
it's gonna be an M plus one digit number
okay which we might write like this okay

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790
okay which we might write like this okay
 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.120
okay which we might write like this okay
so we've got a zero in the ones a 1 in

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130
so we've got a zero in the ones a 1 in
 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.950
so we've got a zero in the ones a 1 in
the tens and so on let's actually write

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960
the tens and so on let's actually write
 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.120
the tens and so on let's actually write
down what this number is sort of

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130
down what this number is sort of
 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.160
down what this number is sort of
algebraically so what this means that n

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170
algebraically so what this means that n
 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.700
algebraically so what this means that n
is really 10 to the N times a n plus 10

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710
is really 10 to the N times a n plus 10
 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.150
is really 10 to the N times a n plus 10
to the n minus 1 times n minus 1 plus 10

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160
to the n minus 1 times n minus 1 plus 10
 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.960
to the n minus 1 times n minus 1 plus 10
a 1 plus a 0 okay so that's what this

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970
a 1 plus a 0 okay so that's what this
 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.440
a 1 plus a 0 okay so that's what this
number is

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450
number is
 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.360
number is
okay any number in principle at this

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370
okay any number in principle at this
 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.830
okay any number in principle at this
stage now let's write down the cross

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840
stage now let's write down the cross
 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.050
stage now let's write down the cross
some okay so the cross 1 is easy to

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060
some okay so the cross 1 is easy to
 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.420
some okay so the cross 1 is easy to
write down let's call it t R then okay

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
write down let's call it t R then okay
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.650
write down let's call it t R then okay
that's just going to be the sum of all

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660
that's just going to be the sum of all
 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.480
that's just going to be the sum of all
these individual positions so n plus a n

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490
these individual positions so n plus a n
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.560
these individual positions so n plus a n
minus 1 plus a little bit to a 1 plus a

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570
minus 1 plus a little bit to a 1 plus a
 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.840
minus 1 plus a little bit to a 1 plus a
0 ok now let's do that take away that do

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850
0 ok now let's do that take away that do
 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.660
0 ok now let's do that take away that do
that we can end - tear then okay let's

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:30.670
that we can end - tear then okay let's
 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.310
that we can end - tear then okay let's
see what we're gonna get so in this

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320
see what we're gonna get so in this
 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.460
see what we're gonna get so in this
position we'll get 10 to the N minus 1 n

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470
position we'll get 10 to the N minus 1 n
 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.690
position we'll get 10 to the N minus 1 n
plus 10 to the N minus 1 minus 1 a n

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700
plus 10 to the N minus 1 minus 1 a n
 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.500
plus 10 to the N minus 1 minus 1 a n
minus 1

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510
minus 1
 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.690
minus 1
you'll get similar things all along here

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700
you'll get similar things all along here
 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.470
you'll get similar things all along here
you'll get 10 minus 1 a 1 and then the a

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:46.480
you'll get 10 minus 1 a 1 and then the a
 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.180
you'll get 10 minus 1 a 1 and then the a
zeros are canceled now look at what

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.190
zeros are canceled now look at what
 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.370
zeros are canceled now look at what
you've got you've got this is 9 right

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:50.380
you've got you've got this is 9 right
 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.710
you've got you've got this is 9 right
the next one in the series would be 99

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720
the next one in the series would be 99
 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.380
the next one in the series would be 99
this one is going to be a whole bunch of

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.390
this one is going to be a whole bunch of
 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.570
this one is going to be a whole bunch of
nines this one's going to be a one more

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:57.580
nines this one's going to be a one more
 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.160
nines this one's going to be a one more
9 it'll have another 9 there so this is

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.170
9 it'll have another 9 there so this is
 

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.450
9 it'll have another 9 there so this is
going to be all the nines all the nines

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.460
going to be all the nines all the nines
 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.160
going to be all the nines all the nines
they're all going to be nines so they're

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.170
they're all going to be nines so they're
 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.280
they're all going to be nines so they're
all divisible by 9 okay so I can pull

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.290
all divisible by 9 okay so I can pull
 

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.220
all divisible by 9 okay so I can pull
out a factor of 9 so this is always

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.230
out a factor of 9 so this is always
 

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.520
out a factor of 9 so this is always
going to be 9 times some whole number if

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:11.530
going to be 9 times some whole number if
 

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.960
going to be 9 times some whole number if
the cross sum is divisible by 9 this is

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:15.970
the cross sum is divisible by 9 this is
 

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.330
the cross sum is divisible by 9 this is
divisible by 9 then this better be

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.340
divisible by 9 then this better be
 

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.350
divisible by 9 then this better be
divisible by 9 and similarly if the

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360
divisible by 9 and similarly if the
 

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.320
divisible by 9 and similarly if the
cross sum is divisible by 3 this is

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.330
cross sum is divisible by 3 this is
 

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.900
cross sum is divisible by 3 this is
definitely divisible by 3 then this

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:27.910
definitely divisible by 3 then this
 

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.400
definitely divisible by 3 then this
number the original number must be

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:29.410
number the original number must be
 

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.400
number the original number must be
divisible by 3 that's the proof dead

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.410
divisible by 3 that's the proof dead
 

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.270
divisible by 3 that's the proof dead
simple right

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:33.280
simple right
 

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.969
simple right
then easy to prove okay why does that

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:35.979
then easy to prove okay why does that
 

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:38.270
then easy to prove okay why does that
only work with nines and threes

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.280
only work with nines and threes
 

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.920
only work with nines and threes
precisely because the fact that you take

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:40.930
precisely because the fact that you take
 

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.940
precisely because the fact that you take
the fact that you take out is 9 okay

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:44.950
the fact that you take out is 9 okay
 

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.860
the fact that you take out is 9 okay
that's why so that you know basically

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:46.870
that's why so that you know basically
 

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.420
that's why so that you know basically
you can only do it for threes and nines

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
you can only do it for threes and nines
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.040
you can only do it for threes and nines
then so they're a bunch of these rules

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.050
then so they're a bunch of these rules
 

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.110
then so they're a bunch of these rules
some some of which are easier than

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120
some some of which are easier than
 

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.580
some some of which are easier than
others

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:52.590
others
 

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.610
others
and we can go through them right and so

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620
and we can go through them right and so
 

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.110
and we can go through them right and so
one okay

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120
one okay
 

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.340
one okay
that's these pretty easy the second

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.350
that's these pretty easy the second
 

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.990
that's these pretty easy the second
something's divisible by one two is easy

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000
something's divisible by one two is easy
 

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.550
something's divisible by one two is easy
it just has to be an even number three's

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560
it just has to be an even number three's
 

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.630
it just has to be an even number three's
we've done

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640
we've done
 

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.790
we've done
what about fours okay what's the

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800
what about fours okay what's the
 

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.519
what about fours okay what's the
divisibility rule for four okay I'm

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:07.529
divisibility rule for four okay I'm
 

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.320
divisibility rule for four okay I'm
gonna write you down a multiple of four

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.330
gonna write you down a multiple of four
 

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.240
gonna write you down a multiple of four
one four five six three to viewers can

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.250
one four five six three to viewers can
 

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.550
one four five six three to viewers can
check if that's a multiple of four

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560
check if that's a multiple of four
 

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.560
check if that's a multiple of four
directly we know it is how do we know it

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:18.570
directly we know it is how do we know it
 

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.260
directly we know it is how do we know it
is the way you do the four check is you

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.270
is the way you do the four check is you
 

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.290
is the way you do the four check is you
just look at the last two digits okay

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300
just look at the last two digits okay
 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.750
just look at the last two digits okay
and you ask yourself are the last two

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760
and you ask yourself are the last two
 

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.570
and you ask yourself are the last two
digits divisible by four if they are are

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580
digits divisible by four if they are are
 

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.450
digits divisible by four if they are are
that seen off so here it's 32 that's

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:32.460
that seen off so here it's 32 that's
 

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.220
that seen off so here it's 32 that's
divisible by four I don't need to worry

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.230
divisible by four I don't need to worry
 

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.290
divisible by four I don't need to worry
about the rest and it's easy to see why

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300
about the rest and it's easy to see why
 

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.900
about the rest and it's easy to see why
because these are a hundreds thousands

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:38.910
because these are a hundreds thousands
 

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.690
because these are a hundreds thousands
tens thousands hundred is divisible by

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700
tens thousands hundred is divisible by
 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.150
tens thousands hundred is divisible by
four a thousands divisible by four and

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160
four a thousands divisible by four and
 

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.400
four a thousands divisible by four and
so on all the all the higher powers of

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.410
so on all the all the higher powers of
 

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.960
so on all the all the higher powers of
ten are divisible by force and the only

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:47.970
ten are divisible by force and the only
 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.340
ten are divisible by force and the only
thing you need to check out the last two

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.350
thing you need to check out the last two
 

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.960
thing you need to check out the last two
so for that are easy as well it's a

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:50.970
so for that are easy as well it's a
 

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.450
so for that are easy as well it's a
really easy test

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:52.460
really easy test
 

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.440
really easy test
fives pretty easy does it end in 5 or 0

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:56.450
fives pretty easy does it end in 5 or 0
 

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.950
fives pretty easy does it end in 5 or 0
6 is well there you have to do the two

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:00.960
6 is well there you have to do the two
 

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.500
6 is well there you have to do the two
tests and the three tests okay so you

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:03.510
tests and the three tests okay so you
 

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.760
tests and the three tests okay so you
check is it even and then you do your

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.770
check is it even and then you do your
 

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.340
check is it even and then you do your
your cross on test for threes and it has

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:07.350
your cross on test for threes and it has
 

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.060
your cross on test for threes and it has
to pass both it has to pass both yes

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.070
to pass both it has to pass both yes
 

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.920
to pass both it has to pass both yes
sevens we're gonna come back the seven

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:12.930
sevens we're gonna come back the seven
 

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.860
sevens we're gonna come back the seven
sevens 7 is a notoriously magical and

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:15.870
sevens 7 is a notoriously magical and
 

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.590
sevens 7 is a notoriously magical and
mystical number right and sevens are the

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600
mystical number right and sevens are the
 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.750
mystical number right and sevens are the
hardest of these you know of these sort

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
hardest of these you know of these sort
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.970
hardest of these you know of these sort
of lower numbers for doing the air

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980
of lower numbers for doing the air
 

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.560
of lower numbers for doing the air
divisibility test so we'll come back to

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:24.570
divisibility test so we'll come back to
 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.220
divisibility test so we'll come back to
7 layer 8 let's try eights ok so here's

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.230
7 layer 8 let's try eights ok so here's
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:33.320
7 layer 8 let's try eights ok so here's
an example 1 7 5 2 4 6 4 so again

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.330
an example 1 7 5 2 4 6 4 so again
 

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.120
an example 1 7 5 2 4 6 4 so again
viewers can check that this this is

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.130
viewers can check that this this is
 

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.210
viewers can check that this this is
indeed a a multiple of 8 directly how do

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220
indeed a a multiple of 8 directly how do
 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.370
indeed a a multiple of 8 directly how do
we check in well it's very similar to

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380
we check in well it's very similar to
 

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.170
we check in well it's very similar to
the four tests but it comes in an extra

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180
the four tests but it comes in an extra
 

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.880
the four tests but it comes in an extra
stage well it depends how good you

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:43.890
stage well it depends how good you
 

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.650
stage well it depends how good you
mental arithmetic is actually okay so

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660
mental arithmetic is actually okay so
 

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.620
mental arithmetic is actually okay so
what you do is so whereas with fours we

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:48.630
what you do is so whereas with fours we
 

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.130
what you do is so whereas with fours we
check the last two digits with 8 we

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140
check the last two digits with 8 we
 

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.490
check the last two digits with 8 we
check the last three digits okay so we

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500
check the last three digits okay so we
 

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.800
check the last three digits okay so we
look at this 4 6 4 and we ask is that

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:57.810
look at this 4 6 4 and we ask is that
 

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.130
look at this 4 6 4 and we ask is that
guy divisible by 8

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:00.140
guy divisible by 8
 

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.230
guy divisible by 8
if that guy's divisible by 8 then this

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240
if that guy's divisible by 8 then this
 

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.940
if that guy's divisible by 8 then this
guy's guaranteed to be divisible by 8

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:03.950
guy's guaranteed to be divisible by 8
 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.310
guy's guaranteed to be divisible by 8
again why does it works very similar

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320
again why does it works very similar
 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.530
again why does it works very similar
reason to the N to the fours so

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:08.540
reason to the N to the fours so
 

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.590
reason to the N to the fours so
basically because the thousands the 10

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600
basically because the thousands the 10
 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.940
basically because the thousands the 10
thousands and so on and all the higher

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:12.950
thousands and so on and all the higher
 

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.100
thousands and so on and all the higher
powers of 10 are automatically divisible

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.110
powers of 10 are automatically divisible
 

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.690
powers of 10 are automatically divisible
by 8 so you don't need to look at the

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:16.700
by 8 so you don't need to look at the
 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.630
by 8 so you don't need to look at the
last three but then about you Brady but

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:19.640
last three but then about you Brady but
 

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.010
last three but then about you Brady but
my mental arithmetic is not good enough

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.020
my mental arithmetic is not good enough
 

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.830
my mental arithmetic is not good enough
to check of straight away whether that

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:23.840
to check of straight away whether that
 

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.540
to check of straight away whether that
number is divisible by 8 but there is a

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:25.550
number is divisible by 8 but there is a
 

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.370
number is divisible by 8 but there is a
test for checking very easily but if

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.380
test for checking very easily but if
 

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.780
test for checking very easily but if
you've got a three-digit number whether

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:28.790
you've got a three-digit number whether
 

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.550
you've got a three-digit number whether
it's divisible by 8 let's take this case

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560
it's divisible by 8 let's take this case
 

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.330
it's divisible by 8 let's take this case
4 6-4

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:31.340
4 6-4
 

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.040
4 6-4
what we do is we take these two digits

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.050
what we do is we take these two digits
 

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.240
what we do is we take these two digits
here okay 46 and we multiply that by 2

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.250
here okay 46 and we multiply that by 2
 

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.370
here okay 46 and we multiply that by 2
and then we add the other digit okay if

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:42.380
and then we add the other digit okay if
 

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.450
and then we add the other digit okay if
you do that you get 96 now my men

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:46.460
you do that you get 96 now my men
 

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.220
you do that you get 96 now my men
arithmetic is just about good enough to

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.230
arithmetic is just about good enough to
 

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.700
arithmetic is just about good enough to
know that that is a multiple of 8 okay

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:51.710
know that that is a multiple of 8 okay
 

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.000
know that that is a multiple of 8 okay
so if this number is a multiple of 8

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.010
so if this number is a multiple of 8
 

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.220
so if this number is a multiple of 8
then this number is a multiple of 8 and

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.230
then this number is a multiple of 8 and
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.740
then this number is a multiple of 8 and
by association so is this number so it's

00:11:59.740 --> 00:11:59.750
by association so is this number so it's
 

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.690
by association so is this number so it's
a two-stage test so let's just prove

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:01.700
a two-stage test so let's just prove
 

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.640
a two-stage test so let's just prove
this three-digit test for the multiples

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:03.650
this three-digit test for the multiples
 

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.280
this three-digit test for the multiples
of 8 is again quite easy so we just take

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:06.290
of 8 is again quite easy so we just take
 

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.590
of 8 is again quite easy so we just take
N and the number that we're interested

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600
N and the number that we're interested
 

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.810
N and the number that we're interested
in well let's write it is a hundred

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:10.820
in well let's write it is a hundred
 

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.370
in well let's write it is a hundred
times 82 plus 10 times 81 plus a 0 the

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:15.380
times 82 plus 10 times 81 plus a 0 the
 

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.950
times 82 plus 10 times 81 plus a 0 the
test we're going to perform is let's

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:17.960
test we're going to perform is let's
 

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.500
test we're going to perform is let's
call it TN is basically we take you know

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.510
call it TN is basically we take you know
 

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.110
call it TN is basically we take you know
the first two digits so that's like 10 a

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120
the first two digits so that's like 10 a
 

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.910
the first two digits so that's like 10 a
2 plus a 1 okay and we multiply that by

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920
2 plus a 1 okay and we multiply that by
 

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.820
2 plus a 1 okay and we multiply that by
2 and then we add the other one which is

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:30.830
2 and then we add the other one which is
 

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.130
2 and then we add the other one which is
a 0 now take these two away from one

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.140
a 0 now take these two away from one
 

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.930
a 0 now take these two away from one
another then you get n minus TN what are

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:37.940
another then you get n minus TN what are
 

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.180
another then you get n minus TN what are
you gonna get you're gonna get 100 minus

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.190
you gonna get you're gonna get 100 minus
 

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.490
you gonna get you're gonna get 100 minus
20 a 2's that's 80 a 2 you get 10 minus

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:45.500
20 a 2's that's 80 a 2 you get 10 minus
 

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.780
20 a 2's that's 80 a 2 you get 10 minus
2 a 1 that's 8 a 1 and the a zeros

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:49.790
2 a 1 that's 8 a 1 and the a zeros
 

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.220
2 a 1 that's 8 a 1 and the a zeros
cancel you can probably see it now right

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.230
cancel you can probably see it now right
 

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.260
cancel you can probably see it now right
basically if this number is divisible by

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:56.270
basically if this number is divisible by
 

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.350
basically if this number is divisible by
8 which is the thing that was the thing

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360
8 which is the thing that was the thing
 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.600
8 which is the thing that was the thing
that was our test so if the test number

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:01.610
that was our test so if the test number
 

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.700
that was our test so if the test number
is divisible by 8 this is guaranteed to

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:03.710
is divisible by 8 this is guaranteed to
 

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.550
is divisible by 8 this is guaranteed to
be divisible by 8 then that's gonna be

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560
be divisible by 8 then that's gonna be
 

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.480
be divisible by 8 then that's gonna be
divisible late

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.490
divisible late
 

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.670
divisible late
that's why works should we carry on all

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680
that's why works should we carry on all
 

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.400
that's why works should we carry on all
right okay what we don't know is already

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.410
right okay what we don't know is already
 

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.570
right okay what we don't know is already
so

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:13.580
so
 

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.720
so
tens I think you know motives can work

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:16.730
tens I think you know motives can work
 

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.910
tens I think you know motives can work
out tens living as we do in our in our

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920
out tens living as we do in our in our
 

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.190
out tens living as we do in our in our
base-10 world so let's do the test for

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200
base-10 world so let's do the test for
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.100
base-10 world so let's do the test for
11s dead simple really easy test okay

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.110
11s dead simple really easy test okay
 

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.199
11s dead simple really easy test okay
so let's pick a number this you can

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:26.209
so let's pick a number this you can
 

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:28.210
so let's pick a number this you can
check if you use your calculator this is

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:28.220
check if you use your calculator this is
 

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.699
check if you use your calculator this is
a multiple of 11 okay so let's do the

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:30.709
a multiple of 11 okay so let's do the
 

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.740
a multiple of 11 okay so let's do the
test okay so the first thing you do when

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:32.750
test okay so the first thing you do when
 

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.940
test okay so the first thing you do when
you do the Elevens test is you have to

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:33.950
you do the Elevens test is you have to
 

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.310
you do the Elevens test is you have to
reverse the number okay so you reverse

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320
reverse the number okay so you reverse
 

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.660
reverse the number okay so you reverse
the order of the number so you write it

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:37.670
the order of the number so you write it
 

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:43.180
the order of the number so you write it
as nine six six five two oh five and now

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.190
as nine six six five two oh five and now
 

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.519
as nine six six five two oh five and now
you don't take the cross some of this

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:45.529
you don't take the cross some of this
 

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:47.440
you don't take the cross some of this
number you take the alternating cross

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:47.450
number you take the alternating cross
 

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.300
number you take the alternating cross
what do I mean by that well that means I

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.310
what do I mean by that well that means I
 

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:54.550
what do I mean by that well that means I
do nine minus six plus six minus five

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560
do nine minus six plus six minus five
 

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.500
do nine minus six plus six minus five
plus two minus zero plus five then I

00:13:59.500 --> 00:13:59.510
plus two minus zero plus five then I
 

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.500
plus two minus zero plus five then I
think it is summer look I think it's 11

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:02.510
think it is summer look I think it's 11
 

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.750
think it is summer look I think it's 11
okay so again the rule is if the number

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:04.760
okay so again the rule is if the number
 

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.759
okay so again the rule is if the number
you end up with here is a multiple of 11

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:06.769
you end up with here is a multiple of 11
 

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:08.949
you end up with here is a multiple of 11
then the number you started out with is

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959
then the number you started out with is
 

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.810
then the number you started out with is
a multiple of 11 so if it have been 22

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:10.820
a multiple of 11 so if it have been 22
 

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.120
a multiple of 11 so if it have been 22
or we got 22 yeah that would have

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.130
or we got 22 yeah that would have
 

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.100
or we got 22 yeah that would have
guaranteed the original number is a

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.110
guaranteed the original number is a
 

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.870
guaranteed the original number is a
multiple of 11 gosh that's really

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880
multiple of 11 gosh that's really
 

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.190
multiple of 11 gosh that's really
obscure yeah we can prove it if you want

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.200
obscure yeah we can prove it if you want
 

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.060
obscure yeah we can prove it if you want
that's quite quite easy to prove but

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.070
that's quite quite easy to prove but
 

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.610
that's quite quite easy to prove but
there's another sort of flight sort of

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:24.620
there's another sort of flight sort of
 

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.050
there's another sort of flight sort of
take on the card trick that you can do

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.060
take on the card trick that you can do
 

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.480
take on the card trick that you can do
for this one it needs you to be slightly

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:28.490
for this one it needs you to be slightly
 

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.920
for this one it needs you to be slightly
quick with your with your mental

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:29.930
quick with your with your mental
 

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.420
quick with your with your mental
arithmetic so basically you lay out a

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:34.430
arithmetic so basically you lay out a
 

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.220
arithmetic so basically you lay out a
bunch of cards I don't know any other

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.230
bunch of cards I don't know any other
 

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.480
bunch of cards I don't know any other
let's let's not worry too much about

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:37.490
let's let's not worry too much about
 

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.590
let's let's not worry too much about
what it is okay and let's take five a

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600
what it is okay and let's take five a
 

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.079
what it is okay and let's take five a
five digit number okay so you want to

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:44.089
five digit number okay so you want to
 

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:45.010
five digit number okay so you want to
start off with something that's not

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.020
start off with something that's not
 

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.470
start off with something that's not
going to be a multiple of 11 curious

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480
going to be a multiple of 11 curious
 

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.850
going to be a multiple of 11 curious
check whether this one is or isn't it

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:48.860
check whether this one is or isn't it
 

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.550
check whether this one is or isn't it
before we proceed any way ahead of that

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560
before we proceed any way ahead of that
 

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.850
before we proceed any way ahead of that
no it's not good just played our random

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:54.860
no it's not good just played our random
 

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.040
no it's not good just played our random
number here okay and now you're gonna

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.050
number here okay and now you're gonna
 

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.870
number here okay and now you're gonna
show how clever you are by you're just

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880
show how clever you are by you're just
 

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.370
show how clever you are by you're just
gonna say I'm gonna add one card and

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:00.380
gonna say I'm gonna add one card and
 

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.790
gonna say I'm gonna add one card and
make it a multiple of 11 okay so how do

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800
make it a multiple of 11 okay so how do
 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.560
make it a multiple of 11 okay so how do
you do that I can't do that thing in my

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:05.570
you do that I can't do that thing in my
 

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.900
you do that I can't do that thing in my
head reversing and alternating across

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:07.910
head reversing and alternating across
 

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.550
head reversing and alternating across
some okay let's see if I can do it okay

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560
some okay let's see if I can do it okay
 

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:15.850
some okay let's see if I can do it okay
so it's you have to do it yes you have

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:15.860
so it's you have to do it yes you have
 

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.050
so it's you have to do it yes you have
to think the answer in your head

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.060
to think the answer in your head
 

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.540
to think the answer in your head
okay so I'm gonna

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:19.550
okay so I'm gonna
 

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:28.700
okay so I'm gonna
you

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:28.710
 
 

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.340
 
yes okay right yes I know how do you

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.350
yes okay right yes I know how do you
 

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:38.820
yes okay right yes I know how do you
thought okay I need another card yeah

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:38.830
thought okay I need another card yeah
 

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:44.310
thought okay I need another card yeah
okay so I need to uh huh okay I think

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320
okay so I need to uh huh okay I think
 

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.170
okay so I need to uh huh okay I think
that should do it

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180
that should do it
 

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.490
that should do it
yeah so if you've got much fewer mental

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:47.500
yeah so if you've got much fewer mental
 

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.990
yeah so if you've got much fewer mental
arithmetic it's bad man you'll do this

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000
arithmetic it's bad man you'll do this
 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.110
arithmetic it's bad man you'll do this
in no time so you were reversing that

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120
in no time so you were reversing that
 

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.880
in no time so you were reversing that
number then alternate yeah so I was

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:53.890
number then alternate yeah so I was
 

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.440
number then alternate yeah so I was
adding I was I was doing the cross one

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.450
adding I was I was doing the cross one
 

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.970
adding I was I was doing the cross one
at the alternating cross I'm in Reverse

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:56.980
at the alternating cross I'm in Reverse
 

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.850
at the alternating cross I'm in Reverse
right five minus three plus one minus

00:15:59.850 --> 00:15:59.860
right five minus three plus one minus
 

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.450
right five minus three plus one minus
two plus four I think is five okay so I

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:03.460
two plus four I think is five okay so I
 

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.280
two plus four I think is five okay so I
need to take off that that would get me

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.290
need to take off that that would get me
 

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.510
need to take off that that would get me
to zero which is definitely a multiple

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:06.520
to zero which is definitely a multiple
 

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.690
to zero which is definitely a multiple
of 11 using the goal is to get so

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:09.700
of 11 using the goal is to get so
 

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.850
of 11 using the goal is to get so
multiple of 11 you can also start

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:11.860
multiple of 11 you can also start
 

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.020
multiple of 11 you can also start
playing around putting numbers at the

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.030
playing around putting numbers at the
 

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.370
playing around putting numbers at the
start but it gets a bit more complicated

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.380
start but it gets a bit more complicated
 

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.420
start but it gets a bit more complicated
but all right let's try it okay 5 4 2 1

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.430
but all right let's try it okay 5 4 2 1
 

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:25.530
but all right let's try it okay 5 4 2 1
3 5 / 11 yay okay so obviously you need

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:25.540
3 5 / 11 yay okay so obviously you need
 

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.180
3 5 / 11 yay okay so obviously you need
to be pretty sharp limit or if it's sick

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.190
to be pretty sharp limit or if it's sick
 

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.550
to be pretty sharp limit or if it's sick
to do this one which I'm afraid I'm not

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560
to do this one which I'm afraid I'm not
 

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.180
to do this one which I'm afraid I'm not
twelves twelves wells Wells is just you

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.190
twelves twelves wells Wells is just you
 

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.430
twelves twelves wells Wells is just you
build it from the fours and threes okay

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440
build it from the fours and threes okay
 

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.350
build it from the fours and threes okay
so it's the same as he just you do the

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360
so it's the same as he just you do the
 

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.060
so it's the same as he just you do the
four tests and then you do the the three

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.070
four tests and then you do the the three
 

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.520
four tests and then you do the the three
tests so that's easy and that just has

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:41.530
tests so that's easy and that just has
 

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.860
tests so that's easy and that just has
to pass by faster pass based yeah yeah

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:43.870
to pass by faster pass based yeah yeah
 

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.690
to pass by faster pass based yeah yeah
we could go on and but let's come back

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:45.700
we could go on and but let's come back
 

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.300
we could go on and but let's come back
to sevens okay cuz we skip sevens which

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.310
to sevens okay cuz we skip sevens which
 

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.480
to sevens okay cuz we skip sevens which
is a bit naughty sevens are hard sevens

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.490
is a bit naughty sevens are hard sevens
 

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.660
is a bit naughty sevens are hard sevens
are notoriously hard

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:52.670
are notoriously hard
 

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:58.910
are notoriously hard

there is a reasonably simple one

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:01.630
there is a reasonably simple one
 

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.630
there is a reasonably simple one
but it also reminds me a friend of mine

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640
but it also reminds me a friend of mine
 

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.150
but it also reminds me a friend of mine
I got a friend called nori nori is a lot

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160
I got a friend called nori nori is a lot
 

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.860
I got a friend called nori nori is a lot
of things but he is not a mathematician

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:07.870
of things but he is not a mathematician
 

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.780
of things but he is not a mathematician
but he has this this thing he can do

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:09.790
but he has this this thing he can do
 

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.600
but he has this this thing he can do
where he if he sees a number he can tell

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:12.610
where he if he sees a number he can tell
 

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.340
where he if he sees a number he can tell
immediately whether it's a multiple of

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:14.350
immediately whether it's a multiple of
 

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.380
immediately whether it's a multiple of
seven and it's really strange he's sort

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:16.390
seven and it's really strange he's sort
 

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.790
seven and it's really strange he's sort
of like he sort of season number in a

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:17.800
of like he sort of season number in a
 

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.160
of like he sort of season number in a
cloud in his mind and then if he's sort

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.170
cloud in his mind and then if he's sort
 

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.540
cloud in his mind and then if he's sort
of warm towards it if he feels like a

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:21.550
of warm towards it if he feels like a
 

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.280
of warm towards it if he feels like a
friendship towards he then that means

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.290
friendship towards he then that means
 

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.110
friendship towards he then that means
it's a multiple of seven this is totally

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120
it's a multiple of seven this is totally
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.560
it's a multiple of seven this is totally
real

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:25.570

just totally he's not as I said he's not

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.130
just totally he's not as I said he's not
 

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.570
just totally he's not as I said he's not
a mathematician he did English at uni

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:30.580
a mathematician he did English at uni
 

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.680
a mathematician he did English at uni
but yet he has this rather unusual thing

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:34.690
but yet he has this rather unusual thing
 

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.480
but yet he has this rather unusual thing
that he has how did you find out that he

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:36.490
that he has how did you find out that he
 

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.950
that he has how did you find out that he
has this ability how does that come up

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960
has this ability how does that come up
 

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.600
has this ability how does that come up
in conversation I know he likes to talk

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:39.610
in conversation I know he likes to talk
 

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.450
in conversation I know he likes to talk
about himself a lot who's always got a

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.460
about himself a lot who's always got a
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.310
about himself a lot who's always got a
coffee at some point do you test him do

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320
coffee at some point do you test him do
 

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.350
coffee at some point do you test him do
you can do it there's no known lesson

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360
you can do it there's no known lesson
 

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.620
you can do it there's no known lesson
about you can totally do yeah so you can

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:49.630
about you can totally do yeah so you can
 

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.720
about you can totally do yeah so you can
go to about five digits and then he

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:51.730
go to about five digits and then he
 

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.130
go to about five digits and then he
starts to feel physical effects

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.140
starts to feel physical effects
 

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.790
starts to feel physical effects
apparently at that point video with nori

00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:58.800
apparently at that point video with nori
 

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.460
apparently at that point video with nori
well the irony was he was but I told her

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:02.470
well the irony was he was but I told her
 

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.680
well the irony was he was but I told her
I thought I mentioned this he he decided

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:04.690
I thought I mentioned this he he decided
 

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.270
I thought I mentioned this he he decided
that a whole video should be about him

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280
that a whole video should be about him
 

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.420
that a whole video should be about him
this is typical nori but I said the

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.430
this is typical nori but I said the
 

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.560
this is typical nori but I said the
whole video is not going to be about you

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:10.570
whole video is not going to be about you
 

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.540
whole video is not going to be about you
know but maybe it is hey let us have a

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:12.550
know but maybe it is hey let us have a
 

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.160
know but maybe it is hey let us have a
picture of him to put on the screen no

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.170
picture of him to put on the screen no
 

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.330
picture of him to put on the screen no
he will love to have a picture of

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:15.340
he will love to have a picture of
 

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.380
he will love to have a picture of
himself on the screen okay so how do I

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.390
himself on the screen okay so how do I
 

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.600
himself on the screen okay so how do I
do okay so we got a multiple of seven

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:21.610
do okay so we got a multiple of seven
 

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.580
do okay so we got a multiple of seven
let me write it down I know he looked at

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:23.590
let me write it down I know he looked at
 

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.320
let me write it down I know he looked at
that number he'd start to seal his

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:25.330
that number he'd start to seal his
 

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.480
that number he'd start to seal his
friendship feelings of warmth and all

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:27.490
friendship feelings of warmth and all
 

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.090
friendship feelings of warmth and all
that right okay so the seventh test the

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.100
that right okay so the seventh test the
 

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.650
that right okay so the seventh test the
simplest one I could find is the

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:31.660
simplest one I could find is the
 

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.130
simplest one I could find is the
following

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.140
following
 

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.830
following
you take the blocks of three okay so

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840
you take the blocks of three okay so
 

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.650
you take the blocks of three okay so
this block of three here nine eight four

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:37.660
this block of three here nine eight four
 

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.050
this block of three here nine eight four
and then we do like an alternating sum

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.060
and then we do like an alternating sum
 

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.700
and then we do like an alternating sum
again so we don't take the next block of

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.710
again so we don't take the next block of
 

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.100
again so we don't take the next block of
three which is this one we take it away

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.110
three which is this one we take it away
 

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.480
three which is this one we take it away
nine seven six and then we add we keep

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.490
nine seven six and then we add we keep
 

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.220
nine seven six and then we add we keep
going like this the next block is going

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:50.230
going like this the next block is going
 

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.590
going like this the next block is going
to be a six of course we stop here okay

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600
to be a six of course we stop here okay
 

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.270
to be a six of course we stop here okay
if we had more we'd keep doing this in

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280
if we had more we'd keep doing this in
 

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.790
if we had more we'd keep doing this in
an in an alternating way okay so now you

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:56.800
an in an alternating way okay so now you
 

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.550
an in an alternating way okay so now you
actually calculate this thing and which

00:18:59.550 --> 00:18:59.560
actually calculate this thing and which
 

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.830
actually calculate this thing and which
is obviously pretty easy to do so that

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840
is obviously pretty easy to do so that
 

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.230
is obviously pretty easy to do so that
is going to be I think 14 so if the

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240
is going to be I think 14 so if the
 

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.210
is going to be I think 14 so if the
result is a multiple of seven that

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:06.220
result is a multiple of seven that
 

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.040
result is a multiple of seven that
guarantees that the original number is a

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.050
guarantees that the original number is a
 

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.900
guarantees that the original number is a
multiple of seven I imagine quite often

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:09.910
multiple of seven I imagine quite often
 

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.460
multiple of seven I imagine quite often
we're going to get negative numbers on

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.470
we're going to get negative numbers on
 

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.730
we're going to get negative numbers on
this

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:11.740
this
 

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.710
this
this test that's fine that they can be

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720
this test that's fine that they can be
 

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.299
this test that's fine that they can be
negative numbers it can be a multiple of

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:15.309
negative numbers it can be a multiple of
 

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.639
negative numbers it can be a multiple of
seven it's just a and negative number x

00:19:17.639 --> 00:19:17.649
seven it's just a and negative number x
 

00:19:17.649 --> 00:19:19.710
seven it's just a and negative number x
times something this was actually a

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720
times something this was actually a
 

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.260
times something this was actually a
really really simple example and it was

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:22.270
really really simple example and it was
 

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.000
really really simple example and it was
pure luck that it turned out to be so

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.010
pure luck that it turned out to be so
 

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.350
pure luck that it turned out to be so
simple normally you're going to end up

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360
simple normally you're going to end up
 

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.970
simple normally you're going to end up
with a three-digit number here right so

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:26.980
with a three-digit number here right so
 

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.769
with a three-digit number here right so
you're faced with the question of is

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:28.779
you're faced with the question of is
 

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:31.139
you're faced with the question of is
that three-digit number a multiple of

00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:31.149
that three-digit number a multiple of
 

00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:33.210
that three-digit number a multiple of
seven which generally is not gonna be

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:33.220
seven which generally is not gonna be
 

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.190
seven which generally is not gonna be
that easy and so let's do another

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200
that easy and so let's do another
 

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.899
that easy and so let's do another
example maybe quickly just to see how

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:36.909
example maybe quickly just to see how
 

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.490
example maybe quickly just to see how
that can arise here I have another

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:38.500
that can arise here I have another
 

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.570
that can arise here I have another
little number which happens to be a

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:39.580
little number which happens to be a
 

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.970
little number which happens to be a
multiple of seven so I do one two three

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:41.980
multiple of seven so I do one two three
 

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.269
multiple of seven so I do one two three
- eight seven - and I am gonna get this

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:45.279
- eight seven - and I am gonna get this
 

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:48.350
- eight seven - and I am gonna get this
it turns out to be minus seven four nine

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360
it turns out to be minus seven four nine
 

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.700
it turns out to be minus seven four nine
that's be hard isn't it Brady that's

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:50.710
that's be hard isn't it Brady that's
 

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.350
that's be hard isn't it Brady that's
beyond my mental arithmetic that's for

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360
beyond my mental arithmetic that's for
 

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.639
beyond my mental arithmetic that's for
sure okay so we're going to now do

00:19:53.639 --> 00:19:53.649
sure okay so we're going to now do
 

00:19:53.649 --> 00:19:57.060
sure okay so we're going to now do
another three three digit test on sevens

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.070
another three three digit test on sevens
 

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.010
another three three digit test on sevens
is that really but I mean seven four

00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.020
is that really but I mean seven four
 

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.539
is that really but I mean seven four
nine actually is pretty easy that's

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:00.549
nine actually is pretty easy that's
 

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:04.590
nine actually is pretty easy that's
really easy this is the bell finger

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600
really easy this is the bell finger
 

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.539
really easy this is the bell finger
probe okay okay but let's pretend it's

00:20:09.539 --> 00:20:09.549
probe okay okay but let's pretend it's
 

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:10.740
probe okay okay but let's pretend it's
hard but what would be the test that we

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:10.750
hard but what would be the test that we
 

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.840
hard but what would be the test that we
do okay so you take your seven we don't

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:12.850
do okay so you take your seven we don't
 

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.610
do okay so you take your seven we don't
need to worry about a minus so you take

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:14.620
need to worry about a minus so you take
 

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.310
need to worry about a minus so you take
your seven forty-nine okay so we take

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320
your seven forty-nine okay so we take
 

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.750
your seven forty-nine okay so we take
this number here which is 74 and we take

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760
this number here which is 74 and we take
 

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.580
this number here which is 74 and we take
off twice this number here okay so two

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:26.590
off twice this number here okay so two
 

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.269
off twice this number here okay so two
times nine

00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:27.279
times nine
 

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:31.260
times nine
okay that's 56 and then the issue is is

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.270
okay that's 56 and then the issue is is
 

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.419
okay that's 56 and then the issue is is
this a multiple of seven which of course

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:33.429
this a multiple of seven which of course
 

00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:35.100
this a multiple of seven which of course
it is okay that would guarantee that

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.110
it is okay that would guarantee that
 

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.159
it is okay that would guarantee that
this is and by association this is this

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:38.169
this is and by association this is this
 

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:40.049
this is and by association this is this
this test for three digits it's quite

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:40.059
this test for three digits it's quite
 

00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:42.149
this test for three digits it's quite
straightforward to prove proving that

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159
straightforward to prove proving that
 

00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:44.340
straightforward to prove proving that
these blocks of three works is it's not

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:44.350
these blocks of three works is it's not
 

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:49.560
these blocks of three works is it's not
so easy you can prove it okay you can't

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:49.570
so easy you can prove it okay you can't
 

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.570
so easy you can prove it okay you can't
prove it and it relies on two facts

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:51.580
prove it and it relies on two facts
 

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.740
prove it and it relies on two facts
we're not going to do the proof the

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:52.750
we're not going to do the proof the
 

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.419
we're not going to do the proof the
first fact that you need to prove this

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:54.429
first fact that you need to prove this
 

00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:57.930
first fact that you need to prove this
is that this number is basically seven

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:57.940
is that this number is basically seven
 

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.220
is that this number is basically seven
times 11 times their team okay so

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:02.230
times 11 times their team okay so
 

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.539
times 11 times their team okay so
actually what's the point about is that

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:03.549
actually what's the point about is that
 

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:06.180
actually what's the point about is that
it's a multiple of seven the other fact

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.190
it's a multiple of seven the other fact
 

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:11.810
it's a multiple of seven the other fact
that you need to know is that imagine

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820
 
 

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.029
 
99999 is also a multiple of certain and

00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039
99999 is also a multiple of certain and
 

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:17.039
99999 is also a multiple of certain and
it's this multiple of seven so this is a

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:17.049
it's this multiple of seven so this is a
 

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:18.360
it's this multiple of seven so this is a
multiple of seven this is a multiple of

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.370
multiple of seven this is a multiple of
 

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.279
multiple of seven this is a multiple of
seven these are the two facts you need

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:20.289
seven these are the two facts you need
 

00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:23.940
seven these are the two facts you need
to prove this set particular sevens test

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:23.950
to prove this set particular sevens test
 

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.450
to prove this set particular sevens test
but it's quite an elaborate

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460
but it's quite an elaborate
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.160
but it's quite an elaborate
it's yeah it's it's it's it's yeah

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.170
it's yeah it's it's it's it's yeah
 

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.930
it's yeah it's it's it's it's yeah
exactly it's it's it's not it's not

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:28.940
exactly it's it's it's not it's not
 

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.760
exactly it's it's it's not it's not
particularly entertaining proof notice

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:30.770
particularly entertaining proof notice
 

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.810
particularly entertaining proof notice
by the way that's got this number in

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:31.820
by the way that's got this number in
 

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.370
by the way that's got this number in
here do you remember that number I do

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:33.380
here do you remember that number I do
 

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.690
here do you remember that number I do
isn't that the one where you can like

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:34.700
isn't that the one where you can like
 

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.450
isn't that the one where you can like
cycle yeah yeah yeah we did we did a

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:37.460
cycle yeah yeah yeah we did we did a
 

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.010
cycle yeah yeah yeah we did we did a
video on that number fact I think we

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.020
video on that number fact I think we
 

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.590
video on that number fact I think we
even probably showed that result I'm

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600
even probably showed that result I'm
 

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.880
even probably showed that result I'm
quite it sort of pleased me that that

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:42.890
quite it sort of pleased me that that
 

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.530
quite it sort of pleased me that that
reappeared okay okay so there is you can

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:47.540
reappeared okay okay so there is you can
 

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.720
reappeared okay okay so there is you can
do one in all generality okay and which

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:52.730
do one in all generality okay and which
 

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.630
do one in all generality okay and which
I don't know how exciting this is but we

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640
I don't know how exciting this is but we
 

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.830
I don't know how exciting this is but we
can do it with an example

00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840
 
 

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.570
 
any number ends in one three seven or

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:01.580
any number ends in one three seven or
 

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.160
any number ends in one three seven or
nine you know you might need to use a

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.170
nine you know you might need to use a
 

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.470
nine you know you might need to use a
few iterations of it to actually get get

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480
few iterations of it to actually get get
 

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.650
few iterations of it to actually get get
down to the to the bottom but yeah there

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:08.660
down to the to the bottom but yeah there
 

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.300
down to the to the bottom but yeah there
is a general test so let's let's do an

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:10.310
is a general test so let's let's do an
 

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.340
is a general test so let's let's do an
example okay so I can illustrate the

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:12.350
example okay so I can illustrate the
 

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.670
example okay so I can illustrate the
general test another piece of paper and

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:14.680
general test another piece of paper and
 

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.710
general test another piece of paper and
yeah why not

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720
 
 

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.410
 
so let's try it for 23 okay so the first

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:23.420
so let's try it for 23 okay so the first
 

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.460
so let's try it for 23 okay so the first
thing that you have to do is let's start

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:24.470
thing that you have to do is let's start
 

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.360
thing that you have to do is let's start
with 23 this we're gonna look at we want

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:28.370
with 23 this we're gonna look at we want
 

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.120
with 23 this we're gonna look at we want
to ask things in a 23 times table we're

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.130
to ask things in a 23 times table we're
 

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.560
to ask things in a 23 times table we're
never we're gonna test for is this

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.570
never we're gonna test for is this
 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.840
never we're gonna test for is this
number which is in the 23 times table so

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:34.850
number which is in the 23 times table so
 

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.520
number which is in the 23 times table so
the test goes in various stages first

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:36.530
the test goes in various stages first
 

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.480
the test goes in various stages first
thing you've got to do is you've got to

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:37.490
thing you've got to do is you've got to
 

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.510
thing you've got to do is you've got to
generate a new number from this guy okay

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520
generate a new number from this guy okay
 

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.060
generate a new number from this guy okay
I'm gonna call it the divvy number okay

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.070
I'm gonna call it the divvy number okay
 

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.000
I'm gonna call it the divvy number okay
from 23 from 23 I'm going to generate 23

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.010
from 23 from 23 I'm going to generate 23
 

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.410
from 23 from 23 I'm going to generate 23
divvy number so the first thing you have

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:47.420
divvy number so the first thing you have
 

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.610
divvy number so the first thing you have
to do is you have to multiply this by

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:48.620
to do is you have to multiply this by
 

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.760
to do is you have to multiply this by
something to make it end in nine okay so

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:51.770
something to make it end in nine okay so
 

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.080
something to make it end in nine okay so
if you've got a number ending in three

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.090
if you've got a number ending in three
 

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.000
if you've got a number ending in three
to make it end in a nine you just

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.010
to make it end in a nine you just
 

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.280
to make it end in a nine you just
multiply it by three okay so that will

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.290
multiply it by three okay so that will
 

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.710
multiply it by three okay so that will
give us 69 so you can now got a number

00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720
give us 69 so you can now got a number
 

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.100
give us 69 so you can now got a number
that ends in a nine okay if you had if

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.110
that ends in a nine okay if you had if
 

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.590
that ends in a nine okay if you had if
your number ended in a one or a seven or

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600
your number ended in a one or a seven or
 

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.400
your number ended in a one or a seven or
a nine

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.410
a nine
 

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.860
a nine
so it wasn't 23 it was twenty-one or 27

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:08.870
so it wasn't 23 it was twenty-one or 27
 

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.260
so it wasn't 23 it was twenty-one or 27
or 29 you would multiply by a different

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.270
or 29 you would multiply by a different
 

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.570
or 29 you would multiply by a different
number to get it to end in a nine okay

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:13.580
number to get it to end in a nine okay
 

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.130
number to get it to end in a nine okay
it would still be one of one three seven

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.140
it would still be one of one three seven
 

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.780
it would still be one of one three seven
and nine but you just use something else

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:16.790
and nine but you just use something else
 

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.820
and nine but you just use something else
the goal is to get something to ends and

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:18.830
the goal is to get something to ends and
 

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.530
the goal is to get something to ends and
I know okay once you've got some of the

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:20.540
I know okay once you've got some of the
 

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.560
I know okay once you've got some of the
ends and a nine you then add one okay so

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:23.570
ends and a nine you then add one okay so
 

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.390
ends and a nine you then add one okay so
that's easy that gives us something

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400
that's easy that gives us something
 

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.890
that's easy that gives us something
that's a multiple of ten it's guaranteed

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:26.900
that's a multiple of ten it's guaranteed
 

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.810
that's a multiple of ten it's guaranteed
to be a multiple of ten okay in our case

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:28.820
to be a multiple of ten okay in our case
 

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.580
to be a multiple of ten okay in our case
it's 70 now once you've got this

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:30.590
it's 70 now once you've got this
 

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.310
it's 70 now once you've got this
multiple of ten you just divide by ten

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
multiple of ten you just divide by ten
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.330
multiple of ten you just divide by ten
okay so let's divide this by 10 and we

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:37.340
okay so let's divide this by 10 and we
 

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.830
okay so let's divide this by 10 and we
obviously get seven

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840
obviously get seven
 

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.750
obviously get seven
okay this is our divvy number so what's

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760
okay this is our divvy number so what's
 

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.330
okay this is our divvy number so what's
the test okay so now we've got our divvy

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.340
the test okay so now we've got our divvy
 

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.180
the test okay so now we've got our divvy
number we've got our number that we're

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.190
number we've got our number that we're
 

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.980
number we've got our number that we're
interested in looking at and so the

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:47.990
interested in looking at and so the
 

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.120
interested in looking at and so the
thing you have to do is you have to

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.130
thing you have to do is you have to
 

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.510
thing you have to do is you have to
write this number in the form 10 T plus

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520
write this number in the form 10 T plus
 

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.720
write this number in the form 10 T plus
Q now that if I do that that means that

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:55.730
Q now that if I do that that means that
 

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:01.930
Q now that if I do that that means that
T is 103 and Q is 5 now using your Divya

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:01.940
T is 103 and Q is 5 now using your Divya
 

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.090
T is 103 and Q is 5 now using your Divya
number what you do is you create so

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:04.100
number what you do is you create so
 

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.330
number what you do is you create so
let's call the divvy number M okay it

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:07.340
let's call the divvy number M okay it
 

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.210
let's call the divvy number M okay it
creates a new number which is this thing

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:09.220
creates a new number which is this thing
 

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.700
creates a new number which is this thing
okay so let's calculate what this is

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:11.710
okay so let's calculate what this is
 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:20.350
okay so let's calculate what this is
okay so M is 7 Q is 5 and this is 103

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360
okay so M is 7 Q is 5 and this is 103
 

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.270
okay so M is 7 Q is 5 and this is 103
that happens to be 138 which hopefully

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:24.280
that happens to be 138 which hopefully
 

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.950
that happens to be 138 which hopefully
you mentally over to rithmetic is good

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960
you mentally over to rithmetic is good
 

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.420
you mentally over to rithmetic is good
enough to check with that that see that

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:28.430
enough to check with that that see that
 

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.910
enough to check with that that see that
that is a multiple of 23 so if the

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:30.920
that is a multiple of 23 so if the
 

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.950
that is a multiple of 23 so if the
number you end up with here is a

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960
number you end up with here is a
 

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.410
number you end up with here is a
multiple of the 23 then the number you

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:35.420
multiple of the 23 then the number you
 

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.400
multiple of the 23 then the number you
are testing is a multiple of 23 so you

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.410
are testing is a multiple of 23 so you
 

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.850
are testing is a multiple of 23 so you
can adapt this method to any number that

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:42.860
can adapt this method to any number that
 

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.990
can adapt this method to any number that
ends in 1 3 7 or 9 and it will work ok

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000
ends in 1 3 7 or 9 and it will work ok
 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.030
ends in 1 3 7 or 9 and it will work ok
what it relies on is that the numbers

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.040
what it relies on is that the numbers
 

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.590
what it relies on is that the numbers
constructed in this way it's guaranteed

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600
constructed in this way it's guaranteed
 

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.900
