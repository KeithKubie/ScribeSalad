00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.631
SPEAKER: Imagine if you could
rush through a McDonald's

00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:04.750
drive-through, or pick
up a dog at the ballpark

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.110
without fumbling
for your wallet.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.550
Welcome to Hands Free Payments,
a quick and convenient way

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.430
to pay for things
in-store by just

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.470
saying, "I'll pay with Google."

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.460
Hands Free is currently
supported at select locations,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.570
including McDonald's,
Papa John's,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.700
and numerous other merchants.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.940
This video will show you,
as a merchant or a merchant

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.120
developer, how you
can enable Hands Free

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.270
payments through your
point of sale system.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.030
But first, here's
a quick overview

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.270
of how the Hands Free
user experience works.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.780
As a customer, you simply
download Hands Free

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.340
onto your Android or iOS phone.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.140
When you run the app
for the first time,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.690
you'll add your photo,
your name, and credit card

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.010
information.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.290
And after that,
you're ready to go.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.910
You don't even need to pull out
the phone to make a payment.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.880
Hands Free uses Bluetooth
Low Energy, Wi-Fi,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.760
and Location
Services on the phone

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.070
to detect when you're in a
store that accepts Hands Free.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.520
When you're ready to pay,
simply tell the cashier,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280
"I'll pay with Google."

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.260
The cashier will then press
the Google tender button.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.750
Hands Free automatically
verifies your identity

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.160
and shows your photo on the POS.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.930
It does so by using a
Hands Free in-store camera

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.100
and visual identification
technology.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.130
In some cases, if Hands Free
cannot find you right away,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.030
the cashier also has the option
of searching for your initials

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.831
to pull up your photo.

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.080
Hands Free does not pass
your full payment information

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.280
to the store or the POS.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.610
Instead, once you're
identified, Google

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240
interfaces with the merchant's
preferred payment processor

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.990
to complete the charge.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.610
Once the charge
completes, you'll

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.940
get a notification in the
Hands Free app as confirmation.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.891
As a merchant, here's
how you get all this up

00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:46.890
and running in your store,
so that you can start

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.020
accepting Hands Free payments.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.030
Your Google representative
will work with you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.670
to ensure that your store's
hardware is set up properly

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.030
to support Hands Free customers.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.220
This includes ensuring
that your POS is connected

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.910
to the Internet,
since it'll need

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.380
to talk to the Hands Free
API to query and find

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.320
the right customer to charge.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.660
The Hands Free API
exposes a number of calls,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.389
but they can be separated
into two groups.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.480
One is for looking
up nearby customers.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.460
And the other is for performing
transactions on a customer

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.450
once you've identified
the correct person.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.740
The first step is
looking up a customer.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.170
When the customer says,
"I'll pay with Google,"

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.720
the cashier presses a Google
tender button on the POS.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750
The POS then calls
the consumer query

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.450
API to query for
nearby customers that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.180
are found using
the in-store camera

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.850
for visual identification.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.600
Here's an example of what your
query request might look like

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.680
and the response you'd get back.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.680
We would return to you
the customer's first name,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800
a URL that points to a
photo of the customer,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.140
and a SessionToken that you
can use in subsequent API

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.280
calls to perform
transactions on the customer.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.940
Once you have all
of this information,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.470
you'll need to make
the POS display

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.320
those customers to the cashier.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.630
Now, if no customers
are found, the POS

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.650
needs to display a
prompt to the cashier

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.012
to enter the
customer's initials.

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:09.470
The initials provide
the Hands Free

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.170
system with a bit more data
to pinpoint nearby customers.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.720
After the cashier enters
the customer's initials,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.460
the POS should call the
consumer query API again,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.010
this time including
those initials.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.220
In most cases, the
consumer query call

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.000
will return a single customer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.760
But it is possible that
more than one customer

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.240
will be returned.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.220
In this case, the POS needs to
display all of the customers

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.040
it finds, so that
the cashier can

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.180
select the correct customer who
is standing in front of them.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.410
As I mentioned, each customer
has a unique SessionToken.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.960
And you can use that
SessionToken to perform charges

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.370
and refunds on that customer.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.960
To charge a
customer, you'll need

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.950
to use a transaction
charge API call.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.060
Here's an example of what your
charge request might look like.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.970
The call is pretty simple.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.010
All you need to do
is pass parameters,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.270
such as a request ID,
the charge amount,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.050
the customer's SessionToken,
and optional line item data,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.730
so that we can show the
customer a digital receipt.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.210
And the response will
return to you whether or not

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.060
the charge was
successful, as well as

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.810
details, such as the charge
amount and the payment

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.320
instrument that was used.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.370
On the POS, you'll need to
create a Hands Free transaction

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.810
confirmation screen, or just
leverage an existing screen

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.010
to show the cashier the
transaction confirmation.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.550
Occasionally, some charges
require user confirmation.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.240
This happens when a risk engine
detects a transaction that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.390
appears suspicious.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.730
And there are API calls
to handle these scenarios.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.600
There are additional API
calls for performing refunds

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.420
and canceling transactions too.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.200
And these are outlined in
our full API documentation.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.820
This has just been a high
level overview of the API.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.730
So if you're interested in
setting up Hands Free payments,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.300

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.752
you set up with
your own account,

00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:03.480
access to the full API
documentation, and even

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.800
a reference implementation
and sample code

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.960
to get you ramped up quickly.
