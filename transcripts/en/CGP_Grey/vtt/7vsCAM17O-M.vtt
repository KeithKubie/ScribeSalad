00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.630
Hello Internet,

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.450
Recently YouTube invited me to California
for a conference with a bunch of really interesting

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.450
people.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.381
There were many talks and giant balloons and
much discussion of what the future of education

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.690
might look like -- which is no small issue
because how society raises the next generation

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.430
of scientists, doctors, and programmers shapes
the future of human civilization.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.310
It was an amazing few days and, if you'll
tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.500
of my thoughts on this as someone who's worked
as an educator both in and out of schools.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.330
So this is how schools have pretty much always
looked: a guy in the front who knows all the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.230
things and students who don't so the guy tells
them.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.600
But a teacher explains things at the right
pace for maybe *one* student in the room during

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.690
a lesson.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.820
Everyone else is either bored because they
already understand the material or lost because

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.970
they're missing knowledge they should already
have.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.150
But, at the end of the lesson, regardless
of student understanding, the circeirculem

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.990
marches rentlessly on.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.890
And whether the teachers use a blackboard,
whiteboard or smart board and whether students

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.829
use tables, or paper, or tablets (again) this
system really isn't any different -- it's

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.780
just technology doing the same thing in a
shiner way.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.909
But the Internet is different and behind the
scenes something interesting is happening

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.520
that hints at the shape of things to come.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.619
In a perfect school, each student would have
a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.619
the great.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.810
But if your education policy is 'Aristotle
for everyone' then there are three big problems

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.810
with this:

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.689
1st) There aren't enough humans on Earth to
individually tutor every child, and even if

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.179
there were it would be horrifically expensive
and even if neither manpower nor money was

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.189
a problem not everyone is as good a tutor
as Aristotle.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.229
But technology is solving these problems:
starting with number 1:

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.459
For who needs humans when the Internet can
teach you all the things?

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.509
Want to learn calculus: get started.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.200
Need an AP biology course?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.119
Go watch this one along with hundreds of thousands
of other students.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.329
The Internet massively multiplies the audience
of potential teachers and solves the manpower

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.329
problem.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.271
But isn't cheerleading the Internet the same
thing I was complaining about before: new

00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:01.299
tech doing old things just with more shiny?

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.170
After all if you were a pre-Internet child,
with bookish inclinations, there's *always*

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.329
been a place to teach you all the things.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.890
And people thought that radio and TV were
going to revolutionize education by giving

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.580
teachers huge audiences, but here we still
are.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.860
These are good points but Internet also solves
the cost problem in a way that Radio and TV

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.040
never could.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.700
Real shows are expensive to make and even
the best of educational TV often gets pushed

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.110
aside for dumber, more popular stuff that,
not coincidently, is also more profitable.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.950
This is known as the History Channel Effect.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
But the cost to access to the Internet is
only going down, as is the cost to make stuff

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.580
for the Internet.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.020
Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker
in his bedroom can pull in a million views

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.840
a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't
have to worry about competition from stuff

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840
like this.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.060
So the Internet solves problems one and two,
but educational videos still aren't personalized

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.430
to students and that leaves YouTube still
as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.050
But you can build on top of YouTube and what
I see coming is this: Digital Aristotle for

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.050
everyone.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.220
A computer program that tutors students individually,
by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.280
a program that tests students on what they
know and, more importantly, adapts to the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.390
way they learn over time by comparing the
effectiveness of different videos and different

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.990
tests to discover scientifically, what works
best.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.040
This isn't a fantasy, there are people building
parts of this right now (even if Digital Aristotle

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.730
isn't their explicit goal).

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.250
And one of these places is The Khan Academy
which is more than just Sal's soothing voice.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.569
If this does not blow your mind, you have
no emotion.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.210
Behind the website is incredibly complicated
software testing everything about student

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.240
learning: the effectiveness of different videos,
different tests, and different ways of asking

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.380
questions.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.630
And while it may seem primitive now, technology
only gets better, faster.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.130
When Digital Aristotle arrives it will be
cheaper, less labor intensive and better than

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.220
human teachers ever could be.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.680
I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle,
or something like it, will free teachers to

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.880
float around the classroom helping kids works
on interesting projects -- and while that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.209
might happen in the near-term, I don't think
that's the long-term reality.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.900
For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly
knows students better than the teacher?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.389
When, for every topic of human endeavor, it's
able to take the best and brightest kids farther

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.750
down the path of knowledge than their teachers
ever could?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.150
I doubt that schools will go away -- after
all they aren't just about learning but are

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.250
also freeing parents to work in the economy
while their feral children are turned into

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.599
civilized adults -- but schools will be radically
different and there will be far fewer teachers

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.270
working in them doing far less.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.479
And while that's not great news for teachers,
it's awesome news for students and society.

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.401
Right now, if you're a student doing poorly
school moves on without you and if you're

00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:57.389
doing well, school holds you back.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.990
In the future, I see every human using a Digital
Aristotle for their whole life, a tutor personalized

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.789
to them, teaching them exactly what they need
to learn when they're best ready for it and

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.999
when that comes, we'll have both a better
educational system and a better society.

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:19.289
I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people
who ran it for bringing me out to California

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.219
to meet up with these awesome people.

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.039
I had more interesting conversations over
the space of a few days than I normally get

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.069
to have over the space of a few months.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.379
If you want to see what the best of education
looks like right now, go check out their channels

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.540
and if you want to hear more on this topic,
I've also put together a playlist of talks

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.160
on this topic I hope you like.
