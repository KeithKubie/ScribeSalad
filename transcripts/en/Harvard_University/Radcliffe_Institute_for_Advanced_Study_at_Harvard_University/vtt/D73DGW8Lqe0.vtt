00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.520
- I would like to
introduce Alicia Martin.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.740
Alicia received
her PhD in genetics

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.020
from Stanford University
and is currently

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.590
working as a research fellow
at the Broad Institute.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.230
She is a population and
statistical geneticist.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.520
And she's very much interested
in how human migration impacts

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.500
health and traits.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.380
So Alicia, I'm keeping
the intro short

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.400
because there's a lot
of interest here today.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.890
So I want the speakers to speak.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.630
And I want you all
to ask questions.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.709
- Hi, everyone.

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:51.250
So I want to start by thanking
the organizers both for giving

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.250
me the vertical assistance
here and for inviting

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.040
me to talk to you guys about
genetic prediction of traits

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.704
and diseases across
globally-diverse populations.

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:01.370
So I'm one of the
local scientists here.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.661
I work primarily at Mass
General Hospital and the Broad

00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.069
Institute.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.360
So first to get started, I
want to start with some very

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.480
fundamental basic facts.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.650
So you've all heard that
human genomes are about 99.9%

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.050
identical.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.530
And this is absolutely the case.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.900
There's very few sites
on the relative scale

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.862
of the entire genome that vary.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.070
However, that said, the
genome is really, really big.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.350
It's greater than 3
billion base pairs,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.300
which means there's
still about four to five

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.820
and a half million sites
that vary across the genome,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.770
depending on which
population you're from.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.020
And every one of your
billions of cells in your body

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.810
has all of these different
variants because they have

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.310
the exact same copies of DNA.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.190
When we're trying to
understand the human genome,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.040
it's also important to recognize
that this heritable variation,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.540
these genetic
differences, account

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.030
for a lot of physical and
biomedical differences

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.630
across these populations.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.630
So looking, for example,
at physical differences

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.190
across populations,
you can easily

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.370
recognize that height and skin
color and many other traits

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.590
are visibly different
across these populations.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.900
And a lot of that is due
to fundamental genetic

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.460
differences.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.820
Additionally, we can think of
different classes of traits.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.250
So we can think of single gene
traits, very simple traits,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.370
for example, like your ability
to digest the sugar and milk

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.400
lactose, your eye
color for example,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.460
and whether or not you have
the disease cystic fibrosis.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.849
But most traits are much
more complex than this.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.390
They're actually
driven by many genes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.431
across a genome or many
variants across a genome,

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.767
maybe tens of thousands,
maybe hundreds of thousands.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:27.600
It's still not entirely
clear how many genes

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.250
are contributing to some traits.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.750
But these are the
kind of the traits

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.550
that we're going to be most
interested in talking about

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.370
for today.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.472
So these include things
like height, weight,

00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:37.305
or many different kinds
of complex diseases.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.460
So when we think
about our genetic risk

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.400
of different diseases and
our genetic complex trait

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.920
distributions, we have
to think about two things

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.700
simultaneously.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.980
We have to think about
the environment--

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.290
so our environmental
distribution here--

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.000
together with our
genetic effects--

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.100
so a genetic effect
distribution here

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.510
across an entire population.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.210
And for each of these, we have
a point in this distribution.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.370
And if we knew
these perfectly, we

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.020
might be able to know
exactly, for example,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.061
what one phenotype would
look like-- for example,

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.685
exactly how tall you might be.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:11.310
But it's also important
to note that we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.729
can use this type of model
to think about binary traits.

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.020
So we can also think about,
for example, whether or not

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.300
you're going to have a
heart attack by using

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.465
the same kinds of models.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.840
So instead of thinking about
this continuous distribution

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.450
here, we might draw a
line in this distribution

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.040
called a liability threshold.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.909
And we might say that above
this liability threshold,

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.450
you're likely to
have a heart attack.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.040
And below this threshold,
you're not likely

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.620
to have a heart attack, say,
over the course of the next 10

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.126
years.

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:39.250
So let's try to make these
models a little bit more

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.860
concrete and think about
the translation of genetics

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.810
into potentially precision
medicine moving forward.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.740
So the first place that I want
to talk about for genetics

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.320
is that this is really
not deterministic.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.040
Our genes are only
one part of the story.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.810
And the environment makes up
a big proportion of the story.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.660
Additionally, traits are
quite variable in how

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.530
heritable they are.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.230
So there is this nature
versus nurture difference

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.700
between many different traits.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.880
So for some traits, there's
quite a bit of heritability.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.730
So you might think of height,
for example, or schizophrenia,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.339
where knowing a lot
about your family

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.630
tells you quite a bit about
how tall you're going to be

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.876
or how likely you are to have
schizophrenia when you grow up.

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:19.209
However, there are a lot of
traits that you can probably

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.450
think of that are not very
heritable, such as how

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.220
likely you are to
vote for any given

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.680
candidate in a political
election, for example,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.530
or some factors that geneticists
are studying like how

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.607
likely you are to develop PTSD.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:35.190
It's also important to note that
polygenic risk scores give us

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.320
sort of a prediction at
an individual level that's

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.610
only accounting for these
genetic differences.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.730
So we're not getting any
proxy for environment.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.310
So throughout this, just
keep that caveat in mind.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.580
So coming back to thinking
about this in translation,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.320
heart disease is
one aspect that I

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.930
think is going to be really
important in the relatively

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.314
near future for thinking
about polygenic risk scores

00:04:55.314 --> 00:04:56.980
as cardiovascular
researchers are really

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.120
trying to push this most
rapidly into health care.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.010
So the first study that
I want to talk about

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.450
is the Framingham Heart Study.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.610
So this was conducted
using thousands

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.000
of participants over the
span of the last few decades.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.280
And one of the most
important findings from this

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.170
was a cardiovascular
disease risk

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.420
model, which is used in
health care all over today.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.550
So this includes a lot of
factors like age, sex, LDL

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.882
and HDL cholesterol,
your blood pressure,

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:25.840
if you have high blood
pressure, whether or not

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.360
you're being treated for
hypertension, whether or not

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.870
you have diabetes, and
if you're smoking or not.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.510
One finding from the study
is that if you smoke,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.581
you have increased
risk of heart disease.

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.080
But notably from
this model, there's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.144
actually no genetic information.

00:05:40.144 --> 00:05:41.560
The researchers
perhaps could have

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.976
used something
like family history

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.567
as a proxy for
some genetic data.

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:46.150
But our genetic data
actually gives us

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.449
a very nice granular
level of insight

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.740
that we can't necessarily
learn from our family history

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.280
alone because our family
history is a little imprecise.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.680
It's also important to note
that there are differences

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.170
in monogenic factors
and polygenic factors

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.510
also at play for
some complex diseases

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.340
even like heart attack risk.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.200
So we know that
polygenic factors

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.990
account for more risk
across the entire population

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.530
than monogenic factors.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.530
So for example, having
a greater than threefold

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.440
risk of cardiovascular
disease is 20 times more

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.331
likely to be driven by polygenic
factors than single genes

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:17.830
alone.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.702
So a recent study of polygenic
risk in cardiovascular disease

00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:26.160
has really made a
lot of headlines.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.710
And I think it's really started
to push the needle for what

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.040
we can potentially do in the
future for genetic risk scores

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.790
in clinical practice.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.330
So as an example from this
study, in this chart here,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.720
you can see on the
x-axis polygenic score

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.820
and the prevalence of
cardiovascular disease

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.380
on the y-axis.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.020
And so you can see
here that there's

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.131
a relationship
between these two,

00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:49.630
where there's a
direct relationship.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.420
Having a higher
polygenic score indicates

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.680
having higher risk of
cardiovascular disease.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.590
But this relationship
is non-linear.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.195
So if you have a polygenic score
for cardiovascular disease,

00:06:58.195 --> 00:06:59.820
not everyone is going
to have high risk

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.970
of cardiovascular disease.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.550
And in fact, it's only going
to be those individuals

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.490
with the most extreme risk that
stand to potentially benefit

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.690
from having this kind
of genetic information.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.460
And then looking at
the entire population,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.560
we can start to make this more
concrete with some numbers

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.140
here.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.830
So for example, about
8% of the population

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.330
is at greater than
threefold risk

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.690
of cardiovascular disease based
on their genetic score alone.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.510
And about 2.3% of
the population is

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.970
at greater than fourfold risk.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.450
And about 0.5% of
the population is

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.110
at greater than fivefold risk.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.260
So this gives us really
fine scale information

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.919
and adds potentially
new information

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.210
to cardiovascular disease
models that's not necessarily

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.876
captured by things like your age
or your sex or your cholesterol

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:41.780
levels.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.572
So the, I think,
place that we're going

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:45.280
is sort of towards
clinical translational

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.050
with a lot of these
polygenic scores.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.970
So these are starting to
become really ubiquitous.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.540
In the All of Us
Research Program spun out

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.400
of the Precision
Medicine Initiative,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.460
this initiative is a
nationwide research program

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.340
that's designed to collect a
million diverse participants.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.280
And it's designed to collect
individual level biological

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.100
and environmental information.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.870
And genetics plays a cornerstone
to that biological translation

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.400
piece.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.950
Additionally, there are
direct-to-consumer companies

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.800
like Color Genomics and
23andMe that are already

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.800
starting to give polygenic
scores out to their customers,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.720
in 23andMes case, to their
millions of consumers.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.310
So some of you in this room
might also already have access

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.350
to a polygenic risk score,
for example, for your BMI.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.520
Color Genomics is giving
out polygenic scores

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.292
to their consumers for heritable
risk of some types of cancers.

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:36.250
And I think the cardiovascular
field has really

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.840
made the biggest push to
translate this into the clinic.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.020
So this quote that
I've put on this slide

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.900
here comes from a perspective
based on the previous study

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.870
that I mentioned in the last
slide, which says "we propose

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.940
the time has come to
incorporate genetic risk

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.500
scores into clinical practice."

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.201
And I think there's a lot of
valid points for the enthusiasm

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:54.700
here.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.569
So I think it's a good time to
start having this conversation.

00:08:57.569 --> 00:08:59.110
Some of those points
include the fact

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.800
that a lot of previous
criticisms for genetic studies

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.097
were simply due to limited
sample sizes and limited power,

00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:08.680
which is no longer the case for
a ton of biomedical phenotypes

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.890
today.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.190
Additionally, those are
relatively cheap tests.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.190
So having a genetic test
done costs about $50

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.720
for the array to be run itself.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.240
And that gives you insights
from birth about your risk

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.300
of many different traits.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.216
So you can learn, for
example, about your risk

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.580
of type 2 diabetes, your
heritable risk of some types

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.590
of cancer, for
psychiatric disorders,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.940
for some immune diseases.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.490
And I can't think of a single
biomarker that gives you

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.270
as much information about so
many different types of traits.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.740
Additionally, a
doctor would never

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.490
consider a polygenic
score on its own.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.940
You can think of this as sort
of an integrative biomarker

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.950
that you would consider
alongside many other factors--

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.530
for example, your
lifestyle, your diet,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.400
how much you exercise, and
in the cardiovascular disease

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.380
case, what your LDL and
HDL cholesterol are.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.000
So with those ideas
in mind, I also

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.160
want to turn to the
explosion in human genetics

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.690
that's been happening lately.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.110
So looking at this plot,
this starts back from 2006

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.304
and goes to present day.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:08.470
And on the y-axis, we have
the number of individuals

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.885
in these genetic studies.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.010
And you can see that these
have expanded massively.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.910
So there are now millions of
individuals regularly partaking

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.360
in genetic studies.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.940
So this has grown
totally enormously.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.320
And this has sort
of been spawned

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.510
on by the completion
of the Human Genome

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.270
Project around the
year 2000, which

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.610
drove an entire industry
of genome technology

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.440
to develop really much cheaper
genetic testing technologies.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.670
However, the picture, if we
look at this, now colored

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.280
by population, is
really not very diverse.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.640
So genetic studies are
vastly Eurocentric.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.310
So this growth has been
overwhelmingly white.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.610
And now I'm showing you the
same exact picture as before.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.310
But I'm also now juxtaposing
it with a global population

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.260
here in billions.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.360
And so you can see that
the red population,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.940
the European populations,
make up about 80%

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.830
of participants in
genetic studies,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.470
contrasting with only about
16% of the global population.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.570
So this is a major
potential issue.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.250
Additionally here, if we
look at the bottom fraction

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.870
here, talking about this speaks
to the fraction of participants

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.500
in these genetic studies.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.430
These are overwhelmingly
European participants,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.180
of course.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.180
But there's a troubling sort
of outlook for this diversity

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.140
here.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.080
So the troubling outlook
is that since about 2014,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.030
the progress in
diversifying efforts

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.380
has been somewhat stalled.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.810
And we're starting
to see a decline

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.860
in the diverse proportion
of genetic studies.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.710
So additionally, I think
it's potentially also worth

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.320
pointing out that there were
some valid reasons for trying

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.710
to include relatively
homogeneous participants

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.230
in genetic studies for
some statistical reasons.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.870
For example, having quite
a bit more diversity

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.120
in genetic studies is
more likely to lead

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.220
to false positive findings
in genetic studies

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.290
or some confounded results.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.710
Additionally, the study
funders, of course, in genetics

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.100
tend to overwhelmingly be from
Europe and in the US, which

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.210
have more of a Eurocentric
population than outside

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.940
of those continents.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.930
However, of course, these
funders, even from the US,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.180
this picture looks
non-representative.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.840
So looking at the US, about
60% of participants living here

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.880
are non-Hispanic
white participants.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.010
And we're not making
up even a proportion

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.680
of the African-American or
Hispanic Latino citizens here.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.290
So the bulk of my work
focuses on this question,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.770
how do bias genetic studies
from an ancestry perspective

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.630
impact the generalizability
of knowledge

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.100
that we're learning
from these studies?

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.660
So I want to be clear
that biology is biology.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.160
If I look at anybody
in this room,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.274
the fundamental basis
of genetic disease

00:12:50.274 --> 00:12:51.940
or the fundamental
basis of these traits

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.440
is the same no
matter who you are.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.714
And so the reason that we're
having some difficulties

00:12:56.714 --> 00:12:58.630
potentially with some
of these genetic studies

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.880
is due to genetic correlation,
not because of genetic causes.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.660
So if we knew the fundamental
genetic cause of disease,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.940
that would by and large
translate very well

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.680
across diverse populations.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.480
But because of
population history

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.040
and because of differences
in correlation structure

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.400
and because our genetic studies
are primarily picking up

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.520
correlations rather
than causation,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.124
we have potential issues with
how well our genetic studies

00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:22.540
are going to
translate, especially

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.070
outside of European
descent populations.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.380
So coming back to a map
similar to some of the work

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.020
that Sriram showed,
we need to think

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.330
about human evolutionary
history to understand

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.490
how well these genetic
differences are

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.420
going to be reflected across
the span of global diversity.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.260
So as Sriram mentioned,
humans originated in Africa

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.610
and then migrated out of Africa
about 50,000 to 100,000 years

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.752
ago.

00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:50.460
They took a subset of
diversity with them

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.120
when they migrated
out of Africa.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.340
This is called a founder effect.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.280
And then migrating out of
Africa, many of our ancestors

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.040
moved into Europe
and into Melanesia

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.310
and then later into East
Asia and the Americas,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.150
each time taking a subset of
genetic diversity with them.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.340
So this human history
is really important

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.464
for thinking about our
genetic differences

00:14:13.464 --> 00:14:14.880
and what this means
for predicting

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.090
risk of different diseases or
predicting complex phenotypes.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.860
So to bring human history and
trait prediction together,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.050
one of the studies
that I took on

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.900
was trying to think about
how polygenic scores or how

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.630
polygenic prediction would
perform across a globally

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.910
diverse set of individuals.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.570
So applying polygenic prediction
to the 1,000 Genomes Project,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.010
which is a large study with
genomes across very large,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.136
globally diverse set of groups,
we looked at polygenics scores

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:46.510
for height, which
you might think

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.030
would be a pretty
simple trait to study.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.920
So from our study,
what you can see

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.870
is that we predicted
European populations

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.040
to be taller than Americans
and South Asian populations.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.050
And we predicted East Asians
and African populations

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.054
to be the shortest.

00:15:00.054 --> 00:15:01.720
And it's not just
that we predicted them

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.890
to be a little bit shorter.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.840
We predicted African
populations to be

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.490
about five standard
deviations shorter

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.320
than European populations.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.090
So just to put some
empirical numbers on,

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.080
this if a European man is, on
average, about five feet nine

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.600
inches tall and a
standard deviation there

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.920
is about three inches, if
we applied these differences

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.920
in Africa, that would
mean that we would predict

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.500
the average male to be about
four and a half feet tall,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.050
or about yea high, which
I already needed a stage

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.060
to help me raise me vertically.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.930
So clearly, that's not in
line with reality here.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.390
And that indicates that we
have some pretty big problems

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.700
if we're trying to
translate these scores

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.200
and think about
cross-population analyses.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.300
So thinking about
this in another way,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.460
one of my colleagues,
Robert Maier,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.050
conducted the same
type of analysis

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.850
with much more
granular populations.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.640
So here is a global map showing
what height prediction would

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.880
look like in a global context
for many different populations

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.700
using, again, the
giant consortium study.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.800
So this study is aptly named.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.310
This study combined
height and genetic data

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.620
across hundreds of
thousands of individuals.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.810
And the biological
findings fundamentally

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.122
are still quite valid.

00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:11.080
But if we try to construct
a genetic prediction

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.150
score across all these
diverse populations,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.980
you recapitulate
what I had seen,

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.160
which is that in
Africa and East Asia,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.340
we predict these populations
to be shorter than anywhere

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.860
else in the globe.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.140
However, if we turn to
a different data source

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.570
to build these polygenic
predictions, namely

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.691
the UK Biobank, we see
a different finding.

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:33.940
So the UK Biobank, I just
want to mention a little bit

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.630
about it.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.240
It's this very large study
that was conducted rally

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.590
rather homogeneously.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.910
So it's all conducted in the UK.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.720
And all individuals were
phenotyped at the same time.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.450
So everyone had their height
measured all at the same time.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.610
All samples used the exact
same collection criteria.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.810
And additionally,
population stratification

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.720
was accounted for more
thoroughly and consistently

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.280
within the study.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.890
So what you can see quite
visibly and easily here

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.620
is that we don't predict any
populations to necessarily

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.240
be taller or shorter.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.099
But we also know that
this is out of step

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.710
with what we see globally,
where we actually

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.339
do see some populations that are
taller or shorter than others,

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.192
and that perhaps some of
this is due to genetics.

00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:17.900
So this really indicates
that our methods

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.260
for comparing populations
through polygenic studies

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.690
are really totally inadequate.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.540
I would challenge anyone who
would say otherwise right now.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.670
But I would also say
that perhaps this would

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.940
be a useful technology even
if we can't necessarily

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.160
compare across populations,
because just knowing

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.930
your score within a
population can still

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.910
have some biomedical value.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.550
If I am, for example, an
individual of European descent

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.200
and I know that my
risk is much higher

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.890
for some complex disease, I can
still potentially act on that,

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.810
as can anyone else.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.620
So combining these
questions, how transferable

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.390
is polygenic prediction, keeping
a lot of these factors in mind,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.270
we assess how well polygenic
prediction transferred

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.570
across populations by looking
at a bunch of previous studies

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.060
that had compared
polygenic score accuracy.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.630
So these studies
combine polygenic scores

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.450
that had used the largest
existing data to compute

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.370
accuracy within
European populations

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.020
and in non-European populations.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.150
And because they were using
the largest studies set

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.400
available to them, this means
they were overwhelmingly

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.430
using European genetic studies.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.702
So they looked at a
wide array of traits.

00:18:25.702 --> 00:18:26.910
They looked at schizophrenia.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.220
They looked at BMI,
educational attainment.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.320
And they looked at height.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.620
And what they found is that
relative to European accuracy,

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.810
East Asian accuracy
or East Asian risk

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.560
was predicted about less
than half as accurately as

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.237
in European populations.

00:18:44.237 --> 00:18:46.320
Additionally, when they
looked at African-American

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.810
populations, they saw that risk
was predicted a little less

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.850
than a quarter as accurately.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.890
So these are really
truly staggering numbers

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.990
if we're trying to
think about translating

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.270
polygenic risk to the clinic.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.640
Can you imagine, for
example, if you had,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.460
across all drugs, that
they worked about four

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.530
to fivefold better in
European populations

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.480
than in African-American
populations?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.920
This would be a huge issue.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.220
It's also notable, I think,
that this is a big problem

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.920
to address because polygenic
risk scores have the potential

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.050
to improve health
outcomes for everybody,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.550
not just European
populations, if we

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.960
can start to really
address these problems.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.780
For example, we could
think about using

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.060
this as a biomarker for
psychiatric disorders, where

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.690
there actually are no biomarkers
that are really easily

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.650
accessible today because of
the inaccessibility of brain

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.580
tissue.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.190
Additionally, this could
help potentially bring down

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.490
the cost of clinical trials
by enabling drug companies

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.890
to target individuals at
higher risk and a higher

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.810
biological likelihood
of having some event.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.320
So there is a pretty
predictable basis

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.300
of these staggering
genetic risk disparities.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.120
So we know in theory
and simulation

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.930
and now empirically that
prediction accuracy decays

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.180
as a function of genetic
divergence between the study

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.030
population and the population
we're predicting in.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.100
This is simply due to
population history.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.460
And if we look at where
humans originated in Africa,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.617
we would estimate
that because of how

00:20:08.617 --> 00:20:10.450
diverged they are from
European populations,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.850
we would predict the worst
in African populations

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.630
compared to elsewhere based on
where our bias studies exist.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.120
This is partially because
genetic studies are best

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.400
powered to discover
common variants.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.370
So if we're studying European
populations over and over

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.740
again, we're missing some of
the low-hanging discoveries

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.930
in non-European populations.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.180
Additionally, we're
identifying correlations

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.580
in our genetic studies,
not causal variance.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.070
And the correlation
structure of the genome

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.900
differs depending on
your population history.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900
And then there are more
complicated differences,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.190
like environment and
natural selection.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.647
So if I'm trying to predict
using a healthy cohort

00:20:45.647 --> 00:20:47.230
into a disease cohort,
there are going

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.810
to be some challenges because
of environmental differences

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.200
there.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.140
So how do we make progress
towards parity now?

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.960
We need a lot of big approaches
for these challenging problems.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.040
So I think one problem that
my colleagues and I are really

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.930
working to move the
needle on is developing

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.600
new statistical methods that
consider this correlation

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.550
structure within
and between pairs

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.302
of globally-diverse populations.

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.510
And I have a lot of hope
that our statistical methods

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.200
are going to help us
make some inroads.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.770
But there's going to be
additional problems, I think,

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.370
in that our predictions
are only going

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.453
to be as good as our data.

00:21:19.453 --> 00:21:20.740
So this is a big problem.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.370
It's really going to require
having more diverse large scale

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.330
datasets.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.850
So this needs to come
from funding sources

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.610
from the top down basically.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.450
And we need to ensure
that data access is

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.970
equitable across
pairs of populations.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.310
We also need to ensure
that existing GWAS summary

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.840
statistics or
genetic studies are

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.100
available across a more
diverse set of participants

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.044
and that we have incremental
releases for diverse studies.

00:21:45.044 --> 00:21:47.460
And then we also need capacity
building for global regions

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.272
that are newer to
genetic analysis as well.

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:52.230
So I'll stop there and
thank you for listening.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.987
And I'm happy to take questions.

00:21:54.987 --> 00:21:57.482
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.570
- Thank you for a
really fascinating talk.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.340
You're probably familiar
with the technique

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.297
of Mendelian randomization.

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:13.463
- Closer to the mic, please.

00:22:13.463 --> 00:22:14.629
We can't hear you back here.

00:22:14.629 --> 00:22:16.470
- One inch from the mic.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.440
- One inch from the
mic-- how's that?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.100
So I was asking about
the technique that's

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.780
used in causal inference of
Mendelian randomization, where

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.190
genetic traits and
their random assortment

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:36.230
are used to make inference
about, for example, exposures

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.310
and disease and the
likelihood of the disease.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.610
How does this issue of lack of
data from certain populations

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.370
affect that kind of
inference in particular?

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:47.870
- Yeah.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.828
That's a good question.

00:22:48.828 --> 00:22:51.380
So Mendelian randomization
is a great tool

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:57.320
for detecting causal variance
in genetic analysis and causal

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.780
relationships between
pairs of phenotypes.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.590
So it would be great
if we could uncover

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.220
the fundamental causal variance
for prediction analysis

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.070
because that would take away
a lot of this correlation

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.547
not causation issue.

00:23:11.547 --> 00:23:13.130
Unfortunately,
Mendelian randomization

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.963
also requires that you
have a really, really

00:23:14.963 --> 00:23:17.120
strong, precise
instrument for uncovering

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.560
those causal relationships.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.840
And the vast majority of
our genetic instrument

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.350
are relatively weak effects that
we're not really confident in.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.840
So Mendelian
randomization is going

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.970
to be a really important
tool for understanding

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.490
the causal relationships
between pairs of traits

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.175
but not necessarily for
building more useful predictors.

00:23:35.175 --> 00:23:36.050
Does that make sense?

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.650
- I have a question, Alicia.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.790
So I can share in the
enthusiasm to want

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.290
to bring these prediction
kits to the market.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.860
But are we getting a little
ahead of ourselves in terms of

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.580
are we outpacing the clinic?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.080
We want to bring
them to the clinic.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.910
But we're outpacing.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.810
How will they impact
clinical management?

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.960
I mean, clearly we're outpacing
the treatment options.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.030
So I wanted to know if you can--

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.920
- Yeah, absolutely--
that's a great question.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.370
And it's a really great point.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.150
So I think genetics
in general is not

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.930
super useful for clinical
translation today.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.239
But I wouldn't necessarily
bet against human genetics

00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:24.780
over the course of
the coming decade.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.154
So I think it's important to
start thinking about it now.

00:24:27.154 --> 00:24:29.870
Because we've seen over the
course of the past decade

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.930
that our studies have gone from
being hundreds of individuals

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.960
at a time being studied to now
even millions of individuals

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.054
being studied at a time.

00:24:37.054 --> 00:24:38.720
So I think it's sort
of a matter of time

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.340
before this is
clinically translated.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.380
And I think to head off
some of these issues,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.860
we really need to
think about them

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.060
now if we're trying to make
sure that we have equitable

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.390
translation and don't exacerbate
existing health disparities.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.080
- OK.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.600
Yes?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.100
- Thanks.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.000
Quick question-- these GWAS
studies have been around

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.990
for a few years.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.590
And the earlier studies
were shorter read length

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.790
and much more expensive.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.952
The first one cost $3 billion.

00:25:04.952 --> 00:25:07.350
So obviously, the
disparities issue--

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.110
have you ever tried to quantify
what it would cost to catch up?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.190
So the tests are much,
much cheaper now.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.050
And you can do a
whole genome scan

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.230
for what it costs you a lot
more to do even a partial exome.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:23.057
So if you put a number on it,
maybe somebody would donate.

00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:24.390
- That's a really good question.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.235
And it's a really good point.

00:25:25.235 --> 00:25:26.860
One thing that we're
trying to think of

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.109
is what the costs of
these health disparities

00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.400
would potentially translate to.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.775
But I think your
question is more

00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:35.840
about what would it take
to even these burdens

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.060
and generally do these
studies at as large a scale

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.932
and many different phenotypes?

00:25:39.932 --> 00:25:42.140
So I it depends on which
phenotype you're looking at.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.806
Like if you're looking
at schizophrenia,

00:25:43.806 --> 00:25:46.730
let's say, the largest
European cohorts currently

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.150
have 150,000
participants, about half

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.700
of those of which are cases
and half of which are controls.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.030
So 150,000 individuals at about
$50 a genotyping array plus

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.920
some analytical costs, it's
a hugely expensive problem.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.440
But I think we need to start
pushing the needle forward

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.780
to be including these.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.640
- And the very last question.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.290
- I love genetics.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.510
But your first slide
started out with

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.220
environmental contributions
and genetic contributions.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.290
So how are you going to deal
with the fact that some things,

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.600
it doesn't matter what you do?

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.520
Your genes are your genes.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.920
But other things,
you know, you haven't

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.680
accounted for the
environmental aspects,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.230
especially in things that are
going into precision medicine.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.730
- Yeah.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.938
That's a great point as well.

00:26:32.938 --> 00:26:34.760
So I wanted to make
sure that the point was

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.870
very clear that genetics
is not deterministic.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.075
So especially for a lot of
these much more complex traits,

00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:41.450
there is always
something you can

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.460
do to tweak your
environment to reduce

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.640
your risk of overall disease.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.391
For the traits that
are not super genetic,

00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:50.223
I don't think genetic
risk scores are really

00:26:50.223 --> 00:26:52.610
going to add that much value
to a clinical translational.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.280
It's more the traits that
do have a pretty significant

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.113
heritable component
that we're going to make

00:26:57.113 --> 00:27:00.790
the most inroads clinically.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.510
- Perfect.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.470
Thank you, Alicia.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.520
