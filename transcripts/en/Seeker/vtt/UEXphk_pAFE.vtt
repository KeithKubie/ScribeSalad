00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.380
Vaccines help our immune system defend against
bacterial and viral infections but soon they

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.820
may help fight off a completely different
type of illness: Heroin addiction.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.450
Drug addiction is usually characterized by
craving, tolerance (the need for more drugs

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.280
over time) and withdrawal.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.430
These three factors work together to drive
the need for more heroin.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.500
Addictions are hard to break.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.820
Don’t believe me?

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.560
Try giving up coffee in the mornings or even
just cutting back to one cup a day and let

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.160
me know how that works for you.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.509
I betcha get a headache.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.370
Well heroin withdrawal feels much, much worse
than coming off of caffeine and symptoms include

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.740
nausea, diarrhea, pain, anxiety, and muscle
spasms that some believe inspired the phrase

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.230
“kicking the habit” .

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.560
Staying away from heroin while wracked with
withdrawal symptoms is one of the most brutal

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.019
challenges in fighting addiction and the potential
for relapse is high.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.949
Recently, scientists at The Scripps Research
Institute announced development of a clinically

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.060
viable vaccine to heroin.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.490
Basically, the vaccine taps into the body’s
own defense system, training the immune system

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.039
to recognize heroin and produce anti-heroin
antibodies.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.950
After vaccination, exposure to the drug would
cause a surge in anti-heroin antibodies that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.100
would bind and eliminate the drug before it
could activate the receptors responsible for

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
its euphoric high.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.280
Hopefully, this would discourage vaccinated
users from taking heroin because they wouldn’t

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.730
feel the “high”.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.920
This vaccine has only been tested in rodents
and non-human primates, but if it were approved

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.420
for use in human patients, it could prevent
heroin addiction in first time users and stave

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.150
off relapse in patients who have already suffered
through heroin withdrawal.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.550
Additionally, the vaccine could be used in
combination with buprenorphine and methadone,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.530
two weak opioid compounds used to manage craving
and withdrawal symptoms, to improve the outcomes

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.110
of patients experiencing heroin withdrawal.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.170
Heroin abuse is a growing problem in the United
States.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.390
Almost 13,000 deaths were attributed to heroin
overdose in 2015 and the number is growing

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.560
every year.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.980
Heroin is considered part of the opioid epidemic
because when some of the 12.5 million people

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.000
abusing prescription drugs lose access to
legal opiates, they turn to more potent street

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.220
drugs like heroin to maintain their high.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.959
If approved, therapies like this new vaccine
may act as internal reinforcement for patients

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.609
who are seeking help for drug addiction.

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.519
And the fact that there is a medical treatment
for their condition may help patients and

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.350
those around them identify addiction as a
medical disease as opposed to a failing of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.170
self-control, which could shift all of our
thinking to remove stigma, alleviate shame,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.670
and provide hope.
