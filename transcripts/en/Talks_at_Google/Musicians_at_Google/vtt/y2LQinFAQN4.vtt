Host: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.467
Welcome to a very exciting
Musicians@Google event,

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.700
and before I’m actually gonna say more,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.400
I wanna show you this.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:57.266
♪ [music playing]

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:02.700
[applause]

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.333
Hi. I hope I’m gonna make it brief.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.333
I was thinking about soundtracks.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:14.100
The bad soundtrack can make a movie much,
much worse. Mediocre soundtrack—

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.834
you know it’s just gonna be there in
the background.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.767
A good soundtrack is gonna
make a movie a little bit better.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.266
A great soundtrack is gonna define
the movie.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.500
An amazing soundtrack is gonna
define the genre.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.734
If you really, really like it,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.633
if you have a really, really
incredible soundtrack

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:32.066
it’s gonna make you wish your life
is a soundtrack of its own.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:36.467
Now when you think about Bear’s Battlestar
Galactica soundtrack it’s really

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:37.734
in a league of its own

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:40.734
because, all of the these things aside,

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.500
it actually became a part of the series,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.967
just integral part of what
Battlestar Gallactica was about.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.667
And it shattered a couple of fourth walls
in the process

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:54.700
and I’m sure there were many more people
than me that it left speechless.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.633
And if you look at
other projects by Bear McCreary

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:02.000
you know he did the TV show Trauma

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.033
and he incorporated actual helicopters
and ambulances in the soundtrack.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.867
For Human Target, which is another show
Bear’s scoring right now

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:16.033
he routinely goes out and, and has
50–, 60–people orchestra

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.667
which is unprecedented for modern TV.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:23.300
And the whole story of videogame
Dark Void which is a, Bear just went

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.700
and did the 8-bit version of the tune

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.367
and it kind of started a videogame
of its own.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:34.200
Maybe he’ll talk about it a little bit more.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.433
Bear composes, but he also plays piano,
he plays accordion,

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:42.367
he actually writes lyrics in all
sorts of different languages,

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:47.667
and I think I even saw him sing once or twice.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.367
But whatever he does he approaches with so much
enthusiasm and passion

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:55.533
that I think we are all very lucky
to have him here,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:57.333
talk about what he does;

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:01.834
and maybe play something
if we can convince him to.

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:04.133
And this is where my original introduction ends,

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:07.800
but we’re actually really, really lucky
because we also have Raya Yarbrough,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.100
I don’t know where she is there,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.000
who’s an incredibly talented vocalist.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300
And you think you don’t know her,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.834
but if we can convince her to sing with Bear

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:21.266
you will kind of quickly realize where
do you know that gorgeous voice from.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:26.700
So that’s the end of my thing here.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.066
Please give it up for 
Bear McCreary and Raya Yarbrough.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:38.200
[applause]

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.166
Bear McCreary: Thank you, thank you.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.333
That was a pretty cool introduction.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:46.500
I don’t know how to follow that exactly.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.300
This is Raya Yarbrough.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.900
[applause]

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.233
So what we’re gonna,
before we do anything else-

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:01.266
Raya Yarbrough: Wanna, like, get you started.

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:03.600
Bear: Yeah. You were,
you were gonna ask me some things.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.000
Raya: Okay.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There’s a lot stuff that Bear did before
Battlestar Galactica, so—

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Why don’t we begin at the beginning.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Bear: Grab the mike.

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:27.400
Raya: Is this on?
Oh, it did it by itself.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.200
It’s the magic of Google.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.667
Okay, so I guess I’ll just,
oh, you’re miked, so you’re all good.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:37.934
So why don’t you tell the good
people how you started off in music,

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:39.266
when you started, how.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.100
Bear: Well,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.800
you were,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.633
you were clever enough to include
the Megaman clip in there.

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:55.934
Actually, 8-bit videogames were part of
the first musical experience I ever had.

00:04:55.934 --> 00:05:01.367
And the combination of videogames
and movies and TV that I grew up on,

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.467
is what inspired me to become a musician.

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:10.433
And as I was growing up, I listened
to nothing but movie music.

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:16.934
It’s all I ever wanted to do and really
I never considered for a moment

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.767
that I would do anything else.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:23.800
So I’m really lucky that it kind of worked
out because I didn’t have a backup plan.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.600
And so I started—

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.934
I started writing my own music
when I was about, I don’t know, maybe ten;

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:36.667
and I sucked; I was not working.

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:41.600
But I just kept trying and I kept trying
and I kept listening to the pieces of music

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.400
that I was really responding to,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.200
and, I don’t know, somewhere
in high school I started—

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.600
I started to kind of figure
a few things out.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.367
And I started scoring little movies that
I was making and my friends were making

00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:01.333
and trying to see if I could connect
music that I heard in my head

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:05.166
with the pictures that I was,
the pictures that I was dealing with,

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.600
and the images that I was dealing with.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.900
And the answer was – no, I couldn’t,
at first.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.867
But then I did it again and
I kept working at it,

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:16.767
and finally started to kind of find some,

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:20.333
I don’t know, I don’t wanna say
my own kind of inner voice,

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:24.000
but I did find some things that I
was able to do and gravitate towards.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.633
And then I,

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:28.400
so then I ended up the 
USC Thornton School of Music

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.233
where I actually learned how to
do music on a more formal level.

00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.467
I didn’t have a lot of training up
until that point except for—

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:39.100
I studied classical piano for many years.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.867
But that was sort of my musical
education was formalized there,

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:49.467
but it really started 
by watching a bunch of movies

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.000
and playing videogames
more than anything else.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.033
Raya: Yeah. I think,
and if I can weigh in here just

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:56.500
’cause I’ve happen to know you sort of well,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.567
as your music has developed through all the
films and TV shows and things you’ve done,

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.467
you’ve, I’ve heard you saying
that you reflected back

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:07.166
to music that your wrote when you were 15 or 16,

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.967
and you realized, “you know, I kind
of did have a voice, even then.”

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.300
Bear: Yeah. That’s funny
I can find pieces when,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.100
that I wrote in high school

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.767
and there’s a piece actually,
when I wrote the big theme for Dark Void

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:20.734
I played it for a buddy of mine and he’s
like, “You wrote that in high school.”

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:21.734
I’m like, “What are you talkin’ about?”

00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:23.667
And he goes, “You know that one thing?”
and I went back and thought about it

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:25.834
and I went back to actually go and listen to it
and was like, “Oh, yeah.”

00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:29.533
I mean it’s not as good,
but there was like all these little,

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:32.333
these little things that I was kind
of stumbling upon in high school

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:35.100
and then when I got this Dark Void
videogame I was able to kind of

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.900
draw on all these different influences.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.900
And there’s pieces I wrote that
sound kind of like Battlestar, I mean,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.133
other things that I’ve done.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.266
Raya: And listening to your older
music and to music that you’re doing

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.667
like right now, it’s funny,

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.266
it’s almost like from your high school time

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.700
it was the seed and it grew into
this forest

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.633
which was Battlestar Galactica and everything.

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.834
And now it’s almost like you’re kind of
harkening back to some of your original–

00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:59.333
could you talk about some of
your original inspirations,

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.667
some of the people who influenced you
from way, way back–

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:06.333
Bear: The first film score
that I noticed was

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.166
Back To The Future by Alan Silvestri.

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.033
Anybody remember that score?

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:10.633
Yeah.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:12.700
Raya: Somebody saying—
Bear: That one.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.266
No, it’s weird.
I talk to people and they are like,

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:16.100
they’ve never even heard of the movie sometimes.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.734
It’s just one of those franchises.
[laughter]

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:20.900
I know. That’s when I was like,
“I feel old.”

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.433
You can talk to a perfectly formed
human being who was born

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:27.133
after Back To The Future 3 came out.

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:30.200
So, yeah, it’s weird.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.133
That was one of the first ones
that caught my ear.

00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:36.834
And, simultaneously, it was the same year,

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:41.166
Pee-wee’s Big Adventure by Danny Elfman
really struck a chord with me

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:45.633
and that was – starting after that
point my parents would notice that

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.467
any time that I went and saw a movie,

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.867
I would identify the composer within the
first five or ten seconds of the movie.

00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:53.734
And I was six, seven, eight years old.

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.633
And then the credits would come up
and they’re like, “God damn, he’s right.”

00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:01.367
And so they kind of knew, they could
kind of see where I was going.

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:07.433
Then in, I also, as a kid, really loved
the music of John Williams.

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:13.266
Temple Of Doom and Empire Strikes Back
had a big impression on me for sure.

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.233
And then it was in
high school that I discovered–

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.400
I had this sort of epiphany

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.567
when I discovered the film music of
Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein,

00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:27.200
Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota and Ennio Morricone.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.633
I think of these five guys as the people that I,

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.633
I’m influenced by the most,
and the reason I say that is

00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:37.300
that I realize that everybody that
I adored was borrowing from them.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.200
And I would go and discover
these scores from the 50s

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.533
that sounded like the scores
from the late 80s and 90s

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:44.300
that I was falling in love with.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.000
Not in a bad way, I mean,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.500
just the influence was there
and that they were innovating,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.400
I mean stuff like Herrmann’s
The Day The Earth Stood Still

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.767
or Elmer Bernstein’s 
To Kill A Mockingbird,

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:58.333
which if you put that
in a movie trailer today,

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:02.367
I don’t think anyone would think
that that music was 55 years old.

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:06.867
So it’s, that was
a big sort of epiphany for me

00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:09.233
when I realized how far back
this tradition goes

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:14.300
and started studying very closely
what those guys were doing.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.233
Raya: Can you say
a little about Elmer?

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:18.500
Bear: I can.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.834
I knew Elmer,

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.900
I met him when I was in high school and—

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.867
Raya: It’s Elmer Bernstein.
Bear: Yeah.

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:30.266
Elmer Bernstein who, who did so many
of the most important film scores

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:31.600
to ever be written;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.500
The Ten Commandments,
The Great Escape,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.400
To Kill A Mockingbird,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.066
The Magnificent Seven,

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.000
Animal House,
Ghost Busters,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.767
the list goes on and on.

00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:42.333
I met him when I was in high school
and I played him a bunch of my music

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:48.500
’cause we had a mutual friend through
this weirdest coincidence in the world.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.734
And he was really impressed with,

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:56.533
I think the energy that I had,
and the amount of stuff I was writing

00:10:56.533 --> 00:10:58.567
and he asked if I was formally trained,

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:01.767
although I’m sure in hindsight
he knew that I wasn’t.

00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:06.066
And he really kind of took me
under his wing.

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:09.967
And when I came down to
Los Angeles to go to school,

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:13.100
I started working for him and one of the,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.533
no, I guess the first professional
job I ever had was at his,

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:19.934
at his, at his house,

00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:21.000
his estate.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.834
And he was gone for the summer and he goes,

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:25.100
“Hey, like, can you housesit
the place

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.133
and then I’ll give
you a film to orchestrate over the summer.”

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:30.333
And I was like—
[laughter]

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.900
“Yeah, let me check my schedule.” You know.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.400
So actually a quick side story.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.133
I was, I had to,

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:38.000
I had to dog sit—
he had these dogs—

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.333
and you had to give them these pills
and stuff, and I’m like, “Alright, sure.”

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:43.500
I did not tell him that since I was
a kid I had this phobia of dogs,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.500
’cause when I was a little
kid I got attacked by a dog.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.433
And I was like, “Alright, I just,
I just gotta get over this.

00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:50.266
How big can this dog be?”
Irish Wolfhound. Okay. [laughter]

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:53.233
It is this big,
I mean on all fours.

00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:54.467
It comes up to here on me.

00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:56.934
And in fact,
when it was a puppy they,

00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:58.233
they had to put it on downers

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:02.133
because it would jump up on Elmer
and it’s like eight feet high.

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:04.333
So I get over there and I
see this dog and it was like,

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.934
“Okay. Let’s…”

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:11.066
My dog, my fear of dogs is of course
non-existent anymore after that summer.

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:17.000
Anyway, so that was a huge influence
on me because I spent the whole summer

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.467
re-orchestrating a film score
called Kings Of The Sun.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:22.266
This was a movie starring Yul
Brynner that came out in 1968.

00:12:22.266 --> 00:12:24.600
I think it’s on DVD,
no, it is on DVD now.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.900
At the time it wasn’t on DVD,
it wasn’t on TV,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.934
it wasn’t screened anywhere,

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:30.600
it had had a theatrical run
and that was it.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.400
And it was still one of the most highly
sought-after scores that Elmer had written.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.700
Fans were writing him and saying,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.834
“Oh, when are you gonna perform
that music?

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:39.934
Is it gonna be on a soundtrack album?”

00:12:39.934 --> 00:12:41.633
And the recordings had been destroyed,

00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:42.700
the scores had been destroyed,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.400
because at that point in time
the studio would keep everything.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.033
And in fact he would tell me stories of
sometimes he’d go to music departments

00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:53.233
to meet a director and he would look at
someone’s writing on a scrap of paper like,

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:56.233
just notes, they have a stack of old
scrap paper and you’d flip it over

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.567
and it’s a handwritten Jerry Goldsmith
score from like the late 70s.

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:00.900
It was “Oh, there it is.”

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.633
But anyway, so who knows where his
score is now somebody’s laundry list or,

00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:07.867
or grocery list or something.

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.033
So I re-orchestrated this whole film.

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:11.433
So I spent the summer,

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:15.800
he had his handwritten sketches
were literally all that remained—

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.200
and so I was able to go through
and recreate the orchestration

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.667
and I didn’t have a recording
or anything to go by.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:28.066
And that taught me more than any program, any class,

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:29.266
any teacher could have ever taught me,

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:35.000
because I was just was able to see
exactly how the germs of the ideas

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.266
became this finished score.

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:38.467
And in fact,

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:40.433
one of the other things that
I did for him was,

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:43.367
was, I sort of organized his
whole closet full of archives

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:49.166
which is now in a collection
at the USC Music Library.

00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:51.467
But at the time it was just
a closet full of stuff,

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:53.233
and I was going through it with him

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.133
and there were all these things
that he didn’t wanna keep.

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:56.967
He was just gonna, he’s like,
“No. Throw all that stuff out.”

00:13:56.967 --> 00:13:59.467
And I said, “I can’t,

00:13:59.467 --> 00:14:01.233
I don’t know why, but I can’t
throw this out.”

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:04.233
It’s like a stack of parts
from the day they recorded

00:14:04.233 --> 00:14:06.500
the cues on To Kill A Mockingbird.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.533
He was gonna throw them out.

00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:09.734
These are the actual parts
that the musicians read from.

00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:11.734
They’re in my closet now and
I don’t know what to do with them,

00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:14.066
but I was like 
“Do you mind if I keep these?”

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:16.266
And one of the things that he was
gonna throw out that’s on my wall

00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:19.600
that I look at every day
is a handwritten sketch

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.834
of the main title in The Great Escape.

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:27.133
And you can see how he thought
of it and before he wrote this,

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.433
that melody didn’t exist.

00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:31.166
I mean like,
I’ll play it real quick.

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:32.967
I mean this kind of blows,
blows my mind, right?

00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:34.767
That he wrote this—

00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:46.133
♪ [playing upbeat piano]

00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:47.734
I mean, everybody knows this tune, right?

00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:50.467
I mean you think it’s like
an old American folk tune.

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:51.133
But he wrote it.

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:56.500
And, I just thought before this piece of
paper existed that song did not exist.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.667
And when he was gonna throw
that out I was just like,

00:14:58.667 --> 00:15:01.433
“No, no way, can I, I gotta,
I gotta keep this.”

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:06.100
And so he had a great impact
on me creatively,

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.667
professionally,
but also personally because I,

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:10.400
I got to spend so much time with him

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.767
and, see that it is possible to
be successful in the movie business

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:19.934
and the music business, and not
turn out to be a big asshole.

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:23.567
[laughter] So that was, that
was an eye opener for sure.

00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:26.400
Raya: So in the steps
of not becoming a big asshole,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.367
shortly after that—

00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:28.333
Bear: Oh, I am a big asshole.

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.467
I failed at that. [laughter]

00:15:29.467 --> 00:15:31.033
Raya: Well, but you grew into it.

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:31.433
Bear: Yeah, so—

00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:33.667
Raya: Of course the four
seasons of Battlestar Gallactica.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:34.400
Bear: Yes.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.934
Raya: So, so let’s,
let’s talk about this.

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:39.533
Bear: Um…
Raya: How did you,

00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:41.934
how did you get into Battlestar
and, yeah.

00:15:41.934 --> 00:15:47.767
Bear: Battlestar
was my first job out of school.

00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:49.166
I, I got it,

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:50.533
the first job that I got,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.633
I was,

00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:53.667
I graduated,

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.166
I had nothing going on,

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:57.166
I was actually even,

00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:01.934
I crashed at Elmer’s place, at his
Santa Monica house, for a month.

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:05.433
So I could score a student film
with a budget of zero dollars.

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:07.100
But I said, it was like,
“I gotta finish this movie.”

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.800
So I was like literally about to go

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.867
hand in applications at grocery stores
and video stores—

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:13.834
Raya: There was florist store—

00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:16.433
Bear: Florist. Yeah, florist,
I could have done that.

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.033
Raya: He makes
brilliant flower arrangements.

00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:18.767
Bear: I could have been a florist.

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:20.133
Raya: If you like his music,
you should see…

00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:20.700
Bear: Yeah.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.500
Raya: …his flower arrangements.
[laughter]

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.166
Bear: But I got a job
working for Richard Gibbs.

00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:28.266
Richard Gibbs is a film composer

00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:31.667
and former keyboardist
of Oingo Boingo

00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:35.967
which is another story for later on, I guess.

00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:38.734
And, so I got a job working for him

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:41.967
and I was his assistant.

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:43.233
I kept the studio running.

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:47.934
I converted all his computers
to the new sampling software

00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:51.500
which has since become a dinosaur
and I’m the only one who uses it now.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.667
But at the time, it was new.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:57.700
And I also wrote a bunch of cues
and worked with the producers

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.233
and helped him meet his deadlines.

00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:02.533
And he,

00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:05.367
so I worked there about a year,
and at the end of that year

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:08.667
he landed the Battlestar Galactica mini-series.

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:13.700
So he asked me to come on board
and help him finish this pilot,

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.567
it was essentially a backdoor pilot.

00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:19.967
And we had to write three,

00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:23.900
almost three hours of music, maybe two and
a half hours of music, in about 14 days.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.800
So it was an incredible turnaround 
and on top of that,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.700
the producer had this really
wacky idea of using taiko drums

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.166
and that was kind of all that he said.
He was like, “We like taiko drums.”

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:34.867
[laughter]

00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:38.033
And I was like, “Okay. I don’t know
what that means.”

00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:42.700
And so actually in that creative process,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:48.033
I worked very closely with Richard
and also with,

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.233
with the director Michael Rymer,

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:51.867
and so when we got through the mini-series,

00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:55.500
and we did use a hefty amount
of taiko drums.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.800
But also a lot of,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.767
there was a lot of orchestral writing and,

00:17:59.767 --> 00:18:04.900
and a very sort of ambient non-thematic approach.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.100
And this was because the producers
felt very strongly

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.000
that they didn’t want the kind of Star Wars
or Star Trek approach to their mini-series.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.633
In fact,

00:18:15.633 --> 00:18:20.100
if you think about it in comparing the new,
the mini-series to the old show,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.166
the thing that is the most
different is the music.

00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:24.300
I think more than anything else.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.066
it’s the one part of the old
show that was completely,

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:30.433
well, except for the Casino Planet,
that was dropped too. [laughter]

00:18:30.433 --> 00:18:32.633
Alright. So there were two things:
the music and the Casino Planet.

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:33.900
Raya: Boxey,
don’t forget about Boxey.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.967
Bear: We had Boxey in the pilot.

00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:36.200
Raya: You did?
Bear: We did.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.300
And in season one they dropped him on his ass.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.867
Raya: That’s right.
[laughs]

00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:41.266
Bear: But yeah, he
was there briefly.

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:43.734
It was the dagget
that was also missing.

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:44.700
Alright, there
were a few things missing.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.633
Raya: There was
a dagget at one point, remember?

00:18:47.633 --> 00:18:48.300
Bear: Oh, yeah.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.633
Raya: Yeah. I don’t know
what scene it is,

00:18:49.633 --> 00:18:52.500
but if you look at one scene you can see
a dagget flying out of the airlock.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.266
Bear: Yeah. It’s true.
There is a dagget and—

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:58.000
And, I think the Starship Enterprise
and the Millennium Falcon

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.433
are in the fleet in a couple of shots.

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:01.066
Raya: Oh, that’s right.
[laughter]

00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:03.667
Bear: Yeah. A bunch of nerds
worked on the show. [laughter]

00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:09.600
So, but anyway, so long,
long story medium-long,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.734
the pilot is relatively
successful and it goes to series.

00:19:15.734 --> 00:19:21.166
And at that point Richard needs
to go on to feature films.

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:24.934
He’s got his slate is full with feature
films and he can’t take on a weekly series

00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:28.567
that would require the amount of
original music that Battlestar required.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:33.066
So, of course, the producers
didn’t wanna hire me at all.

00:19:33.066 --> 00:19:37.200
And while they were off
looking for other people,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.233
there was one deadline coming up
which was for this episode “33,”

00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:42.133
which was the first episode aired.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.734
So they go, “Alright, well, you can take,

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:47.266
you can do this while we’re
off looking for somebody else.”

00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:49.600
And so I did it.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.867
I did the hell out of it and
really gave it my all and,

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:58.033
and brought in all the musicians
that I wanted to bring in.

00:19:58.033 --> 00:20:01.133
All of whom stayed on ’til the end.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:05.100
That episode planted the seeds
thematically that would go all the way

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.734
to the last episode.

00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:07.867
But I didn’t know any better
at the time.

00:20:07.867 --> 00:20:10.700
I mean, I was just,
I was just trying to,

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.033
I don’t even wanna say I
was trying to keep the job,

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:16.100
I was just trying to do an excellent job
because I really adored that episode.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.066
I mean I thought it was
so gripping and powerful

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:21.700
and a worthy follow-up
of the mini-series.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.600
And after the playback the producers
invited me to come look at the next episode.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.266
And I thought, “Okay. We’re doing
two episodes of Battlestar.”

00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:33.900
So that feeling of waiting for,
I can get fired tomorrow, though,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.600
that went away about halfway
through season four. [laughter]

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.233
That’s when I started,
when I was like,

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:42.800
“You know, I probably am gonna finish this show.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.166
I think, I think I’m gonna stick around.”

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.300
But that’s it.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.400
I was,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.200
I had just turned 24 when I became
the composer of Battlestar Galactica

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.700
and it was, it was really through—

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.900
Raya: How did you feel starting
your career so late? [laughter]

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.834
Bear: Yeah, I know.
I know. [laughter]

00:21:01.834 --> 00:21:02.767
It was tough.

00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:04.633
It was tough.

00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:06.100
Well, seriously when I was 15, I was like,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.133
“I’m gonna be famous by the time I’m 20.

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.400
I’ll just land a big movie.”

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.633
The funny thing is when I was,
when I was a kid I never wanted to do TV.

00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:14.100
I wanted to do movies.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:21.200
And ironically the creative freedom
that I have found in television,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.166
and I find that the quality
in television

00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:26.934
surpasses most of what comes out
in theaters,

00:21:26.934 --> 00:21:30.433
and I think about all the big summer action
blockbusters that come out and I go,

00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:32.033
“Well, this would be cool if I did that,”

00:21:32.033 --> 00:21:35.433
but would I have traded four years
of Battlestar, you know?

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:37.400
Raya: Actually that,
that leads me, blah, blah,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.333
that leads me to a question.

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.700
You were talking about the,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.567
in television you really have time
to develop the sound of a show.

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:49.333
Can you talk a little bit about
how the Battlestar music developed?

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:49.900
Bear: Yeah.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.567
Raya: From your beginnings in
season one to the stuff in season four.

00:21:52.567 --> 00:21:52.934
Bear: Well, like I said—

00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:54.100
Raya: There’s some
really unique narrative stuff.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.433
Bear: Yeah. The show,
the music went through a lot of changes,

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:01.967
which is something that I think
is unusual for television or,

00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:05.934
or it’s unusual for what people think
of as typical television scoring.

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:08.834
The idea, I think, of TV scoring is that

00:22:08.834 --> 00:22:13.834
I think of the pinnacle and also
the pinnacle of functional TV music

00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:15.600
was something like Seinfeld, right,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.700
where you can hear that slap bass sound,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.333
yeah you, can you give us an example?

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:20.400
Raya: [making sounds]

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.233
Bear: There you go. [laughter]

00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:23.500
Alright. And you know exactly
what show you’re watching,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.233
there’s no question,

00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:29.467
it’s doing exactly what it needs to
do to get us from point B to point C.

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:34.166
With Battlestar it needed a much
more cinematic and dramatic approach,

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:40.333
but they also didn’t want what they felt
was a cinematic typical sci-fi opera score.

00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:41.734
So they said,

00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:43.900
they said, “no themes” in the beginning.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.567
So I go, “Okay. No themes.”

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.166
And yet in the first episode that I did,

00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:54.500
I wrote this little thing when,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.033
when Boomer and Helo are down on
the planet I had this little thing,

00:22:58.033 --> 00:22:58.700
I remember it—

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:06.133
♪ [playing pensive piano]

00:23:06.133 --> 00:23:07.266
I’m not gonna win any awards for that,

00:23:07.266 --> 00:23:14.467
but it’s a little germ of an idea that
I used whenever Helo and Boomer were on,

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:16.367
were on Caprica.

00:23:16.367 --> 00:23:20.333
And then in the second episode
we went back to Caprica

00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:22.867
to follow that story line more and I thought,

00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:24.900
“Well, why should I write
a new little melody,

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.500
I’ll just use that one.”

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.100
But that’s a theme now.
[laughter]

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.567
And especially at this point when
I’m fearing for my job, I thought,

00:23:31.567 --> 00:23:36.066
“If I tell them I’m doing this,
then I’m gonna get fired.”

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:39.734
So I didn’t tell them and used that again.

00:23:39.734 --> 00:23:42.533
And then there was a little,

00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:44.900
there was a, in episode
four of season one

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.233
I should stay at the piano –
there was a theme for Kara—

00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:54.066
♪ [playing piano]

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:59.266
And that came back in episode,

00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:01.667
it was in episode four and then
it came back in episode five

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:04.967
and then the next couple
of scenes with Kara,

00:24:04.967 --> 00:24:06.633
I had a chance to use it again

00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:09.767
and it was clearly a theme,
but I was just,

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.533
I was afraid to tell anybody.
[laughter]

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.400
And then in episode eight,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.033
so in episode eight, which
is “Flesh and bone,”

00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:18.900
that episode to me is a pivotal one

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.066
because it begins what became a,

00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:25.734
a unique trait to Battlestar
which is our characters,

00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:29.300
all of our characters become
repulsive in one way or another.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.033
All of our characters do something
that makes us question whether they’re,

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:35.500
they’re doing the right thing or not.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:41.266
And in this particular episode Kara Thrace
starts torturing Leoben,

00:24:41.266 --> 00:24:46.533
and of course this also sets in motion
the end of her whole story line

00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:48.734
and her relationship with Leoben
and all these things.

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:52.166
But I don’t think, I’m not sure
the writers knew all of that ahead.

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:53.667
They certainly didn’t tell me if they did.

00:24:53.667 --> 00:24:58.667
But in that episode I thought, “Well,
if this is the triumphant Kara—

00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:01.166
♪ [playing piano]

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:04.233

♪ [playing piano]

00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:11.400
and then you have moody, dark—

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.000
conflicted Kara.
[laughter]

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.400
But then the producers might feel
it’s a theme. And— [laughter]

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.967
I would get fired.
[laughter]

00:25:19.967 --> 00:25:25.000
So I did it anyway,
and I didn’t get fired.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.066
And so by about the,

00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:31.700
so now at the end of season one in episode
ten which is called “The hand of God”,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.600
I was spotting with,
with one of the producers

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.734
and there is a scene there where
Helo and Boomer are hiding out—

00:25:38.734 --> 00:25:41.467
there is this whole story line
throughout that season—

00:25:41.467 --> 00:25:44.800
and every episode I’m playing
a little Boomer theme.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.400
And the producers look at
that scene and he’s like,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.967
“You know having trouble,
this one’s not quite working,

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.633
something’s not connecting,

00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:56.033
can we, can we use that
Boomer theme that you wrote.

00:25:56.033 --> 00:25:59.467
Can we use a little Boomer theme there?”
I was like, [laughter]

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:03.367
“Um, good idea boss.
Yeah. Boomer theme.”

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:06.633
And at that point I thought, “Okay.”

00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:10.200
But it was a, that was a big sort
of moment for me when I realized,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.500
“Okay. They get it that themes can be subtle.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.000
Themes can be a color.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.233
Themes can be a couple of notes.”

00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:24.433
I think that to a sci-fi audience,

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:26.233
well, pre-Battlestar perhaps,

00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:29.767
the word theme means Luke staring off
into the twin sunsets

00:26:29.767 --> 00:26:33.734
and the french horn is playing “THE THEME”
and anything less than that,

00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:36.467
and I love that stuff,

00:26:36.467 --> 00:26:37.734
but it would have sunk Battlestar.

00:26:37.734 --> 00:26:42.600
That kind of approach in early Battlestar
would have, would have been,

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.100
I think just, I don’t know.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.000
It wouldn’t have been,
it wouldn’t have been right.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.333
But I had a highly thematic approach.

00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:51.100
I was doing the same thing
that Williams was doing,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.867
I was just doing it with
different musical tools.

00:26:54.867 --> 00:26:56.600
As that, once I knew that was okay,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600
which was episode ten of season one,
and you can,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.867
you can tell in the scores the point at
which the producer used the word theme

00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:03.400
and I realize I wasn’t gonna get fired.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.100
So starting with episode ten things start to blossom.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.033
And I introduced—

00:27:08.033 --> 00:27:10.233
Raya: In what ways did
you expand your musical palette,

00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:11.400
like instrument wise.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.600
Bear: Well, I was
going to get to that.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.834
In episode ten there was a,

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:19.400
there was a, a Gaelic element that
I introduced with this theme—

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:40.600
♪ [playing very melodic piano]

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.133
So in the texture of Battlestar
this did not fit at all.

00:27:45.133 --> 00:27:47.333
And I knew that it didn’t fit,

00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:49.433
but there was this one scene that it did fit.

00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:53.734
At the end of this episode there
was this big jubilant celebration

00:27:53.734 --> 00:27:56.300
which itself didn’t fit the tone
of the show at that point.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.433
But one of the things
I was realizing is that

00:27:57.433 --> 00:28:00.867
this show was expanding and developing
and changing.

00:28:00.867 --> 00:28:03.433
So once that was, that scene
was in there, I thought,

00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.700
“Well, maybe I can use that as
a theme earlier in the episode

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.800
in a more emotional setting.”

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.367
So I did and I didn’t get fired.

00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:14.433
So that became a theme for,

00:28:14.433 --> 00:28:17.934
for Lee and his father and then that
started coming back in season two.

00:28:17.934 --> 00:28:21.500
That start set me on this path
where now the score was beginning

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.033
to expand instrumentally.

00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:26.900
And what used to be just taiko drums
and an occasional Middle Eastern woodwind

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.667
and an electric fiddle,

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:29.834
now included bagpipes.

00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.066
Raya: Don’t forget
the wailing chick.

00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:32.800
Bear: And the wailing chick.
[laughter]

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.133
And…
[laughter] [applause]

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.467
Yes. Yes.

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.100
And then, so then in,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.467
in the end of season one
we added the orchestra back in

00:28:43.467 --> 00:28:48.433
which is the thing that the producers said
adamantly that they wanted no orchestra.

00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:49.567
Well, they changed their mind.

00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:51.467
And the orchestra again,

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:53.900
it wasn’t Luke staring off
into twin sunsets,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.033
it was, it could be used in,
in more tasteful ways for Battlestar,

00:28:58.033 --> 00:29:01.767
not dogging on Williams.
I love that stuff.

00:29:01.767 --> 00:29:06.767
But when the season ended,
the score had changed dramatically.

00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.800
And so then in season two,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.567
it began to change right from the get go

00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:15.033
and we started adding in some
Indian sitar and some tabla.

00:29:15.033 --> 00:29:18.500
And then in the middle of season two,
about another ten episodes in,

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.734
we added a rock band,
with this episode called “Pegasus.”

00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:23.800
And then the orchestral
music became more pronounced.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:28.033
And so now there
was a pop-rock element.

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:30.266
We went into season three and
I changed up the taiko writing.

00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:34.867
I added a lot more authentic
Japanese percussion.

00:29:34.867 --> 00:29:36.934
Between season two and three,

00:29:36.934 --> 00:29:41.266
I did a lot of research into how
Japanese music uses taiko drums

00:29:41.266 --> 00:29:45.333
and that, on the soundtrack album there’s
this track called “Storming New Caprica”

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:47.100
which sounds different.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.433
I mean you can just tell it sounds
different than season one and two.

00:29:50.433 --> 00:29:53.000
And the bagpipes are still being
used in these episodes

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.633
and you get to season three,
the end of season three,

00:29:56.633 --> 00:30:02.100
with “All along the watchtower” which was
a weird enough inclusion- on its own-

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.900
Raya: But you want to tell
them how that came to be at all or—

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.967
kind of a little synopsis.

00:30:05.967 --> 00:30:07.800
Bear: Well, the interesting
thing is all of these things,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.700
I wanna stress I’m not just throwing
these in because I got bored.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.834
Quite the contrary.

00:30:11.834 --> 00:30:15.900
Most of the time, as a composer
if you were working on a show

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.567
that is in one language and
you just come in and you’re like,

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:22.533
“Hey, I wanna do some bagpipes in
this episode,” you’re gonna get fired.

00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:25.367
It was something that
the producers encouraged

00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:27.367
and in many ways forced me to do.

00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:30.300
Because the writing evolved,
the acting evolved,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.033
the characters changed so much;
Kara Thrace is a perfect example.

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:36.233
Her opening theme which I played you,

00:30:36.233 --> 00:30:40.500
was rather warm and triumphant and
then I created a dark version of it.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.767
Well, in season three we learned
all about this special destiny

00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:46.433
that she might have, so I wrote
a theme for that.

00:30:46.433 --> 00:30:51.500
And then later in season three
we learned about this relationship

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.467
that she has with Lee and that
got expanded on dramatically.

00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:57.700
None of these other themes would
work and I wrote a theme for that.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.767
And Baltar was another character
that had multiple themes

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:04.100
for their different personalities and
one of the things that I realized is that

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.133
these people are not archetypes.

00:31:06.133 --> 00:31:10.300
You can’t write one theme that
encapsulates everything about them.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.433
And if you think about
your own personality,

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:13.700
as much as we’d like to think,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.000
“Well, if I’m the hero of my movie,
I’d have the hero theme.”

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.567
Well, there’s days when your cranky
and you have to have a cranky theme.

00:31:18.567 --> 00:31:23.166
I mean people are complicated,
multi-faceted individuals

00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:28.834
and Battlestar is a perfect
example of every character being like this.

00:31:28.834 --> 00:31:32.533
So I was forced to expand
greatly as this show went on.

00:31:32.533 --> 00:31:36.900
And “Watchtower” came along—

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.867
this was an idea that Ron Moore
had in season one.

00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:45.266
He wanted the ending of season one
to be Baltar in his dream

00:31:45.266 --> 00:31:48.767
walking into the symphony hall and there’s
somebody playing “All along the watchtower”

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:50.867
and the writer’s like, 
“Dude, no way.” [laughter]

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:54.200
So, and then in season two we wanted to
bring it back and the writers were like,

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.300
“No way.”

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.100
In season three finally I think he came
up with the reason to use it.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.633
And they go, “Well, okay.”

00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:02.033
And—

00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:03.700
Raya: What, what was
your first response when you—

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.900
Bear: I thought he was nuts.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.734
I thought it was—
[laughter]

00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:06.567
I thought it was the end of the show.

00:32:06.567 --> 00:32:07.934
Honestly, I thought it
was the end of the show.

00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:10.300
Because I didn’t know
how it was gonna be used.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.567
I didn’t see the episode, I
also hadn’t read the script.

00:32:12.567 --> 00:32:14.567
All I got a phone call was producer going,

00:32:14.567 --> 00:32:17.600
“Dude, Ron wants you to do an
All Along The Watchtower.”

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.266
I was just like, “Good-bye.”
[laughter]

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:22.233
But the more I thought about it,
I thought,

00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:24.333
“Well, there might be some potential here.”

00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:26.100
Raya: There might
be some way… out of here?

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.467
Bear: Yes. [laughter]

00:32:28.467 --> 00:32:31.867
That was the second thing I thought.
[laughter]

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:35.200
Well, you know, I had an idea and I thought,
“Well, I’ll try this.”

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.834
I had an idea to do—

00:32:36.834 --> 00:32:38.767
we had introduced taiko drums,

00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:42.800
we’d introduced Middle Eastern music,
we’d introduced African music,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.033
heavy metal had snuck into the score in an
episode called “Black market,”

00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:49.166
which was just this source piece that I’d
done because I wanted to a heavy metal song

00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:51.100
but there it was, on the 
season two soundtrack,

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.400
and it was in the fabric of the show.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.934
So I thought, “Well, I’ll try
to do the version of this,

00:32:54.934 --> 00:32:57.400
of Watchtower that I think would be cool.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.867
And then I can at least tell everybody that

00:32:58.867 --> 00:33:01.667
there was a cool version at one point
in the past.”

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:03.166
’Cause I was sure that this wouldn’t fly.

00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.333
So I did this, what I called,

00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:08.567
George Harrison sits in with
Rage Against The Machine,

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:12.667
kind of Indian, Middle Eastern version
of “All along the watchtower.”

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:14.433
So I threw it together – a demo.

00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:17.734
My brother stepped off a plane
and he recorded the demo vocals

00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:19.600
and I sent it to Ron
and I was just like,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.166
“Okay. Well, that will be the end of this.”

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:26.767
And Ron writes back and he’s like,
“Oh, it’s great.” [laughter]

00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:28.400
And it was, that was it.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.233
“No, I can totally see that fitting
with the action in the episode.”

00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:32.867
And I was like, “There’s
action in the episode?”

00:33:32.867 --> 00:33:35.133
I didn’t even know.

00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:37.433
And ultimately the version that
you hear on the album

00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:40.066
and in the show is almost identical;

00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:42.400
some of the tracks are from the demo.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.633
It’s exactly what my initial vision
was, and I think part of that is,

00:33:46.633 --> 00:33:52.700
is thanks to Ron letting me do
whatever I wanted; he gave me no input.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.100
I mean it was literally the first time
that the producer said nothing to me.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.633
Before I wrote it, I caught him
in the hallway and I said,

00:33:58.633 --> 00:34:00.166
“Ron, dude, what, what do you want me to do?

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:01.367
It is, should it sound like Bob Dylan?

00:34:01.367 --> 00:34:02.567
Should it sound like Jimi Hendrix?”

00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:04.533
And he goes,
“Make it sound like Battlestar.”

00:34:04.533 --> 00:34:06.200
And he walked away.
[laughter]

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.433
Like this was easy,
you know? [laughter]

00:34:08.433 --> 00:34:14.200
And I also think that
the network had faith in Ron.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.300
I personally believe that they
weren’t sure what to make of it.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.900
I think it was something
that was extremely daring,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.734
I mean whether you liked it or not,
it was extremely daring.

00:34:24.734 --> 00:34:28.633
And that blasted open the doors
in season four

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:33.000
where now the music is something
the characters hear;

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.533
the themes are melodies they’re aware of;

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:42.500
and the music became a part
of the show in a way that

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.100
I can’t think of another film or television
show that did it in this exact way.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.100
And the writers began calling me.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.266
I was on set.

00:34:49.266 --> 00:34:51.133
I was involved in the scripts—

00:34:51.133 --> 00:34:52.667
Raya: It got kind of
meta eventually,

00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:56.266
because first it was kinda like you’re
following the narrative of the show—

00:34:56.266 --> 00:34:58.367
And then, and what’s,
what’s the name of the episode—

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:00.633
Bear: Well, “Someone to watch
over me” was one of the first ones.

00:35:00.633 --> 00:35:02.800
Raya: Yeah, suddenly
the show started following you.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.200
Bear: Exactly.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.166
The character in that named Slick,
who’s this piano player,

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.967
every time he’s talking about music,

00:35:08.967 --> 00:35:13.667
what he’s saying is what I was saying
when I was writing

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:17.100
that season’s mid-season cliffhanger
in an episode called “Revelations.”

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.000
So you’ve got to think about this;

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.600
I’m writing, I’m struggling
to write this cue

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.567
that was one of the toughest cues
I’d ever written,

00:35:22.567 --> 00:35:24.767
and the writers called me
up and they’re like,

00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:25.734
“Can we take a minute of your time?

00:35:25.734 --> 00:35:27.300
We got this character, a composer;

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.367
he’s writing a cue;
he’s having trouble with it.

00:35:29.367 --> 00:35:31.367
What is that like?”
And I was just like— [laughter]

00:35:31.367 --> 00:35:33.000
“Dammit.”
[laughter]

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.533
So like it was, it was perfect.

00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:36.266
I mean literally David Weddle
was like,

00:35:36.266 --> 00:35:36.967
“Hang on.

00:35:36.967 --> 00:35:39.567
Don’t, don’t figure it out,
don’t figure it out,

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:41.667
let me get a pencil,
we’ll write this down.” [laughter]

00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:44.533
So that’s exact,
it was me, that was me,

00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:47.433
what I was going through to write this,
this other cue.

00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:48.600
Raya: And in fact you got
so close that

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.000
you went up to the set for that one.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.233
Bear: Yeah, I was,
I was on set

00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.033
and I worked with the actors,
I worked with Katee and Roark,

00:35:54.033 --> 00:35:56.400
I taught them the piano parts.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.367
Roark is an excellent pianist

00:35:58.367 --> 00:36:01.233
and as he was actually cast
so that he could play my music.

00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:03.700
They only auditioned
people that could play piano.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:09.233
And – fun trivia – they actually
auditioned me for this. [laughter]

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:12.467
Needless to say, my talents are
clearly on the compositional side.

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:14.266
[laughter]

00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:15.066
But—

00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:16.066
Raya: But you went to
the audition.

00:36:16.066 --> 00:36:17.834
Bear: I did. I did.

00:36:17.834 --> 00:36:21.300
It was, yeah.
[laughter]

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.166
So, and then even in the last episode,
I will keep this,

00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:27.500
is there anyone here who hasn’t seen
the last episode? Raise your hand.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.633
It’s okay. Okay.

00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:30.834
I just, alright.
I won’t spoil it.

00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:35.033
In the last episode,
something happens, yeah.

00:36:35.033 --> 00:36:36.567
And there, there are—

00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:39.166
And there are, there are,
there are coordinates involved.

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:43.834
And these are coordinates that,
that I came up with.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:46.867
Actually Ron called me and was like,
“Hey, we need a way to,

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:50.500
to communicate this idea that the music
and the coordinates are tied together.”

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.900
And actually I worked with Kevin Grazier,
the science advisor, and I was like,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:59.934
“Well, tell me how many coordinates, 
how many digits do we need?”

00:36:59.934 --> 00:37:03.133
And he would, he’s, you guys
probably know better than I do,

00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:07.734
it was, he needed 12 digits
to create this set of coordinates.

00:37:07.734 --> 00:37:14.166
And by coincidence the theme that
I was messing around with at the time

00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:15.133
had 12 notes.

For the thirteenth colony. Ooh. 
[laughter] Naah, I’m making that up.

00:37:27.867 --> 00:37:28.700
Yeah, that was a coincidence.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.934
But anyway, it was a happy coincidence
and then I thought, “okay”—

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:36.567
and I devised a number of different
ways we could generate these pitches

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:44.100
and I came up with complex grids of
intervals and different scaling,

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.600
ways of numbering a scale
to create these numbers.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.667
And I said to the writers, “Okay, well
how long is the scene that we have to explain this.

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:53.600
I mean is it like, how many, how
many lines of dialog do we have

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.834
to like to sell this idea?”

00:37:54.834 --> 00:37:57.500
Somebody’d be like, “Well, actually let’s
microanalyze the blah, blah, blah.”

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.066
And he’s like, “Oh,
there’s no dialog.”

00:37:59.066 --> 00:38:01.100
And—

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.066
well, one little spoiler.

00:38:02.066 --> 00:38:04.400
“They’re about to get sucked into the
black hole, everyone’s about to die,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.834
and there’s no dialog, they
just have to kind of do it.

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:09.767
And you have, but you have to
sell that it comes from the music.”

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:13.266
And I was like, “Uh, okay.”

00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:16.166
And then actually I worked
with the editor very closely

00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:20.467
to create this idea that these
are numbers that come to Kara

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:24.200
and what I ended up doing
was numbering the scale,

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.133
just the very bottom note is one,

00:38:26.133 --> 00:38:29.967
and then just going up the scale
not counting the chromatic notes,

00:38:29.967 --> 00:38:33.033
so going up the scale one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:38:33.033 --> 00:38:37.800
And then she just – fortunately they
were all, they’re all numbers under 10,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.133
so they’re all single
digit numbers, so those,

00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:44.266
the twelve digits that she plays in are
the twelve notes that of the theme.

00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:49.367
And, I know, and then as the editor
cut it together we cut her punching

00:38:49.367 --> 00:38:53.000
in the numbers on the keypad to
her playing the notes on the piano

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.800
and, I don’t know, 
did that come across at all,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.266
or were you guys like,
“what the hell just happened?”

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:58.200
Did that, 
did you get it?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.066
Alright.

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:04.133
So that was pretty extraordinary,

00:39:04.133 --> 00:39:09.934
I mean that was sort of the
evolution of that score and it was,

00:39:09.934 --> 00:39:10.900
it was a pretty extraordinary journey.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.400

that way the show and the music

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.300

Bear: Yes, even cooler.

00:45:09.934 --> 00:45:11.800

I ask these questions?

or should we…?

or more cool depending on how…
what they…

right will get those prizes…

shout it. And then you’ll win.

our final prize? This one here?

00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:50.600

of not cool, but not horrible prize.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.367
Raya: The might-be-interesting prize.

00:48:51.367 --> 00:48:52.734
Bear: I want somebody
from the audience to come up

and I’m going to teach them how
to play the Katee Sackhoff’s part

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.200

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:00.934
Raya: Do you want to
say the question?

00:49:00.934 --> 00:49:02.200
Bear: No, you can do it.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.500
Raya: Do you want
me to say the question? Okay.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:10.767
What was the name of the episode
where Bear had a cameo?

00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:12.867
Where Bear was onscreen?

Member of the audience: “Making of.”

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.867
Bear: I think for partial
credit, since we did not say,

00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:28.367
I’m not counting “the making of.”

00:49:28.367 --> 00:49:29.467
I think we have a winner.

00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:29.934
Raya: You think so?

00:49:29.934 --> 00:49:30.533

We can do Q&amp;A, I guess, if
there’s anything I didn’t cover.

All right, good night!
No, I’m kidding.

00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:05.033
Just step up to the mike.

00:52:05.033 --> 00:52:06.800
Member of the audience: I haven’t quite figured out
how to phrase this,

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.300
but you talked a lot about melodies and, you
know, notes and pitches during your stuff,

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.734
but I’m kind of curious to hear
more about rhythm.

00:52:15.734 --> 00:52:18.500
Since you use a lot of rhythm in
your music of all different cultures

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.033
and particularly how that corresponds
to the pacing over the whole—

00:52:22.033 --> 00:52:24.467
like an episode is a really long thing,
right? So—

00:52:24.467 --> 00:52:27.600
Bear: Well, rhythm
is an important tool

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.934
when you’re not allowed to write melodies,
which is how I started.

00:52:32.934 --> 00:52:35.266
I literally had nothing but rhythm.

00:52:35.266 --> 00:52:38.233
So that was how I started the score

00:52:38.233 --> 00:52:42.934
and I would think of themes
in terms of rhythmic ideas.

00:52:42.934 --> 00:52:50.066
And I find that melodies are
probably more effective for use as themes

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:55.967
because it’s easier to have a melody
stuck in your head than a rhythm.

00:52:55.967 --> 00:52:59.266
But in terms of pacing across
a whole episode—

00:52:59.266 --> 00:53:02.800
I always think about the bigger picture
when I—

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.100
when I compose.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.500
And, generally, what I do is
I look at an episode

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.200
and I start with the biggest part of it—

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.667
what I know is the most intense cue
and I—

00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:14.567
not only because it’s the most difficult

00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:17.066
and then it feels really good
when you’re done with it,

00:53:17.066 --> 00:53:19.867
but that way I also know that

00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:21.934
everything that I write needs
to lead up to that

00:53:21.934 --> 00:53:23.734
and it’s generally toward
the end of the episode.

00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:27.667
Sometimes like in the case
of “The ties that bind,”

00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:31.467
which is an episode where this character
that we know and love started going crazy,

00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:36.433
I intentionally mapped out
the whole episode where every act,

00:53:36.433 --> 00:53:40.600
the music got a little bit faster
and the key dropped.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.166
So that, you know, to put this sort
of in really easy terms—

00:53:44.166 --> 00:53:45.967
so, like in the beginning
of the episode we’re here

00:53:45.967 --> 00:53:46.934
♪ [playing note on piano]

00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:47.800
and then in the second act,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.266
♪ [playing piano]

00:53:50.266 --> 00:53:51.233
you know, just down and down and down.

00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:55.300
And you don’t notice it because
it’s over the course of 44 minutes,

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.567
but I think that subconsciously things
like that—

00:53:57.567 --> 00:54:00.333
that and the way that the rhythm
is just getting faster and faster,

00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:02.600
it does create this feeling that

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.166
you’re kind of spiraling out
of control towards something.

00:54:05.166 --> 00:54:07.333
So that can be a really powerful tool,

00:54:07.333 --> 00:54:10.633
and obviously when you’re thinking
in terms of drums

00:54:10.633 --> 00:54:14.033
and a lot of my music is very percussion
heavy, rhythm is—

00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:17.000
you got to have a cool groove.

00:54:19.233 --> 00:54:22.667
Member of the audience: Do you have a dream of something you
want to do that you haven’t been able to do?

00:54:22.667 --> 00:54:23.967
And if so, what is that?

00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:28.633
Bear: Boy, I don’t know.
I got to score a Terminator TV show,

00:54:28.633 --> 00:54:32.433

00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:33.000
I don’t know.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.066
I mean, my dream is keep writing music and
continuing to do what I love, you know.

00:54:39.066 --> 00:54:42.066
And the fact that people are
out there listening to it

00:54:42.066 --> 00:54:44.066
is wonderful and icing on the cake.

00:54:44.066 --> 00:54:46.367
But I mean like the fact that I can keep—

00:54:46.367 --> 00:54:51.834
just keep writing music is
my dream, you know, for sure.

00:54:51.834 --> 00:54:54.200
Member of the audience: How did you pick the Gayatri Mantra
for the title, and more generally,

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.700
how do you come up with these lyrics in all
these different languages?

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.567
Bear: Well, it’s interesting
the mantra came from Eddie Olmos.

00:54:59.567 --> 00:55:02.033
Eddie played this on the set

00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:03.934
so it was something that even
before any composer was hired

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:10.600
was part of the Battlestar Galactica
universe, you know, in an indirect way.

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.367
And what was the other question?
It was about—

00:55:13.367 --> 00:55:13.767
Member of the audience: Lyrics.

00:55:13.767 --> 00:55:15.433
Bear: Oh, lyrics.
Thank you.

00:55:15.433 --> 00:55:17.066
Lyrics are interesting.

00:55:17.066 --> 00:55:19.767
I didn’t write any lyrics for
the first couple of tunes.

00:55:19.767 --> 00:55:23.367
The first time I wrote lyrics for
the show was for an Italian opera scene

00:55:23.367 --> 00:55:25.500
in this comedic moment.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.333
And I wrote these lyrics
that were sort of a parody.

00:55:29.333 --> 00:55:32.100
I mean, they were like very
operatic, angsty lyrics.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.333
“Woe unto your Cylon heart,
my girlfriend is a toaster,

00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:37.867
the spine glows red,” and you know,
blah blah blah.

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:40.467
And it’s clear as day,
I mean it’s in Italian

00:55:40.467 --> 00:55:43.533
but it’s like, if you speak Italian,
there’s no dialogue obscuring it.

00:55:43.533 --> 00:55:46.800
And at the dub where the producers
heard it for the first time,

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.867
they were like, dude,
this music is really beautiful.

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:49.867
What are those lyrics, by the way?

00:55:49.867 --> 00:55:52.900
And I was like, oh, I don’t
have them on me – I’m sorry.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.867
[laughter] Can I – I’ll
show them to you tomorrow.

00:55:54.867 --> 00:55:58.500
Knowing that we were shipping
that night and—

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.600
cause, you know, I didn’t want them
to get cold feet.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:05.900
And then after I started
approaching the lyrics more seriously.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.367
In season three, I got to write
the tune that was in Armenian,

00:56:09.367 --> 00:56:15.400
and comment on things that I was feeling.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.266
And write a song that I wanted to write,
but also that commented on the—

00:56:20.266 --> 00:56:21.333
on the events of the episode.

00:56:21.333 --> 00:56:25.700
And it was great because I could always
hide in another, you know, language.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.133
And I always get kind of—

00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:29.500
people sometimes they ask, dude,
is that outer space language

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.266
that they’re singing in?

00:56:31.266 --> 00:56:32.633
And I was like, no way.

00:56:32.633 --> 00:56:35.033
Like, I go out of my way
to write these lyrics

00:56:35.033 --> 00:56:37.033
and to translate them and to
have them sung authentically.

00:56:37.033 --> 00:56:40.133
That’s something – that’s a layer that
I think adds a lot of authenticity.

00:56:40.133 --> 00:56:43.333
I love the Ewok song.
I’m not dogging on that.

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:48.266
But I think for Battlestar, it
wouldn’t have been appropriate.

00:56:48.266 --> 00:56:51.433
Member of the audience: Have you ever been like
doing the music for a project

00:56:51.433 --> 00:56:54.600
and you were like “This is
the worst TV show ever.”

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.033
Bear: No, generally
I don’t take those on.

00:56:57.033 --> 00:56:59.600
If it’s truly the worst TV show ever.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.567
There are plenty of times, though,

00:57:01.567 --> 00:57:05.000
when, you know, you’re working on something that

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.767
you have to do your best on
whether you believe in it or not.

00:57:07.767 --> 00:57:10.000
You know, I mean, that’s part of
your job. You’re a craftsman,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.600
and sometimes I think about it
like sometimes I’m a guy

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.200
who gets to, you know,
paint the painting.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.400
Other times, I’m a guy who
comes in to fix your leaky pipe.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.700
And this thing isn’t working,
and you got to fix it.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:26.133
And the music can make things better
so sometimes it—

00:57:26.133 --> 00:57:27.400
you just got to wear different hats

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.233
and it depends on the quality
of what you’re working on.

00:57:30.233 --> 00:57:31.066
Thankfully on Battlestar,

00:57:31.066 --> 00:57:37.300
most of the time, I was the painter
and not the plumber. You know.

Is… Are people in your position,
is the industry,

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:03.100
do they have to defend the idea of
having an opening theme now with,

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.333
you know, Dick Wolf, with,
you know, two notes

00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:08.266
and some of these shows that are
in prime time who don’t get one?

00:58:08.266 --> 00:58:09.066
Bear: Can we show
the Human Target main theme?

00:58:09.066 --> 00:58:11.100
Let me show you a main theme I just did.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.667
And then I’ll answer that question.

♪ [music playing]

00:58:48.867 --> 00:58:52.266
Bear: So there is an example
of not having to fight for the theme.

00:58:52.266 --> 00:58:54.400
I mean, clearly the guys that produce
this show

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.333
wanted a strong main title theme with
beautiful visuals and a memorable,

00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:00.367
melodic theme.

00:59:00.367 --> 00:59:05.033
And it is something that,
if the producers don’t want it,

00:59:05.033 --> 00:59:07.467
you know, as a composer,
you can’t change their minds.

00:59:07.467 --> 00:59:09.600
But I think that is coming back.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.266
Getting to do a theme song like that,
with a full orchestra at my disposal,

00:59:14.266 --> 00:59:18.300
and getting to write a melody like that,
is pretty unusual.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:21.967
And I’d love for it to become more usual,
and I think not coincidentally,

00:59:21.967 --> 00:59:25.066
the guy that hired me to do this show
is a big fan of Battlestar,

00:59:25.066 --> 00:59:28.266
and that’s one of the reasons I got the
job is he heard what I doing in Battlestar

00:59:28.266 --> 00:59:31.400
and wanted to bring that kind
of energy to his show.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.433
So I’d love to be able to
do more of that.

00:59:33.433 --> 00:59:36.166
But for a while there it
was a dying art, for sure.

00:59:36.166 --> 00:59:38.000
Raya: Can I make a special request?

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Bear: What’s that?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.567
Raya: Can you play the Sarah Connor theme?
’Cause it’s one of my favorites?

00:59:40.567 --> 00:59:43.500
Bear: I don’t have it.
I only have the Samson and Delilah theme.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.800
Hang on.

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.000
Fiancée asks.

00:59:51.166 --> 01:00:20.100
♪ [playing the Sarah Connor theme on the piano]

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.166
Bear: I miss that show.

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:23.867
Okay.

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:25.500
Any other questions?

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.700
Member of the audience: Yeah, actually that’s a good segue.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.033
I was going to ask about
Sarah Connor Chronicles,

01:00:29.033 --> 01:00:32.767
and you did that show for two seasons,
which if I’m not mistaken,

01:00:32.767 --> 01:00:36.066
which is the second longest run
you’ve had on a show.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.467
Bear: Up there.
So far.

01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:39.834
Member of the audience: So far, of course.

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:44.567
I’m curious if you feel like you’ve had
an opportunity on that to have fun

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:46.967
and basically explore themes.

01:00:46.967 --> 01:00:49.133
Obviously, you didn’t have
as long as on Battlestar,

01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:55.567
but do you feel like you missed
an opportunity to explore those themes

01:00:55.567 --> 01:00:58.066
and those story lines more?

01:00:58.066 --> 01:01:01.033
Bear: Well, I mean—
I think I can answer your question.

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:05.567
Yeah, I had a very thematic score
on Terminator.

01:01:05.567 --> 01:01:07.667
We were in a very similar situation
with Battlestar,

01:01:07.667 --> 01:01:14.867
where we were coming from something that
existed already and needed to know—

01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:17.533
are we acknowledging or are
we distancing ourselves?

01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:20.333
And with Battlestar,
I could do everything

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:22.633
except for what Stu Phillips did
on the old show.

01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:25.200
Obviously, with some disclaimer,
I could spend on hour talking about

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.500
how wonderful Stu is and how wonderful
it was to bring his theme back.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.133
But it really was a special
occasion in Battlestar.

01:01:31.133 --> 01:01:35.033
Terminator was different
because we wanted to—

01:01:35.033 --> 01:01:37.533
we wanted to connect directly
to Terminator 2,

01:01:37.533 --> 01:01:39.400
and it should feel very much like a sequel.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.900
So the score needed to
kind of help ease that in.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.066
“Yeah, I know it’s Lena Headey but she’s
the same person that Linda Hamilton was.”

01:01:48.066 --> 01:01:51.700
This is the spirit of this is
very much coming out of T2.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.200
So I had that as a starting point,

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.500
but I was also able to say to
the producers that the Terminator theme,

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.700
I felt, from the movies, is excellent
as it is, I think of Schwarzenegger,

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.000
I think of those movies.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.200
I don’t even think of the characters,

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.166
like the movies themselves have become
such phenomena

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:11.600
that it’s hard to distance
ourselves from them.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.900
So I thought I don’t think there’s
a theme that’s Sarah Connor’s theme.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.100
So can we try writing one?

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:22.734
And they were open to exploring this
new, you know, musical universe.

01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:28.033
And I had an electric string quartet
where we were running the quartet

01:02:28.033 --> 01:02:32.900
through amplifiers and digital effects,
actually mostly analog effects,

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.567
and recorded the group that way.

01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:38.667
We had big metallic percussion,
we had car parts,

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:44.266
and brakes and anvils and hammers
and like – I mean, it was a blast.

01:02:44.266 --> 01:02:48.467
And that album is worth checking
out for some of those colors alone.

01:02:48.467 --> 01:02:51.467
Thematically, I feel like
I was just getting started.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.500
I mean, I would adore to go back.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:57.734
And there was some talk of
doing a straight-to-DVD movie.

01:02:57.734 --> 01:03:02.000
And I think that ultimately, it’s the just
legalities and the business of it.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You know, the rights are tangled up
with a company that went Chapter 11.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.400
And so it may never happen
and that would make me sad,

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.033
but I’m really happy that that album
is out there, that show is out there,

01:03:14.033 --> 01:03:17.500
and I was able to – going back to
whoever asked me about my dream,

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:22.066
I was able to contribute something
to the Terminator universe.

01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:24.533
I’m thrilled with that, you know.

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.567
Member of the audience: Thanks.
Bear: Thanks.

01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:29.133
Host: One last question?

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:31.100
Okay.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.000
Member of the audience: For those of us who aren’t
familiar with the terminology,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.967
can you talk about what’s involved
in writing a cue

01:03:34.967 --> 01:03:38.433
and why is that more difficult than
writing just some music independently?

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:40.400
Bear: Well, it
depends on your perspective.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.033
I don’t think it is more difficult,
personally.

01:03:43.033 --> 01:03:45.000
I think that the difference is that

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.066
when you’re writing a piece
of music for yourself,

01:03:47.066 --> 01:03:51.467
you need to make yourself happy
and express yourself

01:03:51.467 --> 01:03:53.633
and figure out what you’re going to say
and how you’re going to say it

01:03:53.633 --> 01:03:55.934
and who your audience is and
how you’re going to perform it—

01:03:55.934 --> 01:03:57.934
there’s a lot of variables.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:02.567
And most of the time when – when
you have an idea, it’s wonderful.

01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:04.834
“I just have an idea and
it’s going to spill forth,

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:09.000
and the audience will find it,” but a lot
of the times those things are not as easy.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.800
With scoring for picture,

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.166
you know how long it’s going to be,
you know the shape,

01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:15.433
you know which characters are involved,

01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:17.333
you know the emotions you’re probably
going to want to play.

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:21.467
And I found that I’d become very quick
at looking at a scene

01:04:21.467 --> 01:04:24.633
and in my mind almost being able
to score it instantly.

01:04:24.633 --> 01:04:25.700
I don’t know the themes.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.266
I don’t know the exact rhythms
but it’s like I can see the shape.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.233
I can see the shape that’s it like,
it’s almost like geometric.

01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:37.133
It’s gonna start this way and be
purple and kind of dark and brooding

01:04:37.133 --> 01:04:38.867
and then a rhythm comes in here

01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:41.734
when this guy says something
or when this action happens.

01:04:41.734 --> 01:04:44.233
And then a lot of the times,
I’ll just look at a scene

01:04:44.233 --> 01:04:46.767
and then I’ll see these kind of blocks,
and now I go, okay,

01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:48.033
what are my rhythms?

01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:48.900
What are the pitches?

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.900
What are the melodies I’m going to use?

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.467
These things are – for me,

01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:57.300
they’re relatively easy to that basic
idea of what am I going to say?

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.333
And when I’m writing music on my own,
which I love to do—

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.834
I’m a tough critic, you know.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:04.800
And that’s self-censorship kicks in.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.033
I got a cool idea.

01:05:06.033 --> 01:05:08.900
No, it’s not a cool enough idea.
Screw it.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:13.133
And the other thing I find useful
about scoring for TV and movies,

01:05:13.133 --> 01:05:14.233
you have a deadline.

01:05:14.233 --> 01:05:16.600
So your first idea, you
don’t have time to go back.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.667
And you’re not going to write
three drafts and pick the best one.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:21.533
The thing you sit down to write,
that’s what’s going on the air.

01:05:21.533 --> 01:05:23.667
So if it’s not good when you write it,

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:27.700
you tweak it or you get the performer
to change it, or you edit it later,

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.433
but it’s – it’s trained me
to become very fast.

01:05:30.433 --> 01:05:33.600
And in fact, I think of myself
creatively almost like a—

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.667
I think of my creative mind the way I think
a marathon runner thinks about their body

01:05:38.667 --> 01:05:40.734
where it’s just like I’m always
training myself,

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:42.900
and I know the days I need to
get more sleep.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.867
I know the days that I can sacrifice sleep.

01:05:44.867 --> 01:05:46.233
I know the hours that I write the best.

01:05:46.233 --> 01:05:50.367
I know the cues that I should write
in those hours, you know what I mean?

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:54.367
If I didn’t figure all these thing out
and I was like I’m going to write some cues,

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.700
it would be difficult.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.533
But I have kind of learned
how to do these things.

01:05:58.533 --> 01:06:02.200
And I mean, with Human Target
being a full orchestra now,

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:08.667
I’m generating between 45 minutes and
55 minutes of original music a week.

01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:11.934
And in fact, today’s the first day
I haven’t written music since New Year’s.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:16.100
So – it’s something that
you just rely on the—

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.967
the craft and the technique,
and the things you know.

01:06:18.967 --> 01:06:22.900
And when you’re doing a song for yourself,
it’s fun but all those parameters are gone.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.533
You could do anything.

01:06:23.533 --> 01:06:27.000
I find that slows me down, you know.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.900
Member of the audience: So I’m not trying to
evoke like things you hate—

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.533
Bear: Oh, go for it.

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:34.967
Member of the audience: But do you ever watch a program
or a movie or a project and you say

01:06:34.967 --> 01:06:37.367
not only could I have done it better
but I wish I had been able to that?

01:06:37.367 --> 01:06:39.400
Not necessarily hating
on the person who did it.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.333
Bear: You know it’s difficult.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:45.033
I mean, when I—
I have found that, again,

01:06:45.033 --> 01:06:47.000
going back to that marathon runner mentality,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.633
I can’t – I can’t shut that off.

01:06:49.633 --> 01:06:53.500
So when I go—
I’m so used to looking at picture

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:58.633
and just constantly analyzing every facial
tic, every line of dialogue, every cut,

01:06:58.633 --> 01:06:59.867
thinking “all right, what can we do?”

01:06:59.867 --> 01:07:01.400
“What’s the best way to do this?”

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.100
I can’t shut that off when
I watch anything else.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.033
So it’s very difficult for me—

01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.867
it’s not about thinking that
this score isn’t adequate.

01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:12.400
If anything, I just keep thinking
about what else could be done?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.100
And what I would do and I actually
have to make a conscious effort

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.333
to shut that part of my brain off
to enjoy something.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:22.000
And admittedly, that’s
becoming very, very difficult.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.834
And I’ve been working professionally—

01:07:23.834 --> 01:07:27.266
I mean, I’ve been working under deadlines
like this for 7 or 8 years now.

01:07:27.266 --> 01:07:29.900
And I – it’s almost impossible.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.967
And should I be fortunate enough
to end up like Elmer Bernstein

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.133
and do this until I’m 80,

01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:38.200
I can’t imagine that’s it’s
going to get any better,

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.033
you know, just doing the condition
the same thing everyday.

01:07:41.033 --> 01:07:41.567
So it is tough.

01:07:41.567 --> 01:07:47.633
It’s harder to enjoy—
it’s harder to enjoy media in general.

01:07:47.633 --> 01:07:50.400
Somebody asked me earlier at lunch
what kind of music do you listen to?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.934
I don’t – I love music but I don’t
necessarily listen to it for fun anymore

01:07:54.934 --> 01:07:57.767
because I’m always listening to
the mixes that I’ve got to approve

01:07:57.767 --> 01:07:59.967
or listening to the cues that
I just wrote trying to figure out

01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:01.567
how I’m going to orchestrate them.

01:08:01.567 --> 01:08:06.500
So it’s a part of my life that I—
that I’ve got a new side of it.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.734
A quick tangential side story to that and
the way this has sort of changed my life.

01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:13.000
When I was growing up, the first pop band
I was into was Oingo Boingo,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.967
huge fan of Oingo Boingo.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.467
Huge fan.

01:08:17.467 --> 01:08:21.300
And now, it’s like I think,
well, am I fan of Oingo Boingo?

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:26.266
And I am not because I work with
these guys almost every day.

01:08:26.266 --> 01:08:29.567
I’ve – me and my brother have performed
with them doing Oingo Boingo music

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:33.100
on stage in these crazy sold-out
Halloween concerts.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.533
It’s funny, cause I go, well,
no I’m not—

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:40.533
I still love their music, but it’s
like a different relationship that I have.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:44.033
And then, that’s my relationship
with music and art has changed

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:46.600
because of my involvement in it every day.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.900
So it isn’t something I enjoy.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.767
I’m sure if any of you guys use
another computer program

01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:56.166
or look at another search engine or another
phone or something you – you’re like,

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.433
can you just enjoy on its own?
Oh, this is awesome.

01:08:58.433 --> 01:09:02.000
I mean, you’re probably all thinking,
you know, the stuff you think everyday.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.133
[laughter]

01:09:05.133 --> 01:09:08.433
Anyway, it’s – it’s a lot of fun.

01:09:08.433 --> 01:09:14.233
It’s – you know, a wonderful dream come
true for me to be able to do this, so.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.400
Bear: On the way, as we’re walking
out, I want to show the “Apocalypse” video.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.367
I think that’s pretty awesome.

01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:25.900
Host: So first of all we’re going to have
a table set up later for Bear to—

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.033
if you have time?
Bear: Yes, yes.

01:09:27.033 --> 01:09:29.367
Host: Sign some things.

01:09:29.367 --> 01:09:32.567
Other than that, thank you all for coming,
and thank you to Bear and Raya.

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:33.266
Bear: Thank you, everyone.
