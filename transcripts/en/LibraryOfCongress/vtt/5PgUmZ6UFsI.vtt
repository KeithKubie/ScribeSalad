00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, CD.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.070
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I want
to than you all so much

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.440 position:56%
for attending the Book Fair here and
for joining us in the conversation

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.830
with Alberto Ruy Sánchez.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.970
We'll be chatting about his Poetics
of Wonder, Passage to Mogador,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.270
am I pronouncing that right?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.570
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Yes, Mogador.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.870
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Close
enough, Mogador.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.170
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Mogador.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.470
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK,
he says it better,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.810
and The Secret Gardens of Mogador.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.210
Both of which have been translated
by a professor from the University

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.670
of Louisville Rhonda Dahl Buchanan.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.910
And for those of you who as yet
aren't familiar with his writing

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.010
and with his life story
I should tell you a bit

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.780
about him just a brief bio.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
Born in Mexico City, attended
the University of Paris.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.870
His first novel Los Nombres
Del Aire, the Names of the Air,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.880
very first novel was awarded the
very prestigious Mexican literary

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.270
award the Premio Xavier
Villaurrutia.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.630
More books follow.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.110
Many books, how many books?

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.410
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Twenty-six.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Jesus.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.290
When do you sleep?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Well,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.480
one of my most recent books is
called In Praise of Insomnia.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.240
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: That's a
wonderful title, thanks.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.610
Then now you know the secret.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.010
In addition to his work as a writer
I want to point out something

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.140
that for those of you who
have spent time in Mexico

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.930
or haven't had the pleasure
of doing so yet, Alberto

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.030
and Margarita De Orellana
is the historian,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.760
a noted historian and
wife and husband.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.060
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
And dance as well.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: And dances as well.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.920 position:56%
You learned to dance in order to
stay married you were talking about.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.860
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Yes,
yes to save my marriage.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.940
Because he's from Cuban
origin he understands.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.080
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: If
not it wouldn't work.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
And I want to tell you about
the magazine the publication

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.370
that they coedit which is
called Artes de México.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.030 position:56%
It is a truly fantastic publication.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.200
It is a publication that
covers the thousands of years

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.670
of art produced in Mexico.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.740
It is a publication that thinks of
art very broadly ranging from, say,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.910
mass of the Mayan culture,
Olmec statues to the mass

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.230
of the luchadores, the wrestlers.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.480
It is an exceptional
publication if you ever come

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.190
across it I urge you to pick it up.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.120
I very much want this conversation
as you can tell already I hope

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.720
to be a conversation, na pratica,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.660
among all of us not just
those of us here on stage.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.030
And I want to urge
you, don't be shy.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.610
I'm not. Please interrupt.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.350
Feel free to interrupt
in either English

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.640
or Spanish however the
spirit may move you,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.030
no need to wait for the end.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.990
Please. You know, I was telling
Alberto that I have two daughters,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.000
one who just turned 13 and
another who is about to turn 8.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.190
And somewhere in the last
year I gave up on trying

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.260
to keep dinner table
conversations on track.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.500
And I realize, A, it was
pointless it was a losing battle

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.750
and there was no point in
getting angry, and two,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.050 position:56%
it's too much fun now that they are
older to not just follow the streams

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.890
of conversation, the
digressions wherever they go

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.400
so I hope we'll do that.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.010
With all that said
let's welcome Alberto.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.310
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.760
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Thank you so much.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.060
Thank you, Luis.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.200
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So we were
just discussing the pronouncing

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.500
of Mogador.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.430
Tell us what is Mogador?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.470
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Well
first of all let me thank you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.500
for preparing this
interview and everything.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.800
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Sure.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.850
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Thank
all the audience for being here.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.780
I know that everyone has
seven chairs so that it can--

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.440
we prepare that for you
so that you can climb

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.290 position:56%
and make a nap it would become soon.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.710
Don't worry.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.900
And of course I want to thank the
Library of Congress for inviting me

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.620
and especially Mexican
Cultural Institute.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.050
Thanks to them I'm here
and I'm really very,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.280 position:56%
very proud of being invited by them.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.910
And well Mogador, Mogador is--

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.740
you know the fascinating
thing about this city that is

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.530
that it existed before
Morocco existed.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.650
It was a base of definitions.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.250
So it is one of the places
where writing was invented.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.030
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So
let's situate it.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.530
We are where?

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.830
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
It's the North

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.370
of Africa on the Atlantic side.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.670
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:08.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And it's a
place where the richness was purple,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.960
the purple color produced
by an animal name anthrax

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.100 position:56%
that you don't kill but you milk it.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.920
It's a little animal.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.680
And in Mexico we have model as the
same that is used in the textiles

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.800
to have these velvet purple color.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.980
So, there is like many, many
links between Mexico and Mogador

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:44.070
that begin it seems the really,
really the beginning of Mogador.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.820 position:56%
There is, first, the color and there
is many stories many, many stories.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.990
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So, do
you travel to Morocco?

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.290
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Oh yes.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.720
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: How
the connection start?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.020
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Well, you know--

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.320
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: How
did the obsession start?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.340
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Well,
you know, the story is very long

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.440
but it began with me getting
in love with a woman, so.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.360
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Isn't that
how most stories start.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.590
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And
so this woman went to France.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.010
And so I went after her.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.610
And we were there as very poor
students and the first winter

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.890
that something terrible
that happens, you know,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.040
that there could be wars
and there could be--

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.650
but winter is something that gets

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.790
into the spirit and
the body of people.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.520
And they forget how to smile.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600
So we needed some sun for many,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.230
many months you don't have
not a little bit of sun.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.970
So we decided to travel to
the cheapest place to go.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:47.310
And we discover something invented
by the French technology of tourism

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.140
and it's called to
travel in fourth class.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.140
And they invented that for the
equivalent of the wood box,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.090
the Moroccan wood box that go work
in Morocco and they spend some

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.140
of their savings in a better travel

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.950
but it is still the
basement of the ships.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.220
So we travel in the
basement of a ship

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.210
to from the South of
France to Tangier.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.520
And there many things happen,
one of them was that we discover

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.390
that we had so many things in
common with Morocco that getting

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.460
into the market in Tangier was
like getting into our crafts market

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.540
in Mexico that many of the
ways of talking with the body,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.140
body language, was similar
many, many, many things.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So let me recap.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.330
So, it sounds like you traveled in
the equivalent of steerage along

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.930
with Moroccan immigrants and you
were surprised to find yourself

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.020
with these connections back home.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.590
You mentioned the experience
of being at the crafts market.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.780
You talked a lot in your book
about music in the South.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.620
Could you tell me about
that connection?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.410
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Well,
you know that there is a link

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:12.710
between the [foreign language]
that comes from India travel

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.310
through Europe and gets to
Spain to the South of Spain.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:24.300 position:56%
And the South of Spain is linked to
Mexico in a way that is unavoidable.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:31.800
So when you go to Morocco you
can hear much of the music,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.780
the ancient music of the South,
of the Arabic South of Spain

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.660
that in Spain the groups
played as classical music.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.510
But the same, exactly the same
music, the same score is play

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.040
by Moroccan musicians
as popular in music.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.440
And, you know, in the popular
in music in Morocco when they

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.350
like something they interrupt it.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.220
They applaud or they say, "Wow."

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.740
But when my first book
was translated

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:11.290
into Arabic they made a party and
they invited a Spanish orchestra

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.430
and a Moroccan orchestra and
they play different things

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.940
and then they play the
same score in their ways

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.730
and at the end they play together.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.030
And it was wonderful.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.330
It was really beautiful.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.660
And so all my work has been about
making links between the South

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.110
of Spain, what we have of
the South of Spain and Mexico

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.800
and even through the language.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.260 position:56%
But the Music, the music of the
language, the taste of the language,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.780
the taste of words, the music

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.400
of words is very much
linked to the Arabic word.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.460
You know that the best historian
of the Spanish is Antonio Alatorre.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.470
He wrote a book called
Mil y Un Años,

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:02.160
1001 years of the Spanish language.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:10.790
And he made an account of 4000
words that we have in Spanish

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.380
that are almost the same in Arabic.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.570
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Including, aceite?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.870
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Azeite

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.960
for example is Arabic,
aceite is Spanish.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.020
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Aceite is oil.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.710
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And so we--

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.840
When we are talking Spanish
we are using Arabic words.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.210
And so is the music for example
when in France to make the sound

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.950
of a hota they use the K, Kh.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.880 position:56%
We don't need that we have the hota.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.450
And we have many, many
words for example

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.870
in Spain they swim in piscinas.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.300
We swim in albercas
which is the Arabic word.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.530
We have the on the buildings
these are the creation

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.530
that is called [foreign
language] which mean laces.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:07.930 position:56%
And in Spain they lost that word and
they only use the word esgrafiado

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.280
which is from Latin origin and
doesn't mean the same at all.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:21.470
So we have like a richness from the
Arabic Moorish world that was lost

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.330
in Spain and we have it in Mexico.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.240
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So let's try and
capture a little bit of the passage

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.250
of your encounters and sense
in Morocco in the passage.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.570
We discuss Alberto will
be the first in Spanish

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.370
and then I'll read the
translation in English.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.670
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: OK.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.970
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: And, I don't know

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.670
if you speak Spanish,
we'll find out.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: They were
teaching me how to say I am Alberto.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.740
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Say it.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:13:24.840
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: They say that music
in Mogador is a natural extension

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.780
of the skin of its inhabitants,
past and present, of their echoes

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.370
in this world of their
harmonious and discord notes

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.760
of their percussive outburst and
fuse of their longing for the sun

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.920
when it goes into hiding and also
of their joy when the moon rises.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.690
In Mogador, skin has an
ancient name that means drum.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.910
It is said that many centuries ago
before corpse was buried they would

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.370
make a drum with its skin.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.060
This would explain why the
very ancient houses are filled

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.390
with beloved little drums
hanging on their walls.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.530
People respect and cherish them
and take them down to touch them

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.870
as a way of remembering
their diseased loved ones.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.380 position:56%
And they often place them exactly
where the trade winds enter the city

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.260
from the sea with a mighty force

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:23.230 position:56%
that shakes the drums producing very
faint and rhythmic low pitch notes.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.020
For this reason the first
illusion wind of the evening

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.940
which revives the drums of the
departed is called requiem wind.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.720
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: I'm
assuming that you choose

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.990
that paragraph exactly
and that subject--

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.290
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Why you said that?

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.530
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Because,
you know, it's one of the--

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:54.270
well of the whole book is about how
we'd call an affirmation of life.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.710
The whole book is about
the importance of erotism.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.580
But erotism is always
linked to death.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.850
And when the book has been
translated to several languages,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:11.130
on each language of course
the erotic part has a role

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:18.600
but also the rituals of death,
the way you deal with that.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.340
So it's like the cultural
element that is in the book

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.880
that many people think
that I imagine things.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.090
Many people think that
there's something

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.180
like imagination, pure imagination.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.850
But in fact, everything that
I'm using is more the less

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:44.060
ethnologically based not only
in Arabic or in my culture

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.930
but in different cultures.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.980
And it goes from the music
to the mathematics implied

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.780
in the structure of the book.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.770
But what the element that is
the more international the one

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:03.610
that communicates the more is the
music of the words and the subject

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:09.100
of the music in all
the books and dancing.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:15.070 position:56%
And it's amazing because-- the death
it happens here, you and we just met

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.600
and the Cuban connection,
OK, I would understand.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.360
But the same happen
in Vietnam for example

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.030
when the book was translated
into Vietnamese.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:29.070 position:56%
One way of communicating what
happens with the book is from music.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.680
And when I went to
Indonesia, the same happened.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.960
So it's like if it was a project.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.260
It's amazing.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:44.260
But of course when you go to Ubud
or in Bali, also the music is

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.300
so important and for
example there was a Mexican,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:55.400
Cobarrubias who made the first
important book on the Bali culture

00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.680
and his main interest
was music also.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.570
So there is a link between
cultures like Mexico and cultures

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.250
from other places in the world
and we got it from music.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.620
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Let me interject
and see if there are any questions?

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.720
Feel free just raise your
hand and speak aloud.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.350
No? Give it one more round.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.790
We'll keep going then.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.910
OK. Or, did we-- did
I cut someone off, no?

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.210
All right.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:36.840
I am a journalist because if I
didn't have deadlines I wouldn't do

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:44.120
anything, and because deadlines
remind me of my mortality.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.420
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: See.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.760
Which is rhythm too.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.060
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Sure.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:57.590
Sure. And you speak in The Secret
Gardens there's a garden of voices.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.140
Maybe let's make in general about
The Secret Gardens of Mogador

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.310
and the interaction
between the narrator

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:14.380
and the protagonist woman
whose name is Hassiba.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.420
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Hassiba.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.430
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: And you
describe her name saying,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.850 position:56%
resembling a light touch, laceration
at the beginning of the word

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:28.340 position:56%
that becomes labio almost suggesting
a kiss in its final two letters.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.170
How do you feel about that
translation by the way?

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.470
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Hmm?

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: How do you feel
about the translation in general?

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.070
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Well, you know,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:40.590
I do believe that translations are
like a musician performing a score.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.240
So I wrote in score then in
Spanish has some music some meaning

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.810
and the translation is the
performance of one musician

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.000
and other will do it differently.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.680
I had several translations in
different languages and you can see

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.480
that for example my first, my
French translator is a [inaudible].

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.060
He is really a genius.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.970
And in different languages
it happens differently.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.040
In English I have three
different translations and none

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.820
of them is as the French one.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.120
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.890
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
But it's also the language

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.500
that at the person.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.230
But, you know, sometimes
when a friend say,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.920
"God with this translator
and go to the other or."

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.220
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Right.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: I do believe

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.530
in the personal link
with the translator.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.980
So I prefer that this
person has a link

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.950
with the work and cares about it.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.130
And if someday will be another way

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.820
of translating it that
will happen or not.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.120
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.020
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: But I
do believe very much, you know,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:54.030
in the magic of the power of
each one of my books to develop

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.650
in the people a kind of
a friendship, not with me

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.140
but with image they have of me.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Sure.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.750
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And
but mainly with the books.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.050
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: The
communion of sorts.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.350
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Yes.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.740 position:56%
There is something that happens with
those books that I cannot control

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.530
and the translation is part of it,
the translation or illustrating.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.870
I didn't tell you that it's five
books, this which is a companion

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:27.630
of the two you have and other three
is illustrated by calligrapher he's

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:33.750
like the Picasso of calligraphy
in the world, his Hassan Massoudy.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.380
He was very kind he gave me
the opportunity to use some

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:46.530
of his calligraphies and he made
another even he made my name

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.830
and everything.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.450
But when I published that
there was some woman who wanted

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.920
to have those calligraphies
as tattoos because they wanted

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.260
to continue inhabiting the books.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.630
So I began to receive through
internet a lot of photographs

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:09.690
of sometimes in places you
cannot show of tattoos of Mogador

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.330
so there is like a legion of
woman who became Mogadorian.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.490
And, you know, an offer cannot
planify [phonetic] that.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:23.420
But the nicest thing and that
happened with [inaudible] border is

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.120
that this final book
which is introduction

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.510
of the book is made
of 81 paragraphs.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:36.240
It's a mathematical formula
that explains the whole book.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.870
And so I couldn't ask my friend 81
illustrations was really too much.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:48.750
So I went to method to learn how
to make calligraphies and I copied

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:54.470
like A, B, C, D, E. So, the
first edition was like that.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.860
And then there was a woman who
translated the book into Italian.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.140
And she was not only happy making a
tattoo of one of the illustrations.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.420
She went to Mogador,
she became the pupil

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.010
of a calligrapher a master
calligrapher and, you know,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.410
it's not only learning a craft
it's like in a spiritual initiation

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.800
and she became a calligrapher
herself.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.440
And her initiation like
her graduation work was

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.840
to illustrate the part of the book

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.160
that was illustrated
by Hassan Massoudy.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.030
And here, in the English
edition, in this one,

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.400
is the first time it's published.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.960
So, in all my books--

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So these are first.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.560
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Yes.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.630
In all my books, when the
first one was published I began

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.390
to receive letters and
the readers were involved.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.420
So, the last example
is really that one.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.270
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So,
let's just repeat

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.040
to make sure we all caught this.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.600
There are tattoos of
calligraphies from the book

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.710
that people are supporting in
interesting places which is

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.690
for those of you who
have not yet read any

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.980
of the work perfectly
appropriate that they should be

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:19.820 position:56%
in very private places because I
mentioned the description of Hassiba

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.820
and there's an awful lot of
love making in these books.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.280
I mean, again maybe that's tied

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.040
to the insomniac nature thing
you were referring to earlier

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.770
but there's an awful lot of-- I've
never seen so many descriptions

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:41.990
of female anatomy in one book and
so politely written I might add.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.330
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Well I tried to.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.020
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: You connect that
vision we were starting to talk

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:55.310
about voices and gardens and
there is again this connection

00:23:55.310 --> 00:24:03.360 position:56%
between Hassiba and sort of a garden
that is fertilizing on steroids

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.690
and all these descriptions
of gardens one

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.290
of which is a garden of voices.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.180
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
OK, we're good.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.480
So--

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.780
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: of the
crickets I referred to.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.080
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Let me
tell you about the whole cycle.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.380
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Please.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.170
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: The
first volume is a research

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.380
on woman's desire it's
called the Names of the Air.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.930
Why the Names of the Air?

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.070
Because when you are in
love, even the air that comes

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.370
through the window has a
name of the person you love.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.580
And that book is about a woman
who is in love with another woman

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:42.710 position:56%
and there is many people who
misunderstand the love of each other

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.380
so like a chain of
misunderstandings.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.450
But it's an exploration
of woman's desire.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.130
The second one is about men's
desire and the third one

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.540
and it's called In Lips of Water.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:05.070
And the third one is about
exploring the possibility

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.510
of a couple making a
paradise, any kind of couple.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:14.490
So there is a woman, a character--

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:20.050
well also that was written
when we already had children.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:27.600 position:56%
And in our marriage we have two
children but we have them after more

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.640
than 10 years of being together.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:36.010
So in pregnancy our eroticism
flourished and it was--

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.480
that doesn't happen
to all the people.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.450
So, I wanted to know why and I made
a research and I interview a lot

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.540
of pregnant woman about her erotic
life while they were pregnant.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.530
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: What did
their husband say about that?

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.440
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Well, I avoid the husbands.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.960 position:56%
In that chapter I avoid the husbands

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.780
but I ask the woman
about he husband.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.640
And, you know, there is
basically three categories.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.980
There is the woman who abandons--

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.230
well first, most of the
men are afraid and escape.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.560
So, some of the woman--

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.860
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Terror is--

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.160
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Terrorized.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:23.640
Men, we are very, very coward
linking to our security

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.210
to the pregnancy of woman.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:32.300
And many woman abandon eroticism
and they don't think about it and.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:39.360
But there is a second category that
is very, very numerous of woman

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.960
who have an intensity of their
erotic life and, you know,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.200
even the water has a different
taste for a pregnant woman.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.460
And those woman many times
have their first relation

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.770
out of marriage in that time.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.070
And that's amazing.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.430 position:56%
That's something that surprise me,
but that happens and I document it--

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.610
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I can see now
why you didn't speak the husbands.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: So I had a
lot of stories that I couldn't tell.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.400
And then there was
a third category--

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.380
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I can't
wait to hear this one.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.880
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: --
of woman, very few of them,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.770
who decided to educate the husband.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:25.680
Many times was were woman who
really believe in the power

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.920
of educating the husband.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:34.800
So, the main Hassiba is one of
those woman and her method is,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.960
well she's the daughter
of a gardener,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.890
the gardener the only gardener in
Mogador and she thinks of garden

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:49.950
as a meth of her paradise and to
challenge her husband and lover

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:55.340
who is beginning not to hear
the desires in her body,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.390
she makes of him a
new male sahara sath.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:04.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: And he has
an obligation to come forth--

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.740
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Challenge--

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:11.910
yes, challenged to tell
a story of desire, tell--

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:17.870
describe a secret garden
of Mogador every night

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.690
if he wants to make love.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.240
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: And he gets
pretty creative I have to say.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.740
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: So, he
is threatened by her saying,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.720
"We will only make love if you
come every night with the garden."

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.600
And he said, "But there
is no more gardens

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.160
than the one your father made."

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.630
She said, "Well a garden is
a place, a space something

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.190 position:56%
that the force of desire transform."

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.380
It could be a collection, it
could be a relation, it could be--

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.070
but mainly it could be a garden.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:02.490 position:56%
And she says, "But you cannot invent
the desire you are telling me about.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:09.080
You really need to bring me
desires that exist and you need

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.200
to invent the way of telling them."

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.160
So when I wrote that I said,
"Wow, I need to do that.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.810
The challenge is against me not."

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.230
I cannot invent anything.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:30.710 position:56%
So, she thinks that if he learns how
to read the desires in the world,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.260
he will become a better
lover especially if he learns

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.990
and invents how to tell them.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.820
And I needed to do to
fulfill the same requirement,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.550
so I spend like five years
almost six years going everywhere

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:54.110
in the world asking for
extravagancies of the people,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.000
you know, inquiring about woman's
desire but also about places

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.050
that the desire transforms so
that a couple could leave, could--

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.350
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So
give me some examples

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.650
of the places that you mentioned.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.980
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: Yes, you
know, for example I was invited

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:17.230
to the University of Kentucky
and there was a museum

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.810
that have a collection of Henry
Moore, this British artist

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.850
who inspired all his sculpture
on Mexican ancient Mayan.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.670
So I said, maybe this--
and it was put on a garden.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.480
So, maybe this garden
will be something

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.680
that the protagonist tells
Hassiba he will like to make love.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.970
And I went and there was nothing
there was only a curator putting

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.030
statues like in order or so.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.780
There was no passion there was not
any extravagant there was really no

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.850
desire-- did desire there.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.150
But I got inside the
museum and what did I find?

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:07.140
I found that some American
millionaires were

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:15.450
in their life collecting the little
cages that Chinese emperors used

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.100
to collect crickets, grasshoppers.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.440
And every one of these little
cages, that is like bird cages,

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.040
little small made of wood
of many, many materials.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.070
Every one of them is a work of art.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.320
And I was astonished by the
size and the beauty of--

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.350
there was more than a hundred.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.100
And I said, "Well, you know,

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.160
here there is the will
of-- there is a desire."

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.630
And I imagine if these
collectors donated these

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.870
to the museum they
surely donated the books

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.870
that they collect linked
to this cages.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:59.180
So I went to the library and
I asked to see the collection

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.250
and there was like, you know,
like 20 books on the subject.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.550
And many of the things that
you can think that I imagine

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.320
when I tell the story they
are true, absolutely true.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.060
And for example there is, not
in China but in Japan, you know,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.210
Japan is take a lot of the
Chinese culture transforms

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.160
and make it something different.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.070
But in Japan there is a kimono
with 12 levels and each one

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:31.070
of that level they put a cricket
that is sensitive to the heath.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:39.760
So when the lover gets the hand
inside the kimono, if he is close

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.170
to the where the cricket
is the cricket sings.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:48.900
Like when a Spanish will way,
"Caliente, Caliente, Caliente."

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.880
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: You know, you
just ruined a child's game from me.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.690
Or maybe better, maybe but.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.400
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: So
every one of the chapters

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.200 position:56%
in the book tells a real desire
that I found somewhere in the world.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.500
Not--

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.800
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK, but--

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.100
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
I just didn't invent

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.730
but I invented the
way of telling them.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:19.080
So for this garden of voices, I
mean, I imagine a homage to Burgas

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.590
and the gardener is a blind man
who takes care of the grasshoppers

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:30.390
and puts plants but only to
be eaten by the crickets.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:36.220
And the whole story is
told in that register

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.110
and that imagined fantasy
register based

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.290
on literal reality,
historical reality.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:51.280
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Now you had to
go to Kentucky to learn about,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.890
and I thought I had turned
off my phone and I was going

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.740
to tell people turn off
their phones, apologies.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.930
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
I can answer it.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.230
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: No.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.530
You know, it's probably my wife

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:06.070
so that wouldn't--
that's not a good idea.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:10.590
She doesn't know where
you are and she does.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:16.310
But the interesting thing about
the Kentucky angle that I have

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.290
to mention for people, a very
[inaudible] of transition there

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.300
if you missed it, is that you are
something called a Kentucky Colonel

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.600
is this true?

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.900
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Oh, yes isn't it amazing.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.110
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I mean I
only know one Kentucky Colonel

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.940
and you don't look like him.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.950
How did this happen,
please tell us--

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:36.430
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Deep fried Kentucky?

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:37.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Exactly, exactly.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.070
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Well, you know,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.900
Kentucky is a very special state.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.200
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Agreed.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.660
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And
they have these beautiful horses

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.000
that look like very fragile and
they're amazingly beautifully but--

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I can't wait
to see where this is going.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:55.320
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And there
is universities and to give honors,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.160
the universities make
the most weird things.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.120
Well, you know, they have
as a governor a wrestler.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.420
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: That's right, yup.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.910
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: A
fighter of Lucha libre, you know,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.890
so you can expect anything.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.890
So when the university wants
to make an honor instead

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.620
of giving you a PhD, an honorary
PhD they made you Kentucky Colonel.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.920
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: I'd
take Kentucky Colonel

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.580
over an honorary degree any day
I think that's a fine offer.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.550
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
But, you know, I receive--

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:31.770 position:56%
the first time I went I was honorary
citizen of Louisville and that was,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.830
well you can say this is the
biggest they gave me like the key

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.130
of the city and everything.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.950
But they continue inviting me

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.590
so the next time they
made me Kentucky Colonel.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:45.040
And so I say, well what
comes next I will--

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.860
the formula-- the secret formula.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.720
I'll make a doggie fried chicken.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.470
The next time, I have
been there four times,

00:35:54.470 --> 00:36:03.990
and the next time I was appointed
as honorary captain of the Belle

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:08.690
of Louisville which is the
oldest steam boat going

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.810 position:56%
in the affluence of the Mississippi.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:14.780
So, that I loved and I wanted
to dive it and they allowed me

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.460
to drive it like for a
kilometer or something like that.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.760
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: That's wonderful.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And the next
time I say, "Well, what comes next?"

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.420
The next time they decided
that the 24th of October

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.580
of that year was dedicated to me
it was Alberto Ruy Sánchez Day

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.880
in Kentucky.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.550
So, you know its paradise.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:39.870
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: You know it's
always wonderful and fascinating

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:43.170
to learn some of the
back story to some

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.240
of the most beautiful
passages of the book.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.850
I mean, that section to me
about the garden of the voices

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.520
and the crickets and
the person who keeps it.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.780
It's beautiful in so far as
references both the beginning

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.780
and the end of the book and the
notion of voices becoming shadows

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.450
and that sort of connection,
but I would not have tied it

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:08.260
to Kentucky Colonels
or steam boat captains.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.990
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: And they
receive every year an invitation

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.700
to go to the derby because all
Kentucky Colonels have breakfast

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.650
with the Governor at the derby.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.020
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Have you
place invited to that?

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.840
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Oh no it's quite far.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.140
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: OK, OK.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.800
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: My
horse didn't run so far.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.180
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: So, in your
case Mogador is both a real place

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:36.790
and imaginary place, right, in the
same way let's say Yoko-Napa County

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:41.850
or Macondo are real and
imaginary at the same time.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:46.170
Is that liberating or is
it more terrifying really

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.820
that to bear that responsibility.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.070
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: You know,
I come from a generation who grow

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:59.980
up reading writers who wrote about
their neighborhood in Mexico City,

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.540
Jose Agustin, [inaudible].

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:07.330
And so even my generation
all my friends, [inaudible]

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:13.000
or the others wrote about their
neighborhood and they had the idea

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.250
that it was a realistic way

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.040
of telling their--
what they were living.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.880
And I always found
that even when we were

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.540
in the same street describing the
same things, it was imaginary.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.070
It was their neighborhood
and it was my neighborhood

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.760
and that you are always
creating something.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.170
So, I think that the real essence
of a place is somewhere else.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:47.000
It's not in the way of telling
things in a realistic way

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.660
but in capturing the essence
of people of, you know,

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:58.960
what people dreams about tells you
much more about the neighborhood

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.250
than describing the
size of the sidewalk.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.040
Sometimes the sidewalk is
meaningful but not always.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.530
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: My brother-in-law,

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.020
brother [inaudible] is a Mexican
artist and one of his works

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.670
of art concerns Mexican
sidewalk just for the record.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.970
Are there questions?

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.270
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
Very good argues by the way.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.570
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Yes,
yes, thank you.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.840
Are there questions that anyone
would like to interject with?

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.550
OK, we'll continue then.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.900
And feel free again to interrupt.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.000
Oh, wait there we go.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.250
Oh wait, we've got a
microphone heading your way.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.280
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask
whether you also looked

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.580
at some literature written

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.490
or some Arabic literature
whether you're inspired by it,

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:54.820
poetry in Arabic for
example from the time of--

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:01.070
you know, medieval caliphate
and I want to just whether

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.440
that was also an inspiration
for you because a lot

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.500
of that poetry also deals
with gardens with desire

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.910
and so I guess all the same topics
that are present in your work,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.380
so I was wondering whether the
literature was also an inspiration

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.680
for you.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.280
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez: The
nice thing about the literature

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.820
of the world is that
you learn that there is

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.520
so many ways of telling things.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.680
So for example in the Arabic
tradition there is one Jaru

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.800
that is called Adab and
it's a mixture of Jarus.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.150
So, that was something
that really inspires me

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.060
but not at the beginning.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:43.940
At the beginning for me, you
know, I come from a family and one

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.090
of my cousins is here,
very close to you, Elsa,

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.060
that is a family immigrated
from the North of Mexico

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.940
from Sonora, from the desert.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:41:01.640
And as immigrated family
we have a lot of gatherings

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:07.200
where the oldest first and
then every one tell stories.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:14.550
So, my grandmother was
a wonderful storyteller.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:20.240
So storytelling, when I wrote
for the first time something was

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.320
because I wanted to
write something to read

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.040
to my family, to tell to my family.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.350
Not only, you know, the
conversation in the dinner, really,

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:36.080
for example the ritual do
you remember Elsa the ritual

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:41.130
of giving gifts in
Christmas was a performance.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:47.000
One of the uncles came and he
invested stories when he saw

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.780
who was giving to whom and he
invented the story about the people

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.530
who was-- who receive the gift and
this story was very imaginative

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:01.300
and everybody wanted to guess and
then to guess what it was inside.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.430
So, when I went to Morocco
one of the things thing

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:11.980
that impress me was a
wonderful amazing tradition

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.560
of telling stories
in the public spaces.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.000
And, you know, there is a square

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.650
in Marrakech called the
square [foreign language],

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.910
which means the square of the dead.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.170
And there, there is a storytellers.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:35.820
And the storytellers are amazingly
alive and they have rituals and I--

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.370
there is a lot of anthropologies
who study them.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:44.150 position:56%
They have for example something that
I try to have on this books and I--

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.820
when I was talking about the twos
and the readers and the people

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.540
who writes me is that
they call it halqa.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.420
Halqa means the audience.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.910
The audience is that always
go surrounding one storyteller

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:06.180
and this storyteller includes
what the audience tells them.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.440
And it becomes part of the story.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:14.490
And as what they tell becomes part
of the story is also the tradition.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:21.590
So, a lot of classics and
a lot of the literature

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.900
that you can learn here in
the university but, you know,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:30.110
one of the nicest things I learned
on the street happen on the ship.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:35.240
On the ship, we went 36 hours
in the basement on that ship

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.760 position:56%
and there was more than a nightmare
there was a storm and really a storm

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.980 position:56%
that put everyone out of their body.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:52.410
Everybody was very,
very, very, very sick.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:58.160 position:56%
And, you know, there was cries there
was the smell, everything was--

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.830
it was so strong and
so hard that you felt

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:06.230 position:56%
that the storm didn't began outside
that came to you but the storm began

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:12.400
in your body and was the trebling
was really projecting towards the

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.850
sky that it was in your stomach
that the storm was beginning.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:20.310
It was really something that you
began and the ship made like that.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:26.780
And you couldn't sleep
of course you vanished.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.720
So we vanished.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:37.190
And we woke up 36 hour later
and there was a light who came

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:42.050
to the basement and there was the
sound that said, well, you know,

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:48.530 position:56%
first class will go down first and
we hear, [footsteps] people running.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:53.970
And then second class and third
class and they were already down.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:58.580
And fourth class, that
was us, and nobody move.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.470
So, my wife and I we were in
the floor like that so we try

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.480
to see there was no one there and
all the people was in the back

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.190
of the room and there was
a man telling a story.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.370
It was a storyteller.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:21.040
And this storyteller
was a storyteller

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.130
from the [foreign language] square.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.920
And he was I notice that he
was telling what we live the

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.260
life before.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.880
He was telling about us.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.930
He was telling about a woman who
wrapped a baby with his shawl

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.760
and the baby was like
planet around it.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.510
There was the story of very
religious people what do you do

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.130
when you are very religious
and you are in a ship

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:49.830
that seems to break down.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.150
You pray. So they put a
carpet and they prayed.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.610
But there was another group who
believed that the maker was not

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.110
in that direction but they
pray in the other direction.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.170
So, like 15 minutes instead

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.040
of praying they were
fighting each other.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.480
And then he was talking about
Mexicans who were very sick

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.470
and very afraid of vomiting and,
you know, the Arabs were very open.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:21.710
And I notice that he was using
the structure of a classic

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:26.820
of the literature called Das
Narrenschiff, The Ship of Fools

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.060
by Sebastian Brant, it's
a 17th century, 1629 book.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.420
And I say that what
are classics for?

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.470
What is the use of classics?

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.720
Is not to have a good degree in
school, is not to know something

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:50.650
to accumulate it, classics gives
you an order where there is chaos.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.020
We were leaving a chaos,
the chaos of storm,

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:58.880
and so there was this man using
a classic to give an order

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.430
and understand something having
a reading of when we leave.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:09.920
In that way I use everything
that I was having access to

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.990
and I spend a lot of
time and I read a lot.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:17.950 position:56%
But, you know, influences never jump
directly from one book to the other.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.810
You eat them and you sweat them.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.870
And influences are in your
books when they are sweat.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:28.640
For example, I have a huge
influence of Samuel Beckett

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.320
because he's a geometrical writer
but read in my book you cannot tell

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.850
that that is, but it is
maybe my main influence.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.250
I have another influence
of Lezama Lima

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:44.520 position:56%
that you know very well is a Baroque
but it is for another reason.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.820
And so sometimes you can
see and you couldn't see.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:50.880
So, the influence I have to go to
the origin of your word wrapping it

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:57.840
up as I was ordered to do.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.290
I used classics but I
use them in that way,

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:07.700
in a very alive way
of using classics.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.520
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: Well thank
you very much to all of you.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.580
I'm sure Alberto will hang
around for a few minutes,

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.960
take a few additional
questions on the side

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.150
but we're being ordered
off the stage.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.560
So thank you very much to all
of you and thank you to Alberto.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.860
&gt;&gt; Alberto Ruy Sánchez:
No, thanks to you, Luis.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.160
Really, you were wonderful.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.980
&gt;&gt; Luis Clemens: That's it.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.600
