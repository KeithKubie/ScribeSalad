00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.250
My friends and I, we play a lot of pranks

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.300
on each other. Today, however, I was on the receiving end

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.910
of one. This morning, I could not find my house keys.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.650
Just then, I got a text message from a friend. We

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.700
have hidden your house keys, said the text message. To find

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.450
them, you have to solve a puzzle. On your computer there

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.080
is a folder with several photos. If you rename all the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.250
files by removing the numbers from the photo name, the photos

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.510
will reveal a secret message and lead you to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.200
the house key. This renaming of 50 files will

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.490
take a long time. I can't wait to solve

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.390
this puzzle so I can get my friends back.
