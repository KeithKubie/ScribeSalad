00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.660
Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
I’m Adriene Hill

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.600
Jacob: and I’m Jacob Clifford. Some of you
might be watching this video in school right

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.970
now, but even if you’re not, you’ve probably
spent a good chunk of your life getting educated.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.460
Adriene: Nearly all countries require at least
some mandatory schooling and most of those

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.560
countries provide that education for free.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.560
Jacob: But nothing is ever actually free.
There’s always an opportunity cost. The money

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.939
and resources that go into education might be used
to fund other social programs or bring down the debt.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.590
Adriene: And if you go to college, the cost
is not just the tuition and books, it’s

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.670
also the income you could have earned by going
straight into the workforce.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.370
Jacob: But is college even worth it? Well,
let's look at the economics of education.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.800
Adriene: Why do governments spend billions
funding universal public education? Why not

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.020
just let profit seeking businesses handle it?
Many argue that if education was entirely privatized

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.820
it’s likely that some children would be excluded,
and that would make society, as a whole, worse off.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.960
Education is a positive externality. Education
benefits individuals by helping them get a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.729
job and earn more income, but it also benefits
society as these individuals create art, invent

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.009
cool stuff, cure diseases, and make interesting
conversation at parties. More education increases

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.920
productivity, GDP, and standards of living.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.899
So, today we’re going to look at the education
system in the United States. We’re talking

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.289
about the US not only because we make Crash
Course in the US, but because education in

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.619
this country is going through a lot of changes.
This way, we get to talk about things like

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.200
education standards, vouchers, and student
debt.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.590
Now, to be sure, there are places that do
things differently. For example, in the European

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.170
Union college costs a lot less than it does
in the US, or is even free.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060
In America, the government pays for primary
and secondary public education and heavily

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:57.140
subsidizes college. In 2015, the federal and
state governments will spend about 634 billion

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.359
dollars on primary and secondary education.
That’s an average of about 12,500 dollars

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.469
per student each year. Which is a lot of money.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.230
And despite all that spending, the US has
some serious problems with its education system.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.069
One of the biggest is inequality. Students
from low income families tend to have lower

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.629
math and reading test scores than those from
higher income families. African American,

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.029
Latino, and Native American students are much
more likely to drop out of high school than

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.980
their White or Asian counterparts.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.120
Jacob: For some economists, the best way to
level the playing field is to focus on funding.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.680
They argue that the government should pay
for early education programs, and provide

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.180
extra money for disadvantaged and
low-income students.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.799
For others, the answer isn’t just about
more funding, it’s about having more competition.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.330
Some economists support charter schools and
voucher programs that allow parents to pick

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.049
schools, or open enrollment among or within
school districts.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.810
Now in theory, this forces all schools to
improve, or face losing their funding. Other

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.140
economists focus on the teachers, and argue that they
should be incentivized to improve student performance.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.519
Each of these ideas have been implemented
in the US, with varying success. We have yet

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.030
to find the magic formula, but it’s clear
that the first step to improving equality

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.069
is to invest in primary and secondary education.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.290
Now, what about higher education? Is that
a good investment? Well, keep in mind that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.019
there are many reasons – not all of them
economic - to go to college, and to be educated

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.230
in general. People go to college because they
enjoy learning and want to know more. Or maybe

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.290
they want to put off getting a real job. But in economics,
we focus on financial benefits. So, is college worth it?

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.920
The fact is, college graduates, on average, earn more.
Economists call this the “College Wage Premium.”

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.620
Among 25-32 year-olds, college grads earn 
an average of $45,000 vs $28,000 for those who only

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.840
have a high school diploma. Also, the unemployment
rate for college grads is pretty much always lower.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.240
Right now, for people over 25 with a college degree,
unemployment is around 3%. Now, that's vs. around

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.140
5.4 percent for those with only a high-school
diploma. And it’s 8.6 percent for those who didn’t

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.060
finish high school. So bam – college pays
off, case closed.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.340
Adriene: Well, not quite. The people who graduate
from college are NOT a randomly selected group.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.560
First, it takes a modicum of intelligence
and dedication to even get into college. Second,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.040
you have to receive a fairly good primary and secondary
education to be able to keep up with college work.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.220
Third, the students who attend college are
more likely to come from well-off families

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.140
with educated parents who have the time and
energy to help encourage their success.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.430
So when you compare college grads to those
with less education, you’re often comparing

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.320
people from advantaged backgrounds to people
without many of those advantages. The fact

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.870
that college graduates make more money isn’t
just about college. It’s also about life

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.840
circumstances. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble:

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.490
Jacob: Economists point out two main explanations
for why college graduates earn more. The first

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.540
is the “Human Capital” theory. The idea
is that going to college actually teaches

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.960
you skills that’ll help you get a higher
income job. The second theory is called “Signalling.”

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.460
This is the idea that some students have shown
they're smart and hard-working, but in a job interview,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.350
EVERYONE is going to claim “Sure, I’m
smart and hard-working!” even applicants

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.980
who aren’t. So the talented applicants need
something else to validate their abilities

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.620
that can’t be faked by others. A college
degree sends a clear signal. "Look at me!

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.160
I graduated Summa, and I’ve got the notarized
transcripts to prove it!"

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.750
Many employers would prefer an applicant that
has an actual Harvard degree over one that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.860
has an equivalent self-taught education. But
a college degree isn’t only about signaling

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.380
ability, we could accomplish that with a test
that would take one day and $100, rather than

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.380
4 years and potentially hundreds of thousands
of dollars. College degrees send other signals

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.580
about socio-economic status and background.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.820
BOTH the human capital theory and the signalling
theory are compatible with the data: both

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.780
predict that college graduates would earn
more, which is what we see.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.180
But economists have tried to figure out which
theory is correct. They have compared the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.940
earnings of people who have earned 7 ½ semesters
worth of college credits but didn’t graduate,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.440
to people who finished and got a degree. Both
groups received about the same amount of education,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.450
so if the Human Capital theory is correct,
they should earn about the same amount of

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.450
money. If the Signalling theory is correct,
those with degrees should earn noticeably

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.250
more, and they do. But it’s a smaller gap
than you would find from just comparing high

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.170
school and college grads. It seems that both
theories apply.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.460
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. Okay, so we
know that there are significant financial

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.950
benefits to completing college. But what about
the costs? Going to college can be really

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.440
expensive. Often more than most families can
afford. In the US, students have over 1 trillion

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.530
dollars of debt. That’s more than Americans
owe on their cars or their credit cards!

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.360
More students are attending college than ever,
and more of those students are paying for

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.970
at least part of their education with loans.
In 2012, almost 70 percent of students took

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.210
out loans to pay for tuition, and the median
amount they borrowed was around 27,000 dollars.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.540
By comparison, in 1993, the median amount
students borrowed was around 12,500 dollars.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.080
And that’s just the median. So even if some
of the hand-wringing over the total amount

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.230
of student debt is overblown, the average
student really is taking on a larger burden.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.720
So, this is all thanks to higher tuition,
right? Well, not exactly. At four-year public

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.030
universities, the average cost of tuition,
room and board has gone from $10,600 dollars

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:12.120
in 1994 to $18,900 in 2014, when you adjust
for inflation. The average tuition at comparable

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:20.460
private universities has risen from $26,500
to $42,400 during the same period.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.180
But that rising tuition number is the “sticker
price” for college – in fact, most students

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.750
receive very substantial discounts. Students
from wealthy families, with not-so-great SAT

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.610
scores might pay that full sticker price,
but once you factor in cost reductions from

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.330
scholarships, fellowships, grants and other
sources, many students pay substantially less.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.000
Once you adjust for discounting, the rise
in net tuition has been kind of modest.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.600
So, why all the debt? Well, for-profit colleges
and universities might be contributing to this.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.560
Students at these schools tend to take
on more debt than students at public schools

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.060
or private non-profits. It’s also possible
that student debt is rising because graduate

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.180
school enrollment is up. And grad students
borrow more than undergrads.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.660
Another reason tuitions are increasing is
because the actual cost of running a college

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.340
is higher than a few decades ago. As some
schools compete for students and their money,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.960
some of them build luxurious dorms, climbing
walls and gourmet dining to attract revenue.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.920
Another possibility is that colleges now employ more
administrators and pay them a whole bunch of money.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.740
Jacob: So, in cold, hard, merciless dollars,
does it make sense to spend – or borrow

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.839
- a bunch of money on a college degree? Well,
it depends a lot on the degree you get, but

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.079
on average the answer is, yes -- as long as
you finish!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.379
Many of the worst student-debt horror stories
involve students who racked up large debt,

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:44.750
but were unable to finish college. And that’s
surprisingly common: Every year in the US,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.149
60% of high-school graduates enroll in college,
but only a little over half actually graduate

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:51.519
within 6 years. That’s right: only half.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.550
But what about students that don’t have
the means or the inclination to go to a four-year

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.720
university? Are they doomed to live in squalor?
Well, no, but again better money can be found

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.060
in careers that require specific training
and skills, which can be learned through a

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.560
community college or through an apprenticeship.
The average car mechanic earns $40,000 a year;

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.960
the average plumber earns $50,000; and the average
electrician $55,000. And as more young people

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.240
opt to go to college and as older people in these careers
retire, most economists expect these wages to rise.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.740
So what is the final conclusion? Is college
even worth it? Well, I guess in the end, we

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.360
have to say, it depends. It depends on where
you go to school; how much you pay for your degree;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.520
and it depends on what degree you get.
And, of course, on what you want to do with your life.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.360
Adriene: Education isn’t just another thing
that you buy. It isn’t only about individual

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.100
gain. There’s a social aspect, too. We want
everyone to have access to quality education

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.850
because having an educated populace benefits
all of us. Education can also be a powerful

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.060
tool when it comes to reducing poverty and
addressing income inequality, and we're gonna

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.230
talk about that next time. Thanks for watching!
