00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt;In a few days the world leaders are gathering
in Davos at the World

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.939
Economic Forum to discuss how to improve the
state of the world.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.610
My name is Loic Le Meur, and I'm going to
moderate the social

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.430
networking panel of Davos.
All the main social network leaders will be

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.480
there.
Twitter, MySpace, Ning, Facebook, LinkedIn,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.350
all of them.
You can participate in the debate by asking

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.400
a question which we will
show during the conversation in front of all

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.789
those world leaders.
Here's how you do it: You go to YouTube.com/Davos,

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.961
you press submit a
question button, and then you can ask a question

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:43.829
or leave a comment.
Here's a question: Has the rise of social

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.219
network improved society?
The videos with the highest number of votes

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.059
will be displayed in front
of the world leaders and we will discuss it.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.840
So go ahead do it now.
