we're at the kitchen table and we have

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
we're at the kitchen table and we have
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.760
we're at the kitchen table and we have
toothpicks we put down one toothpick and

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
toothpicks we put down one toothpick and
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.789
toothpicks we put down one toothpick and
we notice it has two ends so at each end

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
we notice it has two ends so at each end
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.950
we notice it has two ends so at each end
we put a toothpick the toothpicks are

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
we put a toothpick the toothpicks are
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280
we put a toothpick the toothpicks are
all the same length ideally we started

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
all the same length ideally we started
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.709
all the same length ideally we started
with one and we added two so now we've

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
with one and we added two so now we've
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.050
with one and we added two so now we've
got three toothpicks we notice now there

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
got three toothpicks we notice now there
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.260
got three toothpicks we notice now there
are four ends so on each end we put a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
are four ends so on each end we put a
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630
are four ends so on each end we put a
toothpick and these toothpicks actually

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
toothpick and these toothpicks actually
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.810
toothpick and these toothpicks actually
touch so those ends are no longer free

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
touch so those ends are no longer free
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660
touch so those ends are no longer free
and we keep going we do this forever so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
and we keep going we do this forever so
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089
and we keep going we do this forever so
the next generation this is the fourth

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
the next generation this is the fourth
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.240
the next generation this is the fourth
step we had for free ends we're gonna

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
step we had for free ends we're gonna
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.229
step we had for free ends we're gonna
add four more toothpicks those those two

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
add four more toothpicks those those two
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.330
add four more toothpicks those those two
toothpicks met at the middle so those

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
toothpicks met at the middle so those
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220
toothpicks met at the middle so those
ends are no longer free so now their

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
ends are no longer free so now their
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979
ends are no longer free so now their
word there are four ends so we add four

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
word there are four ends so we add four
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.450
word there are four ends so we add four
more toothpicks now we've got eight free

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
more toothpicks now we've got eight free
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720
more toothpicks now we've got eight free
ends so we add eight to things and we

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
ends so we add eight to things and we
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420
ends so we add eight to things and we
keep going and the question is how many

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
keep going and the question is how many
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.299
keep going and the question is how many
toothpicks do we have after n

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
toothpicks do we have after n
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.650
toothpicks do we have after n
generations is there a formula well this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
generations is there a formula well this
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.380
generations is there a formula well this
is a very lovely question let me show

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
is a very lovely question let me show
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530
is a very lovely question let me show

Bell Labs made an animation of this and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
Bell Labs made an animation of this and
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.460
Bell Labs made an animation of this and
a number of related sequences there we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
a number of related sequences there we
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.429
a number of related sequences there we
see one toothpick next we added two

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
see one toothpick next we added two
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.300
see one toothpick next we added two
toothpicks next next this is where we

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
toothpicks next next this is where we
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249
toothpicks next next this is where we
got to now we're going to add eight and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
got to now we're going to add eight and
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770
got to now we're going to add eight and
now we have 12 three ends we're going to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
now we have 12 three ends we're going to
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.410
now we have 12 three ends we're going to
add twelve two things and so on so let's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
add twelve two things and so on so let's
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160
add twelve two things and so on so let's
watch it run we see it growing when we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
watch it run we see it growing when we
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130
watch it run we see it growing when we
get to power of two we notice something

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
get to power of two we notice something
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469
get to power of two we notice something
special happens we have essentially a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
special happens we have essentially a
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050
special happens we have essentially a
square that's full of toothpicks there's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
square that's full of toothpicks there's
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670
square that's full of toothpicks there's
no room in the middle to add any more

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
no room in the middle to add any more
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010
no room in the middle to add any more
toothpicks there's a horizontal line of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
toothpicks there's a horizontal line of
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660
toothpicks there's a horizontal line of
toothpicks at the top in the bottom and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
toothpicks at the top in the bottom and
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.840
toothpicks at the top in the bottom and
there are four free ends so by the rule

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
there are four free ends so by the rule
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.260
there are four free ends so by the rule
at step 17 we're gonna add four

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
at step 17 we're gonna add four
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120
at step 17 we're gonna add four
toothpicks the new toothpicks are always

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
toothpicks the new toothpicks are always
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.480
toothpicks the new toothpicks are always
blue so we've just added four and now if

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
blue so we've just added four and now if
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.609
blue so we've just added four and now if
we keep going and you can see it growing

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
we keep going and you can see it growing
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.139
we keep going and you can see it growing
from the corners now the interesting

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
from the corners now the interesting
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.719
from the corners now the interesting
thing is that the growth from the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
thing is that the growth from the
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.559
thing is that the growth from the
corners after 16 generations

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
corners after 16 generations
 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.780
corners after 16 generations
it's the same less the growth in the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
it's the same less the growth in the
 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.209
it's the same less the growth in the
corners after 32 so let's let it run

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219
corners after 32 so let's let it run
 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.429
corners after 32 so let's let it run
Freddie had my Harriet so we're coming

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439
Freddie had my Harriet so we're coming
 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.039
Freddie had my Harriet so we're coming
up to a new power of two one hundred and

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049
up to a new power of two one hundred and
 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.990
up to a new power of two one hundred and
twenty eight generations and again it's

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
twenty eight generations and again it's
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.580
twenty eight generations and again it's
growing and it's growing from the corn

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590
growing and it's growing from the corn
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.699
growing and it's growing from the corn
it's hypnotic isn't that it's wonderful

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709
it's hypnotic isn't that it's wonderful
 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.949
it's hypnotic isn't that it's wonderful
yes but you can do this on your on your

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959
yes but you can do this on your on your
 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.349
yes but you can do this on your on your
computer at home and you can see it's

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359
computer at home and you can see it's
 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.789
computer at home and you can see it's
growing and it's obviously a fractal

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799
growing and it's obviously a fractal
 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.649
growing and it's obviously a fractal
like structure the growth from the

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659
like structure the growth from the
 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.379
like structure the growth from the
corners is has the growth from the

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389
corners is has the growth from the
 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.809
corners is has the growth from the
corners the corners grow like earlier

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819
corners the corners grow like earlier
 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.059
corners the corners grow like earlier
corners grow and it grows and grows and

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
corners grow and it grows and grows and
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.990
corners grow and it grows and grows and
grows and the question is how many

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
grows and the question is how many
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.809
grows and the question is how many
toothpicks do we have after n

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819
toothpicks do we have after n
 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.729
toothpicks do we have after n
generations and I'll show you in a

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
generations and I'll show you in a
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.159
generations and I'll show you in a
minute how we analyze this but there are

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169
minute how we analyze this but there are
 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.550
minute how we analyze this but there are
others that we were not able to analyze

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
others that we were not able to analyze
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.920
others that we were not able to analyze
so when you look at the see car in the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
so when you look at the see car in the
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.210
so when you look at the see car in the
sky it looks like that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
sky it looks like that
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280
sky it looks like that
so that's actually a toothpick it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
so that's actually a toothpick it
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.800
so that's actually a toothpick it
happens to be bent and it's got three

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810
happens to be bent and it's got three
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.440
happens to be bent and it's got three
ends the rule is the same every free end

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
ends the rule is the same every free end
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.349
ends the rule is the same every free end
you add a toothpick only this time

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359
you add a toothpick only this time
 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.559
you add a toothpick only this time
they're going to fix now we've got four

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569
they're going to fix now we've got four
 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.490
they're going to fix now we've got four
wingtips

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500
wingtips
 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000
wingtips
so we go there and they're there and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
so we go there and they're there and
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.110
so we go there and they're there and
let's let it run and swatch it admire it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
let's let it run and swatch it admire it
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.920
let's let it run and swatch it admire it
growing this is much more difficult we

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930
growing this is much more difficult we
 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.259
growing this is much more difficult we
have not analyzed this here the growth

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269
have not analyzed this here the growth
 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.479
have not analyzed this here the growth
from the corners is different at each

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
from the corners is different at each
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.180
from the corners is different at each
power of two it's still every power of

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190
power of two it's still every power of
 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.719
power of two it's still every power of
two it fills up a square as much as it

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729
two it fills up a square as much as it
 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.930
two it fills up a square as much as it
can but the growth in the corners is

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940
can but the growth in the corners is
 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.780
can but the growth in the corners is
much less predictable we even thought to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790
much less predictable we even thought to
 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.629
much less predictable we even thought to
make a double toothpick like Omar Omar

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639
make a double toothpick like Omar Omar
 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.099
make a double toothpick like Omar Omar
Pole yes

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109
 
 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.750
 
isn't that wonderful let me show you a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760
isn't that wonderful let me show you a
 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.240
isn't that wonderful let me show you a
couple of others before I show you a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250
couple of others before I show you a
 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.890
couple of others before I show you a
little bit of the mathematics of the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900
little bit of the mathematics of the
 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.750
little bit of the mathematics of the
analysis which is actually just as

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
analysis which is actually just as
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.960
analysis which is actually just as
pretty as the picture but a different a

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970
pretty as the picture but a different a
 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.809
pretty as the picture but a different a
different style II toothpick and see how

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819
different style II toothpick and see how
 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.499
different style II toothpick and see how
that looks

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509
that looks
 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.849
that looks
run yeah yes this is very Christmasy

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859
run yeah yes this is very Christmasy
 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.039
run yeah yes this is very Christmasy
snowflake II and again we don't have to

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
snowflake II and again we don't have to
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.270
snowflake II and again we don't have to
stand this at all

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
stand this at all
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.610
stand this at all
we know how to generate it but we don't

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620
we know how to generate it but we don't
 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.020
we know how to generate it but we don't
have a formula

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030
have a formula
 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:37.970
have a formula
how many E's a toothpick star

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980
 
 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.620
 
we go back to normal toothpicks now so

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630
we go back to normal toothpicks now so
 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.659
we go back to normal toothpicks now so
here are ten generations and you notice

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669
here are ten generations and you notice
 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.300
here are ten generations and you notice
that after eight generations we have a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310
that after eight generations we have a
 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.030
that after eight generations we have a
square which is almost full as full as

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040
square which is almost full as full as
 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.950
square which is almost full as full as
it can be there's no room to put a

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960
it can be there's no room to put a
 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.620
it can be there's no room to put a
toothpick there are no free ends in the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630
toothpick there are no free ends in the
 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.500
toothpick there are no free ends in the
square there are only four free ends so

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510
square there are only four free ends so
 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.080
square there are only four free ends so
after eight generations we add four

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090
after eight generations we add four
 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.490
after eight generations we add four
again it's just like at the beginning

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
again it's just like at the beginning
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.620
again it's just like at the beginning
one two three four we have eight free

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630
one two three four we have eight free
 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.240
one two three four we have eight free
ends so we add eight and we get there

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250
ends so we add eight and we get there
 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.820
ends so we add eight and we get there
and so on now in if we look at a corner

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830
and so on now in if we look at a corner
 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.760
and so on now in if we look at a corner
and it's focus on a corner so after a

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770
and it's focus on a corner so after a
 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.320
and it's focus on a corner so after a
power of two what we're left with is a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330
power of two what we're left with is a
 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.570
power of two what we're left with is a
square with no no holes in it it's full

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580
square with no no holes in it it's full
 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.510
square with no no holes in it it's full
up and at each of the four corners

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520
up and at each of the four corners
 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.909
up and at each of the four corners
there's half a toothpick sticking out

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919
there's half a toothpick sticking out
 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.700
there's half a toothpick sticking out
the first step is all we can do is add

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710
the first step is all we can do is add
 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.800
the first step is all we can do is add
one toothpicks there and we'd of course

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810
one toothpicks there and we'd of course
 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.659
one toothpicks there and we'd of course
add one at the other four corners now

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669
add one at the other four corners now
 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.820
add one at the other four corners now
the next generation this has two free

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830
the next generation this has two free
 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.290
the next generation this has two free
ends so we add two toothpicks okay now

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300
ends so we add two toothpicks okay now
 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.230
ends so we add two toothpicks okay now
we have three free ends so we add three

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240
we have three free ends so we add three
 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.750
we have three free ends so we add three
more tooth which I'm now at generation

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760
more tooth which I'm now at generation
 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.940
more tooth which I'm now at generation
what is it one two three we're gonna be

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950
what is it one two three we're gonna be
 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.630
what is it one two three we're gonna be
able we've still got three free ends we

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640
able we've still got three free ends we
 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.390
able we've still got three free ends we
add one two three and now we have one

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400
add one two three and now we have one
 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.670
add one two three and now we have one
two three four free ends so we had four

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680
two three four free ends so we had four
 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.340
two three four free ends so we had four
toothpicks and so on after I think this

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350
toothpicks and so on after I think this
 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.770
toothpicks and so on after I think this
is seven steps it looks like that

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780
is seven steps it looks like that
 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.219
is seven steps it looks like that
and if you stare at this you see that

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229
and if you stare at this you see that
 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.129
and if you stare at this you see that
it's really made up of three clumps the

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139
it's really made up of three clumps the
 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.860
it's really made up of three clumps the
corner sequence after whatever it was

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870
corner sequence after whatever it was
 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.440
corner sequence after whatever it was
seven more steps and this is true for

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450
seven more steps and this is true for
 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.110
seven more steps and this is true for
any power of two it's not just you know

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120
any power of two it's not just you know
 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.469
any power of two it's not just you know
there if you go out to 128 steps we

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479
there if you go out to 128 steps we
 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.320
there if you go out to 128 steps we
still see the same growth 256 it still

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330
still see the same growth 256 it still
 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.390
still see the same growth 256 it still
starts the same it grows more and more

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400
starts the same it grows more and more
 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.790
starts the same it grows more and more
because there's more room when we're out

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800
because there's more room when we're out
 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.700
because there's more room when we're out
at 256 but the beginning is the same

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710
at 256 but the beginning is the same
 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.010
at 256 but the beginning is the same
always when you look at it you notice

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020
always when you look at it you notice
 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.550
always when you look at it you notice
that after a power of two beyond where

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560
that after a power of two beyond where
 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.779
that after a power of two beyond where
we were we have three clumps and so pay

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789
we were we have three clumps and so pay
 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.080
we were we have three clumps and so pay
careful attention to how many there are

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090
careful attention to how many there are
 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.629
careful attention to how many there are
we find as a formula and I was using L

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639
we find as a formula and I was using L
 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.750
we find as a formula and I was using L
for the number

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760
for the number
 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.360
for the number
in one of these clumps and here we've

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370
in one of these clumps and here we've
 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.570
in one of these clumps and here we've
got three clumps two clumps which are

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580
got three clumps two clumps which are
 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.570
got three clumps two clumps which are
seventh generational clumps and one

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580
seventh generational clumps and one
 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.640
seventh generational clumps and one
which is eighths generation and we get a

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650
which is eighths generation and we get a
 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.270
which is eighths generation and we get a
formula and when we actually put all the

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280
formula and when we actually put all the
 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.440
formula and when we actually put all the
pieces together we find that we can

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450
pieces together we find that we can
 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.930
pieces together we find that we can
explain the corner toothpicks I won't

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940
explain the corner toothpicks I won't
 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.970
explain the corner toothpicks I won't
really go into the details but there's a

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980
really go into the details but there's a
 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.670
really go into the details but there's a
very nice formula which explains after

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680
very nice formula which explains after
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.500
very nice formula which explains after
we've gone for a power of two plus I

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510
we've gone for a power of two plus I

further steps where I is one two three
 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.820
further steps where I is one two three
four five and so on there's a formula

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
four five and so on there's a formula
 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.740
four five and so on there's a formula
for the number in the corner which

depends on K the power of two and I and
it's a very nice recurrence

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240
it's a very nice recurrence
 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.140
it's a very nice recurrence
once we've noticed this recurrence that

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150
once we've noticed this recurrence that

so it does not get turned on I'll put a
 

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.240
so it does not get turned on I'll put a
zero that like why is that's a zero and

zero that like why is that's a zero and
 

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.870
zero that like why is that's a zero and
that's a zero but this cell here does

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880
that's a zero but this cell here does
 

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.940
that's a zero but this cell here does
get turned on because it's got only one

on or off and once you're on you stay on

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:51.340
on or off and once you're on you stay on
 

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.070
on or off and once you're on you stay on
and there it is it starts off with one

and there it is it starts off with one
 

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.500
and there it is it starts off with one
cell on there it is it's blue because

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:56.510
cell on there it is it's blue because
 

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.630
cell on there it is it's blue because
it's a new cell ok

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
it's a new cell ok

it's a new cell ok
next it turns on its four neighbors and

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120
next it turns on its four neighbors and
 

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.270
next it turns on its four neighbors and
next it turns on four neighbors again if

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.280
next it turns on four neighbors again if
 

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.760
next it turns on four neighbors again if
did not turn on that one because the

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.770
did not turn on that one because the
 

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.860
did not turn on that one because the
rule is you turn on if exactly one of

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:08.870
rule is you turn on if exactly one of
 

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.879
rule is you turn on if exactly one of
your neighbors

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:09.889
your neighbors
 

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:12.069

is on this one has two neighbors that

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079
is on this one has two neighbors that
 

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:14.049
is on this one has two neighbors that
are on so it stays off it is not

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:14.059
are on so it stays off it is not
 

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:17.859
are on so it stays off it is not
infected if we let it run again it's

00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:17.869
infected if we let it run again it's
 

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:20.679
infected if we let it run again it's
gonna grow up and again you'll notice

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:20.689
gonna grow up and again you'll notice
 

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:23.319

and again we can analyze it in the same

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279
and again we can analyze it in the same
 

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:32.109
and again we can analyze it in the same
way and this one is even simpler there's

00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:32.119
way and this one is even simpler there's
 

00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:35.199
way and this one is even simpler there's
a simple formula for how many cells are

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:35.209
a simple formula for how many cells are

there's a pattern of black and white

00:12:33.369 --> 00:12:33.379
there's a pattern of black and white
 

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:35.949
there's a pattern of black and white
cells at the next power of two we see a

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959
cells at the next power of two we see a
 

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.590
cells at the next power of two we see a
different pattern it does not repeat it

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
different pattern it does not repeat it
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.319
different pattern it does not repeat it
is very complicated and over there I

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:41.329
is very complicated and over there I
 

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:43.749
is very complicated and over there I
have a very large piece of paper with my

00:12:43.749 --> 00:12:43.759
have a very large piece of paper with my
 

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:46.780
have a very large piece of paper with my
attempt to analyze it but you want to

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:46.790
attempt to analyze it but you want to
 

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:54.120
attempt to analyze it but you want to
see it yeah of course yeah

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.130
 
 

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.580
 
this is my attempt and it's not finished

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:57.590
this is my attempt and it's not finished
 

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.160
this is my attempt and it's not finished
I haven't given up but I haven't solved

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.170
I haven't given up but I haven't solved
 

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.200
I haven't given up but I haven't solved
it yet this starts down here in the

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:02.210
it yet this starts down here in the
 

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.070
it yet this starts down here in the
corner here and then it grows and it

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.080
corner here and then it grows and it
 

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.030
corner here and then it grows and it
grows and it grows and every you if we

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040
grows and it grows and every you if we
 

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.120
grows and it grows and every you if we
look here you can see this is sixteen so

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.130
look here you can see this is sixteen so
 

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.690
look here you can see this is sixteen so
this is where we were after eight each

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:16.700
this is where we were after eight each
 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.330
this is where we were after eight each
power of two we we get a closed hexagon

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:19.340
power of two we we get a closed hexagon
 

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.840
power of two we we get a closed hexagon
I'm just showing you one sector one

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:22.850
I'm just showing you one sector one
 

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.160
I'm just showing you one sector one
sixths of the whole pizza just a slice

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.170
sixths of the whole pizza just a slice
 

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.170
sixths of the whole pizza just a slice
so after sixteen the we have that after

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.180
so after sixteen the we have that after
 

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.830
so after sixteen the we have that after
32 it's like that and then if life was

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:35.840
32 it's like that and then if life was
 

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.320
32 it's like that and then if life was
simple there would be a predictable

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:38.330
simple there would be a predictable
 

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.080
simple there would be a predictable
pattern but there isn't if you look at

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.090
pattern but there isn't if you look at
 

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.180
pattern but there isn't if you look at
these squares the colored squares the

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.190
these squares the colored squares the
 

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.780
these squares the colored squares the
red squares there are not like the red

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:49.790
red squares there are not like the red
 

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.970
red squares there are not like the red
squares that we saw earlier there are

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:51.980
squares that we saw earlier there are
 

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.790
squares that we saw earlier there are
some similarities so I haven't given up

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800
some similarities so I haven't given up
 

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.020
some similarities so I haven't given up
but this is really tricky I think this

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.030
but this is really tricky I think this
 

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.200
but this is really tricky I think this
one is doable but some of the others and

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.210
one is doable but some of the others and
 

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.930
one is doable but some of the others and
there are a lot as you saw there there

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:04.940
there are a lot as you saw there there
 

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.230
there are a lot as you saw there there
are 100 or more animations that you can

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240
are 100 or more animations that you can
 

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.940
are 100 or more animations that you can
look at it and some of them are very

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:09.950
look at it and some of them are very
 

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.490
look at it and some of them are very
beautiful I particularly wanted to show

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:12.500
beautiful I particularly wanted to show
 

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.730
beautiful I particularly wanted to show

here at the University of Cambridge
asked me if I could solve it and I did

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:23.420
asked me if I could solve it and I did
 

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.860
asked me if I could solve it and I did
it was on the margin of what what could

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:26.870
it was on the margin of what what could
 

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.690
it was on the margin of what what could
be solved and what couldn't but it was

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:28.700
be solved and what couldn't but it was
 

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.870
be solved and what couldn't but it was
the rule is it's similar to the Olin

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880
the rule is it's similar to the Olin
 

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.620
the rule is it's similar to the Olin
Warburton you turn on if the number of

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:35.630
Warburton you turn on if the number of
 

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.490
Warburton you turn on if the number of
neighbors that's on is odd not one as it

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:39.500
neighbors that's on is odd not one as it
 

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.710
neighbors that's on is odd not one as it
was for that Warburton if it's two e's

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720
was for that Warburton if it's two e's
 

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.320
was for that Warburton if it's two e's
you turn off but an odd number you turn

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:44.330
you turn off but an odd number you turn
 

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.250
you turn off but an odd number you turn
on yeah

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:48.260
on yeah
 

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.620
on yeah
well the pictures are beautiful look at

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:50.630
well the pictures are beautiful look at
 

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.150
well the pictures are beautiful look at
this here's the first 16 generations and

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160
this here's the first 16 generations and
 

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.420
this here's the first 16 generations and
then when you look at 32 generations you

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:58.430
then when you look at 32 generations you
 

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.900
then when you look at 32 generations you
ask can we break it up into pieces that

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:01.910
ask can we break it up into pieces that
 

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.000
ask can we break it up into pieces that
look like things we've seen earlier and

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.010
look like things we've seen earlier and
 

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.190
look like things we've seen earlier and
the answer is yes you can but it's a

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.200
the answer is yes you can but it's a
 

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:12.180
the answer is yes you can but it's a
little tricky

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.190
 
 

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.440
 
and the reason it's called Friedkin's

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:14.450
and the reason it's called Friedkin's
 

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.910
and the reason it's called Friedkin's
replicator is if you have some shape any

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920
replicator is if you have some shape any
 

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.600
replicator is if you have some shape any
shape you like say that then after a

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:22.610
shape you like say that then after a
 

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.700
shape you like say that then after a
certain number of generations you see

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:24.710
certain number of generations you see
 

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.940
certain number of generations you see
two copies of it it replicates itself

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:27.950
two copies of it it replicates itself
 

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.910
two copies of it it replicates itself
that's why Friedkin being a famous

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920
that's why Friedkin being a famous
 

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.080
that's why Friedkin being a famous
computer scientist at MIT studied many

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.090
computer scientist at MIT studied many
 

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:51.270
computer scientist at MIT studied many
things like this mathematical things and

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:51.280
things like this mathematical things and
 

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.040
things like this mathematical things and
so I found the game of life was sort of

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.050
so I found the game of life was sort of
 

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.290
so I found the game of life was sort of
overshadowing much more important things

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:56.300
overshadowing much more important things
 

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.990
overshadowing much more important things
and I did not like it we agree on that

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000
and I did not like it we agree on that
 

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.670
and I did not like it we agree on that
right two and three chance you've chosen

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680
right two and three chance you've chosen
 

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.220
right two and three chance you've chosen
a goat so this scenario of course should

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.230
a goat so this scenario of course should
 

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.960
a goat so this scenario of course should
be of more interest to us it's the more

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:04.970
be of more interest to us it's the more
 

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.570
be of more interest to us it's the more
likely scenario
