00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.240
Everyday, each one of us entertains in the caverns of our minds

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.680
a host of secretly very enjoyable, but deeply taboo ideas and scenarios.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.780
We fantasize about the downfall of rivals, sudden wealth and fame,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.160
being able to reverse and accelerate time, eliminating colleagues,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.200
anticipating the stock market, thinking of the death of various people, even a few we're meant to love,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.520
and of course, of having sex with a huge variety of entirely inappropriate people

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.160
in a plethora of highly forbidden or just pretty non-standard ways.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.760
The presence of these fantasies can be hugely dismaying and shame inducing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.780
We contain in our minds enough explosive material to set our world aflame many times over.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.380
But in truth, having fantasies that are sharpely at odds with reality

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.680
is a fundamental feature of good human lives.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.620
It started when we were very young, as a child we might've enjoyed imagining going to the South Pole,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.860
wresting and then making friends with a polar bear, adopting a pet penguin with a broken wing,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.180
and then spending the night in an igloo before getting rescued by pirates,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.620
cruising past in a four-masted nuclear powered ship.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.700
In the real world this would be, by turns, horrific, impossible, dangerous, and in breach of maritime law.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.200
But in our heads, it's lovely.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.240
Make-believe is so enjoyable because it takes a scalple to experience

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.800
and cuts away everything that would be genuinly awful in reality.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.880
We don't worry about children fantasizing; we're confident about the many secure and obvious barriers

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.740
between having a thought and doing something about it in the world.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.200
We should extend the same understanding to ourselves, as adults.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.540
A fantasy isn't a plan, it's a disguised, but very precise acknowledgement

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.940
of what would never work, but needs to be aired.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.220
In it's form, it's testement to our acceptance of the way things actually are.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.420
We fantasize, instead of preparing.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.420
This is what distinguishes us from genuinely terrifying people.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.520
Those who, rather than fantasize, put things into action.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.680
The origin of fantasy is not a failure to understand reality, it is rather a deep appreciation of reality,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.540
which, for the sake of inner relief, has been briefly suspended.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.620
The legal system, which makes such a strong distinction between a thought and an action,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.460
a fantasy, and an enactment, is the guardian of a very important truth and basic liberty,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.020
which has taken many hundreds of years for humanity to secure and must never again be blurred.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.120
Civilized societies don't have thought crimes.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.200
Yet, should it still worry us that fantasies occur to us at all?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.340
Isn't it terrible that some pretty shocking thoughts do pop up into our minds,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.700
even if we know they are just thoughts?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.980
A fantasy is always trying to tell us something important about ourselves,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.560
even though the message usually arrives in garbled forms.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.580
A fantasy about wealth isn't really a political thesis about the allure of drastic inequality,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.120
it's a way we talk to ourselves about stress and anxiety

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.660
We're imagining a life in which we didn't have to worry

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.100
Our complex sexual fantasies are ways of acknowledging certain needs

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.200
we know we had to sacrifice in the name of loyalty to people we love,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.140
but which we need to hang on to nevertheless.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.060
At the root of our guilt around our fantasies is that we don't know anything like enough

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.560
about the inner lives of other people.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.480
We don't realize how deeply normal our so called, "oddest thoughts", actually are.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.360
You can be certain that the most apparently private thoughts your harboring in utter shame

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.740
are active fantasies in the minds of millions of others, right now.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.340
Our fantasies aren't signs of evil, they are natural products of the brain,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.860
the result of the powerful fact that our minds need to imagine the impossible

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.380
to come to terms with the forbidding, sober nature of reality.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.700
Thinking that our fantasies are pretty weird isn't evidence they actually are,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.880
it's a sign we don't yet know other people well enough.
