long-standing slide but when I think

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180
long-standing slide but when I think
 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.420
long-standing slide but when I think
about the time I spent for example in

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430
about the time I spent for example in
 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.060
about the time I spent for example in
1991 in Moscow and and the kind of

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070
1991 in Moscow and and the kind of
 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.920
1991 in Moscow and and the kind of

01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:32.089
England about the it's is it too is it
 

01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:33.609
England about the it's is it too is it
the government channel or is it the

01:05:33.609 --> 01:05:33.619
the government channel or is it the
 

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:35.109
the government channel or is it the

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119
anti-government channel and I do you
 

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.430
anti-government channel and I do you
know it goes back and forth but it

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440

we get here but I do think I guess I

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.250
we get here but I do think I guess I
 

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:44.740
we get here but I do think I guess I
guess we could only hope that there's

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:44.750
guess we could only hope that there's
 

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.290
guess we could only hope that there's
something in the middle because i'm not

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:47.300
something in the middle because i'm not
 

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.930
something in the middle because i'm not
sure that they're not sure the model of

that breath of broadcasting really
really makes a lot of sense anymore but

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:56.630
really makes a lot of sense anymore but
 

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:58.060
really makes a lot of sense anymore but
i think there's there's got to be

01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:58.070
i think there's there's got to be
 

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:01.150
i think there's there's got to be
something in between and I guess if we

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160
something in between and I guess if we
 

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.520
something in between and I guess if we
can learn lessons from what what the BBC

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:03.530
