PRESENTER: I wanted to welcome
you all to another outstanding

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.850
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.990
I can only do very little in
terms of introduction here.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.520
The true expert is fellow
Googler Stephanie McClellan.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.230
But she did give me a few
pointers as we introduce our

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.330
latest speaker today.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.220
Michael Romano is here speaking
about his book, which

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.490
is called "The Family Table."
It's a story of chef and staff

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.480
meals at the Union Square Cafe,
which is where he is the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.810
culinary director.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.650
And this James Beard-winning,
massively awesome restaurant,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.780
massively awesome staff, really
takes the concept of

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.520
enlightened hospitality
to heart.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.950
And so that's truly apparent in
the staff meal, which is in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.190
essence what you feed
the folks that are

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.440
on staff for you.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.190
Very similar to how we approach
life at Google.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.750
And so we will have some time
for questions at the end.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.430
And for now, please join me in
welcoming Michael to Google.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.680
Thank you very much.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.660
MICHAEL ROMANO: Hi.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.100
Thank you for coming.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.310
Very excited to be here.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.110
Great to see Stephanie
up on the screen.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.470
So I don't know, it's a little
embarrassing, coming here to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.590
talk to you about staff meal,
because you have the most

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.130
amazing facility here.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.410
I just got a tour.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.010
I just had a wonderful lunch
at Long Life, was it?

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.500
Long Life Cafe?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.370
And I'm very jealous.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.960
You have the most incredible
food facility I've ever seen.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.500
I was at the New York Google
office, and that was pretty

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.100
spectacular.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.500
But this is amazing.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840
Very excited about
our new book.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.690
This is my third cookbook.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.990
The first two are "The Union
Square Cafe Cookbook," and the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.110
second one was called "Second
Helpings from Union Square

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.100
Cafe." Kind of turned out to be
a bad name, because people

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.820
thought it was a book about
leftovers, but it's not.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.750
And they've done very well.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.470
But this one is very exciting.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.380
I don't know if any of you are
authors, or have written a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.090
book or anything.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.220
But you work very hard at
it, sometimes for years.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.180
And then it gets processed and
put together and published.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.790
And the moment when they put it
in your hands is a really

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.850
amazing moment.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.340
It's like welcoming a newborn
into the world.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.930
And it's just very exciting.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.790
Because you never know.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.140
You never know really what it's
going to look like until

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.160
there it is, in your hand.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.450
So the idea for this book,
"Family Table," is that every

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.290
day in our restaurant, twice
a day, the staff-- which is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770
always referred to as
family, by the way.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.160
The cooks don't say, I'm
making staff meal.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.140
They always say, who is
making family today?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.190
It's just a tradition
in our business.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.360
And every day, they sit down to
a meal at lunch and dinner.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.970
So we thought that in itself
would be an interesting topic

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.926
for a book.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:09.970
What is the food that is being
prepared for these people?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.340
And it's not the food that we
are preparing for you, the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.970
guests who come to
our restaurants.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.950
Quite different.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.240
And then there was another
thought that entered into

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.220
this, which really convinced
us that we

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.660
should do this book.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.520
And I say we-- this is my
co-author, Karen Stabiner--

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.670
was all the stories about the
folks who work in our

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.260
restaurant.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.950
So we have over 2000 employees,
which I know here

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.430
seems like nothing.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.850
But for us it's pretty
amazing.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.050
And so all the people--

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.350
and some of them have been with
us for over 20 years,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.450
because our oldest restaurant,
the Union Square Cafe, where I

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.270
started as executive chef.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.580
Is going to be 28 years
old this October.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.160
So we have people who've
been with us for

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.060
a really long time.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.580
And what happens, of course,
is they develop a kind of a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.220
connection to the place that
goes beyond if you're there

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.090
for a year or two.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.770
They're connected to the
history of the place.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.790
They carry it around with them,
and they teach this.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.120
They are the keepers of the
history and the everything

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.570
that goes into making
our places.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.160
And they teach this to the young
people coming in, the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.500
new people coming into
our restaurants.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.060
So we thought, well, that also
would be an interesting topic

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.280
to put together in a book
along with the recipes.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.420
So that's essentially
what we've done.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.120
We've got great recipes, and
we've got great stories about

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120
the folks who populate
our restaurants,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.940
and make them alive.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180
They bring the spirit, the
soul to the restaurants.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.060
And without that, a restaurant
is not really terribly

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.110
interesting.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.020
It won't ever be great if it
doesn't have that soul.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.270
So what's interesting about the
recipes, I think, is that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.010
you have these cooks, right?

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.210
And has anyone here ever
worked in a restaurant?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.930
Ah, see that?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.025
There's a few.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:05.260
The cook will be assigned
to do family.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.090
And he or she will have
certain parameters.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.100
They'll be very pressed
for time.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.270
That's always a given.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.230
Because they have their
own work to do.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.000
It's not like it's a dedicated
cafeteria, where they're just

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.230
doing food for staff.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.210
They have to do their
other work as well.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.690
So they'll have very
limited time.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.970
They'll have definite parameters
as to what they're

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.790
going to use for the food.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.800
We don't want to ever see
truffles going out to the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.720
dining room for the staff,
and things like that.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.230
So they have to make quick
decisions, work quickly, and

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.280
come up with tasty
food in a hurry.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.500
And I find that has a tremendous
synergy with

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.280
someone cooking at home for a
family, because you probably

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.840
face the same kinds
of constraints.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.730
The parameters are
about the same.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.970
So we hope that that is going
to be an enticement to folks

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.070
cooking at home.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.590
Because they'll see recipes here
that can be done pretty

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.410
quickly, they're very tasty,
and not going to tax your

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.330
pocketbook too much.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.970
But you're going to enjoyed
them, and they're going to

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.790
broaden your repertoire
of things that

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.040
you can cook at home.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.950
The other thing is something
that I hadn't really planned

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.900
on when we started the book.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.980
Was the racial ethnicity
across this

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.730
book is pretty amazing.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.830
Because the cooks are cooking
wherever they've come from--

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.710
they're Dominican, or
Mexican, or Asian.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.890
They bring this to the
food that they know

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.380
and love to the table.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.400
And so we have a great diversity
in the book of

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.360
different recipes and different
flavors, which I

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.650
think is really a lot of fun.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.680
I'm also hoping something
for this book.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.441
This is a little deeper,
a little bit

00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:04.330
of a long term hope.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.580
But I know that's out there,
certainly in the television

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.520
world, there's a kind of a
notion that persists, I guess

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.740
because it makes good
television, that restaurants

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.050
are places where there's a lot
of screaming going on, and

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.470
people are really getting
emotionally

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.920
beat up and put down.

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.650
That kind of persists throughout
our industry.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.710
And I'm hoping that this book
will just make a little dent

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.280
in that perception.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.790
Because it shows how well
people can be treated.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.300
We don't do all that
stuff, and I never

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.070
did that as a chef.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.430
So I want people to see a
different side of the

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.300
restaurant business.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.500
People have asked me, why is
staff meal, why is family

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.480
table so important?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.500
And I tell them for
two reasons.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.490
One is physiological.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.160
Meaning that you need
to be nourished.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.150
If you're working in a kitchen
or dining room,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.770
it's difficult work.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.740
It's challenging work.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.800
You're on your feet
for a long hours.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.980
And if you're in the dining
room, you're facing guests,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.670
and you always have to bring
a level of hospitality, of

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.150
upbeat energy to it.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.360
So if you're not fed, and you're
thinking about how

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.110
hungry you are, and you're
around all this food, and

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.059
you're serving this food, you're
going to be distracted.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.270
And you're going to be serving
someone their chicken, and

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.530
you're going to be thinking,
I wish I had a

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.320
piece of that chicken.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.530
I want to take a little piece
right off of that

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.700
plate and eat it.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.600
And your mind is going to be
not focused so much on what

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.040
you're supposed to be doing.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.910
And at the most basic level, you
need the energy to be able

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.790
to carry on and do the job.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.220
So that's number one.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.560
Number two is the psychological
aspect to it,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.390
which is cooking good food
and serving good food--

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.740
and again, you folks know
this very well here--

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.710
is a way of taking
care of people.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.580
And when you take care of people
in that way, people

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.570
feel taken care of.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.530
And they appreciate it, and they
have a reciprocal kind of

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.910
experience, where they feel good
about the place they're

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.450
working in.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.210
And this is a great
example of it.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.080
So the folks in our restaurants,
if they're well

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.030
taken care of that way, they're
fed, and also they

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.220
feel, this place
cares about me.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.850
They care enough
to serve food.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.540
I know at one of our
restaurants, Gramercy Tavern--

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.490
that was our second one
to open, in 1994--

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.780
I'm always amazed at how
carefully the food that goes

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:53.920
out for family is labeled with
a lot of details about what's

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.450
in the food.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.740
So that someone who doesn't want
to eat pork, or doesn't

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.880
want to eat gluten, or
things like that will

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.730
know ahead of time.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.220
And believe me, that
is not the norm in

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.200
the restaurant business.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.480
Often in the restaurant
business, it's if you get a

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.450
meal, it's like, here it is.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.762
And if you don't like it, too
bad, and you can just go out

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:15.070
and fend for yourself.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.490
So I'm really happy and
proud to see that

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.460
kind of thing go on.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.030
And Gramercy was a big
contributor in this book, and

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:30.630
they did it really, really
joyfully and willingly, and

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.590
they were very proud
of the book itself.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.290
That was really a great
aspect to it.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.260
I noticed after the book came
out, and I showed it around to

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.410
people who contributed the
recipes, they were very proud

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.330
and they were just delighted.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.070
And they couldn't wait to get
a copy and take it home and

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.470
show their families that
they were in this book.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.620
And there's many pictures
of the staff.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.360
And they were proud that they
had contributed to the book.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.650
From my perspective--

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.650
I mentioned before that I have
already done two cookbooks--

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.060
a big challenge of this book,
which made it, in a way, the

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.810
most difficult work I've done,
was that in my first two

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.170
books, the Union Square Cafe
books, the recipes that you

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:31.170
find in there are my recipes
that I mostly created myself

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.240
and was cooking at
the restaurant.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.140
So they were road-tested,
so to speak.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.480
They were broken in, we knew
people liked them.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.180
So really, the challenge for the
book was just to get them

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.510
from restaurant quantities and
restaurant technique to work

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.920
well for the home cook.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.310
And that's not all
that difficult.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.480
So it was an exercise in
transcribing these recipes for

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.120
the home cook.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.390
This book, these are
not my recipes.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.490
These are the recipes that the
cooks in our restaurants put

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.180
together every day
for the family.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.920
So the job became getting with
them, trying not to upset

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.060
their routine and their schedule
too much, but trying

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.800
to extract from them what
it was they were making.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.330
And believe me, they were
not using recipes.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.830
They were not putting
a teaspoon of this,

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.620
and a cup of that.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.100
They were just throwing stuff
together, literally, and

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.440
coming up with some
good-tasting food.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.400
But, as we say, on the fly.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.590
So Karen Stabiner, my co-author,
did a lot of the

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.260
legwork of getting in there and
trying to pull out from

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.890
the cooks what it is
they were doing.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.660
And believe me, they were
sometimes wildly inaccurate.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.730
A cook might say, yeah, I put
about a cup of that in there.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.640
And really it was
a tablespoon.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.870
So then, when I got the first
draft raw recipe handed to me

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.260
and set about testing them in
the kitchen, because we want

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.500
to make sure that they work, I
was getting some wild results.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.520
Oh, this is not going to work.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.380
It just wasn't right.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.190
And I knew what had been
served was good.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.780
So I had to bridge that gap
between what had been served,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.770
and what I saw on the page, and
make them come together.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.230
And sometimes I exercised a
little bit of executive

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.150
privilege and tweaked it here
and there, so that I knew that

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.990
this was going to be
a good recipe.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.930
Sometimes I thought,
well, this needs a

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:30.580
little bit of this.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.800
So I didn't hesitate to add it,
because it's all in the

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.750
spirit of "The Family Table."

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm proud of the recipes, and
I think they came out well,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.020
and I think you're going
to enjoy them.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.426
How many of you actually
cook at home?

00:13:45.426 --> 00:13:46.980
Oh, almost everybody.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.060
That's great.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.230
I got the right audience
here, this is good.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.690
So I'm going to tell you in
a very un-objective, very

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.280
subjective way, my favorite
recipe-- because I get asked

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.470
that a lot in the book--
is my mother's lasagna.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.180
Now, you wonder why my mother's
lasagna is in this

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.340
book, because it's not something
we might serve to

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.350
the family in our restaurants.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.730
There's a category of
recipes in here that

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.160
came from the chefs.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.780
Now, the chefs in restaurants
don't cook family meal.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.310
They're busy doing other things,
and they assign it to

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.640
the cooks, the line cooks.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.180
So we thought, well, we'd like
to include them in there,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.420
because they probably have some
really great recipes.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.820
So we asked the chefs to
contribute recipes that they

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.380
might cook at home for their
families, or had been cooked

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.360
for them when they were growing
up by their family.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.530
And that's how we got these
group of recipes in here, and

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.260
that's how my mother's lasagna
wound up in here.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.600
Because that's, for
me, the number

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.310
one memory of childhood.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.340
It was always a very special
time when she made it.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.520
She didn't make it that
often, because it's a

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.930
fair amount of work.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.500
But when she did, my sister and
I were always delighted,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.530
and it was always
so wonderful.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.330
And so I had to go back
and research, and

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.695
find how she did it.

00:15:06.695 --> 00:15:10.870
What ingredients and what
proportion she used.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.820
My brother-in-law helped a
lot, because he's a great

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.900
cook, and he used to
watch my mother.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.780
She's no longer alive.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.210
But thank god, he noted down
what she used to do.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.410
So we pieced it together, and
it came out really well.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.040
And if you make it, I promise
you're going to enjoy it.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.300
And one of the things she
did was to make--

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.970
her meatballs were
really wonderful.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.270
So she would make the meatballs,
cook the meatballs

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.530
in the sauce, and then actually
slice them and lay

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:42.280
them out, shingled, as the meat
layer in the lasagna.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.070
So instead of just having a
sloppy joe kind of ground meat

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.690
in there, these were seasoned,
held together, beautiful.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.060
And they're very tender,
you'll see if

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.990
you make the recipe.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.640
They're intentionally
very soft.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.030
So that when you eat it in the
lasagna, it's just this whole

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.970
sort of amalgam of--

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.190
and then the cheese layer is
really wonderful, so it all

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:04.710
works together.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.160
We had a book party for press
in New York just before the

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.250
book came out, and that was one
of the dishes I served.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.390
And nobody wanted to leave
until was all gone.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.930
And I got a lot of great
comments, which is very

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.090
gratifying.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.005
And there's a number of other
recipes that I really love.

00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:28.000
There's one called
Dominican Beef.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.420
So-called because the fellow who
makes it, Viktor, is from

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.570
the Dominican Republic.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.050
And he started as a porter--

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.580
that is to say, would be
receiving deliveries, and

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.110
keeping the basement in order.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.980
And then he graduated
to a prep cook.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.070
And occasionally, he would make
this wonderful beef stew,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:48.450
essentially.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.060
It was very simple.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.790
It was a handful
of ingredients.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.550
But it's so delicious.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.610
Some magic happens
when he makes it.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.990
And I would always look
forward to the days

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.540
when he made that.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.750
And now, the current chef at
Union Square Cafe, Carmen

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.900
Quagliata, actually put the
dish on the brunch menu.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.400
So there's an example
of a dish that did

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.640
make it to the guest.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.650
And we're very proud of it.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.160
And Viktor is just overjoyed
with having his recipe not

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
only in the book, but
on the menu as well.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.240
And the photography is a fellow
named Marcus Nilsson.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.150
I think he's from Finland.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.480
Very interesting guy.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.450
Did some wonderful
photography.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.740
It's a little edgy.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.563
A lot of them have
black background.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.800
And I love the way
things came out.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.350
Everything is very unstaged, in
a way, especially the shots

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.140
of the people who
made the food.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.830
I hope that you can get a
sense of the people's

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.960
personality through the profiles
that are written in

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.410
the book, and then see through
the food that they contributed

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.310
a little bit of that personality
come through.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.420
Because it's for me is
really clear, because

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.420
I know these people.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.830
It's a fun part of the book.

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:23.110
I have long, long memories of
staff meals, family meals,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.570
back to the '70s, when I was
working in Europe, and France,

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:32.860
and Switzerland, where I first
saw this institution of the

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.340
staff sitting down.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.480
Although in France, and in
Switzerland as well, we never

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.260
ate together with
the dining room.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.750
The kitchen ate separately
from the dining room.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.470
And that was something
I wasn't too fond of.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.250
And when I came to Union Square
Cafe in 1988, I wanted

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.900
everybody to eat together.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.030
And that's what we still do.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.780
In the main dining room,
everyone sits.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.110
The cooks will will sit together
with other cooks

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.540
because they want to talk about
things, and the servers

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.860
will sit with themselves.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.250
And in Union Square Cafe in
particular, there are the

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.290
staff members--

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.980
that being the oldest
of our restaurants--

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.520
who have been there for such a
long time that they have their

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.820
seats, and that's where they
sit for family meal.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.870
And the new person is quickly
informed, you don't sit there.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.130
That's so-and-so's seat.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.330
But in a very benign way.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.120
It's just people get
very comfortable.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.750
Again, it feels like their home,
because they're made to

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.830
feel so comfortable
and taken care of.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.640
Which is, again, clearly
something that's going on here

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.300
in an amazing way.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.040
You have so many things here
that can help you get things

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.030
done that you need
to get done.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.330
I'm seeing laundry rooms, I'm
seeing all kinds of--

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.520
it's astounding.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.270
So you understand that concept
very well, and taken it to a

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.120
much greater degree.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.190
But our family table is our
attempt at doing that.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.690
I was talking to my partner,
Danny Meyer, before leaving on

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:12.420
the book tour.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.870
And he said, maybe there are
always certain criteria.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:22.030
And they kind of change, they're
kind of topical.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.550
Criteria by which people
judge, or prejudge, a

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.110
restaurant from what they've
heard about.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.820
These days it would be, do they

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.805
practice sustainable cooking?

00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:34.440
Is it organic cooking?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.880
Is its farm-to-table?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.530
Is it seasonal?

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.140
These kinds of parameters.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.540
And he said, maybe just maybe
people will start to think

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.600
about, hmm, I wonder how they
treat their staff, in terms of

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.950
the staff meal?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.580
Because by and large, people
don't think about that when

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.530
they go to a restaurant.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.400
What does the staff eat?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.830
I don't know if it occurs
to them that the

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.110
staff eats as well.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.120
And that's part of a bigger
picture, I think, of the

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.470
question of, how well is
the staff treated?

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.830
Because I go back to the days in
Europe, and I won't mention

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.580
names or places, but it was
not always the rule.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.430
We were treated kind
of harshly.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.420
It was not uncommon, in the
kitchen for example,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.280
certainly, to be screamed
at, and to be even hit,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.090
physically, or have things
thrown at you and whatnot.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.200
And the dining room also was
kept on a very short

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.280
leash, so to speak.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.340
And then you're expected to turn
around and be genuinely

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.960
kind and hospitable to the
guests, which I always find to

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.100
be a very difficult maneuver.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.970
Because it seems to me--

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.320
and again, this is why it kind
of bothers me to see this

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.730
prolonging of this idea of the
chef as screamer, someone who

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.880
just wants to vent on the staff
and belittle people.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.100
Picture if you're in a
restaurant, you're a guest in

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.850
a restaurant, and you are
looking at the menu.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.230
And you see something you
like, but you don't

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.100
necessarily want it the way
it's written on the menu.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.890
I'd like this, the roast
chicken, but could I get it

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.100
with the garnish that's
with the steak here?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.660
And so you're going to ask
your server, right?

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.070
So imagine two scenarios.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.690
If your server knows that when
he or she goes back into the

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.130
kitchen and asks the chef, she's
going to get her head

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.570
chopped off.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.520
She's going to get screamed
at and really get

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.790
hassled from the shelf.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.710
How is she going to react to
you, with your request?

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.060
Some part of her is going to
cringe, and be saying, I wish

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.440
you hadn't asked me that.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.260
But on the other hand,
the other scenario.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.580
If the chef is also genuinely
hospitable and kind, and says,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.970
sure, we'll make that work.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.480
No problem.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.630
She's going to have, or he's
going to have, a much more

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:04.010
open spirit, and be much more
accessible to you as the

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.200
guest, and give you better
hospitality.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.070
And one of the most wonderful
things I've ever heard my

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.660
partner Danny say, Danny
Meyers, describing the

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.090
difference between service
and hospitality.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.760
He says, service
is a technique.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.010
It's a one-way street.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.660
It happens to you,
as the guest.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.620
How well your plate is
presented, how well your plate

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.750
is cleared away, how well the
wine is poured, have you got

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.130
the right cutlery.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.820
That's the service.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.300
Hospitality is a dialogue.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.630
It has to happen between you and
what you want and what you

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:46.570
need, and the server, who has to
be listening so that he or

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.350
she understands what you
as a guest need.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.130
We have an idea how we're
going to present

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.280
our product to you.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.520
But you are going to have ways
that you want to modify that.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.410
Either subtle ways, or
not-so-subtle ways.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.730
And we have to be open to
hearing that, and engaging

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.750
you, and finding a way
to make that happen.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.670
And then you're going
to be happy.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.130
You're going to be
comfortable.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.330
I think here, what I see
around here, is a real

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:18.750
dialogue of what do you need, in
terms of you being in this

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.100
workplace, to be productive,
to be happy--

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.960
and therefore more productive?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.650
And there's a lot of effort made
to provide that for you.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.640
So it's the same.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.440
It's the same kind of
hospitality that

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.640
we're talking about.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.730
AUDIENCE: It's just an
interesting idea to think of

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.330
all the chefs at some of these
really amazing restaurants

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.550
just sitting around
having dinner.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.140
And I'd be terrified to
cook for them all.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.770
Is there a hands-off policy,
you're not allowed to critique

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.336
family dinner?

00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:45.732
MICHAEL ROMANO: No!

00:24:45.732 --> 00:24:48.020
AUDIENCE: When they serve it, is
it kind of like, all hands

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.960
on deck critiquing it?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.040
I just would be terrified
to serve.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.030
You're talking about, they have
a little bit of time,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.300
they're not as experienced
as the other chefs.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.056
I would think that that would
be kind of a terrifying

00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.760
experience.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.140
MICHAEL ROMANO: It could be
for a new person, maybe.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.960
But I think it's an opportunity
for that person to

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.830
step up and show what
they can do.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.760
Because this is not
something--

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.240
The chef has a menu.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.230
And the cooks prepare the menu
according to the chefs wishes

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.940
of how it should be done.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.440
So there's not too much
room for personal

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440
interpretation there.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.470
Sometimes you'll get in trouble
if you do that.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.590
But for cooking family meal, you
do have room to interpret.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.600
So it's a chance for
you to speak.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.380
If you're a timid person, then
yeah, you might be a little

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.250
nervous about it.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.050
As far as feedback, people
will give feedback.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:49.860
Hopefully in a kind way, and
not a destructive way.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.830
And it's not about, oh, I
thought this needed a little

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.200
bit more salt, or you
should've put

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.520
a little bit more--

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.700
No.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.420
Basically, what I've seen over
the years, is feedback when

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.350
people feel they're not getting
enough of a certain

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.220
type of nourishment, or it's
getting too monotonous, we're

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.705
having the same thing
every day, or

00:26:05.705 --> 00:26:06.860
there's not enough variety.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.910
That's a big one.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:08.680
That's really a big one.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.590
If it's hot dogs and sauerkraut
every day for a

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.300
week, you're going to have
problems, and people are going

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.710
to speak up about it.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.360
It's an opportunity for a cook
to show that he or she is

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.990
genuinely interested and
cares about cooking.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.250
Because I have a great deal of
concern and skepticism about a

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.340
cook who's saying to me, yeah,
I love to cook, I want to

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.270
learn, I want to be great,
and then makes a

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.890
miserable family meal.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.696
Food is food.

00:26:38.696 --> 00:26:41.360
If you're trying your best to
do my menu and cook those

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.560
dishes, but when it comes to
doing family you just put out

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.550
anything, that shows something
about you.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.740
It tells me something about you
and your level of caring,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.310
which is a big concern.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.810
So it's a good way to assess.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.920
And then on the other end of
the spectrum, you see cooks

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.980
who really put their heart and
soul into it, and they want

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.850
family to be great, and they
love the positive feedback

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.110
that comes to them
from the staff.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.030
Like, great meal!

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:06.790
That was so good!

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.065
That kind of thing.

00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.460
But thanks, that's
a good question.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for coming.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.060
MICHAEL ROMANO: Oh,
my pleasure.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.860
AUDIENCE: I've actually had
the pleasure of going to a

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.100
number of your restaurants,
which are great.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.000
And I know that they all have
very different personalities.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.800
So I'm wondering a little bit
about the difference in the

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.290
atmosphere and the setup of
family meal between the

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.610
restaurants.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.350
And then the second question is,
I know your staff may move

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.530
between restaurants.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:43.810
So as they move, have you seen
favorite family meal dishes

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.580
move from restaurant
to restaurant?

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.260
MICHAEL ROMANO: Yeah.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.350
So the first question.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:54.260
Definitely the way the meal
is set up and the way it's

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.970
served, or the way people eat,
is very much in line with the

00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:59.980
feeling of the restaurant.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.580
From very casual, like our
barbecue restaurant, Blue

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.770
Smoke, to--

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.270
One of the restaurants that's
included in the list, and

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.750
there are recipes from it,
is 11 Madison Park, which

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.910
actually is no longer
our restaurant.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.890
The chef and GM, who are two
incredibly talented guys,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.780
decided they wanted to buy
the restaurant from

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.300
us, and they did.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.110
And so they're off on
their own doing it.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.420
But at the time that we started
writing this book, it

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.820
was part of the family.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.370
And that was a little bit
more formal, and the

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.540
meal reflected that.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.180
And both the food that was
cooked in the way it was

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.000
presented, you could
see the difference.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.420
You could definitely
see the difference.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.720
And for me, it's fun because I
can get to go to any of the

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.250
family meals that I
want, and get that

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.640
feeling from each one.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.670
Now for cooks--

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.310
yes, you're right.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.870
Cooks do migrate, I like to call
it, from one restaurant

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.360
to another.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.145
If they happen to be the cook
that gets on the line and

00:28:55.145 --> 00:28:57.600
makes family, I'm sure they're
going to bring stuff from one

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.840
to the other, although
I don't have

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.530
concrete examples of that.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:08.310
And they'll get to see what
one family meal is like as

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.840
opposed to another.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.100
There are differences,
I have to say.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.580
Stylistically, and also I keep
coming back in my mind to

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.020
Gramercy Tavern, which seems,
almost every day, to serve an

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:28.370
outstanding variety, and a
tremendous amount of care goes

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.230
into the meal.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.020
It's an interesting experience
to visit a few of them and see

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.570
the differences.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.320
And thank you all very much
for your attention.
