So, a number divided by itself is 1,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.000
It works for things too like eggs.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.980
So let's say I have two eggs and

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.630
I divide them by two eggs.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.922
What does that equal?

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:22.384
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.320
Think about it.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.140
I know this is a weird question, but I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.840
