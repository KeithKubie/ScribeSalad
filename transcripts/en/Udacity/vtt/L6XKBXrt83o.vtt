The last question we're going to talk about today came from Elise.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And Elise got really excited by the discussion that Wes was having

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with the CTO of Mozilla.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
She wants to know how do you create a programming language?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What goes into it?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, the good news is that's what we're doing in this course.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We just happen to be creating all the materials needed

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to interpret and run programming language that exists,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that is JavaScript, and interpret html,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is just how to display something.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But that's how you build a programming language--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
exactly what we're doing in this course.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The only difference is that you would change the syntax

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and all the features to how you would want it in a language of your choosing.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But this is the course, and I hope by the end

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you'll get a very clear picture of what would go into doing such a thing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
All right, well, thank you for your answers, Peter.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And thank you all for your questions.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Thank you, as well. And thank you for being here, Andy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Thanks to everyone. &gt;&gt;Everyone gets thanks.

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
See you next week.
