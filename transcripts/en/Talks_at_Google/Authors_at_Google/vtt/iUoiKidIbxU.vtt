KATIE GRAY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.700
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.590
My name is Katie Gray, and I
work at the presentation design

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.410
firm Duarte, where
these ladies lead.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.090
And I actually used
to work at Google,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.830
so it's exciting to
be back here and I'm

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.320
honored to introduce them.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.722
So Nancy Duarte, she's
the CEO of Duarte.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.430
It's a firm that's
created over a quarter

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.500
of a million presentations
over the past 28 years

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.940
in Silicon Valley.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.240
And Nancy has written
five bestselling books

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.230
about using visual storytelling
in business communications,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100
including "Resonate" and
"Slideology" and the latest

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.550
book, "Illuminate," which
we'll be talking about today.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.160
Her work has been featured in
"Fortune," "Wired," "The Wall

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.910
Street Journal," "New
York Times," many,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.330
many other places.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.270
And Patti Sanchez is the chief
strategy officer of Duarte.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.930
She has over 25
years of experience

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.510
leading transformative
marketing initiatives

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.590
for global brands like Adobe,
Cisco, Ericsson, Nike, VMWare,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.340
GE, and many more.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.440
Her lifelong passion is
helping communicators

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.509
engage empathetically
and authentically.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.050
So Nancy and Patti
are going to speak

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.090
to you about their new book
"Illuminate-- Ignite Change

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.800
Through Speeches, Stories
Ceremonies, and Symbols."

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.080
If any of you have tried to
convince a group of people

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.375
to go on a long, arduous journey
somewhere, even though you knew

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.250
it was worth it but you
had to convince them,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.500
then this book is for you.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.950
The book is a result
of years of research

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.760
into many, many
business case studies

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.110
from the likes of Steve
Jobs or Mary Barra

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.770
or Lou Gerstner at IBM,
and it's very informative.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.290
I think you'll
very much enjoy it.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.623
And today you're going to
hear about some key principles

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:39.630
in that book to help you
lead people to a vision.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030
So with that, I'd
like to welcome

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.178
Nancy Duarte and Patti Sanchez.

00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:45.472
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.590
PATTI SANCHEZ: Thanks,
Katie-- Katie Gray.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
I love working with her,
and I also love talking.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.860
So she might know.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.530
I love talking
about storytelling.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.400
As Katie said, we're big fans of
visual storytelling at Duarte.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.940
And I assume that
you're all fans of it,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.120
to some degree, which
is why you're here.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.790
And a lot of people recognize
the power of storytelling

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.479
as a communication tool,
especially for marketers.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.550
A lot of brands use
storytelling to create affection

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.095
for their products
and to get people

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.220
to fall in love with their
companies and the things

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.240
that they offer.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.170
But what a lot of people
maybe don't realize

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.490
is that storytelling is
actually a leadership tool.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.550
And so we're going
to talk to you today

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.840
about how leaders
and people like

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.060
you can use
storytelling to inspire

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.240
others to do big things.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.570
And really, we think
that the job of a leader

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.780
is to create the future.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.140
So what does that really mean?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.098
Well, first of all, I
think it's the difference

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:44.170
between a manager and a
leader is that a manager is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.150
somebody who maintains what is.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.750
They just keep the
current thing going.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.670
A leader is somebody who
creates what could be.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.000
They make something new possible
that didn't exist before.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.810
And it's not an easy thing to
do to create something new.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.670
And you may not even think
of yourself as a leader,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.180
but if you're
doing anything that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.160
makes a new future possible,
then you are a leader.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.590
You are taking people
into a territory

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.450
that they've never
been in before,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.420
which can be creating a new
feature, in launching it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.300
to the world.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.010
It can be building a
process of some kind.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.960
It can be hiring
or training people.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.440
All of those things
create a capability

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.980
that didn't exist before
to make something new.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.880
The challenges that
that new future

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.750
you're trying to bring into
being actually represents

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.454
change.

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:35.620
Because you're envisioning
something that didn't yet

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.600
exist, you're going to have
to get other people to agree

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.500
that this new thing
is a good idea

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.130
and to get them to help
you make it a reality.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.090
And that's not easy, because
most people don't like change.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.692
Some of you might
actually be kind of

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:51.150
comfortable with
change, especially

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.500
if you have an entrepreneurial
kind of spirit.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.900
Then maybe the white
space excites you.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.660
But the average human being
is frightened by that.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.100
They're frightened
by the unknown,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.530
because it requires
them to do things,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.820
to learn things that
they don't understand.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.440
And that's stretchy.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.471
And so whenever you
introduce a new idea,

00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:12.970
you're effectively asking people
to do something differently

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.250
than what they've done before.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.310
And most people are going
to resist that in some way.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.980
And it may not even look
like outright revolt to you.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.320
It might just sound like doubt.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.620
They might say, how do we
know that's the best idea,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.870
or how do we know it's better
than the way things happen

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.530
right now.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.810
Or maybe the way we used to
do things was the right way

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.480
to do things.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.230
And all of those are
signs that they're

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.810
going to resist this change.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.950
And so if you have
an idea and you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.720
want to motivate people to help
you make that idea a reality,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.030
you actually have to have
a plan for how you're

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.120
going to lead them
on what we call

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.130
a venture-- a venture
into the future.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.680
So venture is an
interesting word,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.306
because it has two meanings.

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:58.180
Especially in Silicon
Valley, a lot of people

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.650
think of a venture as
sort of like a startup.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.770
It's a noun that means
it's a new thing.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.050
But a venture is also a verb.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.800
It's actually the act
of going somewhere.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.050
And it's also sort of like
metaphorically an adventure,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.810
an expedition into a
territory that people

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.950
haven't been in before.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.070
So if you think about traveling
to a place you've never been to

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.270
before, what is helpful?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.210
It's often helpful to
have a map, some way

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.260
to visually understand where
you are and where you need to go

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.880
and what the path
might be between them.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.960
So what is a map of a venture
into the future potentially

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.279
look like?

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.570
Well, we think there's a
common symbol in business that

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.700
actually describes what
this journey looks like,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.610
and it's the s-curve
of innovation.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.540
And what it does is it describes
the life cycle of a business

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.580
or of an idea from its
beginning to its end,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.540
from its start to its
growth to its maturity.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.160
And the challenge is that when
that idea or the organization

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.970
that's created that
idea reaches maturity,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.330
then stagnation sets in.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.510
Because as I said,
people don't like change.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.290
So they're going to
dig in their heels

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.880
and say, let's just
enjoy the way things are.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.030
Now that we've got it
working, let's just ride this.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.930
But if you don't
evolve, if that idea

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.050
doesn't continue
to grow and evolve,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.630
then that stagnation can lead
to a decline or even death,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.410
this downward slide.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.920
So it's the job of a leader
to imagine another future

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.070
and lead another venture to
go there, and to do it again

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.540
and to do it again.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.250
Because for organizations
and even people to thrive,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.470
they have to constantly
reinvent themselves.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.210
So what leaders have
to do is figure out

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.730
how to bring people
along with them.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.360
And we've worked with
all kinds of leaders

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.380
in our years of consulting
at Duarte and before that.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.620
And we've studied what the
greatest leaders do to bring

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.590
people along with them.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.200
And we've found that they're
all great communicators.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.550
But they also use specific
kinds of communication tools

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.100
to bring people along with them.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.910
So we're going to talk
a bit about those.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.252
This is what we consider the
toolkit that great leaders use

00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:12.210
to bring people along
with them on that venture

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.110
into the future.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.790
The first is telling stories.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.400
They also deliver speeches
and they hold ceremonies.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.290
So stories are a great
communication tool,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.230
because they engage people.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.080
They make us feel something.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.510
If you watch a really
interesting movie,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.270
you know that you get caught
up in it, and you have all the

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.210
feels-- the joy and
the pain and the fear.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.290
And the same is true of stories
that we tell in our lives.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.520
And that leaders
can tell is a way

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.170
to create an emotional
connection with the people

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.780
that they're talking to.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.350
So they cause us
to feel something.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.390
And actually, when I'm
telling you a story,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.680
my brain waves actually start to
align with yours or yours align

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.740
with mine, because we're
feeling the same thing together

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.230
at the same time.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.370
And that same connection happens
between the people who are all

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.500
hearing the story together.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.710
So it's actually a way
to unite groups of people

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.500
around a common experience.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.840
Now, another reason why stories
are a really powerful tool

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.310
for leading people is because
stories are about change.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.170
Fundamentally at their
heart, Annie's story

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.040
is about a person who has to go
through a journey of some kind

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.227
and ultimately is
transformed by it.

00:08:28.227 --> 00:08:30.310
And that's really what a
definition of a story is.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.179
And there's a lot of
confusion out there,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.159
a lot of people
talking about story

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.159
and saying that
they're storytellers,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.495
when we don't think they're
necessarily true stories

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.620
that they're communicating.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.652
So this is the definition
in its purest form of story.

00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:44.110
Goes all the way
back to Aristotle.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.980
And he said, a story
has three parts.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.140
It has a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.070
In the beginning, we
meet the likable hero.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.780
This is the protagonist.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.780
This is the person who's
just trying to do life.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.960
And then something happens,
an inciting incident

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.780
they call it, that throws
that hero's world off balance

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.690
and usually actually causes them
to leave that place, that home

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.690
and go somewhere new.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.410
And in the process of
traveling from what

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.230
they know to this
new territory, they

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.680
encounter all
kinds of roadblocks

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.520
in the middle of that story,
because it's all new territory.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.710
They might have to fight
monsters or aliens.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.580
And they even are challenged
to their inner core,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.120
and often end up
questioning who they are

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.670
and what they're capable of.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.640
But ultimately, at
the end of the story,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.450
through grit and determination,
they overcome those obstacles

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.410
and they come out the other
side, different, transformed.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.110
So that's why stories are
actually a really powerful way

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.360
to help people cope with
change, because they describe

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.460
the process of change itself.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.020
Now, there's another tool
that leaders use-- whoops,

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.580
before that-- this is
actually the shape of a story.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.330
And what you can see here is
that the middle of the story

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.960
is where all the action
happens, literally action.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.130
The rising action
increases tension,

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.180
and the falling action
releases that tension.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.040
And it's that
increase of tension

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.110
and the release of tension that
keeps us engaged in the story.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.840
It creates contrast.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.490
Now, as I was about
to say, there's

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.900
another tool that leaders
use to communicate.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.440
And you probably recognize this.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.450
You may do it yourself
and not realize

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.040
that you're giving a speech.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.350
But speeches are not
just the big talks,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.227
like the vision thing,
when the leader stands up

00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:33.810
in front of the
organization and says,

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.650
this is where we're
going this year.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.860
A speech is also a
progress update-- here's

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.330
where we are in our project.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.150
Here's what we're
going to do next.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.600
A speech is also an announcement
about good news or bad news.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.330
All of those are opportunities,
not just to inform people

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.230
about what's happening
and what's next,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.450
but also to inspire
them and engage them.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.704
Now, we've studied also
storytelling principles

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.370
and how they can be
applied to speeches.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.280
And a few years ago, Nancy
made an incredible discovery

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.609
that there's a pattern
to the speeches

00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:12.150
that the greatest
communicators give.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.950
So she can do a better
job of explaining it,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.116
so I'm going to send her up.

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:18.310
NANCY DUARTE: So after
spending about four years

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.850
studying storytelling,
I was wondering

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.780
why some speeches have this
cadence and a rhythm to it.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.840
It's like it builds
tension and released it

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.500
and it would build
tension and release.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.300
You were drawn in.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.410
So after doing a
journey through story

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.630
and then going through the 100
top best speeches of all time,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.610
I actually found
what that pattern is,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.030
and it is based in the tension
and release of storytelling.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.040
And so I want to show you
the shape that I discovered.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.820
This is a structural
shape over time.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.530
It has a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.630
And that pulsing and the cadence
is the building of tension

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.800
and releasing it
from storytelling.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.450
Now, this has a
three act structure,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.996
just like a great story does.

00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:00.370
So the beginning of any-- I'm
going to say presentations,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.244
but this works for any
type of communication.

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:03.200
It works for email.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.870
This could work for a blog post.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:10.110
It helps me get my husband
to do chores on the weekend.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.750
Like, it works.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.340
It persuades.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.030
So the beginning is you
need to establish what is.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.920
And what you're doing
is, you're basically

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.460
saying, what's our shared truth?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.750
This is what we all
believe as true.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.790
This is the state of the union.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.480
This is the budget.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.510
This is where we're
at financially.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.920
That's kind of what you do.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.780
And then what happens is
you insert what could be.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.250
And this is like the
inciting incident in a story.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.200
Suddenly your world
is out of balance,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.100
and that gap between
what is and what

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.100
could be winds up
being what gets

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.350
resolved through the
rest of your talk.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.604
The middle moves back
and forth structurally

00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:43.020
between what is, what could
be, what is and what could be.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.530
So the human brain is
wired for contrast,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.080
and we can actually see the gap.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.340
The audience can see, oh,
if that's what currently is,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.830
but this is what
could be, suddenly

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.030
what is isn't
interesting, and what

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.550
could be is more appealing.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.370
So that's how it works
as a structural tool.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.960
The last vertical line
is the call to action.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.100
And every talk should have one.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.280
But you shouldn't end there.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.170
You should end
with the new bliss.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.830
This is you describing
this future state

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.150
that's going to be amazing
if everyone adopts your idea.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.690
It's the new bliss,
the new norm.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.340
So once I had this shape,
I've analyzed so many talks.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.840
I want to just show you some.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.370
I have done a TED talk
that goes into detail,

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.659
but I just want to
show you some quickly,

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:27.200
because we've analyzed
a ton of them.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.120
So we have Margaret Thatcher
in her "Iron Lady" speech.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.300
You can see, she starts
off with what is.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.920
She's pretty rapid.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.660
When she talked to Parliament,
was a kind of this one punch,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.750
two punch, like
what is, what could

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.390
be, what is, what
could be, all the time.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.640
So you can see she
starts off with what

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.580
is and moves back and
forth between what is

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.640
and what could be, ending
high into the right stating

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.300
the new bliss.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.800
Richard Feynman, very
famous Caltech professor--

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.350
he was a physics
professor and kids

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.529
would run across campus
to see his class, even

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:56.820
if they didn't need to take it.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.950
He was known as "The
Great Explainer."

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.370
He did a law of
gravity speech, and you

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.700
can see it's a technical speech,
yet it moves really rapidly

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.980
between what is
and what could be.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.460
Steve Jobs, "iPhone
Launch" speech--

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.180
he has a heightened
sense of what

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.570
could be in all of
his speeches, but it

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.640
does move back and forth between
what is and what could be.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.310
And of course Dr. King's
very famous "I Have a Dream"

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.870
speech also starts off with
what is, moves back and forth.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.040
Now, you can see the frequency
get really tight about 2/3 in.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.840
That was his very
famous, "I Have a Dream"

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.012
sequence-- "I have a
dream that one day-- I

00:14:30.012 --> 00:14:31.220
have a dream that one day--."

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.803
What's interesting
is some of the most

00:14:32.803 --> 00:14:35.220
beloved parts of our
most beloved speeches

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.900
are the gap between
what is and what

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.450
could be at the
phrase level, as they

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.866
move back and forth between
"I have a dream that one day."

00:14:40.866 --> 00:14:43.050
He did not call this the
"I Have a Dream" speech.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.650
He actually called it "The
Fierce Urgency of Now."

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.550
That was the actual
official title.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.440
The people named it
the "I Have a Dream"

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.730
speech because of this very
beloved sequence right here.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.710
So those are pretty
lofty people.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.770
I just work at Google.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.450
I just have this
thing I need to do.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.075
I'm not reviving the
civil rights movement.

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:03.830
So I'll bring it closer to home,
using an example of a female.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.410
And it's my 11-year-old niece.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.910
She wrote a letter to her dad
because she wanted a mouse.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.770
Now, in an
11-year-old mind, this

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.020
is the most important thing
in her life right now.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.210
So she writes an
impassioned plea that

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.910
follows the form perfectly.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.890
She says, "Dear Dad,
we want a mouse.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.480
And you might say they're
stinky, but they're not

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.280
if you put special
drops in the water.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.920
You might say that they're
mean, but you rarely

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.080
find an aggressive mouse.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.330
If they do bite, it's usually
just a curiosity nibble.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.400
I know you will not
want to pay for it,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.360
and Sophie and I
have that covered.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.749
We've saved our birthday money
so we can pay for the mouse

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:39.290
and everything else,
and you will not

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.860
have to pay a single cent.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.800
Also the mouse will be
in Sophie's or my room,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.410
so you will not see
it all the time.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.600
And the new bliss is we will
respect any decision you make."

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.986
They got the mouse.

00:15:49.986 --> 00:15:51.360
So you can see
what's interesting

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.030
to me is, it's almost
like we're hardwired.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.930
She's not seen my books,
come to my workshop.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.400
I did not design
this letter for her.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.030
She wanted it so bad, she used
a persuasive story pattern

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.090
with the tension and
release of story.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.000
So it's amazing
when you really need

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.930
to give an impassioned
plea, how important that is.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.430
So one of the third
story-based concepts

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.190
that we're introducing into
the business vernacular

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.500
is the idea of ceremonies.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.050
And ceremonies-- some of the
oldest artifacts we can find

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.760
are actually artifacts
that were used in ritual

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.000
because a group of people felt
they needed communal catharsis

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.661
around their community.

00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:33.910
And so it's also based in
the same three act structure

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.390
that story is.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.672
But the naming
conventions are different.

00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:39.630
We looked at the rites
of passage, because that

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.300
is the most common
in society today--

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.760
a marriage, a graduation,
a bar mitzvah.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.550
Because we are both
married to Hispanic men,

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.570
we're going to use the
quinceanera as an example.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.220
And what that is, is when
a young girl turns 15,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.810
she goes through
rites of passage

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.140
similar to a bar mitzvah.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.790
But she comes in a little flat
shoes and a drabby little dress

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.560
and she's carrying a dolly.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.240
So what she's doing
is she's actually

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.160
going to be separating from
that version of her identity.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.089
She goes through a ceremony,
and she transitions.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.470
The minute the ceremony is
done, suddenyl she's a woman.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.609
So she gets rid of her doll.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.470
She gets to wear high heels,
puts on a little tiara,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.420
and she's a woman now.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.200
All that happened was
three minutes of time.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.616
She went from being
a little girl,

00:17:26.616 --> 00:17:29.407
and suddenly she's a woman
just because of the ceremony.

00:17:29.407 --> 00:17:30.990
Now, ceremonies--
what they do is they

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.450
mark endings and beginnings.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.164
This is over.

00:17:33.164 --> 00:17:34.080
I'm not a little girl.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.350
I've let go of my girlish
things and I am a woman now.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.150
Well, corporations need
to practice the concept

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.570
of endings and beginnings.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.840
Because when you're
trying to transform

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.250
a collective
consciousness of people,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.750
there are things
that end and there

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.500
are things that begin again.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.270
It's very important
to understand

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.524
endings and beginnings and
the power that they hold.

00:17:55.524 --> 00:17:57.190
If people can let go
of the old, they're

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.880
more willing to embrace the new.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.050
And we have a case study
in a minute about that.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.530
So this is the basic
toolkit that communicators

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.400
need as you're driving
your own teams.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.900
And I'll bring Patti
back up here again

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.790
to talk about how to do that.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.170
PATTI SANCHEZ:
Well, that toolkit

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.740
that Nancy recaptures there is
what we call a torchbearer's

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.720
toolkit.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.640
And the reason we use
the word torchbearer

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.200
is because it's the
job of the leader

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.610
to illuminate the path between
the present and the future.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.650
Again, when you think
about this metaphorically

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.220
as an expedition
to a place people

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.350
have never been to
before into the unknown,

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.160
metaphorically that
unknown is sort

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.440
of a dark and scary place to
people, or at least it's foggy.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.240
It's hard for them
to visualize it

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.910
and to understand it and
feel safe going there.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.380
So through effective
communication,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.750
leaders basically
light that pass

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.930
so that people can see
where they need to go

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.830
and how to get there.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.670
And if leaders
communicate really well,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.760
they create moments that
move people, moments

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.430
that make people feel
bigger, more capable

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.875
than they realized
that they were.

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:08.080
And they create the
capacity for people

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.580
to do things that they
didn't realize they could do.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.040
But the bigger your
idea is, the more change

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.120
you're going to
ask people to make.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.690
And the more change
you ask people to make,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.720
the more you're going to have
to persuade them to actually go

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.340
there, which means you're
going to have to communicate

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.770
over and over and over, because
transformational change doesn't

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:30.730
happen overnight.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.700
What it's going to take
is actually a movement.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.230
And what is a movement anyway?

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.060
A movement is a
massive group of people

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.020
going somewhere
together, usually

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.520
over a long period of time.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.690
It can be weeks, but often
it's months or years or even

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.990
decades.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.630
And we've had many leaders say
to us they wanted to create

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.000
movements around their ideas.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.540
And that launched
us on this quest

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.790
to understand how
movements actually happen

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.810
and what they really look like.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.030
And so as we mapped the
forms that communication

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.530
can take, the shape of a
story, the shape of a speech,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.030
we wondered, is there actually
a shape to movement too?

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.110
And we studied business
movements, like OpenSource.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.230
We studied social movements,
like civil rights.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.510
And we looked at all
the things that leaders

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.460
did, all the communication
that they gave,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.525
and how that unfolded over time.

00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:23.150
And we discovered
that they do actually

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.450
follow a shape,
which is magically

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.380
the s-curve of innovation,
which is basically mapping

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.750
the path between what is,
the present state, and what

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.430
could be, which is the future.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.980
But we also discovered that
those movements follow a story

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.140
structure too, just
like the communication

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.090
that you use to move people.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.080
And so this is that
story structure

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.100
of a movement, which we
call a venture scape.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.380
It's that landscape of the
venture into the future.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.560
So it has three acts, just
like a story, with five stages.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.930
In the first act are the
dream and leap stages.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.250
Dream happens when you--
the leader, whoever's

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.800
the advocate for an idea--
declares the vision.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.720
You say, this is what I see.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.660
This is where I want us to go.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.507
Let's go there.

00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:06.840
But immediately, as soon as
you communicate that vision,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.070
people are faced with a
choice about whether they're

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.420
going to say yes, I'm
in, or whether they're

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.760
going to say no, I'm out.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.760
So they have a choice
to commit or resist.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.810
And how well you
communicate directly

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.892
affects how likely
they are to say yes.

00:21:22.892 --> 00:21:24.350
And when they do
say yes, when they

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.330
leap into this venture with you,
then in the middle of the story

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.570
starts to unfold.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.280
In the middle, just
like in a great story

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.370
that you might see in a movie
is where all the action happens.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.940
And translated in
real life, that

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.960
means where all the
hard stuff happens.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.800
Because in the middle are
the fight and climb stages.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.160
The fight is when
anybody is trying

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.410
to bring that idea to reality.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.450
The status quo
rises up against it.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.020
Anybody who's defending the
way things are and the fact

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.240
that they should stay the same
is going to put up resistance.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.470
And so people have to
overcome those obstacles.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.150
They have to fight
that internal inertia

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:04.060
or the external
criticism of this idea.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.330
But every time they overcome
one of those obstacles,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.800
they gain a little more ground.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.310
They climb a little
closer, get a little closer

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.790
to that end goal.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.640
And the middle is
really the hard part.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.080
It's where people are tested,
just like in the story.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.990
That hero comes to question
whether they have the stuff

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.380
to continue.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.150
And how well you
communicate will

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.360
determine whether they
think they can finish.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.000
And that's when the
third act of the story

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.610
comes to an end, which
is the arrive stage.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.510
The arrive stage is where
you achieve your goal,

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.700
or at least you
conclude that effort.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.840
And it could be a happy
ending, like in the movies.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.560
But most likely, it
won't be perfectly happy.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.699
You might fall short of
your goal a little bit.

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:46.740
You might not achieve what
you thought you would.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.155
It might change shape.

00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:49.530
But at that point
in the journey,

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.710
it's important to look back,
to say, what did we actually

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.660
accomplish?

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.400
Where did we fall short, and
how do we avoid those mistakes

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.810
in the future?

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.460
Also, you have to
communicate frequently

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.920
throughout this process.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.912
And your communication has to
take on a different flavor,

00:23:05.912 --> 00:23:08.120
depending on the stage of
the journey that you're in,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.030
because people have different
emotional needs at each stage.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.480
In the beginning of the
journey, that first stage

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.220
in dream, what they need
is a moment of inspiration.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.440
They need to believe
in that idea.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.740
They need to be able to imagine
themselves in that future

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.230
and long to go there.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.110
In the leap stage,
what they really need

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.110
is a moment of decision.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.390
They need help choosing
whether to say yes

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.360
or whether to say no.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.520
And hopefully, they'll say yes.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.570
The fight stage is
a moment of bravery.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.230
That's when people need to
be reminded that they're

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.240
capable of overcoming
those obstacles,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.190
to feel courageous,
willing to risk anything

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.880
to fight, to make
your idea a reality.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.800
The climb stage, which
is kind of a misnomer,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.760
because it can be a very
long, drawn-out process

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.520
of getting closer to the goal.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.830
And what people really
need then is endurance.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.290
They need to be reminded
that they have reserves

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.400
deep inside of themselves
that they can call upon

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.480
so that they can overcome, keep
going, and ultimately finish.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.870
And in the end, what people
need is a moment of reflection.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.440
This is a time to stop, to catch
your breath, before you rush

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.830
off to the next initiative to
tell the stories of what you

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.040
just went through,
to celebrate them

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.247
or to mourn the endings before
they start the next journey.

00:24:26.247 --> 00:24:27.830
So I want to tell
you about one leader

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.246
that I think did
this really well.

00:24:29.246 --> 00:24:31.150
And his name may not
be familiar to you,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.270
but I have a lot of
affection for him.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.870
His name is Ray Anderson, and
he was the CEO and founder

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.300
of a company called Interface.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.960
Interface was
founded in the 1970s.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.700
When Ray had this idea, it
was kind of crazy at the time

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.230
to create carpet
tiles-- basically take

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.316
big rolls of carpet and cut
them up into squares, because he

00:24:50.316 --> 00:24:51.440
thought it was a good idea.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.940
And so he convinced
a few investors

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.196
to give him some money, and
he started this business.

00:24:55.196 --> 00:24:57.570
And it turned out to be the
right idea at the right time,

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.050
because office
environments were changing,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.070
and so this modular carpeting
was a really good concept.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.600
And so he grew that
business like gangbusters.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.010
For 20 years, it became the
world's largest supplier

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.790
of carpet tiles.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.140
And he was making
money hand over fist,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.820
a self-made millionaire.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.830
And everything was
great until the 1990s,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.770
when everybody started
to wake up to the climate

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.650
problem, the
environmental problems

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.450
that we were all experiencing.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.770
And they were
starting to criticize

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.680
industrial businesses,
who they believed

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.230
were causing the problems.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.980
And so customers
even started asking

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.879
Ray, what are you doing
for the environment?

00:25:32.879 --> 00:25:34.670
And he was really
troubled by the question,

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.020
because he couldn't answer it.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.519
His only answer
was, I'm just trying

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.830
to stay out of jail, which
is not a good strategy.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.730
So coincidentally, an employee
sent him a copy of this book,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.944
"The Ecology of
Commerce," by Paul Hawken,

00:25:46.944 --> 00:25:48.610
one of the founders
of Smith and Hawken.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.210
And so Ray devoured this
book, looking for an answer

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.170
to that question.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.420
And what he saw was this.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.820
He said, "He convicted me as a
plunderer of the earth," which

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.432
is a horrible thing to hear,
especially for a founder.

00:26:02.432 --> 00:26:04.890
He said, I built this company
that is plundering the earth.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.310
And he said it hit him
like a spear in the chest.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.580
He would tell people
that story over and over

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.010
about the epiphany that he had.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.950
And he was compelled to
come up with a new dream

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.300
for his company.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.050
And this is how
he articulated it.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.442
He said, what if
Interface became

00:26:18.442 --> 00:26:20.150
the first industrial
company in the world

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.740
to achieve sustainability?

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.640
And he used a story,
metaphorical journey

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.690
of climbing a mountain
taller than Everest

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.570
to describe this vision.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.850
And he always drew this
picture to depict it.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.340
And he would use
that over and over

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.790
in his communications to
help people really understand

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.510
and imagine themselves
achieving that goal.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.700
He knew it going to take a lot
of work to make that happen.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.080
So he called all of his
leaders together for an offsite

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.880
in Maui, Hawaii, and
he asked Paul Hawken

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.320
to actually give the keynote.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.880
So Paul Hawken stood up and he
talked about all the problems

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.420
that were affecting the
planet, but also all the things

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.380
that individuals can do, this
global village, to turn things

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.550
around, to make a difference.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.857
And then Ray got up and spoke.

00:27:01.857 --> 00:27:03.690
And he asked every
single one of his leaders

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.140
to make a personal commitment
to do something different,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.610
to put the environment
back in balance.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.470
But he didn't just ask them.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.950
He asked them to
demonstrate that commitment

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.030
in front of everybody
right then and there.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.380
So they all wrote
pledges on cards

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.500
that they pinned up next
to photos of themselves

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.580
on what they called a
personal legacy wall.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.580
It was a ceremony of pledging
commitment to change.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.360
And after that ceremony,
the leaders were galvanized.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.060
They raced forward
and they kicked off

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.340
all kinds of initiatives
across the company

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.450
to do things
differently, to transform

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.770
the way they did business.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.120
And over the next 20
years, they really

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.640
changed everything top to bottom
in the company, everything

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.870
about how they operated.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.771
And they also transformed
their industry.

00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:49.895
So why do I tell you this
story about Ray Anderson?

00:27:49.895 --> 00:27:51.200
There are a couple reasons.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.204
One, because he's an
entrepreneur, somebody

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:54.620
who made something
out of nothing,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.540
and I think that's
really inspiring.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.210
Two, because he put
his entire business

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.060
in service of a purpose greater
than profit, which I also think

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.460
is really inspiring.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.420
But three, because
he was a leader who

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.350
understood the power of
communication and storytelling

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.720
and used it to motivate people
to do really big things.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.940
He's not the only one.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.500
There are a lot of leaders
who did this really well,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.541
and so Nancy is going to
tell you about one more.

00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:19.550
NANCY DUARTE: So I want to do
a quick case study about Apple.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.740
As you guys know, Steve Jobs was
kicked out of his own company,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.720
went away for 10 years and
built a different company

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.210
with a different
operating system.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.940
But in the time that Mr.
Jobs was gone from Apple,

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.550
Apple had no strategy.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.790
They tried a few times to create
an operating system and failed.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.440
So they had to go
outside of Apple,

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.110
look to buy an operating system.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.640
They bought Next and
with Next came Mr. Jobs.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.450
The very first time
Mr. Jobs spoke,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.950
even though it was
a broad audience,

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.616
it was not at a
developers' conference--

00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:49.510
the news was there.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.010
It was a MacWorld.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.630
He spoke as if he
was only talking

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.880
to the developers in the room.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.990
He had 20 minutes, and he used
the word "developer" 27 times,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.820
because he knew
the developers had

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.200
to move from Mac OS 9 to Mac
OS X or the whole company

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.080
would fail.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.880
It was huge.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.230
Now, Gil Emilio spoke
for three hours,

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.250
and he said the word
"developer" three times.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.090
No wonder he wasn't
the right guy to lead.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.600
But you've got to
realize Apple was

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.920
in a complete
crisis at this time.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.699
The developers were
very, very skeptical

00:29:16.699 --> 00:29:18.740
because they had been
jerked around for a decade.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.810
They'd do a build, and the next
year they'd find out everything

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.280
was wasted.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.770
They'd do another build
and it was wasted.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.060
So they were very skeptical.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.030
In fact, Mr Jobs
did a talk actually

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.306
called "Apple's
Hierarchy of Skepticism"

00:29:28.306 --> 00:29:30.455
where he went through all
the steps of skepticism

00:29:30.455 --> 00:29:33.020
and where the developers were
in the spectrum, because they

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.130
were that skeptical.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.880
So what happened is 2001,
a lot of the developers

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.080
still were not moving.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.930
They were still not migrating.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.010
And he did a ceremony.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.940
He stood up and he made a vow.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.130
He unfurled an oversized
piece of parchment paper,

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.340
and he made a verbal vow that
I will stick with one operating

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.721
system strategy.

00:29:53.721 --> 00:29:55.220
Some of the developers
hadn't moved,

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.928
because they thought
that they were going

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.840
to keep jerking them around.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.760
What happened that was
kind of interesting

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.671
is in the middle of the
climb, a lot of times

00:30:02.671 --> 00:30:05.170
if the s-curves, overlap that's
the time you need to already

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.730
be dreaming again.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.830
So the developers
are still moving.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.830
A lot of them had come,
but some pretty big ones

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.390
had decided to resist
and decided not to come.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.470
In the meantime, Mr.
Jobs had a new dream.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.190
He was already on
with the Redream.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.730
He had this new vision
that the whole world

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.370
of connected devices
would connect

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.007
to Mac OS X. It was called
his digital hub strategy.

00:30:25.007 --> 00:30:26.590
If you go and you
look at this speech,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.310
he basically prophesied their
entire hardware strategy

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.430
for the next decade.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.690
It was a big speech,
so it was a big dream.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.315
So of course, he's
losing his patience.

00:30:35.315 --> 00:30:40.335
He's like, get onto X. Get
onto X. He keeps telling them,

00:30:40.335 --> 00:30:41.710
get onto X. I got
this new dream.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.060
Oh my God, you're not going
to believe what the world is

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.852
going to look like.

00:30:43.852 --> 00:30:45.059
So he decides, you know what?

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.040
We to bury the old OS.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.970
We need to bury Mac OS 9,
and he did exactly that.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.200
He actually had a coffin and
smoke come up out of the stage,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.000
stained glass up on the
wall, eerie music played.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.626
He came out with an
oversized Mac OS 9,

00:30:56.626 --> 00:30:58.833
you can see there to the
right, put it in the coffin,

00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:00.630
closed the lid, put
a red rose on it.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.330
And he said a
eulogy for Mac OS 9.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.290
He said, we are here today to
mourn the passing of Mac OS 9.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.490
He is now in that great
bucket in the sky, no doubt

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.250
looking down upon us
with that same smile

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.480
he displayed every
time he booted.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.296
Mr. Jobs never mentioned Mac
OS 9 again after this day.

00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.510
It was done.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.050
The developers that
were there-- you

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.550
could actually hear
it in the audio.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.200
They're like [NERVOUS CHUCKLE]
are we supposed to laugh

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.710
or what?

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.710
They'll never forget it.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.210
It was over.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.710
It was done.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.710
So this is a ceremony of
endings and beginnings.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.280
Move on.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.990
He said, language like, the
train has left the station.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.300
People are going to buy
another brand than your brand.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.460
He pushed them out--
endings and beginnings.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.050
He pushed them forward.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.330
Some got pushed out, maybe.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.695
But it is fun to be
a leader, myself.

00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:47.070
Some of you might be like,
well, I'm not really a leader.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.540
But I've had the privilege of
being able to prophetically

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.330
imagine my own
organization's future

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.620
and then had the
power and the autonomy

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.610
to move it into this
new alternate future.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.950
And one thing is consistent
is change itself.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.075
I'm sure you've heard that,
but my own organization

00:32:02.075 --> 00:32:02.750
is 28 years old.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.450
We're on our eighth reinvention.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.172
That means we have reinvented
ourselves every four years,

00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:09.630
which I think is fascinating,
because the US Board of Labor

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.970
and Statistics states that small
businesses die between four

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.174
and five years.

00:32:14.174 --> 00:32:15.590
So it's almost
like the life cycle

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.310
of just my own little
unit of 120 people

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:23.490
actually needs to be rejuvenated
in about four year increments.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.210
Now, Google does that at a
scale that this isn't even messy

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.370
enough to show.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.580
You guys have hundreds
of venture scapes,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.670
hundreds of them going
on all the time, which

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.040
means every single one
of you in this room

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.250
are either leading
a venture scape

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.840
or you're being impacted
by someone else that's

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.270
leading a venture scape.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.370
That means that there's
a lot of other travelers

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.160
that need to come
along with you.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.310
You have other people.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.294
These ideas are not
going to be realized

00:32:49.294 --> 00:32:51.210
if you can't get others
to come along with you

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.920
and make that dream a reality.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.735
It's why learning to
communicate well is so critical.

00:32:57.735 --> 00:33:00.360
And you're going to have moments
all the time all along the way

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.009
where there's a speech, a story,
a ceremony, bam, bam, bam,

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:03.800
every day a speech.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.060
Oh, I need to tell a story or
I need to do a ceremony today.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.435
You may have a one on one with
one of your direct reports

00:33:08.435 --> 00:33:10.047
who's encountered a roadblock.

00:33:10.047 --> 00:33:11.380
And you're like, oh, I remember.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.921
And when I did this,
here's the story

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:15.434
of how I overcame that
same roadblock-- a speech.

00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:16.600
You got the vision meetings.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.016
You've got the all
hands meetings.

00:33:18.016 --> 00:33:20.560
You've got your staff meeting
speeches all the time.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.810
And then there are ceremonies.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.690
Oh my gosh, we just
launched this initiative.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.807
Let's all sign the great
poster that was just made

00:33:25.807 --> 00:33:28.390
and make a commitment that we're
going to make this a reality.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.510
Those happen all day long.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:35.160
But there's these other moments
that happen when the team maybe

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.110
missed it.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.820
The team needs to heal.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.950
The team needs to be galvanized.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.100
They need to be rallied.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.830
It's a bigger moment along
all those other moments where

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.060
you need to create
collective effervescence,

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.530
this moment where the people
are bound to each other

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.570
and bound to you and recommitted
what you're asking them to do.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.492
And those stand
out among the rest.

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:57.950
And that's when
you need to combine

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.150
the stories, the ceremonies,
and the speeches into a moment

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.410
that people will never forget.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.340
Because this is when
they actually recommit.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.890
They're so exhausted,
so beat up,

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.210
sometimes they need a moment
to decide, is this worth it?

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.139
Can I keep going, and do
I want to keep doing that?

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.040
So moving people is really hard.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.792
Just because maybe I have this
skill for seeing the future

00:34:19.792 --> 00:34:22.250
doesn't mean I've always been
really good at getting people

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:23.389
to go there.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.897
In fact, I used to just,
at the vision meeting

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.480
every year at my
company, I would just

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.660
make this epic declaration
of what needed to happen.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.159
And then I would check in with
myself at the end of the year

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.712
and be disappointed, sometimes
mostly in my travelers,

00:34:34.712 --> 00:34:36.420
that they didn't make
my dream come true,

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.880
that I told him once.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.290
And it's so weird just to see
how hard it is to move people.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.070
But I had to finally own.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.159
I was like, why don't
they want to do this?

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.150
Why are we not working
together to make this happen?

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.070
And I had to realize,
well, maybe it's

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:56.719
partly that the sacrifice is
huge I'm asking them to do.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.652
I have not honored the
fact that maybe they

00:34:59.652 --> 00:35:00.610
had to spend more time.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.840
They had to learn new
skills, the sacrifice

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.210
they were going to have to
make this dream come true.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.560
But also, was I portraying
it in a way that

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.210
made the risk seem worth
the reward to them?

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.787
Was the risk worth the reward?

00:35:12.787 --> 00:35:14.620
Did I really think for
a minute that they're

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.420
encountering these
obstacles that might

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.250
be just too hard for them?

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.280
And moving them is
really, really hard.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.500
And it's empathy that unlocks
something inside of them.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.600
So I don't and haven't had
that much empathy in my career.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.357
I had to learn it.

00:35:28.357 --> 00:35:30.690
And if you look at these two
models we showed you today,

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.700
they're actually
models for empathy.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.480
So a leader can actually
think through and see things

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.210
from someone else's perspective.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.500
And I was actually
raised by a narcissist.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.382
And a narcissist doesn't
have the empathy gene.

00:35:43.382 --> 00:35:45.590
It's actually a mental
illness where the empathy gene

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.590
is just vacant.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.710
That means I didn't have
empathy modeled for me as a kid.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.460
My mom never showed me what
that means to think and consider

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.360
someone else's perspective.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.880
So my body of work is actually
my own personal journey,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.970
a calling, this thing called
empathy that was evasive to me.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.410
It was gone, and I couldn't
really grasp it or find it.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.210
So I had to create models
so I could see things

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.960
from other people's
perspectives.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.570
And I have to confess, I
have opened my own book

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.660
that I wrote myself
with Patti, and I've

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.700
had to look at the model to do
a couple talks in my own shop.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.820
So it works to consider how
somebody else may be perceiving

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.300
what you're asking them
to do and then communicate

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.210
through them from that place.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.500
And it is storytelling
that binds us together.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.250
Everything you learn
today, all the models

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.030
are based in storytelling.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.590
And I can tell you that
if you adopt the concepts

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.495
and principles of story, your
career will never be the same.

00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:40.120
It is the very thing
that will move you

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.710
from simply a manager
to being a leader,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.580
is how you choose to
communicate the actions you're

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.906
wanting others to take on.

00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:49.030
That's the sole difference.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.580
Like Patti was
saying, it's a tool.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:57.000
It's hardwired into our
brains to bind the teller

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.540
to the hearer, to the listener.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.310
It binds us to each other.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.330
Storytelling also connects
you with each other.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.530
When you've experienced
an amazing story,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.600
you feel connected
to each other.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.550
And it really changes
the trajectory

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.865
of where you're going and how
quickly you can get there.

00:37:12.865 --> 00:37:14.240
So if you think
about the concept

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.090
of story being
about transforming,

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.610
it creates longing.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.660
If people are trying to
change and get somewhere,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.840
the journey is hard.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.730
And it's story that's
the coping mechanism.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.650
It's story that
helps them recommit.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.480
It's story that makes
them want to continue

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.620
to build the future
you're portraying

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.880
that needs to be built.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.900
Stories create a longing
unlike anything else

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.455
in any sort of communications.

00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:38.700
So I want to end with
a quote, and then we'll

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.940
take questions from you guys.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.980
"If you want to build a ship,
don't drum up people together

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.540
to collect wood, and don't
assign them tasks and work,

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.100
but rather teach them to long
for the endless immensity

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.330
of the sea."

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.720
If Google, in principle
and conceptually

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.510
would embrace the
power of storytelling--

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.740
you guys are already great
and unstoppable-- I can't even

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.510
imagine what could become,
because you guys actually

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.810
do change the entire world.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.900
And so we would love
to take questions.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.010
We also have a gift
as you leave today.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.530
We brought the actual
insert from the book,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.902
the communication toolkit,
which has "Speeches, Stories

00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:19.360
and Ceremonies." and it has
"The Dream, Leap, Fight, Climb,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.190
Arrive."

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.357
We have warnings, speeches,
and motivating speeches,

00:38:22.357 --> 00:38:24.690
warning stories, motivating
stories, warning ceremonies,

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.700
motivating ceremonies.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.040
Whip this out.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.699
Use it as your map, and
change the world like crazy.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:32.990
So we'd love to take questions.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.490
If you want to shout
them out, we'll

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.610
repeat it for the recording
if anyone has questions.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.237
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:43.570
I've been invited to different
professional conferences.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.320
And often they invite me to
talk about some topics that

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.439
are quite similar, not really
new concepts or new practices,

00:38:51.439 --> 00:38:53.730
but talking about things that
people really are already

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:56.880
know, just sort of
reminders, refreshers,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.750
trying to reinspire people.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.480
But the research is the same.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.640
If we're talking about
mentorship or the best

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.140
practices in the
HR community-- I'm

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.140
actually in people ops-- it's
really similar information.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.150
You go to a conference.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.770
You're hearing this information.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.420
I would say half
of those stories

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.990
are personal stories
that are new,

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.280
but the information that's
backing is really the same.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.667
So making that move and
making that transformation,

00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:20.750
the research is out there.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:25.070
People know the research, and
so instead of just restating it,

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:25.700
I think, yes.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.560
We need to do this.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.810
We need to do this right away.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.100
But what would you suggest
in terms of an approach

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.667
to reviving the research
that's out there?

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:34.250
NANCY DUARTE: Reviving
stale research?

00:39:38.098 --> 00:39:42.010
PATTI SANCHEZ: Gosh, that's
a really good question.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.910
I guess would it be too
simplistic for me to say,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.540
storytelling is an
approach to do that.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.750
There's a way to
find a new narrative

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.030
in the data that's out there.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.510
And certainly by connecting
it to current situations

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.820
that illustrate
those principles.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.700
I think in people ops, I
think in a lot of fields,

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.460
there's sort of an attraction
to shining new objects,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.060
whatever the trend is
is what-- the book that

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.460
starts to sell off the shelves,
something that seems like it's

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.910
got a new hook but it really
is rooted in things people

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.660
already know.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.854
And in some ways, I think
storytelling is like that.

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:26.020
NANCY DUARTE: You know what
I have to do for myself?

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.220
I speak enough where I want
it to be interesting to me

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.450
so I'm enthused
when I deliver it.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.810
So sometimes I just throw
in different examples

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.790
or startle myself or
something because I

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.240
have to stay interested
in my own material.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.140
And people can see when
you're enthused or not.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.070
So it's like, oh, I'm
tired of this story.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.690
I'll tell you it again.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.280
So I think a lot
of it has to come

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.750
from here, a place of
passion instead of here,

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.350
a place of knowledge.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.290
And people can feel it.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.940
I can feel it when
I'm delivering it

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.990
from my heart versus
delivering it from my mind.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.910
And the really cool thing about
being with people in person

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.310
is presentations are one
of the few times when

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.760
you can connect face to face.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.210
So you could go and get eyeballs
and search results and clicks

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.920
and all of that.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.970
But when you're actually in
the room with people, in a way

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:19.010
that you can actually create a
really deep human connection,

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.460
using stories, using
personal stories,

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.880
using new and fresh ways to
connect them to the information

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.190
while you're in person,
it makes you unstoppable.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.047
So that was a good question.

00:41:32.047 --> 00:41:33.380
That was a really good question.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.370
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, thank you

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:39.180
both so much for coming
and visiting with us here.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.941
I want to talk to you about
and ask you about your process.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.470
I want to learn
about your process

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.410
in two different settings.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.940
One is when you're in the
act of making a presentation

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.670
and what is the chain of
things that you go through when

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.250
you're doing this yourself?

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.840
But secondly also, as you
talk about storytelling,

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.460
it involves connecting the
dots from several different

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.580
experiences in the past.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.190
So I guess that needs
you to become a learning

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.370
machine over time.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:16.070
What is your process for
things that you see every day?

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.370
Do you make notes?

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:17.910
How do you--

00:42:21.574 --> 00:42:22.740
NANCY DUARTE: Good question.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.970
PATTI SANCHEZ: Yeah, really.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.960
Well, I guess so answering
the first question

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.390
about our process, when
thinking about a presentation

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.970
or any form of
communication for me,

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.370
I always start
with the audience.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.490
And it's also the
Duarte methodology

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.050
to empathize with the people
that you're communicating to.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.700
And it's sort of
counterintuitive,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.960
because usually the thing
you're clearest about right away

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.170
is what you want to say.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.300
This is my subject matter.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.610
This is the information
I want to get across.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.250
And the problem is,
if you start with that

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.140
as your framework, first of
all, you're not necessarily

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.950
going to communicate in the
best possible way for people

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.330
to understand it and embrace it.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.650
And second of all, ego
can get in the way.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:06.270
And that can be a problem too.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.372
So our methodology and when
we work with our clients

00:43:09.372 --> 00:43:11.330
to build presentations
or help them communicate

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.220
their story on any level is
to start by empathetically

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.450
understanding their audience.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.140
Who are they?

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.490
What are they feeling?

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.290
What are they thinking?

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.710
What are they likely to resist?

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.260
What are the reasons they
might like this idea?

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.420
And then use that to help
us decide what we say

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.230
and what we don't say and
then also how to structure it.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.760
I'll let you take the other
question about the learning

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.860
machine and gather your stories.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.460
NANCY DUARTE: I'm sure you
guys have heard the mindset

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.050
concepts of being a lifelong
learner versus someone who

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.760
just checks in.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.150
I think Google's hiring process
filters out the people that

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.750
aren't lifelong learners.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.650
But I would say we are vast
consumers of information.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.220
To your point on research,
Patti and I have, I think,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.130
three banker boxes that
we printed of research

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.240
and then who knows?

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.450
I think we read the internet,
pretty much the whole thing

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.000
and found patterns
that had never

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.960
been seen before and insight.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.610
And it's just that
hunger and quest

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.000
for how much more can we
have storytelling change us?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.800
And I think in that
quest for learning,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.600
you're transformed yourself.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.970
And I would say stay hungry.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.410
Stay foolish is super
important to do if you

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.660
want to become something.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.410
There's a whole lot
of people that do just

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.850
want to skate through life
and live on the system

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.080
or live on a system or just
be plugged in to the matrix.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.020
Maybe not that system.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.220
But yeah, it's
just a mindset that

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.820
will turn you from an individual
contributor to manager

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.750
to leader.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.140
It's all a mindset.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.580
One of the reasons we
use the term torchbearer,

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.710
because it's a mantle.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.370
Being a leader is a mantle.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.260
You're offered opportunities
to lead all day.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.030
Like, Frodo had the
little ring fall

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.410
on his hand and
he's like, holy cow.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.730
Do I want to deal
with this or do I not?

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.100
You're given a choice.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.650
And leadership's like that.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:04.570
it's like a mantle.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.080
And a lot of people
self-select out of leading.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.180
They self-select
out, and they choose

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.062
to not follow, go into
the fire of Sauron.

00:45:13.062 --> 00:45:14.270
That is kind of scary, right?

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.780
There's a lot of interesting
hardships in choosing to be

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.160
a leader, but the ones that
communicate well have less

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.626
hardships than the
ones that don't.

00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:25.030
AUDIENCE: So a gentle
follow-up, if I may.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:30.280
You mentioned printing out
tons of research and so on.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.600
NANCY DUARTE: We
only killed one tree.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.634
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:38.550
AUDIENCE: Silent motivation
behind my question

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.990
here was with the internet and
knowledge becoming so much more

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.590
accessible, there's
also the concept

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.490
of information overload.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.237
And in your works, and every
time you do so much research,

00:45:50.237 --> 00:45:52.070
I was wondering, how
do you balance learning

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.936
versus information overload?

00:45:53.936 --> 00:45:57.047
NANCY DUARTE: We had a
round of this that we did

00:45:57.047 --> 00:45:58.380
and we pasted it up on the wall.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.595
We were real excited, and we
brought one of our key clients

00:46:00.595 --> 00:46:01.094
in.

00:46:01.094 --> 00:46:02.700
And he was like, holy cow.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.990
You guys have, like,
six books in here.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.980
You need to-- it's hard to
murder your own darlings,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.480
right?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.249
And you would get really
attached to stuff, especially

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:13.290
when it's research-based.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.498
Because there were things
where I was like, for sure?

00:46:15.498 --> 00:46:17.590
We spent two months on
this one concept we cut.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.660
Two people times
two months cutting.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.410
That was hard, but it was right.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.880
And so you get so deep
you lose perspective.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.530
And we actually had other
people come in and slash

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.610
and slash and slash.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.110
And we have some beautiful stuff
that's hit the cutting room

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:33.700
floor that we're
just now next week,

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.670
we're going away for the
whole week, to my house,

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:40.015
to examine the things that got
cut to see if we can plant that

00:46:40.015 --> 00:46:41.390
and it blooms into
something new.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.470
But cutting it,
slashing that stuff-- I

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.660
have a photo of her where
we pasted it up on the wall.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.510
PATTI SANCHEZ: It was like
"Home Alone." [SCREAMS]

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.390
Very upsetting.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.410
NANCY DUARTE: We literally
took the whole thing.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.480
And it was two months
before deadline.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.930
We cut half the
book and rebuilt it.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:58.932
It was unbelievable.

00:46:58.932 --> 00:47:00.932
PATTI SANCHEZ: But it was
the right thing to do,

00:47:00.932 --> 00:47:04.794
and what motivated it was a
desire to help the reader.

00:47:04.794 --> 00:47:06.460
The feedback that we
got from the people

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.219
that we tested the ideas with,
that's what gave me conviction

00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:12.510
to let go of some things that
I was really attached to.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.968
Because it was more
important to me

00:47:13.968 --> 00:47:15.450
that they walk
away with something

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.580
that's valuable to them
than to satisfy myself.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.190
NANCY DUARTE: Showcase that
we printed the internet wasn't

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:22.330
as important.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.330
PATTI SANCHEZ: Some of
it came from in here too.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.746
It wasn't all out
in the internet.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.890
Any other questions
from you guys?

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.420
Hope it is a really hard,
challenging question out there.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.878
NANCY DUARTE: Or you guys just
want to get back to your job

00:47:35.878 --> 00:47:37.842
and be torchbearers.

00:47:37.842 --> 00:47:39.790
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious to hear about some

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.225
of the company reinventions
you went through.

00:47:42.225 --> 00:47:43.279
NANCY DUARTE: Yeah.

00:47:43.279 --> 00:47:44.820
So believe it or
not, a lot of people

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.910
think I started the
company, but my husband did.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:50.210
1987, he worked his
butt off all summer

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:53.230
moving furniture from a
failing aerospace company.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.480
And he saved enough
to buy a Mac.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.730
And he started doing
technical illustrations.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.220
So he was a freelancer working
from home in his underwear,

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.350
kids underfoot,
loving it, right?

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.850
And then I joined him in
1990, pick up the phone,

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.190
and in one afternoon
won three huge accounts.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.850
So I don't go back
to my real job.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.969
We become a service bureau I
actually had a 35 millimeter

00:48:12.969 --> 00:48:13.510
slide imager.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.610
People don't even
know what that was.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.400
Cost us 20 grand.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.260
Here we are in this crappy
apartment in Sunnyvale,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.000
with yellow shag carpet.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.710
And we have a $20,000
thing that makes slides.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.430
Every penny we made, we
stuck back in the business.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.370
So we became a service
bureau, and then we

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.830
became a design firm.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.720
And then the dotcom
crash happened.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.120
Good to Great came
out, and Good to Great

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.385
had a hedgehog concept.

00:48:35.385 --> 00:48:37.260
And it said, if there's
one thing you can do,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.718
you can be best in
the world at, be

00:48:38.718 --> 00:48:42.196
profitable at and passionate
about, do just that one thing.

00:48:42.196 --> 00:48:44.320
So here was a season where
the economy had crashed,

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.150
and I did the most
counterintuitive dream,

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.790
re-dream of my business
ever, is I completely

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.500
shut the door on print and web.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.830
And we did just
presentations, the one thing

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.380
that we could focus on.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.440
So then we became a
niche, and then we

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.970
became best in the world when
we produced our material.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.110
And then we decided to
become best in the world

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.550
at business storytelling.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.050
And then you can
see-- and now we're

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.230
in leading through stories.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.087
So you can see the migration
of how that happened.

00:49:09.087 --> 00:49:10.670
PATTI SANCHEZ: And
we're not done yet.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.211
NANCY DUARTE: And
we're not done yet.

00:49:12.211 --> 00:49:14.950
The cool thing is, we moved in
two years ago to the building

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.970
that my husband moved
furniture from in 1987.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.570
So the building we're in, and
then the four buildings to 101

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.605
are the ones that he
moved furniture from.

00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:24.230
PATTI SANCHEZ: One
of the things that I

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:28.120
love about that story, the
transformation around 2001

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.136
and focusing on presentations
is saying no to other things.

00:49:31.136 --> 00:49:32.510
Nancy talked about
the importance

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.650
of endings and beginnings.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:35.566
And I think that's
actually one of the hardest

00:49:35.566 --> 00:49:37.790
things about
reinvention of yourself

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.040
or anything that you're working
on is saying no to something,

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.260
leaving that something behind.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.407
But it's also freeing too,
lets you do bigger things.

00:49:48.407 --> 00:49:50.490
NANCY DUARTE: So if someone
has a burning question

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:52.198
and throws their hands
up, we'll take it.

00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:54.240
Otherwise, you guys get to go.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.190
Rehydrate and get ready
for your next thing.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.980
So here's your toolkits,
and thank you so much

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.180
for your time, guys.

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.110
Thank you.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.628
