00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.590
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.520
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.820
I'm John Cole.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.940 position:56%
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.720
which promotes books, reading,
literacy, and libraries on behalf

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.710
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.200
We were created almost 40 years
ago by the Librarian of Congress,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
Daniel Boorstin, when
he was a librarian.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.360
And we operate primarily here
at the library through events

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.280
such as this one, which are
noontime events by new books,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.230
by people who have a
special association

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.810
with the Library of Congress.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.860
But we also operate
nationally through a system

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.360
of affiliated state centers.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.750
Each state has an affiliation that
works with us to promote books,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.760
reading, and literacy in their
states and they also kind

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.840
of do their own thing
in their state.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.990
They are each either with a state
library or a humanities council,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.470
and they develop their own programs
but we provide not only a link

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.200
with the Library of Congress
but occasional support.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.250
A second way we operate
nationally is through reading

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.430
and literacy promotion partners.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.650
These are nonprofit groups that
are already interested in literacy

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.600
and in reading and they --

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.250
often they have branches
here in Washington,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.510 position:56%
and each year we have a national
meeting for each of these affiliates

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.790
where in person we swap ideas and
promote the activities of behalf

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.370
of reading and literacy promotion.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.030
The -- we are also the sponsors,
and I gave this major sponsor,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.830
the Library of Congress has a
wonderful book festival each year

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.360
and the Center for the Book
plays an important role in it,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.670
and I put this here to remind
me to tell you we have a date

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.780
for this coming book festival.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.340
It will be here -- it will be in
the Washington Convention Center

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.510
on September the 24th, all day,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.740
and will be having
more than 120 writers.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.560
And the real heart of this is
the writers and the readers.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.000
And so it's book signing and
listening to our favorite writers

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.250 position:56%
and also some programming, including
of course a literacy corner.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.750
It will be in the convention center
and that's been a wonderful way

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.440
for us to reach a broader audience.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.030
The Center for the Book
has this program series,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.760
which is as I mentioned, new books
by prominent writers and we --

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.300
it is a library wide series
and I know we have helped today

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.360
in recruiting the audience
and having --

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.470
helping us spread the word about
the talk from all parts of library.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.230
And I'm pleased to see people from
the congressional research service,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.240
which is the policy
part of the library

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.810
that deals among other
things with health,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.430
and from the Daniel
Murray Association,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.810
which has been supportive of Center
for the Book programs in the past.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.650
And finally, and this is
the end of preliminary part,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.100
by coincidence the Library
of Congress literacy awards

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.340
which were created by David
Rubenstein three years ago,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.380
we have just finished
giving the third set

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.280
of awards, is hosting a symposium.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.320
We do an annual symposium that kind

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.110
of stretches the boundaries
of literacy.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.270
And last year it was
on poetry and literacy.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.220
This year it's on literacy
and health, and it's going

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.770
to be here November --
March 16 and March 17.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.770
And on the handout table
there is information.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.720
It's a public event and you will
get the information and I'm hoping

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.050
that people can come on March 17.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.250 position:56%
It's really on St. Patrick's Day and
we will be talking about a subject

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.510
that is very dear to our
speaker's heart I learned

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.070
when I read his wonderful
autobiography,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.790
which he is going to
be discussing today.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.890
Our speaker, of course,
is Dr. Louis Sullivan,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.500
who served as the secretary
of health,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.690
in what did we call
it in those days?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.800
I must have it in here,
secretary of --

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.730
health and human services

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.650
under George H. W. Bush
in the administration.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.690
And we will hear his story today,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.900
which is part of his
new biography --

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.220
autobiography and it's really a
moving tale, an interesting story

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.320
about how a man from Georgia
really went to Morehouse College,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.900
attended medical school, and came
to be the secretary of health

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.590
and human services and
much more than that,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.730
and he will be telling
you that story.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.370
I would like to say a
word about our schedule.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.800
All of our talks are filmed for
the Library of Congress website

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.920
and we will include a
question and answer period

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.380
as well as a book signing.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:50.160 position:56%
And if you are able to think of some
questions you are most welcome to.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.220
Everything; however, will be filmed

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.040
and eventually presented
on our website.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.010
So thank you in advance for your
permission to use your image

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.790
and I'm sure penetrating questions.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.540
I would like to say just
another word about the program

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.350
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.350
We have another connection with Dr.
Sullivan that we talked about --

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.560 position:56%
which I read about in this book,
and that was with Laura Bush, who --

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.270
excuse me, with Barbara Bush.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.610
We are -- our program is
connected with both the Bushes,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.120
who were considered
[inaudible] literacy.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.380
His was with Barbara Bush
and he will tell a little bit

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.870
about his connection with
Barbara Bush and her concern

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.000
with adult literacy, and lo
and behold things come around,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.450
the Barbara Bush Family
Literacy Foundation is a partner

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.980
of the Center for the Book
as part of that network

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.650
that I described earlier.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.560
So I'm pleased to have that
connection with our guest.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.510
Let's give him a round of
applause, Dr. Lewis Sullivan.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:06.110
[ Applause ]

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.410
&gt;&gt; Louis W. Sullivan: Thank you.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.330
Well thank you very much for
that generous introduction.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.580
And I'll begin by saying for
me this is a great pleasure

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.090
and on an opportunity to be
here at Library of Congress

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.520
as part the Center
for the Book program.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.220
So I don't forget it, let me
mention three recognitions

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.360
that the book has received; one
from Georgia Center for the Book,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.800 position:56%
that the Georgia Center for the Book
recognized my autobiography as one

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.440
of 10 books in the year 2015
that all Georgians should read.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.550
So I was very honored,
very pleased with that.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.180
I wasn't sure how they could
enforce that recommendation

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.450
but hopefully people
will be swayed by that.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.290
I was also pleased to receive the
NAACP Image Award in February --

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.070
a year ago for outstanding
autobiography.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.970 position:56%
And finally, the book was a finalist
for the Phyllis Wheatley Book Award

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.830
at the Schomberg Library
in New York.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.780
So I'm pleased with the recognition
that the book has received.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.970
Let me also jump ahead to
tell you how the connection

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.200
with Barbara Bush occurred.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.080
In July of 1982, at the
Morehouse School of Medicine,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.710
we dedicated the first
structure we had developed

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.160
for the medical school.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.490
We had Vice President George
H. W. Bush as our speaker.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.710
And we had a great time that night.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.130
That was his introduction to the
Morehouse School of Medicine.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:54.240
This is a new school
having been formed in 1975.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.320
And we were warned by his
staff that he could stay

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.470
after his speech only
about 15 minutes.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.050
This is a program scheduled
for nine in the morning

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.050
because he was scheduled to speak
at a luncheon in New Orleans.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.490
So his staff warned us
that he would probably have

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.600 position:56%
to leave immediately after his talk.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.040
Well he came, gave his talk.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.480
This was on an outdoor patio
in front of the building.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.340 position:56%
Across the street behind the barrier
were about 15 or 20 protesters and,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.220
of course, as the dean of this
school I was quite embarrassed.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.930
We had the vice president
here and they were protesting.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.490
He came out and looked.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:41.540
He said, gee, only 15 to 21,
Ronnie would have 100 [laughter].

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.780
So that was where he diffused that.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.300
Well, rather than staying --

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.020 position:56%
rather than leaving immediately
afterwards he stayed almost an hour.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.480
His staff was tugging at
him to get him to leave.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.690 position:56%
He was obviously having a good time.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.550
I was very pleased.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:05.090 position:56%
And here at the program were like
Andy Young, John Lewis, Ed McIntyre,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.770
the African American mayor
of Augusta at that time,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.620
and many other black
officials, all of them Democrats

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.920
where they're all pushing

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.540
to get their pictures taken
with the vice president.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.230
So I was quite pleased with
that and vice president --

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.200
then Vice President Bush
was enjoying himself

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.170
so finally his staff succeeded

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.800
in tugging him away to
go onto New Orleans.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.080
And, of course, I was
quietly thinking, well,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.920 position:56%
perhaps the staff gave me that story

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.410
in case he was not
well received here

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.630
so there would be a rational
reason for him to leave.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.170
But nevertheless, he
left and as he left one

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.470
of his aides pressed something

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.440 position:56%
into my hand saying the vice
president would like you have these.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.920
And later I -- I put it in my
pocket and later I pulled it out

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.140
and it's a pair of vice
presidential cufflinks.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.400
Up until that time I didn't know
that any such thing existed.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.350
Two weeks later, on a Friday
afternoon, I was very busy trying

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.070
to finish some things in my office

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.740
when my secretary buzzed me saying
the vice president is on the phone.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.040
I said what vice president?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.380
She says, oh, you've
forgotten already [laughter].

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.240
So I said, oh.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.820 position:56%
So I picked up the telephone, it was
Vice President Bush and he proceeded

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.880
to tell me that he was planning a
trip to [inaudible] South Africa

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.710
in November of that year, this
was 1982, and he wanted me

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.050
to be part of his delegation.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.830
So I'm listening and, of
course, quite surprised.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.010 position:56%
And I said, gee, Mr. Vice President,
this sounds very interesting.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.130
It's a very important
trip and I'll see

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.620
if I can really arrange my
calendar, but since I'm not

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.610 position:56%
in government what would my role be?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.150
He said, Lou, well to
be honest with you,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.740
we don't have an Andy Young
in our administration.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.930
Because you remember how
prominent Andy Young was during the

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.400
Carter years.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.110
And he went on to say,
and I don't think I can go

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.410
to [inaudible] South Africa

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.910
without some prominent African
Americans in my delegation.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.840
So you would do me a
favor, but more importantly,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.800
you would do the country a service
if you would be willing to go.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.640
So I went.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.080
I appreciated his honesty.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.200
On that trip was Barbara Bush.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.560
We visited eight countries
over a two week period.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.500
And while Bush was meeting with
the heads of state in Zimbabwe,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.720
in Synagogue, and Nigeria, Zaire
and other countries we visited,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.990
Barbara was talking
adult literacy groups.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.280
And frequently I would
tag along with her.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.580
It was very interesting.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.850
And these groups were almost
all female, because of the level

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.180
of literacy in the various
countries in Africa.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.930
And she obviously was committed
to this, she was enjoying it.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.600
The audience was also enjoying it.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.460
And I was fascinated.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.800
So on the plane back,
this was a Wednesday,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.660
the day before Thanksgiving
in 1982, on the way back

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.130
to the U.S. I spoke with her.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.920
I said, Barbara, you
know, you do a great job

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.250
with these adult literacy groups.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.530
And you know, you and I
are in the same business,

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.180 position:56%
you're in adult literacy
education, I'm in medical education,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.820
we are new school and, you know, we
are a minority school and we need

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.600
to have someone like
you on our board.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.900 position:56%
Would you be willing to consider it?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.650
She says, well, Lou, you know,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.830
they really make sure before I
accept anything I have to pass it

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.440
by the White House
counsel, etcetera.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.720
So let me talk to them and
I will get back to you.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.590
And so I was thinking,
well gosh, what a nice,

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.380
smooth way to brush
off such a request.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.830
Well this is Wednesday, the
day before Thanksgiving.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.600
The following Tuesday she called.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.360
She said, Lou, I can do it.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.660
I said great.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.940
So she joined our board
in January of '83.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.700
And that's how the Bush
relationship started.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.820
So I'll come back to this a
little in my autobiography.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.200
Well, I was born in 1933, the
depth of depression in Atlanta.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.510
My father was an insurance salesman
for Atlanta Life Insurance Company.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.240
Those of you who know Atlanta know

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.070
that the Atlanta Life Insurance
Company was the backbone

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:14.490
of the Atlanta economic
engine for blacks in Atlanta.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.450
That was founded in the early part
of the 20th century, around 1901

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:25.660
and 1902 by Alonzo Herndon, who
himself had been born a slave.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:31.720 position:56%
That organization grew and supported
the development of a number

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.980
of other financial organizations.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.090
One was Mutual Federal
Savings and Loans.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.200
Because in Atlanta back in the '30s

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.510
and '40s blacks could not get
mortgages from white banks,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.780
but they got them from Mutual
Federal Savings and Loans.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:51.250
And so growing up in Atlanta we
saw that blacks had fine homes.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.860
There's also a real estate --
several real estate companies,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.900
a property insurance
company, many other businesses

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.510
in the Atlanta community.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.440
So my father was a
salesman for Atlanta Life,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.130
but during the depression nobody
was buying life insurance.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.510
So I was the second of two boys.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.720
So thinking of how he would really
support his family, he left Atlanta

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.680
and moved to southwest
Georgia and founded the first

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.270
in black funeral home in Blakely,
Georgia, in southwest Georgia.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:31.310
Blakely is about 58 miles west of
Albany, and about 28 miles east

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:36.430
of Dothan, Alabama, about 70
miles north of the Florida border.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.970
So down in southwest Georgia.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.970
In those years this was the
heart [inaudible] country.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.720
In addition to founding
a funeral home,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.540
he did a number of other things.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.460
He founded the first
chapter of the NAACP.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.440
He started an annual emancipation
day celebration on January 1

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.640
of every year that the African
American community was celebrating

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.850
Lincoln's emancipation.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.700
We would have bands,
speakers, parade downtown,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.820
voter registration
efforts, because in addition

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.880
to his other activities he was
working like many other blacks

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.390
in Georgia to have a
repeal of the white primary

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.010
where blacks could not participate.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.310
So he was quite an activist.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.380
And because of his
activism my mother,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.010
who was a school teacher having
taught in North Carolina prior

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.030 position:56%
to them getting married, in spite of
her experience as a school teacher,

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:41.000
during the 20 years they
lived there from 1937 to 1957,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.200
my mother never got a position
as teacher in [inaudible] country

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.950
where Blakely is the county seat.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.460
During those 20 years she had
to drive to other counties

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:59.740
where she taught, ranging from 14
miles to as far as 40 miles away.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.060
My brother, Walter, who is a
year and a half older than I,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.090
never attended school in Blakely.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.720
We attended school where
my mother was teaching.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.400
So we would go to Bluffton,
to Cuthbert, other places.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.890
But by the time I was in fifth
grade, my brother in sixth grade,

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.440 position:56%
we went to Savannah to live with our
aunts where my mother had grown up

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.730 position:56%
and attended school there that year,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.550
and that was because of my parents'
commitment to the two of us getting

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.890
as best an education as we could.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.200
Because in those years segregated
schools in rural Georgia,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.470
schools for blacks were
really not very good.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.770
We got hand-me-down books.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.700
When white school got
books we got the used books

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.290
from the white school.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.750
The white school had a band,
the black school did not,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.340 position:56%
there were no instruments, etcetera.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.790
So there were many
obvious deficiencies

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.500
in the educational
offerings for blacks

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.160
in rural Georgia in those years.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.060
The following when I was in sixth
grade my mother returned to Atlanta

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.100
to study for her master's in
education and my brother and I went

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.930
with her and we lived in
Atlanta during that year.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.680
By the end of that year she had
arranged for a friend to take us

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.670
in as borders during
the school year.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.540
So from sixth grade on my brother
and I attended school in Atlanta.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.850
We would go home to
Blakely on the summer

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.530
or Christmas or other holidays.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:36.190
Well, there are many scenes that we
describe in the book from Blakeley.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.800
One of them out was when the local
policeman was going by our house

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.130
and I was on the front porch
with our dog and he had a BB gun,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.980
he was shooting stray dogs

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.910
and he thought this was
the funniest thing ever.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.700
So he shot my dog.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.010
I was about age 11.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.250
And when that happened I was
quite surprised and I was angry.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.780
I ran down to the curb and
asked, why did you shoot my dog?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.310
So he pointed the gun
at me and said, well,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.930
would you like to have some?

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.230
So I said, you wait here.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.600
And I was so angry, I was
crying, tears run down,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.960
ran in the house looking
in the chifforobe drawer

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.450
where my father kept his gun.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.060
Fortunately, it was not
there because he was away

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.160
and he always carried
his gun with him.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.040
My mother, who was in the back
of the house, heard the noise

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.700
when the door slammed,
came up and found me crying

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.440
in their bedroom looking
for my dad's gun.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.890
So she grabbed me to find
out what was going on.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.500
And also at time the
iceman was there

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.740
because what we had was a
refrigerator where we had

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.820
to purchase ice every day.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.330
So the iceman came up and the two

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.360
of them restrained me while
they learned what was going on.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.570
So about 20 minutes later my father
returned with my brother to find

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.040
out -- to return home
and found this commotion.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.220
And he stood quietly as I
told him what had happened.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.930
So without saying anything more he
told my brother, Walter, he said,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.180
Walter, you come with me.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.140
So Walter said, where are we going?

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.890
They got in the car, he says we're
going down to the sheriff's office.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.190
So we went down.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.320
And in those years one of the
things that happened in Blakely,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.080
as all over the south, blacks were
never addressed as Mr. or Mrs.,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.920
it was Annie or Bill or
Joe or what have you.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:35.210
So my father went into the
police station in the front.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.850
And the policeman was in the back.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.530
So my father yelled out
in a loud voice, Dallas,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.730
his last name was Dallas.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.860
Dallas? So he peered out.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.520
Oh, yes, [inaudible] and he
says what can I do for you?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.820
He said, well, I understand

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.960
that there was some
trouble up at my house.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.430
He says, trouble, what
kind of trouble?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.240
I understand that there
was a problem with my dog.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.540
Oh, I don't what.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.510
So my father then pulled
this revolver out of his belt

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.000
and put it right between his eyes.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.300
He said look, let me
tell you something,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.630
he said if you ever have
any trouble with my wife

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.100
or my boys you don't say
or do anything to them.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.170
You come to me.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.870
Because if anything
like this happens again,

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.220
I will blow your brains out.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.930
By this time Dallas was really
melting with perspiration.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:32.550
So from then -- those years on we
never had any trouble in Blakely.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.440
But my father, I'm sure as you
know, was known within some

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.900
of the white community
as that crazy N,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.730 position:56%
you know the N word they always use.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:50.520
Well, we -- my father retired in
1957 and that's when they moved

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.460
to Fort Lauderdale, Florida where
my mother got a position teaching

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.090
school in Fort Lauderdale.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:04.040
My experience with the schools
in Atlanta was very different.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.130
While the community was segregated,
there's a strong black community

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.970 position:56%
in Atlanta, I mentioned the business
community, but there's also a group

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.160
of black colleges in Atlanta
that many of you have heard of,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.180
Morehouse College being one,
Spelman College being another.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.280
Morehouse is all male,
Spelman all female.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.160
Clark College, which
is co-educational

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:30.130
and my mother had graduated from
Clark College and my brother,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.630
a year ahead of me, also
went to Clark College.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.080
The presence of those colleges mean

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.570
that over the years
there are a number

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.030
of well-educated African
Americans in Atlanta,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:48.550
and that has fed the growth of
a professional class in Atlanta,

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.590 position:56%
not only in business but in the
arts, etcetera, and it's no accident

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.910
that the civil rights leaders
really focused in Atlanta.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.260
So Atlanta, over the years, even
in those years back in the '40s,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.810
was really different
from the rest of Georgia

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.330
for the African American community.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:12.970
[inaudible] that has been the
white leadership in Atlanta led

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.350
by Bob Woodruff, the
former CEO of Coca-Cola.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:23.780 position:56%
Because when I graduated from Booker
Washington High in Atlanta in 1950,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.800
there were about 400
in my graduating class.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.320
There were a number of students

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.120
who received scholarships
from an anonymous donor.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.770
And every time that anonymous
donor scholarship was announced

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.990
when a student was
introduced, there's a murmur --

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.780
a knowing murmur that
went through the room,

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.660
because we knew this
was Bob Woodruff

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.290
and the Woodruff Foundation.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.920
So Bob Woodruff set
the tone for business

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.640
and business leaders in Atlanta.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.910
Some -- to jump ahead
to mention a few things,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.850
to show what I mean is this.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.560
When Martin Luther King Junior
was assassinated it turned

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.770
out by coincidence Bob Woodruff
was in the Oval Office meeting

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.990
with President Lyndon Johnson.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.890
The President's aide came in with a
message for Mr. Woodruff for a call

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.930
and that's when he learned
about King's assassination.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:28.330
So he then -- Woodruff then called
Chief Inman, the chief of police

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:35.520
in Atlanta and told him, well,
we don't want to have any riots

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.110
in the home of Martin Luther King
Junior, so whatever you need,

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.300
if you don't have it in your
budget, I'm good for it.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.040
So that was one example.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.590
Another was earlier in the '60s

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.240
when Martin Luther King Junior
received the Nobel Prize.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.650
They planned a dinner
in his honor in Atlanta.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.090
And it turns out about a week
before the dinner there were few --

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.190
only a few of the white
business leaders

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.830
who had signed up for the dinner.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.810
Bob Woodruff sent out a
message saying Coca-Cola is an

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.050
international company.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.390
We happen to be based in Atlanta,
but we don't have to based

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:21.340
in Atlanta if we cannot honor a
son who has gotten the Nobel Prize.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.240
The dinner was sold out
before sundown on that day.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.490
So Atlanta has been
blessed by others

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:32.190
who have really taken the spirit
of Woodruff so that the level

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:36.980
of communication and cooperation
between black leadership in Atlanta

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:42.050
and white leadership in
Atlanta has been great.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:46.210 position:56%
Let me give you one further example.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:51.740
You've seen around the country
the failure of public hospitals

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.190
because of lack of support in them.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.570
D.C. General has experienced

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.350
that because D.C. General
Hospital closed.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.890
A number of other hospitals,

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.940
Philadelphia General Hospital
closed, St. Louis Hospital closed,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.030
and in Los Angeles the Martin
Luther King Junior Hospital closed,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.520
because public hospitals have a
difficult time with the number

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.680
of patients who -- that they
serve who have high costs

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.440
but there's no insurance and they
don't have the funds themselves

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.450
and they depend upon support
from their local governments.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.750
And if that support is not
enough the hospitals fail.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:34.240
Grady Hospital in 2008
was in such a position.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.020
But the Chamber of Commerce met
with Fulton County Commissioners

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.010
and they came up with the idea
of privatizing the governance

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:46.930
of the hospital so that the
personnel issues would be private,

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.940
the hiring, evaluation,
firing of the CEO, contracts,

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.870
etcetera would be approved
by this non-profit board,

00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:00.150
which would operate the
hospital by contract.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.490
I served on the Grady
board at that time

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.850
until a year ago, March
of last year.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:12.950
So with that participation by the
business leadership in Atlanta,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.470
Grady Hospital has been rescued.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.610
It went from a $50 million
annual deficit to less

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.900
than $10 million annual
deficit today,

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.410
and had the county
continued the level of support

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:29.510 position:56%
that they were giving in 2008 Grady
would be actually well in the black.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:35.400
So there's that kind of community
in Atlanta that my brother, Walter,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.110
and I grew up in, so
we have enjoyed that.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.350
In high school, at
Booker Washington High,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.470
our teachers were very
dedicated, they were inspiring.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.060
They did everything to try
and interest us in learning

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.870
and challenging us to do well.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.120
So I went on Morehouse College.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.890
Surprised my family described
that episode in the book

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.600
when I told parents that I
wanted to go to Morehouse.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.110 position:56%
My father's reaction said, you
know, no, we are a Methodist family,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.850
that's a Baptist school [laughter].

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.470
So I said, dad, you know,
they started out affiliated

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.470
with the Baptist but they've
been independent a long time.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.370
He said, well, he kept going --

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.690
said, well, dad, I'm not going
to church, I'm going to college.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.080
So my mother intervened and
said, Walt, if he wants to go

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.130
to Morehouse, Morehouse is a good
school, so let's let him do that.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.730
So I went on to Morehouse.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.140
My friends were going to Morehouse
from my high school class.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.750
I wanted to go places they went.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.450
At Morehouse I came
under the influence

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.230
of Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:50.240
Dr. Mays served as the president of
this college from 1940 until 1967.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.530
He came in towards the
end of the depression.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.780
The college, like so many
colleges around the country,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.530
was struggling with its finances.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:03.950 position:56%
But through his diligence, he was an
eloquent speaker, he was a preacher,

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.900
well-known, spoke all
over the country,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.760
the National Council of Churches.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.910
He would speak for example
at [inaudible] State College

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.780
for their Easter service
every year, etcetera.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.770
So Dr. Mays really
rescued Morehouse.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.470
He recruited a strong faculty.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.330
So when I entered in 1950 I
was really entering a place

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.710
where there were many scholars

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.370
and he was always challenging
the students to do well.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.080
One of his sayings
that he would say,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.500
and he spoke every
Tuesday at chapel.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.070
Now in those years as a
student, chapel was compulsory

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.120
at Morehouse, and we
didn't like that.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.890 position:56%
We said we're supposed to be adults,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.550
why are we being treated
like children?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.410
We're being compelled to do this.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.250
Because if we didn't
attend we would get demerits

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.020
and it would actually take
away from our college credits.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.460
And it happens that one very good
friend of mine, who did well,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.900
had earned all the credits
he needed to graduate,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.040
but he had so many demerits
he did not graduate.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.880
He had to attend summer
school to make up the credits.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.180
So that was it.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.630
So we really on the one hand,
we resented that because we felt

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.760
that we were supposed
to be treated as adults,

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.440
but you're treating
us like children.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.370
Well, I can tell you as an alumnus
looking back I'm glad we had

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.620
to attend chapel.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.450
Because not only did
we hear Dr. Mays,

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.360
but we heard many other
outstanding speakers,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.660
Thurgood Marshall would come
leading the legal defense fund

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.210
in the [inaudible]
legal defense fund.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.050
We had many local speakers.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.370
Attorney Walden, who
was one of the leaders

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.300
in the black community
really negotiating

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.300
with then Mayor Hartsfield.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.050
He led an effort, but they would
sit down with Mayor Hartsfield

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.620
and say we want our roads paved,
we want these schools [inaudible],

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.090
we want a swimming
pool here, etcetera.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.520
And so with Mayor Hartsfield
agreeing to that,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.840
the blacks would vote for him.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.830
And so he remained as mayor
for a number of years.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.570 position:56%
And as you know, the Atlanta Airport
became the Hartsfield Airport.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.040
It's now the Jackson
Hartsfield Airport

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.350
with Maynard Jackson's
name after it.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:27.310
So at Morehouse we were really
taught to work to excel.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.830
And he would -- Dr. Mays would say
such things to us as this, he said,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.690
whatever you choose to do in
life, you should do it so well

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:43.970 position:56%
that no man living, no man dead, and
no men yet to be could do it better.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:48.300
He said, if you commit yourself
to that, when they're looking

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.680
for someone in your field they
will have to consider you.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.830
You may not get the job,
but it should not be

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.410
because you're not prepared.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.620
Because he was telling us,
we're in a segregated world

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.460
and we may really not get
the job but he said this,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:09.190 position:56%
nothing more unfortunate than having
an opportunity presented to you

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.350
and you're not prepared, you're
not ready to take advantage of it.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.350
And as you know, Martin Luther King
Junior is our most famous graduate

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.740
of Morehouse College,
having finished in 1948.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.500
He came under Dr. Mays' spell.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.110
And Dr. Mays gave his eulogy
when Martin Luther King died.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:32.660
So that was the environment that
I was privileged to be a part

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.520
of during my college years.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.020
And I then went on to medical
school at Boston University.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.960
So first Morehouse graduate
to go to Boston University,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.300
and in those years there
very few blacks going

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.080
to predominantly white schools.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.590
[inaudible] were the schools
that were educating the most

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.870
of the nation's black
physicians, and they continue

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.810
to educate a significant
number today.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.140
So in September of 1954, shortly
after the Supreme Court's Brown

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.820
versus Board of Education decision

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.730
that declared separate schools were
inherently unequal and; therefore,

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.210
unconstitutional, that was year I
entered Boston University School

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.670
of Medicine.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.700
For me this was several
significant things.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.240
First, of course, I was
going to medical school,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.720 position:56%
which I was very excited about
because I had been really mesmerized

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.010
by one black physician
in southwest Georgia,

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.900
Dr. Joseph Griffin [assumed
spelling], who was in Bainbridge.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.530
Bainbridge was 41 miles
south of Blakely.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.330 position:56%
When my parents needed about a
doctor they didn't go to the doctors

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.570
in Blakely because with the white
doctors there were segregated

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.870
waiting rooms.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.170
Usually the black waiting room was
around the side or around the back.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.580
So they didn't like that.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.880
So they would not go.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.590
Only in an emergency would
they use the white physicians.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:57.080
And my father operated an ambulance
service and many other blacks

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.450
who could afford it would use my
father's ambulance service to go

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:04.590
down to Bainbridge
to see Dr. Griffin.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:09.860 position:56%
Dr. Griffin, when you would open the
door of his clinic, it was a 25 bed,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.220
brick clinic, unusual
brick structure.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.830
He was obviously very
successful, highly respected.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.190
Open the door, there would
be the smell of ether,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.710
which is kind of a
sweet, pungent smell,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.010 position:56%
and he would be wearing scrub suits.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.630
And so for me as a young
boy I found him fascinating.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.600
I was interested in science
and trees and birds and flowers

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.190
and wild animals and so forth.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.780
So for me biology was a natural.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.170
But Dr. Griffin was special
because he could cure people,

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.570 position:56%
to take care of people who were ill.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.560
So from age five I decided
I wanted to be a doctor.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.400
So that was my goal as I went
through high school and then went

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.070
through college and then went
on to Boston University there,

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.650
not quite 21 years of age.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.430
My first time living in a
non-segregated environment.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.110
I wondered, how am I
going to be received here?

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.270
Will it be with hostility?

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.580
Will it be ignored or indifferent?

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.400
Or will it be welcomed?

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.830
Well, to make a long story short,

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.230
I had a great experience
at Boston University.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.710
My classmates and my
faculty well received me.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.450
I was the only black in
my class of 76 students.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.990
Another thing was interesting
at Boston University, they --

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:32.430
a class of 76 students, we had
seven women and we were boasting

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.460
at that time that only the
medical college for Women

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.900
in Pennsylvania had more
women medical students.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.240
And, of course, that's very
different today because about half

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.990
of the nation's medical
students are female.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:52.040
So when I entered Boston University
in 1954, this was really a time

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:58.620
for me of new beginnings, living
in a non-segregated environment,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.980
really studying medicine, which
had been my lifelong goal,

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.020
and also the center where
the revolution started,

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.570
where there was a Boston tea party.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.820
The Paul Revere ride,
the battle at Lexington,

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.280
and the bridge in Concord.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.690
And I walked the freedom trail
and took in that history,

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.090
Colonial [inaudible] regiment,
the all-black regiment

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:24.670
from the Civil War [inaudible] just
opposite the capital building there

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.970
in Boston.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.950
And so this for me was
a tremendous experience.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.740
I worried when entered.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.430
Here my classmates, these guys
who finished Amherst, Williams,

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.230
Princeton, Harvard,
Columbia, etcetera,

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.980
places I had really heard
about all these years.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.010
Of course, during our first week
we would be meeting each other

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.950
and say hi Lou, I'm
from, you know, Holyoke,

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.780 position:56%
Massachusetts and I went to Amherst.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.080
Where did you go?

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.380
I said, I went to Mores.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.680
Oh yeah, Morehead, great school.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.080
No, no, no, not Morehead,
North Carolina, Morehouse.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.060
Oh, Morehouse, where's that?

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.220
So my classmates hardly
knew about it.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.340
So here I am.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.270
The one black in my class.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.300
I'm wondering, am I
going to do okay?

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.830
Will I let my parents down?

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.470
Will I let Dr. Mays
or Morehouse down?

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.770
Since I was the only black I'm kind

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.730
of really representing
the black community.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.490
Will I embarrass myself?

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.740
All these guys who finished
at the top of their class

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.410
at all these places and they
never heard of where I came from.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.660
Well, our first examine in anatomy
was about three weeks later.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.180
I got a great score so I
relaxed and I enjoyed my --

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.710 position:56%
the rest of my medical school years.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.210
I served as class president
for two of my four years there.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.420
So I had a great experience.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:52.520
Then when I graduated I went
through a similar phenomenon

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.780
because I was accepted
for an internship

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.080
at Cornell Medical Center.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.960
1958 New York Hospital had
never had a black intern.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.840
So I went there.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.230
The chief of medicine had
come up from Tennessee.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.280
When he interviewed me I
said oh-oh, this is it.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.560
And I'm saying they're just doing
this to say they interviewed.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.580
But sure enough I was surprised.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.860 position:56%
I was accepted there, spent two
years, had a great experience there,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.450
and his name was Hugh
Lucky [assumed spelling].

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:31.400
To fast forward, in 1975
when I went back to Morehouse

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.840
to start the medical school one of
the first grants we received was

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.740
from the Josiah Macy Foundation
where Hugh Lucky was one

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.670
of the board of directors.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.970 position:56%
So he and I got to be great friends.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.540
And so that experience
taught me a lesson,

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.640
because I had automatically assumed
with his thick, southern drawl

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.120
when he interviewed me that I
was out, but turned out to --

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.710
became one of my best
friends and boosters.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:02.340 position:56%
So that showed me I had my own
prejudices I had to work to address.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.360
Went back to Boston for training in
hematology, first at Mass General

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.510
for a year and then at
the Thornback Laboratory

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.350
at Harvard at Boston City Hospital.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.130
Then joined the faculty first in
New Jersey College of Medicine,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.580
but then recruited back to Boston

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.250
after two years to
my medical school.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:24.120
I wanted to become what eventually
was a professor of medicine.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.740
I thought I was really then set
on my life's path because I wanted

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.740
to be chairman of the department of
the medicine hopefully by age 45,

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.910
but at age 41 Morehouse
College decided they wanted

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.760
to start a medical school, and I
worked with them as an advisor.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.060
I was very pleased to advise them
on this, but then they surprised me

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.300
by asking if I would come
back to head up the school.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.650
And after some thought,
and I describe this

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.820
in the book with details.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.020
My wife, Ginger, I got
married in medical school.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.810
She's from Massachusetts, three
children born in Massachusetts.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:01.480
So my ties to Georgia had
become a little tenuous.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.760
But the idea of medical school
at Morehouse was fascinating

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.260
because the rationale for
the school is as follows.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:16.640
A shortage of black physicians and
other black health professionals.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.400
In 1950 2% of the nation's
physicians were African American

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.480
when blacks were at
10% of the population.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.740 position:56%
During the civil rights era a lot
of things changed, including efforts

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.410
to increase the number
of African American,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.270
and other minority
health professionals.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:40.850
So today rather than
2% it's about 4.7%.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.100
Whereas blacks now are 12% of
the population, Hispanics are 15%

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.660
of the population, and
they represent only about 4

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.810
or 5% of the nation's physicians.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.840
So the rationale for
developing a more --

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.170
a school medicine at Morehouse
was to increase the number

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.880
of African American and
other minority physicians.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.100 position:56%
And so I went back and worked there,
established the medical school

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:11.200
which became independent from the
college in 1981, and we started

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.410
as a two year school but evolved
into a four year school there.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:21.270
And I can say to you today
that we now have a number

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.740
of graduates who have done well.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.980
We've produced a surgeon general,

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.770
Regina Benjamin was
one of our graduates.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.880
We produced the president
of another medical school.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.710
And one of our graduates from South
Africa returned to South African

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.950
and developed the first
nationwide blood banking system

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.820
in South Africa, modeled after the
Red Cross blood banking system.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.510
I was there in October of
2010, had dinner with him.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.790 position:56%
They were celebrating the completion
of their first year of operation

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.880
without a single case
of transmission of HIV

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.870
or hepatitis C virus, so it's a
very important contribution there.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.710
So those are the things that
have animated me during my life.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.390
I'm officially retired but
I'm still active in a number

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.950
of voluntary organizations working

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:11.770 position:56%
to not only improve the health
system, because my focus is not only

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.900
on the African American and
other minority communities,

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.320
but on our country at large.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.540
Because during my time
as secretary we worked

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.970
to develop a new food
label, which was approved.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:28.990
We worked to discourage tobacco use
and to improve healthy behavior,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.100
because I say that while the
20th century was a century

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.010
in which we experienced tremendous
advances in the sciences,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.900
[inaudible] medicine with
many new drugs, new therapies,

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.890
medical devices, life
expectancy has improved

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.220
because of improvements
in public health.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.720
The 21st century is going to
have its major improvements

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.140
if we could improve the health
behavior of our citizens.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.830
That's why I was pleased to launch
Healthy People 2000 in September

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.700
of 1990 when I was secretary.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.570
That has continued now and
so with increased emphasis

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.950
on healthy behavior we hope to see
many improvements in the health

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.320
of our citizens going forward.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.290 position:56%
So with that I will stop and will be
pleased to respond to any questions

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.780
or comments that you might have
either on things I have mentioned

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.610
or things I may not have mentioned,

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.320
I will be happy to
try and respond to.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.120
So thank you very much.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:31.160
[ Applause ]

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.960
Yes?

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:43.560
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.360
Yes.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:54.070
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:43:54.070 --> 00:44:01.850
Yes. Well, first of all, let
me say the question was what

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.430
about my experience at HHS?

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.760
What are some of the
memories I take from that?

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.180
I would say this.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:13.460
The first, I was impressed with
the dedication and the expertise

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.070
of the employees at HHS,
because I had not been

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.380
in public service before.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.890
Of course, what I had heard from
various members of congress,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.190
who were always criticizing things

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.170
about the federal bureaucrats
suggesting

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:29.590
that that person is really
either incompetent or inefficient

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.560
or whatever, I'm sure there's
some of that, but there's some

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.990
of that in the private sector.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.450 position:56%
But I was impressed by the number of
employees who were not only expert

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.430 position:56%
in their fields but who worked hard.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:43.530
Occasionally I would sneak in to
my office on a Saturday or Sunday

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.200
to try and do some things
quietly because of my schedule.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.790
But I noticed in the parking
lot under the building about 20%

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:55.670
of the places have cars
there, employees were there.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:59.540
When I would have briefings
on various activities,

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.840
because I was impressed by that.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.830
So that was the first thing.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:08.480
The second thing that
I was impressed by,

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:15.440
in somewhat of a different way,
was how personal the programs

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.210
of HHS are to so many people.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:24.700 position:56%
Because HHS deals with so called hot
button issues, abortion, abortion,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.740
animal rights, because many
animal groups don't like --

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.610
don't approve of animal
experimentation,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:36.550
so they really do everything
to try and stop that.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.440
Because I'm a supporter I'm
certainly for ethical treatment

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.270
of animals, but there's so many
advances that have occurred

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.970
because of our ability to work --

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.700
to do work on animals
so that when we work

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.900
on humans we're not --
we are at less risk.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:56.220
Another group that was a
surprise was the disability group.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.510
I would go to speak at a
commencement or what have you,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.810
people would be wheeled --

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.190
brought in wheelchairs and so
the ushers would bring them right

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.270
down front so they could be seen,

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:07.510
and they would be there
very orderly, etcetera.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.780
Then when I would get up to
speak they would throw themselves

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.890
out of their wheelchairs and start
crawling towards the station --

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:18.020
towards the podium chatting,
why won't you meet with us?

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.830
Well, their issue was this.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.530
They wanted to have 1/3
of the have funds spent

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:28.050
for nursing homes spent
for home care.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.640
And, of course, my
staff had met with them

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.990
and explained, well,
it's in the law.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:35.030
The secretary does not have the
authority to change the law.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.520
It has to be changed
by the congress.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.260
But nevertheless, they
would be there.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.370
And, of course, in front
of an audience, you know,

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.750
you couldn't explain that.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.620 position:56%
If it, as you know, this thing is
if it takes you more than a sentence

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.320
to explain it you've lost it.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.270
So that was really something
which was very unusual.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.840
So when I was sworn in by my
assistant secretary for personnel,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.640
because the day I was
confirmed by the senate he came

00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.940
up with this Bible and swore me in.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.260
I said, wait a minute, we're
going to have an assembly.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.730
He says, oh yes, we'll have that
in a couple weeks, you know,

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.200
but the real ceremony
is swearing you

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.350
in right now before they
change their mind [laughter].

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.600
So I took the oath.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.440
But when he swore me in
he said, congratulations,

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.870
you are now the most sued person
on the universe [laughter].

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.370
That would -- most of that
was social security issues.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.490
People had legal issues
about eligibility or payment

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.460
or other things like that.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.580
So those are things -- some of
the things that surprised me,

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:37.140
and of course I also learned you
don't have to explain or qualify

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.380
or apologize for words
that you didn't say.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.000
In other words, during
my orientation one

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.990
of the things I was always
taught, think through now

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.290
when you have a question,

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.630
particularly in an
emotional setting.

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:54.280
Don't just strike out, because
then you might say the wrong thing

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.580
and then you're forever
trying to say,

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.850
well what the secretary
really was trying to say,

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.920
or meant to say, etcetera.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.850
So that was another thing.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:06.270 position:56%
Because I learned, of course, that
the press is out there to make news,

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.360
and you may be their
vehicle to make news.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.820
So if they can get you to say
something that is different

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.540
or sounds different,
etcetera, that's a problem.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.040
So those are some of
the things there.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.910
But overall I say my experience
for me was 90% positive,

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.500
only about 10% negative, because
I got used to being picketed

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.790
after a time and I
realized that really it's

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.230
because I have this position.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:37.710
Once I was no longer secretary on
January 20, 1993, the pickets went

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.250
to the new secretary,
so they didn't go to me.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.050
Yes?

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:59.180
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.570
The Zika virus?

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:02.870
Yes, right.

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.130
Well, let me just repeat
the question.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:10.510 position:56%
What is the status of understandable
about the Zika virus, if I --

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.060
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.580
Yes, and the way we stop it, yes.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.480
Well first of all, the Zika virus
has been around for a long time,

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:25.440
but it's been really primarily
in Africa or in South America.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.070
And so there you have a population
that has been exposed to that virus

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.230
so there's a lot of immunity there.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:38.310
But what has happened in Brazil,
this virus has come in to areas

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:40.570
where it was not there before.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.720
So you have a population that is --

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.290
what's called naive in
terms of immunologic terms,

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.030
they have not had the virus before.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.880
So indeed when people are
infected with it, of course,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.260
first of all it's my understanding

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:58.610
that in most instances it's a very
mild viral infection, maybe a rash,

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.910
etcetera, but in a few instances
you might have these severe

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.770
complications that are being seen.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.820
So that's one of the issues.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.750
I do know that there is a
lot of work being done to try

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.780 position:56%
and develop a vaccine for the virus.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:23.190
There's other work that's being
done by experts in insects to try

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:28.970
and develop -- to change the
genome of the mosquito so that

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.560
if they -- the goal is this.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:37.530
If they can change that so that the
mosquito cannot carry the virus,

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:41.140
then that will stop the epidemic.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:46.670
Then thirdly, environmental things
such as getting rid of pools

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.290
of water where the mosquito
multiplies, etcetera.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.790
So there are a lot of
things that are being done.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:56.120
And, of course, they're working to
hopefully develop perhaps some kind

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.740
of antiviral against
the virus itself.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.380
So all of these things
are being done,

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.910
but because this is really
relevant -- coming into new areas,

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:08.740
including the possibility
of a southern U.S.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.280
because of climate change
that is with global warming.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.040
That means that the mosquito
could move into areas

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.910
where it was not there before
because of the warmer environment.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:24.810
So, of course, for reference
towards combating global warming,

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.610
this is another argument
to really do better on that

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.460
because the Zika is only one
of a number of conditions

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.320
that really could become present

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.110
that are not present
in our current climate.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:42.320
And, of course, we had the
Ebola virus a few years ago.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.920
And, of course, this is another
example of a virus that has been

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.240
in an area but now is coming
into new areas that we have

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.890
to find ways to combat that.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:55.660
Yes, yes?

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.120
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.920
Good morning.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:24.880
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.250
Okay, I hope I got the second part

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.320
of your question correct
and, if not, just tell me.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.680
So the question you're asking
is what things can be done --

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.690
well, is our health system
undergoing a revolution or changes?

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:44.330
And I would say yes, but it's
a question of definition.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:48.070
The fact is throughout the
course of 20th century starting

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:55.040 position:56%
with Teddy Roosevelt, there has been
an expressed desire of leadership

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.960
to have a universal
healthcare system.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.940
Now the argument has been, what
would be the shape of that?

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.770
The -- because our current
system is a mixture of public

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.070
and private participation, Medicare

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.370
and Medicaid being the
largest public systems,

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.330
but also the Veterans'
Administration,

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:19.390
Department of Defense,
and other parts

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.960 position:56%
of the publicly provided healthcare.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.400
The, of course, the private
being through insurance

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.220
or through employer
provided healthcare,

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.370
so we have this combined
public provide mix.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:37.150
Our healthcare system really,
I think, has made a number

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:43.160
of remarkable contributions to
life in America to improve life.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.710
Life expectancy in 1900 for an
infant born that year was 47 years.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.530
Today it is approaching 80 years.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.880
That's primarily due to
improvements in public health

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.780
such as safe drinking water,
the elimination of malaria

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.390
from the southern part of
the country that was present

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:02.900
in the early part of the 20th
century, safe drinking water.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:09.630
And then the development of first
of all sulfa drugs back in the '20s

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.630
and '30s and then antibiotics
and many other things.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:19.360 position:56%
And medical devices, such as cardiac
pacemakers, artificial joints.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.080 position:56%
I have an artificial hip that before
artificial joints were available,

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.410
and they were not available
when I was a medical student,

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:30.790
people would be immobilized if
they developed arthritis, etcetera.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.690
So we've had throughout the course

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:38.560
of the 20th century remarkable
advances in medical care

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.460
and in health -- more American
scientists throughout the course

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.680
of the 20th century have received
Nobel Prizes in physiology

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.840
and medicine than in the
rest of the world combined.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:55.000
So that's a measure of the strength
of the science in our country.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.460
So those are the things that we are
proud of, but we also have a system

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.200
that has a number of
problems or challenges.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.400
First of all, it's too expensive.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.530
Everyone agrees on that.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:11.260
Health consumes about 6% of
gross domestic product in 1965

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.870
when Medicare and Medicaid
were instituted.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:16.870
In 1989 when I came to
Washington as secretary of health

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:19.700
and human services, it was
11%, it almost doubled.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:23.700
We were spending $1 trillion
for healthcare from public

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:27.490
and private sources in 1989.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:31.320
In 2010 it was $2.4
trillion, it more than doubled

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.490
since I had come to Washington.

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:39.470
And it was taking 18% of
gross domestic product.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:44.990
So the path we are on really is
not sustainable because that means

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:50.300
that health will squeeze out
education, transportation, housing,

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.260
other things if we don't change it.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.680
So in that sense we have
to -- have to address it.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.340
But the question you
raised is very complex.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.600
We have a lot to be proud of,
but we also have a lot to address

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.960
and not everyone is covered

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.780
and that's what the Affordable
Care Act is designed to do.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.380
That's made some improvements.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.440
And for the record, I'm for that.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.530 position:56%
I really wish that members of
congress would see the obligation is

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.230
to serve the people rather
than to fight each other,

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.150
which has been the case
for the last several years.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.370
So overall we've made
improvements but we have a lot

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.060
yet to do if this is to continue.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:32.510
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You have time for two
more quick questions if we could.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:57.230
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:00.340
Yes, well, thank you for that.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.870
That in 25 words or less, right.

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:05.910
I think the question was,
what about health disparities,

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:09.860
what is the situation with the
African American community,

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.450 position:56%
particularly African American males?

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:16.060
And I would say this,
there's a lot to that.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.430
I would summarize it by saying
the health of Americans,

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:23.790
of all Americans, improved
tremendously throughout the

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:25.250
20th century.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:26.780
Black Americans today
are living longer

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.820
than white Americans
were living in 1900.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.550
So everyone has improved.

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:35.030
The gap in life expectancy
between blacks and whites back

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:39.360
in 1900 was about 15 to 17 years.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.050
The gap -- there's still a gap but
now it's around six to seven years.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.330
So the gap has narrowed
but it's still there.

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:47.660
We still -- we have a --

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.000 position:56%
we are undergoing a tremendous shift
democratically in our population.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.420
35% of Americans today
are either Latino,

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.850
African American, or
Native American.

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.570
Roughly 10% of our
health professionals come

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:02.150
from these groups.

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:07.390
And among some it's even lower, I
think around -- dentists around 6%.

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:08.690
So we have to do better.

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:12.440
And the reason for that
is that the relationship

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.740
between the health professional

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.450
and the patient also
affects the outcome.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:20.040
So we have many instances where
there is a very good relationship

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.000
between the health professional
who may be of a different racial

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.610
or ethnic group, but
often there is some bias,

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.300
even unconscious bias there.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.600
And that's one of the reasons

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.460
for more diversity among the
nation's health professions.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.060
Now the final comment is this, that
we really are in serious trouble

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:41.390
with the health profession so
far as African American males.

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:46.350 position:56%
You probably are referring to the
study that just came out last August

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:51.830
that showed that in the year
2014 there was something

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:57.390
like 525 African American
males entering medical school,

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:02.120
but that was actually 25 fewer
African American males entering

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.300
medical school than
occurred in 1978.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:08.680
1978 happens to be the year that
we [inaudible] class students

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:09.980
at Morehouse School of Medicine.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.570
So whereas other groups
have made progress,

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.840
there are more Hispanics going,
and actually let me say this,

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.580
there are more African Americans
going to medical school today

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.380
but it's because we have more
African American females,

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.050
2/3 of African American medical
students today are female.

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:28.440
Because there are around 1,400
African American first year medical

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.890
students around the
country now, and about nine,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.590
eight or 900 of those are
female, the rest are male.

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:38.050
So we need to do things
to address that.

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:40.120
And the Sullivan Alliance
is an organization

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.260
that I had -- was formed in 2005.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.240
We we're working in nine
states with programs

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.520
to increase the success
rate of minority youngsters

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.640
in gaining access to
health professions career,

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.880
not only medicine but
dentistry, nursing, other fields,

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.790
and fields such as
physician's assistants,

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:59.840
nurse practitioners, etcetera.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.140
So there's a lot to do.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:05.020
And so we are far from
having an ideal system,

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.770
but we're still plugging and hoping

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.170
that over the next few
decades we will get there.

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.470
&gt;&gt; John Cole: One last question.

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:13.270
Ma'am?

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:42.440
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.240
Yes, right.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.230
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.530
Sure, right.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:53.490
Well, the question I'll
repeat is, you retired in '95

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:57.270
from you said HEW, but
it was HEW up until 1976.

01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.110
That means you started before
1976 since you used HEW

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:03.840
because it's Health and Human
Services since the mid '70s

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.500
when education was split off.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.350
By the way, Lamar Alexander, when
he became secretary of education,

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.760
I had over for lunch in
my private dining room.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.200 position:56%
And the first thing I said, Lamar, I
want the rest of my department back,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.820
because Carter split off
education because of his agreement

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.390
with the teachers union, but that
really shouldn't have happened.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.990
But anyway, that's when
it changed [laughter].

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:30.920
Now your question, first of all,
most generics are just as good.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.220
There's hardly any problem.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:37.600
But physician, if he insists that
you should have a brand name,

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.290
can write that, say no
generic substitution,

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:42.280
but you would have to pay that.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.930
You can't get the brand name
drug at the generic price.

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:55.020
So -- but I think the rare
situation if you have a generic

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.990
that was not really as
good as a brand name.

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:02.640
What -- it's similar to, you know,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.860
why do we pay the Mercedes
price for a Mercedes car?

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.270
Well, that's -- a part of
that is the image, etcetera.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.660
Well in the pharmaceutical
industry maybe [inaudible]

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.780
but really generics are quite good.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.670
I take a number of
medications and they're generics

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.300
and I'm perfectly happy with it.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:26.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: On that positive note,
joint me [applause] in applause for.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.230
Thank you so much.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:35.100 position:56%
I want to thank Dr. Sullivan for not
only giving this wonderful picture

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:40.120
of his life, his inspirational
story, but also handing

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.370
out some practical medical advice.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:47.550 position:56%
It shows that he is on top of this
field, he's on top of several fields

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:52.900 position:56%
and I remain very impressed with
him and thank him for his being here

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:57.610
and his patience and for the
books that you are about to sign.

01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:00.700
You will have a chance to
continue the conversation

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.540
when we have a book signing here.

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.170
The books are on sale for the
Library of Congress 10% discount.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.490
I am very proud of the Georgia
Center for the Book for saying

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.260
that on their list,
on their website,

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.070
that every Georgian
should read this book.

01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:20.650
I agree and I wish I had thought of
that line to start my introduction.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.680
One final round of
applause and meet him

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.940
over for the book signing
[applause].
