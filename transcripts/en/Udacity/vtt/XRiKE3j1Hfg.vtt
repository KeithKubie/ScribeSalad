00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.540
Intradomain routing protocols are responsible for

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.850
routing within an autonomous system. Interdomain routing

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.710
protocols, on the other hand, are

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.500
responsible for routing traffic between autonomous systems.
