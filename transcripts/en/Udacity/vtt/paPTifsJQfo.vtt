00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What we've seen so far--we've analysed a bunch of different families of graphs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we've found that for all these examples the number of edges is like Î˜(n).

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It grows linearly with the number of edges.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You might wonder at this point, is that all there is in life?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Is it always the case that the number of edges grows linearly with the number of nodes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The answer, of course, is no.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's consider the complete graph, also known as a clique on n-nodes.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In a complete graph, every node is connected to every other node,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and you get very pretty star patterns if you fill these in.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In this case, we have five nodes and a total of ten edges.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But this doesn't really tell us anything about the growth rate.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It just tells us that in this one example, well, it could be that the number of edges

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is twice the number of nodes. We don't know.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We need to generate a more comprehensive formula.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In fact, I'm going to say you need to generate a more comprehensive formula.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In this question, I'd like you to actually work out the number of edges in a complete graph on n nodes.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The way you should submit this to us is by writing a function in Python that's called "clique"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and is given one value n, which is going to be an integer greater than 0,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and it should calculate from that the number of edges that will be created

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
if you fully connect all those nodes,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then just return that answer back so that we can grade it.
