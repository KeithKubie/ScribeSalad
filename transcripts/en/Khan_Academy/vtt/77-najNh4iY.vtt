00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome back.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.030
Well I'm now going to do a
presentation on how to

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.330
essentially invert the chain
rule or reverse the chain

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.730
rule, because we're doing
integration, which is the

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.910
opposite of taking
the derivative.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.570
So let's just take a
review of what the chain

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.610
rule told us before.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.710
If I were to take the
derivative of f of g of x--

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.180
hopefully this doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.060
I'll give another example
with a concrete f of x

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.986
and a concrete g of x.

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:31.820
If I want to take the
derivative of that, the chain

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.830
rule just says the derivative
of this composite function is

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.410
just the derivative of
the inside function.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.930
g prime of x times the
derivative of the outer, or

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.840
kind of the parent function,
but still having g

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.610
of x in at times.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.885
f prime of g of x.

00:00:55.885 --> 00:00:59.850
I know this might seem
complicated if you aren't too

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.693
comfortable with this type of
notation, but done in kind

00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:04.790
of an example form it
makes a lot of sense.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.790
If I said what is the
derivative of let's

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.100
say sin of x squared.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.490
Well in this situation, f
of x is sin of x, right?

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.870
And then g of x is
x squared, right?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.920
And sin of x squared is
essentially f of g of x.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.680
And this review of chain rule.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.530
You could go watch the video on
the chain rule as well, but I

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.210
don't mind doing a couple
of problems here.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.730
All this is saying that the
derivative of this is you take

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.330
the derivative of the inside
function-- g of x in this

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.845
example, which is 2x-- and you
multiply it times the

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.370
derivative of the
outer function or the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.270
parent function.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.420
And we memorize I guess that
the derivative of sin of x

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.470
is cosine of x, so it's
times cosine of g of x.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.900
So we keep the x squared there.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.840
If it confuses you, just
think about the inside

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.160
and the outside function.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.700
If you take the derivative of
kind of this composite

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.260
function, it's the same thing
that equals the derivative of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.970
the inside function, which is
2x times the derivative

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.230
of the outside function.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.775
But we keep this inside
function in it, and we

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:24.960
keep this x right there.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.130
So that's a review
of the chain rule.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.050
So what happens if we want
to reverse the chain rule?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.260
Well if we wanted to reverse
it, we're essentially saying

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.560
that we want to take the
integral of something where we

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.650
have the derivative of kind of
the inner function, and then we

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.980
have the derivative of a
larger composite function.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.300
I'm just rewriting the chain
rule, but I'm writing in

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.330
an integral form that this
is equal to f of g of x.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.140
This statement up here is
the exact same thing as

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800
the statement down here.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.010
All I did is I took the
integral of both sides.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.240
I'm saying the integral
of this is equal to the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.680
integral of this right here.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.700
I probably shouldn't switched
equal signs like that

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.930
with you, but let's use
this formula I guess.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.285
But all you have to know is
this the reverse of the chain

00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:27.290
rule to solve some problems.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.125
Image invert colors.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.440
Let me rewrite that.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.180
The integral-- if I have g
prime of x times f prime of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.390
g of x dx, then that is
equal to f of g of x.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.880
This is just the chain
rule in reverse.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.010
And I know it's very
complicated sometimes when you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.420
have it in this notation,
but I'll give you a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.070
couple of examples.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:08.160
What if I had the integral of
let's say-- this is actually

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.400
one that's often kind of viewed
as a trick, but you'll see

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.180
it's actually not that
tricky of a trick.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.810
OK.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:29.650
So let's say I have the natural
log squared over x dx.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.100
And if you saw an integral
like this, you'd probably be

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.760
daunted, and you'd be
surprised, many people well

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.270
into college calculus courses
are still daunted

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.500
by this problem.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.060
But all you have to
recognize is this is

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.870
the reverse chain rule.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.200
Why is this the
reverse chain rule?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.610
Well, this is the same thing as
the integral of 1/x times the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.260
natural log-- whoops, this
should be nlx, right-- the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.770
natural log of x squared dx.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.400
These are the same thing,
I just took the 1/x out.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.550
Now this might look
a little familiar.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.610
Well, what's the derivative
of the natural log of x?

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.960
If you remember from
the derivative module,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.530
it's 1/x, right?

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.560
Let me write that down
in the corner here.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.170
The derivative of the natural
log of x is equal to 1/x.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.130
So right here we have
the derivative of the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.640
natural log of x.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.360
So now we can just say that we
could essentially treat this

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.875
natural log of x as kind
of a variable by itself.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.520
And essentially what I'm
going to be doing if I could

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.900
actually substitute for.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.440
Actually let's do that.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.850
Well no, no, no I don't do that
now, that'll confuse you.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.930
Although my flip-flopping
is probably confusing

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.690
you even more.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.990
I have the derivative of the
natural log of x, so I can then

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.250
say well I have the derivative
there, so this is a

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.410
composite function.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.460
This is essentially
f prime of g of x.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.400
So then I can say well
that integral must be

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.260
equal to this thing.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.580
This is something
squared, right?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.330
So what's the integral
of something squared?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.200
Well the integral of
something squared is 1/3.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.920
That's something to
the third power.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.660
We learned in the previous
indefinite integral

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.960
module, right?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.470
And then it's 1/3 something to
the third power, and then we

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.150
know from the chain rule that
something is the ln of x.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.120
And I don't know if I've
already forgotten to do it

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.000
once, but don't forget
to do the plus c.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.810
Now you say, Sal, this
completely confused me,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.590
because it probably did.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.360
And if it completely confused
you, let's just take the

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.620
derivative of this and I think
you'll see it happening the

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.120
other way around and it
might make a little sense.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.960
When you take the derivative,
we just use the chain rule.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.300
You take the derivative
of the inside first.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.370
The derivative of the inside is
1/x and you multiply that times

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.670
the derivative of the outside
function, and then you

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.330
keep the inside the same.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.150
So the derivative of the
outside function is 3 times it

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:15.090
coefficient, so it's 3 times
1/3 times the whole thing

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.180
to one less exponent.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.050
So the whole thing is ln of x.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.420
And then of course
plus 0, right.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.490
The derivative of c is 0.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.090
Well this is just equal
3, 3 cancel out.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:36.150
This is equal to 1/x times
the ln of x squared, which

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
is our original problem.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.600
Let me do another problem
because I probably started

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.360
off with something a
little bit too hard.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:08:02.070
What is the integral of
let's say sin of x to

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.500
the third power dx.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.040
That's often written like this.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.330
That's often written
like sin of x.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.010
Same thing, but I like to
think of it this way because

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.750
it's not a new notation.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.610
Actually this is a mistake.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.310
Clearly I'm making up these
problems on the fly.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.250
Actually I don't
want to do that.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.410
That is the wrong problem.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.380
I want to take the integral--
and actually you can see kind

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.020
of how I'm thinking about these
problems-- I'm going to take

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:41.880
the integral of cosine of x
times the sin of x to

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.960
the third power dx.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.790
Well, we have this kind of more
complicated part, the sin of x,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.410
and we have the derivative sin
of x because we learned the

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.190
derivative sin of
x is cosine of x.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.420
So if we have a function inside
of a larger composite function,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.530
and we have it's derivative, we
can just treat this function as

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.720
kind of like a single entity.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.290
Like if this was just one
variable and then we

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.550
take integral of it.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:18.450
So this just equal to sin of x
and we raise this one more

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.880
power to the fourth and
we multiply times 1/4.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.030
And how did we do that?

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.430
Because we know that the
integral of say x to the fourth

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.570
dx is equal to-- I mean x to
the third dx-- is equal

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.970
to 1/4 x to the fourth.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.910
Instead of an x we
had a sin here.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.390
And remember the reason why we
did that is because the

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.330
derivative of the sin function
is sitting right here.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.660
In the next presentation, I'll
show you why this can also be

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.750
done using substitution, or
why they're the same thing.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.090
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
