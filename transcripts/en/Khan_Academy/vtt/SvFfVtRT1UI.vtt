00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
- [Voiceover] I wanna
talk a little bit about

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.213
one of the quirkier ideas
in signal processing,

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:07.886
and that's the idea of negative frequency.

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:10.649
This is a phrase that initially
may not make any sense

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.721
at all, what does it mean
to be a negative frequency?

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:17.101
Could there be a sine
wave that goes up and down

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.931
at a rate of minus 10 cycles per second,

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.906
what on earth does that mean?

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:27.073
Or could there be a radio
station of minus 680 kilohertz?

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.076
What is that, that doesn't
sound like it means anything.

00:00:32.076 --> 00:00:34.207
There is a sense in
which negative frequency

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:36.723
is understandable and
we're gonna just quickly

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:38.384
talk about that here.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:42.000
You remember, we can
describe a cosine like this,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.167
cosine of omega t equals
1/2 e to the plus j omega t,

00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:56.328
plus e to the minus j omega t.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.503
And each of these components,

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.334
each of these complex exponentials here,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.751
we can draw as a rotating complex number.

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:09.861
So for this first one, we
could actually draw it,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.569
if we wanted to, we
could draw it like this,

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.909
we could draw a complex
number out here in space,

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.743
and think of it as a rotating vector,

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.826
and that would be e to the j omega t.

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:25.699
This one has a plus sign.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:29.116
Now the other thing, this term over here,

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:33.413
would look like a similar thing,

00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:36.163
it would be sum vector and space,

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:41.634
there's that number right
there, e to the minus j omega t,

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.435
and this one's rotating
in the negative direction.

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:48.768
So that means this is rotating this way.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.443
So the idea of a negative frequency,

00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:56.138
when we talk about rotating
vectors, makes good sense.

00:01:56.138 --> 00:02:00.107
If we are rotating in the
positive direction, like this,

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:02.452
you could say that's a positive frequency.

00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:05.447
And if we're rotating in the
negative direction, like this,

00:02:05.447 --> 00:02:09.166
you could say that's a negative frequency.

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.205
So omega t gives us the speed,

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:16.152
and this sign right here,
and this sign right here,

00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:17.855
give us the direction.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:21.445
The frequency here is plus omega t,

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:25.283
and the frequency here is minus omega t.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.368
So in this sense of rotating vectors,

00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:31.060
negative frequency seems
like a pretty simple idea.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.570
Okay, so let's go where
it's not a simple idea,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.707
and that's when we do
this thing we did before

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:39.874
where we projected these
vectors onto a cosine wave,

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:44.811
it had spread out the time
axis linearly, like this,

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.157
going down the page for
the cosine, remember,

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:50.706
we did this, we drew a
line here on this side,

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.308
we're gonna do plus omega t.

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:57.391
So we're gonna plot e to
the plus j omega t here.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:03:03.008
This will be the real axis,
this will be the imaginary axis,

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:07.073
and down here, this'll
be the voltage axis,

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:09.490
and this'll be the time axis.

00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:17.779
So when we start out at
time equals zero, we have,

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.335
we project it down here, and
we got that value right there.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.789
And then as time goes on,
if we tip our arrow up,

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.850
like that, to that point,
then we project down to the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.850
cosine curve right here.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:36.400
If we let our arrow go all
the way to the other side,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.650
it projects like this down,

00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.902
it projects down to this
point on the cosine curve.

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:44.414
And as we go farther and farther,

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:46.366
let's go straight down for a second,

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:49.497
that one projects to right there.

00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.522
and as we come over here,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.627
it projects to that point right there.

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:57.506
And eventually, when we
get back to home again,

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:58.957
when we get back to zero,

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:02.451
the projection is right
to this point here.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:05.547
And so with one rotation
we've carved out one cycle

00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:06.714
of the cosine.

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:09.644
So that seems pretty clear.

00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:12.719
Omega t is there, omega t is down here.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.507
Okay, so let's do it again,

00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:16.529
but this time we'll go over on this side,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.862
and we'll plot e to the minus j omega t.

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:30.223
So this again is the real axis,
and this is the imaginary.

00:04:30.223 --> 00:04:34.390
And this is the voltage axis,
and this is the time axis.

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.283
So let's start out again,
we're going straight sideways

00:04:39.283 --> 00:04:43.319
to time equals zero, so
let's project that down.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.971
And okay, that's pretty good,
that's the same as before,

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.195
we got the same v here.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:49.102
Now let's tip it down,

00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:53.417
let's say we rotate this way a little bit,

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:55.744
and here's our new position of our vector.

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.079
And that projection, after
a little bit of time,

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.662
goes to right here.

00:05:00.983 --> 00:05:03.868
And then if we go over this way,

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.720
eventually, rotate some more,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.470
we'll project to this point here.

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:12.221
And when we're straight sideways,

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.388
it'll project to this peak right here.

00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.471
And you can see what's
happening is basically

00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:22.439
the exact same thing is happening
as happened on the left.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.272
Which is these points
carve out a cosine wave,

00:05:29.657 --> 00:05:31.324
just as we'd expect,

00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:38.502
and when this vector gets all
the way back around to zero,

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:40.594
we've done one cycle, we're back home,

00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:44.704
and now we're projecting
to this point here.

00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:47.836
What happened here is we
took two different vectors

00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.303
rotating in opposite directions,

00:05:49.303 --> 00:05:51.505
this one clearly had a positive frequency

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:54.699
cause it was going counter-clockwise.

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.409
This one had a negative frequency

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.826
cause it was going clockwise.

00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:02.927
And both of them carved out
the exact same cosine wave,

00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:04.344
when we got done.

00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:08.152
So in the vector world where
we're spinning vectors around,

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:10.522
it seems very natural to talk
about plus and minus frequency

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:14.689
but when we cast this back
into say a real-world v of t,

00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:19.258
notice that the idea of
negative frequency just sort of,

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:23.670
it melts away, it evaporates,
it's not really there anymore.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.990
And it's been removed by
this process of projection.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.737
So when the idea of
negative frequency comes up,

00:06:28.737 --> 00:06:30.585
and it seems like it
doesn't make sense in this

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:33.068
time to main view of the signals,

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:36.097
but then just remember that
when we go back up here,

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:37.677
and we look at the rotating vectors,

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:40.471
that it just means which
way the vector's spinning.
