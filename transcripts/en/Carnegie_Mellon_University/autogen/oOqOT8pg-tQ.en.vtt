grade and it just came out of

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.670
grade and it just came out of
 

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.850

conversation that she was having trouble

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:30.860
conversation that she was having trouble
 

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.860
conversation that she was having trouble
with mathematics and it came out it was

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:32.870
with mathematics and it came out it was
 

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.930

you know unit conversion ounces to
 

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.590
you know unit conversion ounces to
gallons etc and so I I told Nadia I was

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600
gallons etc and so I I told Nadia I was
 

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.240

like look I I think you're fully capable

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.250
like look I I think you're fully capable
 

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.550
like look I I think you're fully capable
of this if you're willing to how about

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560
of this if you're willing to how about

when you go back to New Orleans we work

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240
when you go back to New Orleans we work
 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.870
when you go back to New Orleans we work
on the phone every day and she agreed

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880
on the phone every day and she agreed
 

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.640
on the phone every day and she agreed
and so we started this was August of

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:48.650
and so we started this was August of
 

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.460
and so we started this was August of
2004 and the first month was kind of

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
2004 and the first month was kind of
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.110
2004 and the first month was kind of
difficult she'd completely convinced

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120
difficult she'd completely convinced
 

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.760
difficult she'd completely convinced
herself that she's just not good at math

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:54.770
herself that she's just not good at math
 

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.740
herself that she's just not good at math
but then slowly she kind of things

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:56.750
but then slowly she kind of things
 

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.210
but then slowly she kind of things
started to click in she started to catch

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:58.220
started to click in she started to catch
 

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.700
started to click in she started to catch
up then frankly about two months into it

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:00.710
up then frankly about two months into it
 

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.950
up then frankly about two months into it
she became a little bit advanced and at

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:02.960
she became a little bit advanced and at
 

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.630
she became a little bit advanced and at
that point I became what I call a a

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:04.640
that point I became what I call a a
 

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.560
that point I became what I call a a
tiger cousin and I I called up her

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:08.570
tiger cousin and I I called up her
 

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.200
tiger cousin and I I called up her
school and I I said you know I really

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.210
school and I I said you know I really
 

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.970

think Nadia Rahman should retake that

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:12.980
think Nadia Rahman should retake that
 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.079
think Nadia Rahman should retake that
placement exam they said who are you

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:17.089
placement exam they said who are you
 

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:21.369
placement exam they said who are you
all right I'm her cousin and somewhat

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:21.379
all right I'm her cousin and somewhat
 

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:22.780
all right I'm her cousin and somewhat
surprising that they allowed her to and

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:22.790
surprising that they allowed her to and
 

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.400
surprising that they allowed her to and
she went from a slow math track to an

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.410
she went from a slow math track to an
 

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.860
she went from a slow math track to an
advanced math track and has been on a

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:26.870
advanced math track and has been on a
 

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.650
advanced math track and has been on a
kind of a good trajectory ever since and

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:29.660
kind of a good trajectory ever since and
 

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.579
kind of a good trajectory ever since and
so I was intrigued was this a one-off

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:32.589
so I was intrigued was this a one-off
 

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:34.509
so I was intrigued was this a one-off
you know it was a fairly small

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519
you know it was a fairly small
 

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.879
you know it was a fairly small
intervention on my part and so I started

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:36.889
intervention on my part and so I started
 

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.559
intervention on my part and so I started
working with her younger brothers and

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:38.569
working with her younger brothers and
 

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:40.420
working with her younger brothers and
then a couple of things happened over

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:40.430
then a couple of things happened over
 

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.269
then a couple of things happened over

you're doing and possibly ways that we
 

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.240
you're doing and possibly ways that we
might help support you and and I was

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.250
might help support you and and I was
 

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.080
might help support you and and I was

time some folks from Google reached out
and by meeting meeting wand was kind of

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:25.990
and by meeting meeting wand was kind of
 

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.630
and by meeting meeting wand was kind of
similar to the meeting with an meeting

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640
similar to the meeting with an meeting
 

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.310
similar to the meeting with an meeting
too was they said you know what would

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320
too was they said you know what would
 

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.590
too was they said you know what would
you do with two million dollars and I

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600
you do with two million dollars and I
 

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.380
you do with two million dollars and I
said is this an open question because

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:33.390
said is this an open question because
 

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.580
said is this an open question because
but when I I can't you know I obviously

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:35.590
but when I I can't you know I obviously
 

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.870
but when I I can't you know I obviously
told them the same things that I told

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880
told them the same things that I told
 

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.389
told them the same things that I told
and I told the Gates Foundation and so

00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399
and I told the Gates Foundation and so
 

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:44.100
and I told the Gates Foundation and so
by fall of 2010 we had our first kind of

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:44.110
by fall of 2010 we had our first kind of
 

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.810
by fall of 2010 we had our first kind of
real initial support to become a real

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:45.820
real initial support to become a real
 

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.610
real initial support to become a real
organization for it to be really more

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:47.620
organization for it to be really more
 

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.990
organization for it to be really more
than just me operating out of a

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000
than just me operating out of a
 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.570
than just me operating out of a
operating out of a walk-in closet and so

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:51.580
operating out of a walk-in closet and so
 

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.909
operating out of a walk-in closet and so
what we started working on was

00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919
what we started working on was
 

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.010
what we started working on was
essentially the software part of Khan

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.020
essentially the software part of Khan
 

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.389
essentially the software part of Khan
Academy because that was always the the

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399
Academy because that was always the the
 

00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:59.490
Academy because that was always the the
real meat of the dream where the and and

00:25:59.490 --> 00:25:59.500
real meat of the dream where the and and

real meat of the dream where the and and
so what do you see here is kind of a

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.210
so what do you see here is kind of a
 

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.760
so what do you see here is kind of a
zoomed out version of what we call our

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:02.770
zoomed out version of what we call our
 

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.470
zoomed out version of what we call our
knowledge map and I and I show this this

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480
knowledge map and I and I show this this
 

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.690
knowledge map and I and I show this this
isn't our primary interface anymore but

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:06.700
isn't our primary interface anymore but
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.100
isn't our primary interface anymore but
it gives a good sense of how we at least

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.110
it gives a good sense of how we at least
 

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.260
it gives a good sense of how we at least
think about kind of skill learning

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:10.270
think about kind of skill learning
 

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.990
think about kind of skill learning
skills in mathematics so each circle

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000
skills in mathematics so each circle
 

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.820
skills in mathematics so each circle
here is a concept in mathematics the

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:14.830
here is a concept in mathematics the
 

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.409
here is a concept in mathematics the
ones at the top those are the most basic

00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:16.419
ones at the top those are the most basic
 

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:18.210
ones at the top those are the most basic
you know single-digit addition and

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:18.220
you know single-digit addition and
 

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.519
you know single-digit addition and
subtraction and as a student shows that

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:20.529
subtraction and as a student shows that
 

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:21.899
subtraction and as a student shows that
they've become proficient and then

00:26:21.899 --> 00:26:21.909
they've become proficient and then
 

00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:24.029
they've become proficient and then
mastery and then masters these concepts

okay I don't get this they would only
 

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.230
okay I don't get this they would only
engage into a problem for five seconds

then it changes their mindset they take

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:02.260
then it changes their mindset they take
 

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.720
then it changes their mindset they take
ownership over their own learning and

this next video is one we got a few

00:33:39.299 --> 00:33:39.309
this next video is one we got a few
 

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:41.460
this next video is one we got a few
months ago that we were you know it kind

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:41.470
months ago that we were you know it kind
 

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.480
months ago that we were you know it kind
of exemplifies that

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:44.490
 

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.880
so I actually dropped out of high school

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:47.890
so I actually dropped out of high school
 

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.500
so I actually dropped out of high school
twice during my freshman year and when I

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.510
twice during my freshman year and when I
 

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.570
twice during my freshman year and when I
eventually came back I was put in sort

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:54.580
eventually came back I was put in sort
 

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.279
eventually came back I was put in sort
of little math and science classes

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:56.289
of little math and science classes
 

00:33:56.289 --> 00:34:00.230

because I was so behind then I

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240
because I was so behind then I
 

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.120
because I was so behind then I
discovered Khan Academy and I was able

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.130
discovered Khan Academy and I was able
 

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.310
discovered Khan Academy and I was able
to skip two years worth of math just

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320
to skip two years worth of math just
 

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.159
to skip two years worth of math just
there using the site and I came into

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:08.169
there using the site and I came into
 

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:10.260
there using the site and I came into
school I took the exam with students who

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:10.270
school I took the exam with students who
 

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.369
school I took the exam with students who
had been enrolled in the class all year

00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:11.379
had been enrolled in the class all year
 

00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:13.379
had been enrolled in the class all year
and I was actually able to get the

00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:13.389
and I was actually able to get the
 

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.329
and I was actually able to get the
highest or the second highest scores in

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:15.339
highest or the second highest scores in
 

00:34:15.339 --> 00:34:19.500
highest or the second highest scores in
the class so for me Khan Academy have

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:19.510
the class so for me Khan Academy have
 

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.599
the class so for me Khan Academy have
really changed the trajectory of my

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:21.609
really changed the trajectory of my
 

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:24.450
really changed the trajectory of my
entire life because without it I don't

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:24.460
entire life because without it I don't
 

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.430
entire life because without it I don't
think I ever really have been inspired

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440
think I ever really have been inspired
 

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.490
think I ever really have been inspired

so we're going to take questions from

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:03.730
so we're going to take questions from
 

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.790
so we're going to take questions from
the audience let me point out that we're

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800
the audience let me point out that we're
 

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.000
the audience let me point out that we're
looking for questions not I am available

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.010
looking for questions not I am available
 

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.790
looking for questions not I am available
for an internship and if you would

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800
for an internship and if you would
 

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.710
for an internship and if you would
please line up at the microphones on

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:13.720
please line up at the microphones on
 

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.030
please line up at the microphones on
either side

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040
either side
 

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.430
either side
we'll begin and and while we're waiting

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440
we'll begin and and while we're waiting
 

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.360
we'll begin and and while we're waiting
Sal I have to say that what some of the

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:21.370
Sal I have to say that what some of the
 

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.940
Sal I have to say that what some of the
most moving parts of your talk had to do

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:23.950
most moving parts of your talk had to do
 

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.420
most moving parts of your talk had to do
with human potential and how we get out

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:27.430
with human potential and how we get out
 

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.700
with human potential and how we get out
of our preconceived notions about

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:29.710
of our preconceived notions about
 

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.930
of our preconceived notions about
potential through scaling up the kind of

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:33.940
potential through scaling up the kind of
 

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.460
potential through scaling up the kind of
individualized attention that you were

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.470
individualized attention that you were
 

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.730
individualized attention that you were
first able to give to your knees so

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740
first able to give to your knees so
 

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.780
first able to give to your knees so
looking at the relationship between

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:39.790
looking at the relationship between
 

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.360
looking at the relationship between
those two and thinking about scale I'm

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:42.370
those two and thinking about scale I'm
 

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.090
those two and thinking about scale I'm
wondering what kind of data you collect

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:45.100
wondering what kind of data you collect
 

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.080
wondering what kind of data you collect
on your work and I mean standardized

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.090
on your work and I mean standardized
 

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.140
on your work and I mean standardized
tests maybe and whether that gets used

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.150
tests maybe and whether that gets used
 

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.800
tests maybe and whether that gets used
to iterate the scaling up you know so as

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:55.810
to iterate the scaling up you know so as
 

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:59.490
to iterate the scaling up you know so as
you can imagine you know we as a website

00:43:59.490 --> 00:43:59.500
you can imagine you know we as a website
 

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.010
you can imagine you know we as a website
we can we're collecting everything on a

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:02.020
we can we're collecting everything on a
 

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.330
we can we're collecting everything on a
student and you know we're very careful

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:03.340
student and you know we're very careful
 

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.740
student and you know we're very careful
about privacy and that's not sure

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:04.750
about privacy and that's not sure
 

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.960
about privacy and that's not sure
another reason why you know I decided to

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:06.970
another reason why you know I decided to
 

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.130
another reason why you know I decided to
be a not-for-profit so there wouldn't be

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:08.140
be a not-for-profit so there wouldn't be
 

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.230
be a not-for-profit so there wouldn't be
temptations to go in one direction or

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240
temptations to go in one direction or
 

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.030
temptations to go in one direction or
another but yeah I mean the neat thing

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040
another but yeah I mean the neat thing
 

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.680
another but yeah I mean the neat thing
is we we can collect all of this really

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:13.690
is we we can collect all of this really
 

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.780
is we we can collect all of this really
interesting data and so that allows us

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:15.790
interesting data and so that allows us
 

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.150
interesting data and so that allows us
to you know actually they're probably

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160
to you know actually they're probably
 

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.350
to you know actually they're probably
going to be some papers published by

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:19.360
going to be some papers published by
 

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.090
going to be some papers published by
some of our in-house research scientist

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:21.100
some of our in-house research scientist
 

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:21.960
some of our in-house research scientist
that have been working with some

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:21.970
that have been working with some
 

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.380
that have been working with some
researchers at universities on some

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:24.390
researchers at universities on some
 

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.340
researchers at universities on some
learning gain research that they've been

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:26.350
learning gain research that they've been
 

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.900
learning gain research that they've been
doing on there's been some research on

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:27.910
doing on there's been some research on
 

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.400
doing on there's been some research on
growth mindsets based on the work of

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:29.410
growth mindsets based on the work of
 

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.770
growth mindsets based on the work of
Carol Dweck where we were doing we were

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:31.780
Carol Dweck where we were doing we were
 

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.930
Carol Dweck where we were doing we were
able to do it on a scale that was a

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:33.940
able to do it on a scale that was a
 

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.280
able to do it on a scale that was a
little unprecedented where you know we

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.290
little unprecedented where you know we
 

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.990
little unprecedented where you know we
have five million exercises done every

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000
have five million exercises done every
 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.320
have five million exercises done every
day and and so yeah so what we're

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:40.330
day and and so yeah so what we're
 

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.580
day and and so yeah so what we're
absolutely using it to trying to

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:41.590
absolutely using it to trying to
 

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.140
absolutely using it to trying to
understand learning better to

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:43.150
understand learning better to
 

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.670
understand learning better to
personalize it for students better and

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680
personalize it for students better and
 

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.100
personalize it for students better and
to also kind of measure the quality of

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:47.110
to also kind of measure the quality of
 

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.380
to also kind of measure the quality of
the of the experience yeah that's very

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:49.390
the of the experience yeah that's very
 

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:51.030
the of the experience yeah that's very
exciting and I think president Suresh

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040
exciting and I think president Suresh
 

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.340
exciting and I think president Suresh
told you about the data shop the more

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:53.350
told you about the data shop the more
 

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.290
told you about the data shop the more
than a million instances of learning

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:55.300
than a million instances of learning
 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.640
than a million instances of learning
that we've collected and we really do

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:56.650
that we've collected and we really do
 

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.160
that we've collected and we really do
find that that helps us

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:58.170
find that that helps us
 

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.110
find that that helps us
likewise build learning software that

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:01.120
likewise build learning software that
 

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.240
likewise build learning software that
that helps oh yeah no absolutely and I

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.250
that helps oh yeah no absolutely and I
 

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.200
that helps oh yeah no absolutely and I
just come and like this cosmic

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.210
just come and like this cosmic
 

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.580
just come and like this cosmic
partnership that gets even more excited

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:05.590
partnership that gets even more excited
 

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.350
partnership that gets even more excited
because it's like a it's a well defined

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:07.360
because it's like a it's a well defined
 

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.750
because it's like a it's a well defined
end point that students are trying to

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760
end point that students are trying to
 

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.890
end point that students are trying to
reach in yeah so yeah

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:10.900
reach in yeah so yeah
 

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.870
reach in yeah so yeah
that's great so we're going to start

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880
that's great so we're going to start
 

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.680
that's great so we're going to start
asking

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:13.690
asking
 

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.390
asking
for questions were lucky enough to have

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400
for questions were lucky enough to have
 

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.329
for questions were lucky enough to have
Andre Hinds with us here today and he's

going to give the closing remarks
 

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.410
going to give the closing remarks
so we'll take questions and then we'll

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:22.420
so we'll take questions and then we'll
 

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.859
so we'll take questions and then we'll
turn it over to Andre hi thanks so much

um I am curious what you are doing what

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359
um I am curious what you are doing what
 

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:33.029
um I am curious what you are doing what
your platform is doing for people with

00:45:33.029 --> 00:45:33.039
your platform is doing for people with
 

00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:35.039
your platform is doing for people with
disabilities specifically I'm thinking

00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:35.049
disabilities specifically I'm thinking
 

00:45:35.049 --> 00:45:36.150
disabilities specifically I'm thinking
about how you're making your website

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160
about how you're making your website
 

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.299
about how you're making your website
accessible to people with low vision and

00:45:39.299 --> 00:45:39.309
accessible to people with low vision and
 

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:42.870
accessible to people with low vision and
with who are deaf yeah so so we've

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880
with who are deaf yeah so so we've
 

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.249
with who are deaf yeah so so we've
started doing things there and we

00:45:44.249 --> 00:45:44.259
started doing things there and we
 

00:45:44.259 --> 00:45:46.190
started doing things there and we
haven't done everything that we can do

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200
haven't done everything that we can do
 

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.650
haven't done everything that we can do
almost all of our videos are subtitled

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660
almost all of our videos are subtitled
 

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.720
almost all of our videos are subtitled
and so that's wonder on the low vision

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:51.730
and so that's wonder on the low vision
 

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.460
and so that's wonder on the low vision
side of things we've gotten some

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:53.470
side of things we've gotten some
 

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.410
side of things we've gotten some
feedback about ways that we could make

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:55.420
feedback about ways that we could make
 

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.009
feedback about ways that we could make
it better we haven't you know even when

00:45:59.009 --> 00:45:59.019
it better we haven't you know even when
 

00:45:59.019 --> 00:46:00.960
it better we haven't you know even when
it comes to the video production some

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:00.970
it comes to the video production some
 

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:01.980
it comes to the video production some
people are getting feedback that it is

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:01.990
people are getting feedback that it is
 

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.960
people are getting feedback that it is
actually getting it's already close to

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:03.970
actually getting it's already close to
 

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.579
actually getting it's already close to
being useful for a lot of people who are

00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:05.589
being useful for a lot of people who are
 

00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:08.130
being useful for a lot of people who are
vision impaired but you know things like

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:08.140
vision impaired but you know things like
 

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.450
vision impaired but you know things like
it's not helpful if I'm saying hey up

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:09.460
it's not helpful if I'm saying hey up
 

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:09.809
it's not helpful if I'm saying hey up
here

00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:09.819
here
 

00:46:09.819 --> 00:46:11.039
here
you know I should I should reference

00:46:11.039 --> 00:46:11.049
you know I should I should reference
 

00:46:11.049 --> 00:46:13.170
you know I should I should reference
kind of what I'm doing or something like

started doing a little bit but we have a
 

00:46:16.839 --> 00:46:21.900
started doing a little bit but we have a
lot more to do so you should a lot of

best practices and some of those best
 

00:47:13.089 --> 00:47:14.730
best practices and some of those best

invested in it we've been seeing some
 

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.730
invested in it we've been seeing some
very very powerful results but it's it's

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:41.740
very very powerful results but it's it's
 

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.530
very very powerful results but it's it's
still early it for us it's let's look at

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:43.540
still early it for us it's let's look at
 

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.850
still early it for us it's let's look at
the people using it let's see where

with folks taking notes and then you
 

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.130
with folks taking notes and then you
take an exam but I think stem is

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:11.140
take an exam but I think stem is
 

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.970

over over these over these years but you
 

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.060
over over these over these years but you
also have essentially four years of very

tangible experiences and a portfolio to

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.260
tangible experiences and a portfolio to
 

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.930
tangible experiences and a portfolio to
show and I think this is already a

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940
show and I think this is already a
 

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.250

someone's portfolio and it could even be
 

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.040
someone's portfolio and it could even be
unrelated to what they're doing in the

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:31.050
unrelated to what they're doing in the
 

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.720
unrelated to what they're doing in the
job it could be the set of their

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:32.730
job it could be the set of their
 

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.580
job it could be the set of their
photography that they've done and that

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:34.590
photography that they've done and that
 

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.320
photography that they've done and that
just shows to us that they're capable of

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:36.330
just shows to us that they're capable of
 

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:37.910
just shows to us that they're capable of
this kind of starting with nothing and

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920
this kind of starting with nothing and
 

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.260
this kind of starting with nothing and
creating something or apps they've

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:39.270
creating something or apps they've
 

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.030
creating something or apps they've
written or books did whatever they've

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040
written or books did whatever they've
 

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.830
written or books did whatever they've
done so so I would say that's kind of

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:42.840
done so so I would say that's kind of
 

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.740
done so so I would say that's kind of

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.140
engineering the internships are very
high-paying and so most of these

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:12.150
high-paying and so most of these
 

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.060
high-paying and so most of these
