00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.910
in order to survive in the world we have
little option but to spend our lives

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.579
being rather defended that is at one
remove from are more vulnerable sides

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:16.430
closed off from certain emotions focused
in many cases on not feeling

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.870
and yet in relationships quite the
opposite is required to be good at love

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.200
means to have a capacity to reveal one's hurt, desires and tender sides this is quite

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.490
a balancing act

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.689
great strength for most of the day and
well handled tenderness for the few that

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.560
remain

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.760
it's no wonder if the journey from
Independence to vulnerability can get

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.500
rather fraught and if the desire for
closeness can be accompanied by terror

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.860
and what looks like but isn't really
nastiness

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.400
even after years with someone that can
be a hurdle of fear about trying to get

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.240
close two major symptoms then tend to
show up

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.680
firstly we can get distant or what
psychotherapist call avoidant we want to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.890
get close to our partners but feel so
anxious that we may be unwanted we

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.510
freeze them out a bit instead we say
we're busy

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.740
we pretend our thoughts are elsewhere we
imply that a need for reassurance would

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.369
be the last thing on our minds we might
even have an affair

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.440
the ultimate face-saving attempt to be
safely distant and often a perverse

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.509
quest to assert that we don't require
the partner's love. A love that we've been

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.640
too reserved to ask for or else we can
get controlling what therapist called

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.750
anxious

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.860
we feel our partners are escaping us
emotionally and we respond by trying to

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.850
pin them down

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.380
administratively we get unduly cross
that they're a bit late will chastise

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.140
them heavily for not having done certain
chores

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.800
we asked them constantly they've
completed a task they'd agreed to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.729
undertake all this rather than admit I'm
worried I don't matter to you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.840
we can't we believe force our partner to
be generous and warm

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.400
we can't force them to want us even if
we haven't actually asked them to

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.470
so we try to control them procedurally a
tragic cycle that unfolds we become

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.200
shrill and unpleasant to the other
person

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.260
it feels that we can't possibly love
them anymore

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.540
the truth is we do which is fear rather
too much that they don't love us but if

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.990
are rather harsh graceless behavior
could be truly understood for what it is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.109
it would be revealed notice rejection
but as a strangely distorted get very

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.540
real plea for tenderness

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.828
we should have sympathy for ourselves
relationships require us to put

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.329
ourselves in a very weak position visa
fee partners if they ever want to use

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.490
the power they have over us and
sometimes they do they know exactly

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.609
where to put the boot in this can be
deeply frightening this aspect of

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.810
relationships is even more difficult if
our early experiences and childhoods

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.400
have made closeness rather scary if
we've encountered people who have taken

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
signs of vulnerability as targets

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.790
so we're not frightened of closeness
because with fools but because it is a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.530
challenge to be around another person
who might easily hurt us and to keep on

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.489
in a relationship despite the fact that
they do sometimes use this knowledge to

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.810
strike out at us

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.400
closeness is inherently threatening but
we can gradually with courage and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.480
difficulty replace defense with
explanation we can say with frightened

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.889
and why

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.180
rather than turn cold or controlling and
we can begin to see what our partners

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.900
might be trying to communicate through
their off-putting behavior

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.319
we can never be through with a
requirement for acceptance

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.480
this isn't a curse limited to the weak
into the inadequate in security and love

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.638
is a sign of well-being

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.690
it means we haven't allowed ourselves to
take another person for granted

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.549
it means we remain realistic enough to
see that things could genuinely turn out

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.280
badly and that we're invested enough to
care

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.590
we must get better at seeing the love
and longing that lurk behind some of our

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.900
and our partner's most frosty managerial
and brutish moments we're just in our own

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.460
way of dealing with the anxieties of
trying to get close
