00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.354
ROB LEONARD: Hello again.

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:10.134
TONY TRAGUARDO:
Hello again, Mark.

00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:11.550
MITCH AXELROD: We
had the pleasure

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.650
of speaking with Mark
this morning for our show.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.380
And again, we want to
start at the beginning.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.520
Why did you feel it
necessary to write

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.340
another book about the Beatles
and the history of the Beatles?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.300
So many have been written.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.175
MARK LEWISOHN: Well,
there are so many books.

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:33.040
I don't know how
many people here

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.875
have Beatle books on their
shelves, but I have about 500

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.490
at home.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.420
And myself I've done a
half a dozen in the past.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.920
But they were all
reference books.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.457
Most of the Beatles books are
a niche area of the subject.

00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:47.290
And they look at it.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.540
And they go quite deep on it.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.790
But they're quite
specialists in that way.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.920
In terms of biography,
there are still very few.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.500
And I didn't feel that any
single biography had ever

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.165
really covered the
Beatles in the way

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:03.040
that I wanted to read
about it and in the way

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.970
that I think their story
demands and deserves.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.962
So I just decided
that I would do it.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.420
But I would do it
with a difference

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.100
in that I would write about
it in deeply in three volumes.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250
Because if you try
and cram this story,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.420
in all its many
ramifications, into one book,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.900
then you are going
to have to leave out

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.810
a lot of material
that's absolutely

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.540
necessary to the understanding.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.510
So the idea came up for
this three-volume series.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.640
And I was able to get
a publisher the UK

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.110
and here in the US.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.643
Thank you to my team who
are here today, brilliantly.

00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:44.890
And they've been really patient
because it took a while.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.409
But the idea is that this
story, in my opinion,

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.200
has never really been
told properly before.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.580
And the idea is to press the
refresh button on something

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.100
that we think we
know, and to actually

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.170
look at it again from
the top to the bottom,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.850
from the side to the side, every
which way, and do it properly.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.350
MITCH AXELROD: Now
we are at Google.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.370
So obviously we want to talk
a little bit about research

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.230
because a long time ago,
when people did their books,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.300
it was libraries and phone
disks and no internet.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.370
You've had the good fortune
of having the internet.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.662
But you've also done the
old-fashioned way as well.

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:24.120
Why don't you talk a little
bit about the research you did.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.036
MARK LEWISOHN: Well, I
figure that if you only

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:28.660
research your book on the
internet, then by definition

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.660
you're not going to be
able to get anything that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.400
is special and unique to you
because it will be something

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.430
that has been found before,
has been typed by someone,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.080
and is up there because
someone's put it up there.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.780
So obviously, the internet
is a phenomenal resource.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.790
And we will use it.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.270
And it was a great help to me
on this project in every way.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.970
But at the same
time, you can't be

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.570
doing old-fashioned
detective work

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.420
and getting out there
and burning shoe leather.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.030
And I burned shoe leather
and car tires and whatever.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.050
I needed to go wherever
the information was.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.310
And this story is now
quite an old story.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.260
I mean the book begins
in the 19th century.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.270
But even when the
book really begins

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.750
to accelerate after they're
born-- the Beatles are all war

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.540
babies, which is quite
important to the story--

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.600
when you're looking
at 1940s and '50s

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.080
and '60s resource
materials, a lot of that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.740
is still not available
on the internet.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.580
You have to go to the libraries.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.540
You have to go
into the archives.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.520
And you have to do
proper research.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.710
So it's a combination.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.860
I always say with this book,
I go where the information is.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.780
If it's easily available,
I'll grab it easily.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.880
If it's difficult to obtain,
I'll go that extra mile.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.986
MITCH AXELROD: So where
was the information?

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.360
MARK LEWISOHN:
The information is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.700
in personal and private hands.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.220
It's in public
archives and libraries.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.820
It's in corporate archives.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.250
It's in old newspapers
and magazines and books

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.530
and radio and
television and film.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.490
It's wherever you need to go
and whatever you need to do.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.840
So a lot of time in the
Liverpool record office, which

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.580
is looking at birth
records and school

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.260
records in Liverpool, England.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.580
A lot of the time in
the archives of the BBC

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.702
or the archives of their
record company, EMI.

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:13.160
None of that stuff's
been digitized

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.000
so you have to go to it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.350
And in particular,
archives of people

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.800
who had an
association with them,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.870
like lawyers who might have kept
legal files or broadcasters who

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.372
kept files, all
that kind of stuff.

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:29.330
TONY TRAGUARDO:
Now Mark, there's

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.260
been so much written
about the music.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.570
You've started way back
with literally the birth

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.450
of each of the individual
members of the group.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.460
But when it comes to
going back to Liverpool,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.960
you're relying on
people's memories.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.590
You're relying on a
combination of information

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.200
that's been available
and, as you say,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.570
newly discovered information.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.380
You found some conflict, of
course, amongst all of this.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.547
So how did you work through all
of the many, many conflicting

00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:00.630
stories about the Beatles?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.790
MARK LEWISOHN: Well,
the Beatles is often

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.220
the biggest thing
that ever happened

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.300
to someone in their life.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.230
If they had an association
with the Beatles,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.396
you can imagine it is
something that they talk about

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:12.940
forevermore-- most
people, not all.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.440
And inevitably along
the way, their stories

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.380
begin to gather layers
that weren't actually

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.690
necessarily there
in the first place.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.550
So one of the things that
I can bring to the project

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.210
like this is I have a wealth
of background knowledge.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.940
I've been doing this now for
30-odd years professionally.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.060
So you have to know when people
are talking bull, basically.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.725
And I have a very
strong sense of that.

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:40.100
No matter how exciting the
story, if someone's telling me

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.670
something that I know will
look good on the page,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.080
but I don't quite believe
it, I won't use it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.724
because accuracy is absolutely
everything to a book like this.

00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:51.140
There's no point in doing this
again unless it's accurate.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.015
MITCH AXELROD: What
about the George Harrison

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:56.249
quote that is in the book?

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.790
MARK LEWISOHN: There's a quote
in the book where George says,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.680
in their bid to
tell what they know,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.440
some people tell more
than what they know.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.750
And that is the same thing.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.930
Stories become
embroidered with time.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.630
In an interview even where I'm
really comfortable with what

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.510
someone's telling
me as the truth,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.154
there'll still be
something that I won't use.

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:21.070
And there are some people
I won't go to at all

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.050
because I know what
they're going to say.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.092
And I know it's unusable.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.216
TONY TRAGUARDO: The script.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:26.070
They have a script.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.528
MARK LEWISOHN:
Yeah, it's a script.

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.610
And some people actually
have made a living out

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.110
of putting themselves
more centrally

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.980
into a picture they were
never in in the first place.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.600
ROB LEONARD: Mark, you've been
doing research on the Beatles

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.310
for, like you said,
over 30 years.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.010
When you were doing
interviews along the way,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.740
were you thinking about
this book at this point?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.480
Because you obviously have a
great archive of interviews

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.020
with the Beatles themselves.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.980
MARK LEWISOHN: No,
I didn't know I

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.800
was going to be doing this until
pretty much when I started it.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.110
So all the times in the past
I've had access to people,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.050
I could have asked them
certain things and didn't.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.800
But you know, I didn't
have that foresight.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.800
But this is very much
a book of information.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.820
And with Beatle collectors,
I am a Beatle fan,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.330
but at the same time, I'm
an independent professional

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.420
historian.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.580
So I have the
enthusiasm of a fan

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.650
to carry me through a
long project like this,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.810
but I'm not interested in
polishing their reputation

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.520
in any way.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.210
So this is not a book saying,
hey, weren't the Beatles great?

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.910
This is an independent history.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.880
And it doesn't pull any punches.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.690
But it's essentially
a book of information.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.980
And Beatle fans collect
different things.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.110
And I, more than anything
else, collect information.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.440
And I've had incredible
access to archives

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.055
through working for the
Beatles for so long.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:56.030
I've been in many
good situations

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.630
where I've had
access to archives.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.050
And I always take
the moment if I can,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.370
if there's an opportunity.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.267
So I have filing cabinets
full of history, basically,

00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.350
and that's all going to
go into these three books.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.058
TONY TRAGUARDO: But
we could add, though,

00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:10.930
that while the book
is information,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.700
there's quite a bit of humor.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.010
And that is really wonderful.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.350
There's a great
humorous aspect partly

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.437
because, as we've talked about,
the Beatles themselves were--

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:22.020
MARK LEWISOHN: Well,
yeah, absolutely.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.970
I mean, they're just
such funny guys.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.210
And their story
always makes me laugh.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.340
I still laugh hysterically at
most aspects of the Beatles.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.320
And it's really important
that a book like this

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.700
should have humor in it.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.590
And I'm glad that
you noticed that.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.070
ROB LEONARD: How
important is the fact

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.654
that they're from Liverpool and
not London or someplace else?

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:43.820
MARK LEWISOHN: It's crucial.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.060
It's crucial.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.830
We live in a world now where
rock music is everywhere.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.880
You can't avoid it.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.004
Even when you want to avoid
it, you can't avoid it.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.240
And this is a
contextual history.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.900
So I'm writing about
the 1950s and '60s

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.160
when rock music was the
music of delinquents.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.640
And it was greatly frowned
upon in mainstream society.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.980
Adults did not get it.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.410
It was not their music.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.740
They thought it was
associated with hoodlums.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.150
And therefore they shunned it.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.140
And what was the question?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.070
ROB LEONARD: How
important was the fact

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.611
that the Beatles
were from Liverpool?

00:09:18.611 --> 00:09:21.000
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah, so we
live in a world now full

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.930
of rock music.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.755
And rock bands are everywhere.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.210
In those days, in the
late '50s, early '60s,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.320
there was no real rock band
scene anywhere in America.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.900
There had been
some rock and roll

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.420
and corporate America was trying
to suppress it, to kill it off,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.280
with the payola scandal and
all of that of the late 1950s.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.020
And it really survived
primarily in England

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.920
where everybody in England,
all the kids in England

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.536
growing up who loved
American music,

00:09:50.536 --> 00:09:52.160
they didn't want
anything from England.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.570
It had to be American.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.360
And in England there was
really only one place

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.250
where there was a scene, where
there were bands forming, mates

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.130
playing guitars, swapping
chords, swapping songs, getting

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.880
up on stage and singing.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.780
It wasn't London.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.700
It was Liverpool.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.430
It was the only
place in the world,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.904
in other words, that
had a rock band scene.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.570
And the Beatles,
initially, they weren't

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.940
in the first wave of that.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.840
They were not there at
its formative period.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.620
They joined it
after two or three

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.320
years it had been
up and running.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.150
And when they got back from
Germany the first time,

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.340
which is another story,
they took it over.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.860
And they were the kings
very, very quickly.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.300
And they were different
from everybody else

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.880
because they were original.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.710
The Beatles always
broke all the rules.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.840
They were always original.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.990
They were never tied
by any convention.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.087
They thought differently.

00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:43.920
They look different.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.640
They acted different.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.929
And they were the kings.

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.970
ROB LEONARD: And they also
played different songs

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.845
from the other bands
because they would often

00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:52.601
look at a B-side,
let's say, which

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:54.600
is something you don't
think about because you'd

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.550
want to play the A-side
because everyone knew it.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.216
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah,
I mean, the Beatles

00:10:58.216 --> 00:10:59.850
didn't have iPlayers--
sorry-- didn't

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.090
have iPads or iPods
or anything like that.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.890
They were in record
shop listening booths,

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.084
browseries they were called.

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:08.750
And they would all
squeeze themselves in

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.170
and they would ask the
assistant behind the counter

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.850
to play this one, this
one, this one, this one.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.330
And whatever they picked
that was from America.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.760
They only wanted to
play American music.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.050
And they would be crowded
into these browseries.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.210
And one of them
very quickly would

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.666
say something was
crap, usually John.

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:29.290
And they would take it off, and
they would put on the next one.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.550
And someone, Paul, would
say, I'll do this one.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.050
Or John would say,
I'll do this one.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.050
Or George would say,
I'll do this one.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.910
And that's how they
got a repertoire.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.760
But they looked for the unusual.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.029
So they went to the B-sides.

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:42.820
And they went for the
really obscure tracks

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.770
that no one else
was even playing.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.630
And they popularized a lot
of American music that way

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.960
that wasn't even popular here.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.170
MITCH AXELROD:
And actually, they

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.140
made African American music
accessible here to white people

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.530
in America, which was a
very big thing for them.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.980
They were very proud of
it because they were not

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.940
into the segregation.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.600
Correct?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.350
MARK LEWISOHN: The
Beatles was first album

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.240
is principally a New York sound.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.220
It's the music of 1650 Broadway
properly known as the Brill

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.580
Building, but actually
that was across the street.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.870
It's the music of Jerry
Goffin and Carole King

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.032
and songwriters like that,
Burt Bacharach and Hal David.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.240
And that was the first album.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.830
The second album was
really a Detroit sound.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.010
They were looking for the Motown
sound, the Tamla Motown sound.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.050
And then they
exploded in America

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.850
and were able to get back
to you the music that

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.180
was yours in the
first place, but often

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.840
hadn't been heard before.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.548
TONY TRAGUARDO: And
they actually brought

00:12:39.548 --> 00:12:41.580
that music out of
just the club scene

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.070
by being the first to perform
a Tamla Motown track on the BBC

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.750
radio.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.500
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah,
that was interesting.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.170
The Beatles first
appeared on the radio

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.400
in England in a session
before they actually

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.407
had a recording contract.

00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:56.740
And one of the songs they
played in their first forecast

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.820
was "Please, Mr. Postman"
by the Marvelettes on Tamla.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.890
And I thought, I wonder how many
times that record or anything

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.980
else from Tamla had been
played on British radio before?

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.760
So again, this is
nothing digitized here.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.620
I spent days going
through microfilm records,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.470
wearing out my eyes, turning
film round and round and round

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.750
on all the BBC program
output records.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.690
So every record played in every
radio show would be logged.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.910
And I went through the logs.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.570
And it turned out
my hunch was right.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.630
They were the first
to play a Tamla

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.140
sound from Detroit on BBC Radio.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.800
And then in their
next broadcast,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.610
they played a song
"Ask Me Why" that

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.650
was based on a Tamla record,
or inspired by a Tamla record.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.500
So that was also a first.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.860
They, I'm sure, didn't
know any of this.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.380
They were just doing it.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.705
It's down to the historian
to come along and put it

00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:50.420
into context.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.720
But they were doing it.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.042
They were the first.

00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:55.500
MITCH AXELROD: Let's go back
in the past just a little bit.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.777
We've gone to the music.

00:13:56.777 --> 00:13:58.610
And we'll get back to
that because we really

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.864
need to find out how the
Beatles did get their music.

00:14:01.864 --> 00:14:03.280
You had mentioned
it a little bit.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.430
But let's go back
to the childhood.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.290
Because again, you say the
book is a social history

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.610
with the Beatles at
the center of it.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.220
So let's talk about each Beatle,
briefly, about their childhood

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.100
and musically what
they had and such.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.240
MARK LEWISOHN: OK,
so starting with?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.940
MITCH AXELROD: That
boy, John Lennon.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.560
MARK LEWISOHN: OK.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.040
John, Paul, and George,
all the products

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.670
of Catholic
Protestant marriages,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.500
which is an unusual
mix in Liverpool which

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.820
had a particularly
strong religious divide.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.990
You would normally stick
to your own religion.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.620
Most unusual that
three of the Beatles

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.940
actually have that mixed
background, which, I think,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.350
it is part of their makeup.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.740
I'm not quite sure what it says,
but it's part of who they are.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.490
John Lennon was born
in 1940 when Liverpool

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.980
was being bombed by the Germans.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.900
Liverpool was very, very
badly bombed by the Nazis

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.090
in the Second World War.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.500
He wasn't born in an air raid.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.710
But all the same,
there were bombs

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.290
falling very close by
within a day or two

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.780
of where he was born.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.640
And he was born to a father
who was a merchant seamen who

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.950
was actually plying the
Atlantic route with the U-boats

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.870
lurking in the deep,
so a very risky job.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.270
That was Alf Lennon.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.130
And his mother Julia,
John's mother Julia Lenin,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.835
was a very liberal
woman in her time.

00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:28.710
They had married, but
they didn't really ever

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.240
have much of a relationship.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.420
There were no photographs of
John Lennon's parents together,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.390
not from their wedding
day or any of the years

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.570
they were together.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.390
In fact, they weren't
together very much.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:47.340
But Julia was unusual in that
she was very attractive to men.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.160
And the fact that
she was married

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.820
didn't stop her from
courting other men.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.250
And she had four children
to three different men

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.830
in nine years, which sounds
more like today's behavior

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.810
if anything, than
1940s behavior.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:05.244
It obviously marked her out
as very unusual in her time.

00:16:05.244 --> 00:16:06.660
But they never
really got the hang

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.530
of bringing up
their son together.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.690
And John was kind of passed
from one to the other.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.070
When Alf was back,
John would see his dad.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.980
Otherwise he was with
his mom, but the mom

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.420
was mostly going out at night.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.250
So he was really raised by his
auntie, his aunt and uncle,

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.320
his aunt Mimi and
his uncle George.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.370
And they gave him the
stability that he needed.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:34.500
And in 1946, he became the
guardian of his Aunt Mimi

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.210
and Uncle George permanently.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.430
MITCH AXELROD: And they
also provided a, I think,

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.780
harmonica to him?

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.350
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah John's
mother was very musical.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.830
She played ukulele.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.700
And John's father
played harmonica.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.700
But I don't think John
necessarily knew that.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.997
But he was very good musically.

00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:55.330
He had a natural musical talent.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.040
But he also had a great
facility for words.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.880
He was writing really
inventive comic poetry

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.357
and doing lots of drawing
from infancy onwards.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.190
MITCH AXELROD: That was
an influence of Mimi

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.974
because she had
been an avid reader

00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:10.890
and brought that to
influence him in that way.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.473
MARK LEWISOHN: John Lennon was
an avid reader his entire life.

00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:16.329
He would read a book or
two a week and a newspaper

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.010
or two every day,
cover to cover.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.869
And he did that until
the day he was shot.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.839
So he was always reading.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.190
MITCH AXELROD: And what
about Paula McCartney?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.907
MARK LEWISOHN: Paul
on his mother's side,

00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:29.240
there's not so much music there.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.060
She was a midwife.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.920
But on Paul's father's side,
there was a lot of music.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.520
His dad actually had a band.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.600
And much as the Beatles were
playing the Liverpool halls

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.680
and club circuit in
the 1960s, so his Dad

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.070
had been doing that 40 years
earlier with Jim Mac's Band.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.290
Jim McCartney had
Jim Mac's Band.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.700
He was the leader.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.790
And he played piano and
trumpet and wrote a tune.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.890
So Paul McCartney
was not the first

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.980
in his family to write a song.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.470
His dad wrote one before him.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.370
And actually his dad
had been a musician

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.620
as well, playing northern
England brass band music, which

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.350
I don't think is
so well known here

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.670
but very nice kind
of brass music.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.640
TONY TRAGUARDO: Now
Ritchie, I mean,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.600
we know we know him as Ringo,
but throughout the book,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.230
for the most part, he's Ringo
when we talk about him onstage,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.490
but he's Ritchie.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.230
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah, there's
no hindsight in this book.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.540
So I can't call him Ringo
until he becomes Ringo.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.780
He's about 20 years old by then.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.980
And similarly, I don't use
the word Beatles anywhere

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.730
until they actually
come up with the name.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.736
Because until that point,
they're not Beatles.

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:33.110
TONY TRAGUARDO: They're not.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.230
MARK LEWISOHN: So he's
Ritchie, Ritchie Starkey.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.146
TONY TRAGUARDO: Right.

00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:37.566
Oh, go ahead.

00:18:37.566 --> 00:18:40.190
MARK LEWISOHN: There's a little
bit of music in his background,

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.130
but not too much.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.060
But mostly it was
family parties.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.030
Liverpool is a
very musical city.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.570
It's another reason why they
had a rock band scene there.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.310
And that's because Liverpool
is a very musical place.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.140
It's the Irish, the strongly
Irish heritage there.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.920
People, you go to
pubs, you sing.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.680
At a family party, everyone
is expected in turn

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.040
to have a turn.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.802
So it would come to
your turn, and you

00:19:04.802 --> 00:19:06.760
would have to get up and
read a piece of poetry

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.530
or sing or whatever.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.550
And they all had these musical
events in their background.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.130
But Ritchie, the biggest
thing about his childhood

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.970
is that he was
seriously ill twice.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.000
On the first occasion,
he was seven years old.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.760
He very nearly died.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.810
Three times his mother was
told he wouldn't last night.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.881
And poor woman, Ritchie
was her only child.

00:19:28.881 --> 00:19:31.130
And she would have to go
home on the bus from hospital

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.940
thinking she'd
never see him again.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.400
But he was always
a tough little kid.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.700
Not necessarily physically,
but emotionally, mentally, he

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.232
is still a very
tough guy, Ringo.

00:19:41.232 --> 00:19:43.410
MITCH AXELROD: And didn't
he also at these parties,

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.030
after he was sickly
and came home,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.300
he used to sing
"Nobody's Child"?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.610
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah,
Ritchie liked country music

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.310
from America.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.177
And whereas there
is a bit of a myth

00:19:55.177 --> 00:19:57.510
that the Beatles always got
their music from the sailors

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.170
who sailed between New York
and Liverpool, in reality, they

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.760
actually got their records
from shops, as I was saying.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.570
But he, Ritchie, did have a
bit of a supply line there.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.360
And he was into real
American country music,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.520
which all started when he saw
a Gene Autry film at the cinema

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.110
when he was 9 or 10.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.060
And living where
he did-- Liverpool

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.790
was a very poor city-- but
the area where Ritchie lived

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.730
was about the
poorest of them all.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.650
And they had nothing.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.990
And they had no prospects.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.890
And they had no heating.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.230
And they had no hot water.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.330
All these guys had
outside toilets.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.170
Nobody had a toilet inside
the house let alone a bath.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.400
I mean, these things were
completely unheard of.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.460
You would always have to go
into a public bath to wash.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.740
So this was a very
different way of growing up.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.710
And he saw Gene
Autry on the screen

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.500
singing "South of the Border."

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.190
And he wanted desperately
to go to America

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.880
and tried to emigrate
to Houston, Texas

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.460
when he was about
19, 20 years old.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.600
TONY TRAGUARDO: Wow.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.840
ROB LEONARD: We didn't
talk about George, yet.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.340
But when we talk about George,
then I have another question.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.737
MARK LEWISOHN: OK.

00:21:06.737 --> 00:21:09.070
George doesn't really have
much music in his background.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.640
His dad did get a guitar.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.890
His dad was a sailor, as well.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.540
And he first came to
New York in about 1927.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.890
So both John's father and Paul's
father had been to New York

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.530
and, obviously, would talk about
America to a degree at home.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.180
And George's father bought a
guitar actually in New York.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.770
But the times got tough in
the 1930s in the Depression,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:33.810
and sold it.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.060
But what they had
was American records.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.840
He brought back Roy Rogers
records, "Singing Br Brakeman"

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.580
and all that kind of stuff--
Jimmie Rodgers, not Roy Rogers.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.080
I'm sorry.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.320
That is the cowboy, isn't he?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.710
I don't think he made a record.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.470
MITCH AXELROD: No.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.340
ROB LEONARD: Roy
Rogers probably did.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.920
MARK LEWISOHN: Oh, well, maybe.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.530
TONY TRAGUARDO: "Happy Trails."

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.840
ROB LEONARD: "Happy Trails."

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.881
MARK LEWISOHN: Oh, right.

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:56.530
OK.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.750
So there was music around.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.200
And also there was the
influence of some English music

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.540
like George Formby.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.217
I don't know if anybody here has
heard of George Formby, music

00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:07.890
hall star in England
who wrote and sang kind

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.420
of very saucy songs, risque
double entendre songs.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.145
So they all had music to some
degree or other, Paul the most.

00:22:18.145 --> 00:22:20.940
ROB LEONARD: I want to
talk about Brian Epstein.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.895
Here's a guy, he ran a record
shop in his parents' store.

00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:27.770
And all of a sudden he
becomes their manager.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.310
And he really sets
a revolution off

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.190
by the way he presented the
Beatles and other bands, too.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.800
It wasn't just the Beatles, too.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.050
How important is Brian
Epstein going to the Cavern

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.377
in November of 1961?

00:22:41.377 --> 00:22:42.460
MARK LEWISOHN: It's vital.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.260
Because the Beatles,
as I said, they

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.160
were the hottest
act in Liverpool.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.420
But that was all.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.890
There was no way out.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.270
How do you get out of Liverpool?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.830
How'd you get down to London
and get a recording contract

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.640
and become famous?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.330
None of them had any
idea how to do it.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.705
None of the people
in London were

00:22:57.705 --> 00:23:00.239
looking up north because
London is always very insular

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.530
and people just think that
if it's not happening there,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.370
it's not happening anywhere.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.100
So the music scene as we know
it-- the books I'm writing

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.720
have to tell the story of
how the music business, which

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.250
was this quaint old thing that
began in Tin Pan Alley in New

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:19.060
York in the 1910s, how that
became the record business,

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.930
and how that crossed
the Atlantic.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.430
And ultimately,
through the Beatles,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.050
it became the
music industry with

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.110
these vast multimillion--
billion-- dollar companies,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.970
like Google even, that
control all these rights

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.060
and find ways of bringing
the music to the marketplace.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.405
This was just a
very little thing

00:23:39.405 --> 00:23:41.780
when the Beatles were trying
to get a recording contract.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.238
And it was the
Beatles who actually

00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:45.240
made that revolution happen.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.050
So I must show in these
books how the Beatles changed

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.560
the music business, how they
changed the entertainment

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.910
business.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.780
ROB LEONARD: But Brian
was very sure about that.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.401
Right away, he knew
something was going on.

00:23:59.401 --> 00:24:01.900
MARK LEWISOHN: Just as there
was no group like the Beatles--

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.934
and believe me, when
the Beatles first

00:24:03.934 --> 00:24:05.350
tried to get a
recording contract,

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.110
one of the reasons
they struggled

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.170
is because no one like that
had ever existed before.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.630
It sounds so simple.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.970
I got drums, bass guitar,
lead guitar, rhythm guitar.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.320
One, two, or three
guys-- or even all four--

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.150
who sing, in harmony, and
write their own songs.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.840
God, it's everywhere now.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.330
It was nowhere then.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.920
And it was so nowhere that
no one could recognize

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.820
that they were
new and different.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.400
And similarly, Brian
Epstein as manager

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.030
was so different to any manager
who had ever been before.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.030
So Brian revolutionized
rock management.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.060
And the Beatles
revolutionized rock music.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.410
And he was a young guy
who was unfulfilled.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.620
He was struggling
to find his way

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.600
in life in that he was
very good as a businessman.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.810
He was good enough to be
considered store management

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.985
material at the age of 21.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.150
But he was never satisfied
with doing any one thing.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.450
So he would start something
with immense enthusiasm

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.530
and after a year he would
get bored and go and do

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.500
something else.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.350
He really wanted to be an actor.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.490
He really wanted to
be a dress designer.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.980
He really wanted to
direct plays on the stage.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.010
But he couldn't.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.110
Every time he tried one of those
things, it never really worked.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.160
And he ended up dissatisfied
back in Liverpool

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.000
until he saw the Beatles.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.300
And he was able to bring to them
all his ideas for presentation

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.180
and all his
organization in terms

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.270
of management administration.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.400
He was a brilliant
administrator.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.170
One of the joys for
me on this project--

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.950
and we talked about how
to get information--

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.530
is I was able to find
Brian Einstein's management

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.810
files for the Beatles.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.600
And that's all
completely unseen stuff.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.460
And I have a very, very
strong collection of this.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.110
It runs all the way through to
his death in '67 and, in fact,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.720
beyond.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.490
And all that stuff
is completely new.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.080
But what it tells
me is that this guy

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.710
was a brilliant organizer.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.850
And the Beatles were always
the best at what they did,

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.740
but they had no idea how
to organize themselves.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.630
They needed someone
to come in and shape

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.120
the direction for them, to
actually show them the way

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.870
to go, and to open up the doors.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.460
And he did it.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.560
TONY TRAGUARDO: Now
the Beatles that we

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.420
know that Brian Epstein
took to the topper-most

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.430
or the popper-most were John,
Paul, George, and Ringo.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.327
But initially, when
Brian went down

00:26:27.327 --> 00:26:29.660
those steps of the Cavern in
Liverpool and saw the band,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.390
there was another drummer there.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.580
I know it's hard to
put into a nutshell,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.345
but sort of the
story of Pete Best.

00:26:38.345 --> 00:26:40.220
MARK LEWISOHN: Well,
yeah, the Beatles always

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.290
had a problem with
getting a drummer.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.060
In fact, there was a period in
1960 when Paul was a drummer.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.032
So they were a four-piece
with Paul on drums.

00:26:49.032 --> 00:26:50.990
But that was always really
frustrating for Paul

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.300
because he wanted
to be out front.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.230
So by a miracle of
coincidences, they

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.710
end up getting offered this
trip to Hamburg in Germany.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.940
And they must go
as a five-piece.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.490
And it's quite clear that
they need to get one more guy.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.615
And he's going to have to
be a drummer because that

00:27:10.615 --> 00:27:11.970
was what they always lacked.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.180
And they knew there was
this kid in Liverpool

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.290
with a drum kit and no
particular day-to-day job.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.720
So they grabbed him.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.580
And his name was Pete Best.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.590
And Pete Best was their drummer
until pretty much the eve

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.770
of their breakthrough in the UK.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.250
And then he was fired
and then, poor guy,

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.490
had to watch while the
Beatles became the biggest

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.820
thing that entertainment
had ever known.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.060
I mean, they were hoping to
have a hit record or two.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.937
But they actually kind
of changed the world.

00:27:38.937 --> 00:27:41.020
TONY TRAGUARDO: Did a
little bit better than that.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.190
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah,
and we're still

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.700
talking about them
50 years later.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.150
And he's just been having
to watch it for 50 years.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.660
So that was all
quite unfortunate.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.285
TONY TRAGUARDO: But
you do in the book,

00:27:50.285 --> 00:27:53.052
though, you do
explain the story.

00:27:53.052 --> 00:27:54.135
MARK LEWISOHN: Well, yeah.

00:27:54.135 --> 00:27:55.760
TONY TRAGUARDO: How it
all happened and you'll--

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.759
MITCH AXELROD: The myth.

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:58.550
TONY TRAGUARDO: You'll
see the myth of--

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.770
MARK LEWISOHN: Well, the
Beatles' story is one that

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:00.930
attracts a lot of myths.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.860
It's inevitable
because everyone thinks

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.380
they know something of it.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.680
And things get magnified.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.300
And things get told
out of proportion.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.274
One of the things is, why
did they fire Pete Best?

00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:13.940
And for some reason,
it's been a mystery

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.627
for 50 years as to why
they should fire this guy.

00:28:17.627 --> 00:28:18.960
MITCH AXELROD: Even mean to him.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.260
MARK LEWISOHN: So he says.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.360
So he says.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.260
But actually, it's quite
clear when you read the book.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.735
And it isn't me saying it.

00:28:25.735 --> 00:28:29.444
It's all the people I talk
to because I have interviewed

00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:31.860
hundreds of people who were
witnesses to all these events.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.670
And it's absolutely clear
that he was never really

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.510
one of them.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.950
And if you're in a band and
the chemistry isn't right,

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.202
then you know it, right?

00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:41.243
I mean, you're in a band.

00:28:41.243 --> 00:28:43.000
You know these things.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.770
You've got to have
the chemistry right.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.680
And especially if the front
line is so full of personality

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.100
and so full of
exuberance and character.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.425
And the guy on the drums
is making no eye contact.

00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.505
He's a very shy
individual, Pete.

00:28:54.505 --> 00:28:57.590
He just looks down, doesn't
make any eye contact,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.950
doesn't smile, doesn't
speak to anyone.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.750
And after the gig, he just
goes home and the other three

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.017
hang out together, well,
there's a divide there.

00:29:06.017 --> 00:29:07.600
And every time they
played with Ringo,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.180
who was part of
the same scene-- he

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.780
was in another
band-- it felt great.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.860
They just immediately
felt this is the guy.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.500
MITCH AXELROD: And Paul,
you said Paul played drums

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.260
for a while, but
Paul was actually

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.680
the best guitarist
in the Beatles,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.682
wasn't he, for a while?

00:29:21.682 --> 00:29:23.140
MARK LEWISOHN: Paul
was pretty good

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.557
musically at
anything he picks up.

00:29:24.557 --> 00:29:26.181
I mean, he's just
one of those guys who

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:27.900
can pick up any
instrument and that's it.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.360
He's away.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.250
And that can make life
difficult in a band

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.800
when ultimately in the
Beatles, he's saying to Ringo,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.160
no, no, no, I could
do-- let me show you.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.660
Because obviously,
you've got to be

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.940
aware of the chemistry
of the personalities.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.450
MITCH AXELROD: But he ended
up playing bass guitar.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.572
MARK LEWISOHN: By default.

00:29:48.572 --> 00:29:50.530
MITCH AXELROD: Who was
playing bass in Hamburg?

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:51.580
MARK LEWISOHN: Well,
they had another guy

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.130
called Stuart Sutcliffe.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.310
The Beatles were originally
a five-piece, not a four.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.570
And Stuart was brilliant,
a brilliant artist--

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.070
not so much a brilliant bass
player, but a brilliant artist.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.950
And he gave the Beatles
an image and a look

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.140
that was very important
to their development.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.090
And he also
attracted in Germany,

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:15.010
in Hamburg, three bright young
things who were primarily

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.580
attracted to Stuart first--
Astrid, Klaus, and Jurgen,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.620
who had a great
influence on the Beatles.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.200
And that's an
interesting story, too,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.290
because they were all war
babies as well, Astrid, Klaus,

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.455
and Jurgen.

00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:34.410
And they were so disgusted
with their country's behavior

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.270
that they grew up after
the war absolutely appalled

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.470
to be German because of
what their country had done.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.620
And so they shunned
everything German

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.360
and embraced everything French.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.700
So the Beatles went to
Hamburg as young English guys

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.170
with Irish background
singing black American music

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.150
and got to Hamburg to meet
three people who were totally

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.660
influenced by Paris.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.800
And the Beatles became this
melange of all of that.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.310
And when they really
broke America,

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.190
they had a continental look, not
an English look and certainly

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.120
not an American look.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.490
They were kind of French.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.680
ROB LEONARD: You just talk
about myths from the Beatles.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.440
Your book separated some of the
myths from showing the truth.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.990
What myths bother you
about the Beatles?

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.330
MARK LEWISOHN: So many.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.390
I have real difficulty reading
most books on the Beatles,

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.450
especially those that
have got an agenda.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.470
The writers often have
an agenda on something.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.250
And they bring that
agenda onto the page.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.080
And they're forcing
their opinions on you.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.180
For me, it's just about
being the narrator.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:49.050
And I just try and weave other
stories together in this book.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.620
Myths that bother me?

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.830
Just too many aspects of their
story are-- they're too pat.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.150
These are very interesting,
challenging, spiky, difficult,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.790
funny, talented,
amusing, original people.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:11.870
And I just think that you can't
easily put a thought on them

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.500
because they were much
more diverse than that.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.160
So I look in this book at the
Beatles from the outside in

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.480
and the inside out.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.660
And I want to see their
chemistry with one another

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.310
and how they
functioned as a unit.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.620
I mean, how did
these four guys stay

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.290
so sane through
such insane times

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.850
once they became so
globally popular?

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:34.840
So I look at all that.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.370
But there are so many
elements of the story that

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.170
are too easy, like when they
go to India, for example,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.180
and they're with the Maharishi,
which is often just kind

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.100
of thrown away as this kind of
silly period in their career

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.960
when they just went off to
India and tried to levitate

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.780
or whatever.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.890
But in reality,
they're just guys.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.860
They're human
beings who are going

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.220
through an extraordinary time.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.680
And they're having to deal with
what fame is bringing them,

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.080
fame on an unimagined scale.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.580
No one had ever been
as big as the Beatles.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.710
They are the ever present
loyalty of all celebrity.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.480
To this day, you go in a
room full of celebrities,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.910
Paul McCartney walks in, they
will all turn to look at him.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.290
He's the tops.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.210
And they all were.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.710
The same as true
of John and George.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.550
And it's still true of Ringo.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.850
So they had to deal with this.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:33.160
So at the ages of
25, 26, 27, 28,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.290
they decided to go and find
out what life was about,

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.200
to take that journey.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.700
But being the Beatles, it became
a very, very public thing.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.390
It should have been
a private thing.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.190
But it became very public.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.200
And everyone took the
mickey out of them for it.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.190
And they became kind
of the laughing stock.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.590
But they needed to
find out who they

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.784
were to discover themselves.

00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:56.200
And when they came
back, they were

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.350
different from before they went.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:02.530
So what happened there in India
is worthy of a proper look.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.090
It's not just to be tossed
away as something silly.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.900
It's like, this is important.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.909
If those guys thought it was
important, it's important.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.929
And at the same time, being the
Beatles, wherever they went,

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:13.780
everyone followed.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.460
This whole business of people
being interested in meditation,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.270
people being interested
in spiritualism

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.280
and Eastern
philosophy and so on,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.080
that existed for centuries
before the Beatles,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.280
but they are the great
popularizers of it.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.219
Because they did it, it became a
possibility for everybody else.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.690
MITCH AXELROD: Now
to be fair, 1968

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.215
is going to be in Volume Three?

00:34:33.215 --> 00:34:33.550
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.216
MITCH AXELROD: OK,
so we've got to wait.

00:34:35.216 --> 00:34:36.630
ROB LEONARD: That's
a while away.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.300
MITCH AXELROD: This only goes
up to the New Year's Eve of '62,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.800
right?

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.730
MARK LEWISOHN: This goes up
to the very brink of 1963

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.622
when the Beatles have got
a record out in England.

00:34:45.622 --> 00:34:47.830
They're already being exposed
to the American market.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.380
They've already
been turned down by,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.110
at the end of this book, three
American record companies.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.510
Because America was no
more prepared to accept

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.260
what the Beatles were than
the English market was,

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.230
they had to force their way in.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.290
But once people heard
them, that was enough

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.810
because the music did the rest.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.790
MITCH AXELROD: Now let's
talk about their idols.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.850
Because we talked about
the music a little bit.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:14.700
Who were the Beatles idolizing
for American musicians?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.754
MARK LEWISOHN: Elvis,
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.

00:35:16.754 --> 00:35:17.920
MITCH AXELROD: Was it Elvis?

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.003
MARK LEWISOHN: Absolutely.

00:35:19.003 --> 00:35:19.565
It was Elvis.

00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:20.290
MITCH AXELROD: I thought so.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.260
MARK LEWISOHN:
Yeah, Elvis Costello

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.630
was really big in those days.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.620
Yeah, Elvis and also
very much Buddy Holly

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.270
and the Crickets, and very much
Eddie Cochran, and very much

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.040
Jerry Lee Lewis, and
very much Carl Perkins.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.110
Little Richard, of
course, Little Richard.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.130
It didn't matter to
them what skin color

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:44.250
the person had
because it was music.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.430
And John Lennon had this
extraordinary experience

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.450
when he was 15?

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.760
Yes, it was April, 1956.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.237
He had just heard Elvis.

00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:54.070
And Elvis was the
greatest thing he had ever

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.680
heard in his entire life.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.910
And John Lennon would
always love Elvis

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.140
until the day he died.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.640
And then some kids in
his class at school

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.710
had been on a school
trip to the Netherlands

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.590
and been in a record store there
and bought a Little Richard 78.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.620
Now Little Richard was
not available in the UK

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.440
at this point, not until
about eight months later.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.420
And this guy called Michael Hill
had the record with "Long Tall

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.210
Sally" on one side and "Slippin'
and Slidin'" on the other,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:29.030
a 78, and said to John during
the course of a school morning,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.100
I've got a record at
home by a guy who's

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.789
probably better than Elvis.

00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:35.080
And John who had only heard
of Elvis for about a month,

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.720
said, not possible.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.770
Would've told him it
in two short words,

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.010
no doubt, what he
thought of that idea.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.130
But at lunch time, they
all bunked out of school,

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.210
went and got a bag of chips--
French fries-- back to this guy

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.240
Michael's house,
pull on the record,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.110
and John Lennon heard "Long
Tall Sally" for the first time

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.060
and was completely stupefied.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.570
And torn, because he
loved Elvis and yet he

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.970
loved this guy as well.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.030
And then someone said to
him that Little Richard

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:07.140
was a Negro, as the word was
then-- black, African American.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.587
And it was like, oh, my God.

00:37:10.587 --> 00:37:11.670
They make this music, too?

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.710
I love it.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.760
And they became
totally passionate

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.977
about black American music
from that moment onwards.

00:37:16.977 --> 00:37:18.560
MITCH AXELROD: And
to this day, if you

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.600
ask Little Richard, he says he
influenced Paul McCartney all

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.750
the time, doesn't he?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.402
He'll tell you firsthand, I did.

00:37:24.402 --> 00:37:25.360
MARK LEWISOHN: He does.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.910
And they eventually got to
play with Little Richard.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.410
And for them, meeting
Little Richard

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.100
was like anybody
else meeting them.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.380
It was like them
and their heroes.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.046
MITCH AXELROD: What
were the first songs

00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:37.106
that John and Paul wrote?

00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:39.480
MARK LEWISOHN: Well, first of
all, they wrote separately.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.410
And this is one of so many
amazing things in this book.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.760
There were hardly any boys
in the south end of Liverpool

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.660
where they were growing up.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.701
Liverpool was a big city.

00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.400
So it has a north
end and a south end.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.430
It doesn't have a west end
because that's the river.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.440
But it as an east.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.500
And they lived in the
south end of the city.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:03.800
And John Lennon started writing
songs in 1957 at the age of 16.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.560
His first song was
called "Calypso Rock."

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.720
Because as I said,
America believed

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.240
that rock and roll was
this five-minute thing.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.000
And we in England, who swallowed
everything that you thought,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.150
thought it would last
five minutes as well.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.130
So it was going to
last five minutes.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.200
And it was preserved
only by the kids.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.950
Because the companies were
already trying to say,

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.940
well, here's the next fad.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.290
And the next fad was
going to be calypso music.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:33.430
So if you read "Billboard" or
"Cashbox" or "Variety" of 1957,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.510
you'll read, calypso
is the coming thing.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.400
Rock and roll is dead.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.950
And that filtered
across to England.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.160
So John Lennon thought, a-ha,
if I'm going to write a song,

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.920
I'll try and straddle
the two things.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.260
So he wrote a song
called "Calypso Rock."

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.600
And then he wrote a song
called, "Hello, Little Girl."

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.200
And Paul, at the
same time, and this

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.810
is where it gets
interesting, he was

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:58.090
writing a song called "I Lost My
Little Girl" at the same time.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.760
So before they met, or
around the time they met,

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.530
they were both
individually writing songs.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.940
So what are the chances
of two guys-- two kids--

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.830
writing songs?

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.620
Paul was only 14.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.130
What are the chances of them A,
writing songs, and then finding

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.960
each other, and then thinking,
let's write together?

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.180
So unusual were the
Beatles in those days

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.500
that when Brian
Epstein were trying

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.965
to get them a recording
contract in London,

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:25.340
not only were
people telling them

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.830
you'll never make it from
Liverpool and go home

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.524
and all that kind
of stuff, everyone

00:39:31.524 --> 00:39:33.940
said to him you've got to
change the name because the word

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.075
Beatles will never catch on.

00:39:36.075 --> 00:39:36.950
MITCH AXELROD: Never.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.200
MARK LEWISOHN: Never catch on.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.410
So as weird as that sounds, that
is the thinking back in 1962.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.955
And the Beatles were
always about, stuff you.

00:39:44.955 --> 00:39:46.640
We're going to do it our way.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.810
And if you don't like it,
well, we'll just keep it

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.982
and you'll pay for it later.

00:39:51.982 --> 00:39:53.440
And when they first
went to London,

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.274
there's a section
in the book when

00:39:55.274 --> 00:39:57.690
they go to London for the first
time to promote themselves

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.710
and they go around
meeting journalists,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.040
people were openly
hostile to them.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.429
Your name is horrible,
and you'll never make it,

00:40:04.429 --> 00:40:04.970
and all that.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.055
And they, being the Beatles,
they thought, right.

00:40:08.055 --> 00:40:08.680
We'll show you.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.690
And they never forgot.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.895
I mean, very tough-minded
guys, the Beatles.

00:40:11.895 --> 00:40:12.980
Very tough.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.104
MITCH AXELROD: But they
had a little bit of trouble

00:40:15.104 --> 00:40:17.510
with the name in Germany,
too, didn't they?

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.399
MARK LEWISOHN: There's
a leading question.

00:40:19.399 --> 00:40:20.690
MITCH AXELROD: I had to ask it.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.760
MARK LEWISOHN: In
Germany, the word Beatles

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.050
will be pronounced as "peedles."

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.340
MITCH AXELROD: Not to end
on a naughty note, but--

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.140
MARK LEWISOHN: And
"peedles" actually means

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.070
the male appendage in
German in some kind

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:37.890
of slightly schoolboyish talk.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.129
Actually, I quite like the
fact that in America you

00:40:41.129 --> 00:40:42.170
always say Beatles with--

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.169
MITCH AXELROD: Like a D.

00:40:43.169 --> 00:40:46.190
MARK LEWISOHN: Like a D. And
we say Beatles with the T.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.600
But we say Elvis wrong.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.210
Presley.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.630
Because we say
Presley as if it's got

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.730
what I would call a
zed and you call a zee.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.550
And you say Presley.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.930
So we name your greatest
star incorrectly.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.950
We pronounce it wrong.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.480
And you pronounce our
greatest star incorrectly.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.855
MITCH AXELROD: Actually, we
don't even say the last name.

00:41:02.855 --> 00:41:04.460
We just call him Elvis.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.390
MARK LEWISOHN: The King.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.767
MITCH AXELROD: What's
Madonna's last name?

00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:09.975
MARK LEWISOHN: I can't think.

00:41:09.975 --> 00:41:10.460
MITCH AXELROD: Just kidding.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.110
MARK LEWISOHN: Cuchione?

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:11.940
MITCH AXELROD: Oh, wow.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.800
ROB LEONARD: Ciccone.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.517
MITCH AXELROD: Someone
Google it right now.

00:41:13.517 --> 00:41:14.484
ROB LEONARD: Ciccone.

00:41:14.484 --> 00:41:16.900
MITCH AXELROD: There's so much
to talk about in this book.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.690
I mean, it's 1,000 pages.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.830
It really is.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.000
It does go up to '62.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.600
You really need to
buy it and read it.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.100
It's the most incredible
detail you will ever

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.550
read on the Beatles.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.720
It really does put
into context who

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.030
they were, why they
became who they did,

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.970
and, as you say, why they
gelled as ultimately John,

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.200
Paul, George, and Ringo.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.140
It was John, Paul,
George, and Pete,

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.680
or drummer, or undesirable
member, as you'll read in here.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.710
And then it became Ringo.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.230
MARK LEWISOHN: And that
order is important.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.780
Psychologically,
the constitution

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.330
of the Beatles as a band is
John, Paul, George, and Ringo

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.160
because John started
it and led them

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.350
and he was always the leader.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.970
And he brought in Paul.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.270
And Paul brought in George.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.230
And George brought in Ringo.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.900
So that doesn't just fall
nicely of the tongue,

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.020
it's absolutely essential to
understanding the relationships

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.440
within the group.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.000
TONY TRAGUARDO: And just to add,
one of the fascinating things

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.230
about the book is that it's
written in a narrative form.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:22.879
And you see sort of how
different people could have--

00:42:22.879 --> 00:42:24.420
you know, there were
some near misses

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.160
of people who weave in and
out of the Beatles' lives

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.790
at different times.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.480
So many instances
of things could

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.720
have been radically
different if one domino had

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.600
been slightly out of place.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.200
And while other books,
you'd see a little

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.890
of that, because you have
it so beautifully laid out,

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.750
you really do see the,
if you want to say,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.622
fate or just the circumstances
that put it all together.

00:42:51.622 --> 00:42:52.330
Brilliantly done.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:52.900
MARK LEWISOHN: Thank you.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.690
ROB LEONARD: I also
think you, just

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.160
a little review of
the book, you look

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.910
at the bigger circle as
well as the inner circle.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.970
I think the people
like Brian Epstein,

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.110
you don't start where he
first meets the Beatles.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.380
It's before that.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.240
George Martin and other
people who managed them or--

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.490
TONY TRAGUARDO: In the sphere.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.448
ROB LEONARD: In quotes.

00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:15.800
MARK LEWISOHN: To
me, it's always wrong

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.674
when you get a book
where, for example, Ringo

00:43:17.674 --> 00:43:19.610
joins the Beatles in '62.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.090
So most of the
books on the Beatles

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.300
will have their
story to that point

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.010
and then bring him in and
do a little quick back story

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:27.860
and that's it.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.990
But actually all these people
are growing up in the same city

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.900
at the same time.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.941
They're all living there.

00:43:32.941 --> 00:43:35.540
They're all on parallel tracks
that sometimes cross over

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.980
before they really have met.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.010
This is not a book
about legends.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.030
This is a book about
four people who

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.560
thought differently and
acted differently, and were

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.030
original and daring and
prepared to break all the rules.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.270
So it's really important to
actually put them properly

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.494
all in the same space
at the same time

00:43:57.494 --> 00:44:00.160
because they're all going to see
the same films at the same time

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.120
in the cinema, the
Elvis films or whatever.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.280
And they're all listening
to the same records.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.590
And they are crossing
over one another

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.330
even before they know it.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.270
So it makes it much more
of a cogent and real story

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.362
if you've actually got
them in the same place

00:44:14.362 --> 00:44:15.070
at the same time.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.944
ROB LEONARD: And also
the fact that they also

00:44:16.944 --> 00:44:19.500
met the right people who
believed in them-- Brian

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.860
Epstein, George Martin.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.539
If they were signed to Decca--

00:44:23.539 --> 00:44:25.080
MARK LEWISOHN: They
were lucky to get

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.610
Brian Epstein as their manager.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.220
They were extraordinarily
lucky to get

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.580
George Martin as their producer.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.310
And he, in turn,
was extraordinarily

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:32.910
lucky to get them.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.740
Because as I show
in the book, he

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.860
didn't actually
want to sign them.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.310
He actually had his arm
twisted to sign them.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.100
But as soon as he met them--
because he signed them

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.210
before he met them--
as soon as he met them,

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.920
he knew that they were original.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.840
And he worked-- George Martin's
career fell into two paths,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.650
really, which was if he
ever followed a formula

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.030
and did whatever the
formulaic thing to do

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:59.090
was with unoriginal talent, the
records were really quite poor.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.300
And I have a
collection of them now,

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.070
George Martin's poor records.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.720
There's a box full of them.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.670
But if he ever worked with
original minds, people

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:12.280
who were really creative
in their own right,

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.520
he would bring all his
creativity to the palette

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.020
as well.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.200
And the results were fantastic.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.590
So meeting the
Beatles, for George,

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:25.150
was just the most perfect thing
because their thing was always,

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.050
what do you mean
we can't do that?

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.880
It's just like,
what do you mean no?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.170
Well, if you say no, we'll
say yes, as the song goes.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.670
I mean, that actually is Paul
McCartney's mantra to this day.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.070
You say yes, I'll say no.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.832
Or you say no, I'll say yes.

00:45:40.832 --> 00:45:42.540
And the Beatles always
operated that way.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.290
As soon as they got
to Abbey Road studios,

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.104
and they met a sheet of paper
full of rules like that,

00:45:47.104 --> 00:45:48.770
they went, well, we're
going to do that,

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.260
and we're going to do that,
and we're going to do that.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.090
And they just broke them all.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.740
And because they
broke them all, they

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.300
made "Sergeant Pepper" and
"Revolver" and "Abbey Road"

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.602
and "The White Album"
and all these things

00:45:58.602 --> 00:46:03.460
that were just culturally
pushing the envelope so far.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.250
MITCH AXELROD: Well,
I want to open it up

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:06.541
to questions from the audience.

00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:10.090
But I will say as far as
the narrative in the book,

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.190
you do get a sense
when you read this

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:14.556
that you are in their story.

00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:16.680
And that's, I think, one
of the biggest compliments

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.620
I can pay you.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.400
Because I felt
like I was actually

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.550
walking down the street
with John, with George,

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.800
with Ringo, and Paul.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.270
And you really were
there with them.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.010
And that has not happened before
in any other book I've read.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.719
So I mean, kudos.

00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:32.760
MARK LEWISOHN: Thank you.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.305
MITCH AXELROD: It is a really
fascinating book, really is.

00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:35.560
MARK LEWISOHN: Thank you.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.470
TONY TRAGUARDO: To bring
in the ruddles humor,

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.053
you brought in the
sights, the sounds,

00:46:38.053 --> 00:46:39.960
the smells of the actual.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.640
And you'll read about
that in the book.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.570
There's actually a
comment about the smells.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.319
MITCH AXELROD: So do
we have any questions

00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:48.241
from the audience for Mark?

00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:48.740
Sure.

00:46:50.847 --> 00:46:52.180
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.650
And thanks for
writing this book.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:58.380
As one of the only people in the
room who probably saw "The Ed

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.870
Sullivan Show" the first
time it was shown--

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:07.460
and my father said that can't
be their real hair-- it became

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.760
sort of a genetic piece of
my fabric, of growing up,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.680
my culture and my background.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.960
And I wonder if the
same sort of feeling

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.260
happens with any other
artists later on.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.790
Is there another generation
that has another artist that

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.670
becomes so genetic
in their core being?

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:25.960
Or is this a once in a
lifetime, once in a generation,

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.530
once in a millennium thing?

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.110
MARK LEWISOHN: Well, I'll throw
this one open to the panel

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:30.610
here.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.810
But from my own point
of view, I mean,

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:36.360
the obvious answer is that
every generation has its heroes.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.882
And every generation has
its key musical influences.

00:47:39.882 --> 00:47:41.340
I always think that
it is the music

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:44.750
you hear when you're,
say, 14 to 19 or 20

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.820
that has the greatest
impact on you in terms

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.550
of shaping your opinion.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:53.100
But on the other hand,
subsequent generations

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.390
wouldn't have had anything
as profound as the Beatles

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:59.920
or as artistically deep and
satisfying as the Beatles.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.220
Molds can really
only be broken once.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.290
I mean, there are so
many molds to be broken,

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.580
but the Beatles just--
they changed so many things

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.370
that after that,
everyone was, in a way,

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.740
always treading in
their footsteps.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.820
But of course, if asked
an 18-year-old today,

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.570
though he might know
of the Beatles, which

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:19.540
is an amazing thing
in itself, that

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:23.139
wouldn't necessarily be
his or her game changer.

00:48:23.139 --> 00:48:23.930
That's what I feel.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:24.520
What do you think?

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.061
MITCH AXELROD: Well,
you know, to me,

00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:30.720
Dexys Midnight Runners
with "Come On Eileen."

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.460
There's no one like
Dexys Midnight Runners.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.810
No, to me, I mean, you're asking
the wrong person because to me,

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.514
I'm up here because
of the Beatles.

00:48:39.514 --> 00:48:41.180
Well, I'm up here
because of my parents.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.527
But I'm up here, really,
because the Beatles

00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:44.860
were a big influence on my life.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.310
I don't think there's
anybody-- you have always said,

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.340
there were circumstances that
made the Beatles who they were.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.030
And I don't think
those can happen again.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.650
I just don't.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.650
MARK LEWISOHN: They were
born at the right time.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.240
And they entered our lives
at the right time as well.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.980
ROB LEONARD: I think
some bands have

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.147
had a place in rock history.

00:49:04.147 --> 00:49:05.396
MARK LEWISOHN: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:05.396 --> 00:49:07.070
ROB LEONARD: But I
think culturally,

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.585
in the bigger picture,
the Beatles knocked down

00:49:10.585 --> 00:49:12.160
so many doors and stuff.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:12.850
MARK LEWISOHN: I
think, I mean, there

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.950
was always this
thing about who's

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.400
going to be the next band
to be as big as the Beatles.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.030
And after about 30
years, eventually people

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.540
stopped asking because
it just isn't possible.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.415
Times have moved on.

00:49:23.415 --> 00:49:25.290
MITCH AXELROD: I think,
actually, the curse--

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.360
ROB LEONARD: But there's
no Ed Sullivan show either.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.250
TONY TRAGUARDO: Well, I
was just going to say,

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.999
I think part of it has
to do with the idea

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.580
that "The Ed Sullivan
Show" was such

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.530
a huge simultaneous exposure.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.010
I think that there have
been acts since then.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.990
You read about Elton
John's performance

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.920
at the Troubadour that
broke him wide open.

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.790
U2 had some stunning
performances.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.460
But these were often
live performances

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.570
that were reviewed.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:51.900
Springsteen being called
the future of rock and roll.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.650
We saw it in
individual performances

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:54.940
that would get reviewed.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:50:00.680
But to have had it given to
all of us on the Sullivan show,

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.270
here it is.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:04.010
ROB LEONARD: And
how many bands got

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.150
started the next day because
of "The Ed Sullivan Show"?

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.830
TONY TRAGUARDO: Because
of "The Ed Sullivan Show."

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.360
MITCH AXELROD: Well, it's funny
because I feel bad for Elvis

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.375
because Elvis probably
thought the same thing.

00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:14.270
Well, no one's going
to be bigger than me.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.186
And then, a few years
later, it's the Beatles.

00:50:16.186 --> 00:50:17.270
And, like, oh, damn.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.270
ROB LEONARD: I do have a
question for you, Mark.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.700
And it concerns
the Sullivan show.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.620
Here in America, it's a moment.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.732
In Great Britain,
"The Ed Sullivan Show"

00:50:26.732 --> 00:50:27.690
wasn't broadcast there.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:32.274
How was that looked
at from Great Britain?

00:50:32.274 --> 00:50:34.690
MARK LEWISOHN: I used to read
about "The Ed Sullivan Show"

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:36.620
for years as a Beatles fan.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.810
And also I was always interested
in broadcasting, as well.

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.375
But I didn't actually see
it until the video age

00:50:42.375 --> 00:50:44.500
when you could actually
get to see tapes of things.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.370
For us, that was not the show.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:52.380
For us, we had our own landmark
moments, a couple of big TV

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.630
shows the Beatles did.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.460
But more than anything else,
whereas the Beatles, well,

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.880
they were number one at a time
of the Sullivan show here.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.536
But that was where the nation
saw them for the first time.

00:51:02.536 --> 00:51:04.410
In England, it happened
a few months earlier.

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:07.550
And it mostly happened
through the records and radio.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.590
And then people saw
them on television

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.520
and thought they were great.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.430
We didn't have that
one single defining

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.320
moment like you've had here.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.340
MITCH AXELROD: We have our next
question from Mark Lapidos.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.750
We should just tell
everybody that Mark Lapidos

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:26.250
is the founder of what was
known as Beatlefest in 1974

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.030
and since changed to The
Fest for Beatles Fans.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:31.070
And Mark Lewisohn is
going to be a guest,

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.889
if you want to tell people
about that after your question.

00:51:33.889 --> 00:51:34.680
MARK LAPIDOS: Sure.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.460
First of all, there
are other people here

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.530
who were there for
"The Ed Sullivan Show."

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.930
And it's a little known
fact that to this day

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.210
it's the largest audience in the
history of American television

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.170
by population size.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:50.080
So the population was like 160.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.220
So it's like, I think,
42%, something like that.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.640
And Superbowl never gets
more than 33%, I don't think.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.100
So that Ed Sullivan show,
as George said, of course,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.170
many times, even the
criminals, they don't watch us.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.869
But anyway, I have a question.

00:52:04.869 --> 00:52:06.660
I have no idea if you're
writing about this

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.400
because this book only
goes up to the end of '62

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.800
and I'm only up
to page 50 or 60.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.030
It's going to take me maybe
10 years to get through it.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.640
But I'm loving it so far.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.320
I don't know how much you delve
into the music part of it.

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.280
But I guess for book three, I
have a bit of Beatles trivia

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.930
I'd like to ask you about.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.170
I asked George Martin,
and he answered it.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:32.040
But I want to know if
you know about this,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.900
what your answer would be.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.910
"Penny Lane."

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.720
I met with him
about 20 years ago.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.650
I said, can I ask you
one trivia question?

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:40.530
He said, sure.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.880
I said, what happened at
the end of "Penny Lane"?

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.699
Why is it only on the
promotional single in the US?

00:52:46.699 --> 00:52:47.990
So do you have an answer, Mark?

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.250
MARK LEWISOHN: Why--

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:49.940
TONY TRAGUARDO: You
should let people what--

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.440
MITCH AXELROD: You mean
the trumpet ending.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.610
MARK LAPIDOS: The trumpets,
the trumpet ending,

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.360
it's only on the
promotional single.

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.620
It never made it on the
American single or album.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.995
MARK LEWISOHN:
Did he tell you it

00:52:59.995 --> 00:53:02.872
was because Paul wanted to
change it at the last minute?

00:53:02.872 --> 00:53:03.580
MARK LAPIDOS: No.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.330
MARK LEWISOHN: What
did he tell you?

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:05.740
MARK LAPIDOS: I'll give you
an answer in a minute, but--

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.657
TONY TRAGUARDO: Well, now
we know what the answer is.

00:53:06.657 --> 00:53:07.839
We already know the answer.

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:09.630
MARK LAPIDOS: This is
exactly what he said.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.660
He said, we were
just making music.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.102
We just sent it over.

00:53:14.102 --> 00:53:15.060
He didn't even know it.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.110
He was like, all right.

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.174
We'll send it over.

00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:19.090
Oh, it's not finished?

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.440
Doesn't matter, just do it.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.410
Never gave it a thought.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.070
It surprised the hell out of me.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.270
MARK LEWISOHN: They were
turning out product.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:26.978
I mean, that is yet
another amazing thing

00:53:26.978 --> 00:53:30.130
about the Beatles is that all
the recorded material that we

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:32.340
know and love all came out
in the space of about 7

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.420
and 1/2 years.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.289
I mean, 13 albums
in 7 and 1/2 years,

00:53:37.289 --> 00:53:39.080
if you're looking at
the UK products, which

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.520
is the way they shaped it.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.140
And all those singles and
other tracks, as well.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.000
I mean, 200-odd
tracks in seven years.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.890
An act these days
would probably do

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:51.110
one or two albums in that time?

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:55.630
And they completely wiped
clean and drew again

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:57.490
the face of popular
music in that period.

00:54:00.482 --> 00:54:01.940
One of the things
I do in this book

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.200
is actually name
number all the years.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.380
So 1958 is really the year when
the Beatles are first-- they're

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.040
not the Beatles yet,
but in fact, they

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.810
went around as a
trio at one point--

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:14.402
John, Paul, and George--
called J Page 3.

00:54:14.402 --> 00:54:16.110
TONY TRAGUARDO: That
was a new discovery.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.193
That was something that
had never surfaced before.

00:54:18.193 --> 00:54:20.932
Where did you find--

00:54:20.932 --> 00:54:23.140
MARK LEWISOHN: Tracked down
this guy who was actually

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.880
their manager for a while
and had a recording of them

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.180
that he wiped, unfortunately.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.900
But they were J Page 3.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.320
J for John, P-A for
Paul, and G-E for George,

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.210
and 3 because they were
a trio, three guitarists.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:40.450
And that is year one.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.180
1958, when they started going
around together, is year one.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.140
So 1964, when they
played the Sullivan show,

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.747
that's year seven.

00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:50.330
There's a tendency
in America to think

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.660
they kind of arrived when
they played the Sullivan show,

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.900
but that was year seven.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.390
And when they broke
up, it was year 13.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.570
Now they don't get a recording
contract until year five,

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.530
but that doesn't mean
they're not together.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.840
They're still very much working
and finding out who they are,

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.810
and young lads having
fun and all that,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.440
and having adventures.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.750
Actually, they were
together 13 years,

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:15.540
much more than people realize.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.490
MITCH AXELROD: And
we did want to say

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:20.190
that Mark will be at The
Fest for Beatles fans

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:23.634
on this Sunday,
February 9, correct?

00:55:23.634 --> 00:55:25.800
MARK LEWISOHN: The anniversary
of the Sullivan show.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.220
MITCH AXELROD: Absolutely.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.420
MARK LEWISOHN: I shall
being doing my Ed Sullivan

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:28.919
impressions.

00:55:28.919 --> 00:55:30.420
MITCH AXELROD: Oh, good.

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.080
I'll be doing my Topo
Gigio impression.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.734
I'm short enough so.

00:55:34.734 --> 00:55:36.400
Do we have any other
questions for Mark?

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.358
TONY TRAGUARDO: We're
being told to wrap it up.

00:55:38.358 --> 00:55:40.460
MITCH AXELROD: We're
being told to wrap it up.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.500
One more question?

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.170
Anybody?

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:43.830
Al?

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.330
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I did have one--

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.110
MITCH AXELROD: Can you
go to the mic, please?

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:46.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.655
MITCH AXELROD: Sorry.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.960
And then I believe Mark
will be doing signing.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:55.470
We don't?

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.410
I'm sorry, Al, you--

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.790
TONY TRAGUARDO: Can you
ask it in private, Al?

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:58.760
MITCH AXELROD: Yeah,
ask it in private, Al.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.080
Sorry.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.249
We'll ask it after.

00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:02.290
AUDIENCE: OK, real quick.

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:03.730
MITCH AXELROD: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.050
AUDIENCE: Mark, you
talked about the hostility

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:10.120
that the London music
establishment had

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.360
toward Liverpool, or
indifference, maybe.

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.540
And yet there was in that
first batch of teen idols,

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.540
there was one
Liverpudlian, Billy Fury.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.310
But he didn't apparently
become sort of an icon

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:30.987
for the other budding
musicians in Liverpool.

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.570
Is there a particular
reason for that?

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:34.861
MARK LEWISOHN: Yeah, Billy
Fury was the first Liverpool

00:56:34.861 --> 00:56:36.520
rock-and-roll star
before the Beatles.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.420
His real name was
Ronald Wycherly.

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.390
And he actually was in the
same class at school as Ringo.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.760
But so embarrassing was
the Liverpool accent,

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.970
or perceived to be in
those days in the UK--

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:50.250
and that's another
thing the Beatles did.

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.040
In my country, in
England, they completely

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.630
changed the class system.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.770
Well, not changed it,
but challenged it.

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.300
And opened it up to people.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.250
Because they had northern
working class accents.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:04.090
And that had always been
embarrassing before.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:07.270
Billy Fury never
said a word publicly

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.730
because of his Liverpool accent.

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.922
His manager said to
him, don't speak.

00:57:10.922 --> 00:57:12.880
And when he sang, he sang
in an American voice.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.713
So no one really knew
he was from Liverpool.

00:57:14.713 --> 00:57:15.620
It wasn't important.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.380
But when the Beatles broke
through, it's like, yeah,

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.265
we're from Liverpool.

00:57:19.265 --> 00:57:20.140
We're from the north.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.170
You got a problem with that?

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.590
And that was a real
challenge to people,

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.010
which is why they received
hostility to begin with.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.200
But eventually,
within about a year,

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.090
everyone was putting on a
northern accent to be cool.

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:38.150
That's just a small measure
of the impact that they had.

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.480
MITCH AXELROD: Well, the
book is called "The Beatles

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.740
All These Years,
Tune In, Volume One."

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.510
There will be three of
these by Crown Archetype.

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:46.540
Thank you very much.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.930
We appreciate Mark being here.

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:49.530
We appreciate Google
having us here.

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:49.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.871
MARK LEWISOHN: Thank you.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:54.899
MITCH AXELROD: Thank you.
