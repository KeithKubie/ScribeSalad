PRESENTER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.800
Authors at Google New York
is pleased today

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.170
to welcome Jon Ronson.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:10.070
JON RONSON: Hello.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.560
Hi.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.210
So "The Psychopath
Test." It began--

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.030
I was at a friend's house, and
she had on her shelf a copy of

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.400
the DSM manual, which I'm
sure you all know about.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.560
It's the manual of
mental disorders.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
It started off in the '50s
as a very slim volume.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.050
There were very few mental
disorders in the '50s.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.460
And then it grew and grew and
grew, and it's currently 886

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.900
pages long, and it lists every
known mental disorder.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.780
And there's currently 374
mental disorders.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930
So I was leafing through the
book, wondering if I had any

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.400
mental disorders, and it turns
out that I've got 12.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.970
I've got generalized anxiety
disorder, which frankly, I

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.500
didn't a book to tell me.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.960
I've got nightmare disorder,
which is categorized if you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.150
have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.870
And all my dreams involve
people pursuing me and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.790
declaring me a failure.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.270
I've got a parent-child
relational problems, which I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.690
blame my parents for.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.210
I've got malingering.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.061
And I think it's actually
probably quite rare to have

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.100
malingering and generalized
anxiety disorder,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.420
but there you go.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.170
I've got both.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.890
The new edition, as I'm sure
you'll know, is about to come

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.230
out in May, and they've just
announced some of the new

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.950
disorders that are going
to be in there.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890
Intermittent explosive
disorder.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.660
There's a version of it
in the current DSM-IV.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.980
But now I met the head of the
new DSM a couple of weeks ago,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.250
and I said to him, OK, if you
break a bottle against a wall

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.930
twice in a year in anger, does
that mean you've got

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.930
intermittent explosive
disorder?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.195
And he said, yes.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:58.760
So there you go.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.050
Also, they've been thinking
about putting internet

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.980
addiction into the new DSM.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.660
But now they've decided to put
it into the appendix, which is

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.740
the graveyard of mental
disorders.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.970
Which actually, I'm kind of
pissed off about, because the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.370
times when I've accidentally
typed my name into Google and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.010
inadvertently pressed Search,
and I found people slagging me

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.980
off, I kind of like the idea of
them being declared insane.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.900
But unfortunately, internet
addiction isn't going to be a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.970
full-blown disorder.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.760
Much later, by the way,
I was wondering why.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.270
You know, with these mental
disorders, was I much crazier

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.700
than I thought I was?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.320
Or maybe it's not a good idea
to diagnose yourself with a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.690
mental disorder if you're not
a trained professional.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.900
Or maybe the psychiatry
profession has a kind of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.685
strange fetish to label
increasingly normal behavior

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:50.790
as mental disorders.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.840
I didn't know which of those
things was true.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.120
But I thought it was really
interesting to try and solve

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.060
that mystery.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.180
Much later, by the way, I met
the man who turned the DSM

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.010
from a pamphlet into
a brick of a book.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.370
It was called Robert Spitzer,
who is now in Princeton.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.450
At the time, he was
at Columbia.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.420
And Robert Spitzer's story
is that he hated Freudian

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.300
psychoanalysis, because his
mother was miserable her whole

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.920
life, and she died unhappy,
and she'd gone to Freudian

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.210
analyst after Freudian analyst
and none of them helped her.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.130
So he grew up with this kind
of hatred of Freud.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.560
And when he took over the
editorship of the DSM, he

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.370
decided that it was his destiny
to eradicate Freud

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.880
from psychiatry and replace all
that sleuthing around the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.480
unconscious with checklists.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.760
So he called all his like-minded
people into

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.933
conference rooms at Columbia,
and he'd say, who's got ideas

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.010
for the mental disorders?

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.630
And people would go, oh, ADHD!

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.400
And he'd go, what's
the checklist?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.570
And he'd type it into
his typewriter.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.160
And that's how ADHD came to
be a mental disorder.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.540
And it's how bulimia came to
be in the DSM, and so on.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.630
The person who shouted the
loudest, he would listen to

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.245
them, and he'd type it into his
old typewriter, and there

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:16.000
it was, sealed in stone.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.430
And I said to him, when I met
him in Princeton, a couple of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.340
years ago, I said, were there
any proposed mental disorders

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.320
that you rejected?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.340
And he said, yeah,
there was one.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.340
Atypical child syndrome.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.110
He said the problem with it
was when I asked the man

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.310
proposing it what the shared
characteristics were, he said,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.410
that's very hard to
say, because the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.510
children are very atypical.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.800
JON RONSON: He said he was
also going to put in

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.240
masochistic personality
disorder, which would be for

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.960
women who remained in abusive
relationships.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.140
But he said he got into terrible
trouble with the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.310
feminists, and so he changed
the name to self-defeating

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.970
personality disorder and shoved
it in the appendix.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.180
So this was much later.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.590
And when I was at my friend's
house, I was wondering, well,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.620
what is this with mental
disorders?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.950
What's the issue?

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.790
And so I decided to meet a
critic of psychiatry to get

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.860
their view, which is how I ended
up having lunch with the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.360
Scientologists.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.290
And it was a crack team
of Scientologists.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.020
This was in London.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.970
They're called the CCHR.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.830
And it's their destiny
to destroy

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.400
psychiatry wherever it lies--

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.230
probably because of difficult
relationships between L. Ron

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.550
Hubbard and psychiatrists,
back in the day.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.585
And I had lunch with the head
of the London branch.

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:46.220
His name was Brian.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.600
And I said, can you prove to me
that psychiatry is a wicked

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.350
pseudoscience that
can't be trusted?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.300
Can you prove your
ideology to me?

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.490
And he said, yes, I can
prove it to you.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.890
And I said, how?

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.860
And he said, I can introduce
you to Tony.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.910
And I said, who's Tony?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.570
And he said, Tony's
in Broadmoor.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.960
And Broadmoor is Broadmoor
Hospital.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.970
It was Britain's most notorious,
mythologically

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.360
notorious asylum for the
criminally insane.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.830
It's now called, of course,
Broadmoor Hospital.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.500
And I said, what did Tony do?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.040
And Brian said, hardly
anything.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.160
He beat someone up
with something.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.245
But the point is, he decided to
fake madness to get out of

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:37.620
a prison sentence, and he faked
it too well, and now

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.710
he's stuck in Broadmoor.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.750
And the more he tries to
convince the psychiatrists

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.290
there that he's sane, the more
they take it as evidence that

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.890
he's crazy.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.720
Do you want us to get you into
Broadmoor to meet Tony?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.900
So I said, yes, please.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.510
So I'm going to read a tiny
bit from "The Psychopath

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.890
Test," what happened when
I went to Broadmoor.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.930
I got the train there.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.500
I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park, which is

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.000
what dogs also do
when anxious.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.910
And I got to Broadmoor, and I
met Brian, and we were taken

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.030
through high-security gate after
gate after gate into the

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.100
Wellness Center, which
is where you

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.230
get to meet the patients.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.430
And it's all calming colors,
like peaches and pine.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.020
And I'm going to do a little
microphone experiment of,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.550
like, leaning back a bit
and seeing if you

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.080
can still hear me?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.080
Is that OK?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.320
Because I was getting a--

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.640
great.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.150
OK.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.560
So the Wellness Center at
Broadmoor, it's all peach and

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.370
pine and calming colors.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.170
It looks like a kind
of travel inn.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.820
And the only bold colors are the
reds of the panic buttons.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.210
And Brian said to me, you know,
Tony's the only person

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.460
in the entire DSPD unit to have
the privilege of meeting

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.160
people in the Wellness Center.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.380
And I said, what does
DSPD stand for?

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.670
And Brian said, Dangerous and
Severe Personality Disorder.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.670
And I said, is Tony in the part
of Broadmoor that houses

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.180
the most dangerous people?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.580
And Brian said, yeah,
isn't that insane?

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.070
And then the patients started
drifting in, and they're all

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:13.240
quite overweight and wearing
sweatpants and shuffling, and

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.230
they had sort of doleful eyes.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.990
And Brian whispered to me,
they're medicated.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.700
Which, to a Scientologist, is
like the worst evil in the

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.970
world, but I'm thinking it's
presumably a good idea.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.060
And then Brian said,
here's Tony.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.549
And a man was walking towards
me, and he wasn't overweight.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.030
He was in excellent physical
condition.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.270
And he wasn't wearing
sweatpants.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.720
He was wearing a
pinstripe suit.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.860
It was evidently the outfit of
a man who wanted to prove to

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.130
me that he was incredibly
sane.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.810
So we sat down, and I said, is
it true that you faked your

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.550
way in here?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.700
And he said, yeah, absolutely.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.510
I beat a man up in Reading,
which is just west of London.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.480
And I was on remand, and my
cellmate said, you're looking

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.030
at five to seven
years for this.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.530
What you have to do
is fake madness.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.550
Tell them you're mad.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.330
You'll get sent to some
cushy hospital.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.340
You'll have your own
PlayStation.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.905
Nurses will bring you pizzas.

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:14.700
So he says, so that's
what I did.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.960
And I said, how to do it?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.950
He said, well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.280
And I'd just seen a film called
"Crash," in which

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.500
people get sexual pleasure from
crashing cars into walls.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.940
So I said to the psychiatrist,
I get sexual pleasure from

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.810
crashing cars into walls.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.830
And I said, what else?

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.280
And he said, oh, I told the
psychiatrist that I wanted to

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.200
watch women as they died,
because it would make me feel

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.760
more normal.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.580
And I said, where'd
you get that from?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.380
And he said, oh, from a
biography of Ted Bundy that

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.610
they had in the prison
library.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.090
So anyway, I faked
madness too well.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.680
They didn't send me some
cushy hospital.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.820
They sent me to Broadmoor.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.560
The minute I got here, took a
look around, asked to see the

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.230
psychiatrist.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.040
I said, there's been a terrible
misunderstanding.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.630
I said, how long have
you been here for?

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.570
He said, well, if I had done my
time for the original GBH,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.140
I'd have got five
to seven years.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.720
I've been in Broadmoor
for 12 years.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.250
It is an awful lot harder,
Tony told me, to convince

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.910
people you're sane than it is to
convince them you're crazy.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.700
I thought the best way to seem
normal, he said, would be to

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.380
talk to people normally about
normal things, like football.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.660
That's the obvious thing
to do, right?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.110
I subscribe to "New Scientist."
I like reading

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.410
about scientific
breakthroughs.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.730
One time, they had an article
about how the US Army was

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.370
training bumblebees to
sniff out explosives.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.880
So I said to a nurse, did you
know that the US Army's

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.610
training bumblebees to
sniff out explosives?

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.730
Later, when I read my medical
notes, I saw they'd written,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.040
"thinks bees can sniff
out explosives."

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.980
An then when Tony said this to
me, I thought it was probably

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.180
good idea that I hadn't met any
psychiatrists when I was

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.630
writing "The Men Who Stare At
Goats," which if people don't

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.770
know, it's full of that stuff.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.210
It was my previous story.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.560
I was in Hawaii and I met a man
called Glenn Wheaton, who

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.050
was part of a secret
US military unit

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.930
called Project Jedi.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.490
And I said, what was
Project Jedi?

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.280
And he said it was a
series of levels.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.490
And I said, what
was level one?

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.100
He said, level one
was observation.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.580
You walk into a room.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.360
How many chairs are
in the room?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.570
The super soldier
would just know.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.040
And I said, what
was level two?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.170
He said, level two
is intuition.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.480
You're at a fork in the road.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.700
Do you go left?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.940
Do you go right?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.480
You go right.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.800
And I said, what was
level three?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.632
And he said level three
was invisibility.

00:11:44.632 --> 00:11:49.450
And I said, that's quite
a leap from level two.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.620
I said, what, actual
invisibility?

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.180
And he said, at first, but after
a while, we adapted it

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.896
to just trying to find a
way of not being seen.

00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.205
So I said, like camouflage?

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:02.646
And he went, no.

00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:04.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.000
He said, level four was we had
a master sergeant that could

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.790
stop the heart of a goat just
by wanting it to stop.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.640
And I said, did he
ever manage it?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.090
And he said, one time.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.810
But his heart got damaged
at the same time.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.840
And I said, what, was the goat
psychically fighting back?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.510
And he said, no, the goat
didn't stand a chance.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.920
He said, it's what's known
in paranormal circles as

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.591
sympathetic injury.

00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:36.120
He said one time they had 30
goats in a room, and they were

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.600
all staring at goat number
16, and then goat

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.480
number 17 fell over.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.725
Which I guess is collateral
damage.

00:12:41.725 --> 00:12:44.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.030
When you decided to wear
pinstripe to meet me, I said,

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.360
did you realize the look
could go either way?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.580
Yes, said Tony, but I thought
I'd take my chances.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.200
Plus, most of the patients here
are disgusting slobs who

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.360
don't wash or change their
clothes for weeks on end, and

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.070
I like to dress well.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.020
Tony said he didn't like
hanging around

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.680
with the other patients.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.480
He said on one side of him, he
had the Stockwell Strangler,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.880
and on the other side of him, he
had the Tiptoe Through The

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.295
Tulips Rapist.

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:11.787
And he said he found them
unsavory and frightening, so

00:13:11.787 --> 00:13:13.350
he stays in his room a lot.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.570
And he said they took that as
a sign of madness, because

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.760
they said it demonstrated that
he was aloof and grandiose.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.120
So only in Broadmoor would not
wanting to hang out with

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.762
serial killers be considered
a sign of madness.

00:13:25.762 --> 00:13:29.140
Anyway, Tony seemed completely
fine to me.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.590
Just normal and sane.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.080
But obviously, what
did I know?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.305
So when I got home, I wrote to
his clinician, Anthony Maden,

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.150
and I said, what's the story?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.750
And he wrote back to me,
and he said, it's true.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.660
We accept that Tony faked
madness to escape a prison

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.720
sentence, because his delusions
that had seemed very

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.200
cliche to begin with,
just vanished the

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.610
minute he got to Broadmoor.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.500
However, we have assessed him,
and we've determined that what

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.160
he is is a psychopath.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.900
And in fact, faking madness is
exactly the kind of cunning

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.820
and manipulative act
of a psychopath.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.790
It says on the checklist.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.120
Item eight, cunning,
manipulative.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.280
And I said to the clinicians,
what else?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.280
And one of them said to me,
the pinstripe suit--

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.830
classic psychopathic.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.300
Speaks to items one and
two on the checklist--

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.810
grandiose sense of
self-worth, and

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.330
glibness, superficial charm.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.590
Not wanting to hang out with the
other patients was classic

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.075
psychopathic.

00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:23.180
It spoke to lack of empathy
and also grandiosity.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.770
So all the things that seemed
most ordinary about Tony was

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.120
evidence, according to its
clinicians, that he was crazy

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.630
in this new way.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.400
He was a psychopathic.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.530
And Tony Maden said to me, if
you want to know more about

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.040
psychopaths, you can
actually going on a

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.180
psychopathic-spotting course
with Robert Hare, who's the

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.290
creator of the checklist, for
PCLR psychopath checklist.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.640
Like the grandfather of
psychopathy studies.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.150
So I did.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.850
I went on a Hare course.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.355
And I am now a certified--

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.460
I have a certificate
of attendance--

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.350
and I have to say, extremely
adept psychopath-spotter.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.490
So these are the statistics.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.040
One in 100 regular people
is a psychopathic.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.710
So one in 100, walking around,
regular people, are

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.110
psychopaths.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.390
This, according to Robert
Hare and his group.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.620
But that rises to 4% of CEOs
and business leaders.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.990
You're four times more likely
to have a psychopath at the

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.060
top of the tree than you are to
have one as your underling.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.510
Because, of course, capitalism
at its most remorseless

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.326
rewards psychopathic behavior.

00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:42.530
It rewards the lack of empathy
and the grandiosity and the

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.920
impulsivity and the
irresponsibility.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.490
These things are rewarded by
an out-of-control system.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.770
This was what Hare
was saying to me.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.330
I have to say, when I was
learning all of this, I'm

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.890
wondering what I should
do with my new-found

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.580
psychopathic-spotting skills.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.940
I thought I wouldn't put them
to philanthropic good use.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.640
What I would do is think about
all the people in my past who

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.580
had crossed me to see which
of them I could out as

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.340
psychopaths.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.630
So the first on the list--

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.460
I don't know if there's any
British people here, or

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.840
indeed, "Vanity Fair" readers.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.380
Because the first on my list
was AA Gill, the critic AA

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.820
Gill, who is a classic
psychopath.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.050
He gave me very, very bad
reviews on my television

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.440
documentaries over many years,
which is classic psychopathic.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.600
Plus he once wrote a column
about how he wanted to shoot a

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.500
baboon on safari.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.640
He'd been on safari and he shot
a baboon, because like

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.920
all of us, he wondered
what it would be

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.770
like to shoot a person.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.440
Classic psychopath.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.690
So I met AA Gill, actually,
quite recently at a journalist

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.820
award ceremony in London.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.710
And he came bounding up to me.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.920
And somebody had told him
I'd put him in my book.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.760
And the first thing he said was,
I would never sue another

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.819
journalist.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.774
So I said, that thing that you
wrote about wanting to kill a

00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:15.840
baboon on safari, because like
all of us, you wondered what

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.010
it would be like shoot
a person, I said

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.800
it's not all of us.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.030
It's not a normal
thing to think.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.590
It's just you.

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.940
And he said, well, you don't
hunt, so you would never

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.770
understand.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.893
So I said, I sell more
books than you do.

00:17:30.893 --> 00:17:35.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.760
So by all criteria, I won.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:45.440
And then I thought of somebody
who was possibly more

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.730
psychopathic than AA Gill.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.790
And this was a man I'd met
15 years ago in New York.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.860
His name was Toto Constant.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.700
And he was a Haitian dictator.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.490
I won't go over his crimes,
but they were terrible.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.290
And he'd got away with it,
because at the same time, he

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.250
was working as an informant
for the CIA.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.200
So when he had to flee Haiti, he
moved in with his mother in

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.230
Queens, and was allowed
to remain.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.000
He said, if you don't let me
stay here, then I will spill

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.510
the beans about the CIA.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.980
So they let him stay.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.240
The rule was that he
had stay in Queens.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.510
Queens was to be his prison.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.260
He was never allowed
into Manhattan.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.130
I should say, he was

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.840
constantly going into Manhattan.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.180
So I thought, at the time--

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.060
I was young and I was
just starting out.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.620
I thought it would be funny to
go and meet a dictator who had

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.340
to move back in with his
mother in Queens.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.370
But I have to say,
it was not funny.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.860
There was nothing
funny about it.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.520
I turned up in Queens,
and he was there,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.700
wearing a pinstripe suit.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.810
Very hot day.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.490
And all he wanted to do was
protest his innocence.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.250
That was my only purpose that
day, was to listen to him

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.500
protesting his innocence.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.365
And it was nonsense.

00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:09.610
The evidence against him is
completely compelling.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.300
One of the items on the
checklist, by the way,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.530
according to Hare, is compulsive
lying and not

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.700
caring about being
caught in a lie.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.970
So a kind of shamelessness.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.080
But so all he wanted to do was
protest his innocence.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.980
And so I left.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.980
I was frustrated.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.510
I couldn't connect with him on
any kind of empathetic level.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.640
And I never did anything
with the interview.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.940
I found it kind of creepy.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.530
And at one point, he started
crying, and I looked up, and I

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.550
realized he was only
pretending to cry.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.880
Shallow affect is one of the
items on the checklist, an

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.010
inability to experience
a range of emotions.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.140
But now I'd done a
psychopath-spotting course.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.080
I was suddenly incredibly
excited about my

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.120
day with Toto Constant.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.950
So I decided to write to him
again, to see if you would

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:53.980
meet me again.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.050
And it turned out that he was
doing 12 to 37 years in jail

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.070
in upstate New York for
mortgage fraud.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.700
So that's item 20 on
the checklist.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.000
What is item 20?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.330
Oh, I'll get back to
what item 20 is.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.890
Criminal versatility.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.770
So I wrote to him, and I said,
I don't know if you remember

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.000
me, but we met 15 years ago.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.040
And he wrote back and said,
I remember you very well.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.950
Please come and visit.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.470
Nobody ever visits me.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.300
It would just be wonderful
if you came to visit me.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.710
So I'm going to read another
little bit from "The

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.100
Psychopath Test" as
to what happened

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:34.050
when I met Toto Constant.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.030
Why didn't you come and
see me last Tuesday?

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.370
he asked me.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.760
That volcano erupted in Iceland,
and everything got

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.760
put on hold, I said.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.550
OK, he said.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.930
I understand.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.760
When I got your letter,
I was so excited.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.610
Really?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.470
I said.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.470
All the inmates were saying, the
guy who wrote "The Men Who

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.870
Stare At Goats" book is
coming to visit you.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.040
Wow.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.280
Everyone here has heard
of that movie.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.940
Really?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.660
I said.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.220
Yes.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.560
We have a movie night,
every Saturday night.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.760
Last Saturday was "Avatar."
That movie touched me.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.340
It touched me, Jon.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.390
The invasion of the small nation
by the big nation.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.540
I found those blue
people beautiful.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.790
I found a beauty in them.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.730
Are you an emotional man?

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.260
I asked.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.350
I am emotional, he nodded.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.965
By now, I'm thinking I'm wasting
my fucking time.

00:21:20.965 --> 00:21:22.710
I've driven up all the way from
New York, and New York

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.330
state turns out to
be a big state.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.510
And it had taken me, like,
hours to get there.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.230
Then I see him, and he's
obviously not psychopathic.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.490
Oh, shit.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.140
Which I guess is slightly a
callous lack of empathy, which

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.300
is item six.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.470
Anyway, a couple of moments ago,
they chose "The Men Who

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.630
Stare at Goats" movie.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.750
Most of the inmates didn't
know what the

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.990
hell was going on.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.270
They were saying, what's this?

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.520
But I was saying, no, no.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.110
I've met the guy who
wrote the book.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.860
You don't understand
the guy's mind.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.970
And then you wrote to me and
said you wanted to meet again,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.120
and everyone was so jealous.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.650
That's nice, I said.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.060
When I heard you were coming
last week, my hair was a real

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.400
mess, but I wasn't scheduled
to have my hair cut, so

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.620
another inmate said,
you take my slot.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.210
We switched slots at
the barber shop.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.066
And someone else gave me a brand
new green shirt to wear.

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:14.440
Oh, god, I said.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.580
And then he just started to say
to me, you know, I really

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.800
want people to like me.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.400
It's very, very important
that people like me.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.796
It matters a lot to me
that people like me.

00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:30.380
And after a while, I said to
him, isn't that a weakness?

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.130
Your desperate desire to
have people like you,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.530
isn't that a weakness?

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.250
And he said, oh, no.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.910
It's not a weakness, and
I'll tell you why.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.580
If you can get people like you,
you can manipulate them

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.010
to do whatever you
want them to do.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.960
So I said, you don't really
want people to like you.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.920
He goes, oh, no, no, no.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.460
So I left Toto Constant's house
that day feeling like a

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.650
psychopathic-spotting genius.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.670
I had cracked him open with
the word "weakness." And I

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.140
just felt incredibly
proud of myself.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.570
And I was driving back
to New York, and then

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.750
I started to panic.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.900
And my amygdala shot signals
of fear and distrust and

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.260
remorse up and down my central
nervous system, which my

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.530
amygdala does a lot--

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.130
which makes me, by the way, the
neurological opposite of a

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.840
psychopathic.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.390
Their amygdalas under-perform.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.030
And my amygdala was, like,
over-performing.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.450
I was, like, veering across the
road, and I was thinking,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.270
oh my God, what if Toto Constant
reads my book and

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.950
decides to kill me?

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.990
And then I thought, well, that's
not going to happen,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.180
because he's doing 12
to 37 years in jail

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.520
for mortgage fraud.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.840
But what if, like, one of his
friends or relatives decides

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.050
to kill me?

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.110
And I panicked, and
I kind of pulled

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.850
into a drive-in Starbucks.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.050
And I went through my notes, and
I've got to the part where

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.950
he said, I've lost everybody
who ever loved me.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.010
I don't have anybody
left in the world.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.410
Anybody who ever loved me has
betrayed me and gone.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.490
I have nobody left.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.290
And I thought, well,
that's OK, then.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.180
Anyway, I recounted all my
findings to Robert Hare, who

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.310
was unimpressed.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.270
And he said forget about
some Haitian dictator.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.810
Forget about some guy
at Broadmoor.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.360
The big story is corporate
psychopathy.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.660
This is like the world's
biggest story.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.770
And I have to say, back then--
things have slightly changed.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.150
But back then, it was true, what
Robert Hare said, that

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.920
this was like a hugely important
story, but nobody

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.080
was interested.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.600
Nobody cared when he told them
that it was the solution to

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.210
the greatest mysteries of all.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.300
Why the wars?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.490
Why the corruption?

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.480
Why the tax evasion?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.120
While all these terrible
things?

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.450
Corporate psychopaths.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.050
This was Hare's contention,
that psychopathic behavior

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.370
will both propel you to the top
of the tree, because of

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.770
the kind of person it turns you
into, and also, the system

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.860
rewards it.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.460
He said this was an
enormous story.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.810
Why is nobody interested?

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.910
He said, you should get yourself
some corporate

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.510
psychopaths to interview.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.060
And so I tried.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.740
I wrote to Bernie Madoff,
saying, can I come and

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.670
interview you to find out
if you're a psychopath?

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.250
And he didn't write back.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.980
So then I changed tack.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.400
I wrote to "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap,
the famous asset

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.570
stripper from the '90s.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.180
I said, I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.310
that makes you interested
in the

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.240
predatory spirit and fearless.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.060
Can I come and interview
you about your

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.090
special brain anomaly?

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.390
And he said, come on over.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.120
So I went to Al Dunlap's
place.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.180
Al Dunlap, if people don't know,
would go into a failing

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.630
business, fire 30% of the
workforce, always with a quip.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.890
For instance, he once
told somebody--

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.040
somebody once said to him,
I've just bought

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040
myself a new car.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.680
And he said, you may have a
new car, but I'll tell you

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.330
what you don't have-- a job.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.010
Plus, he once threatened his
first wife with a knife, and

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.480
said he always wondered what
human flesh tasted like.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.650
Plus he didn't turn
up to either of

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.580
his parents' funerals.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.480
So I went to his house, which
was filled with sculptures of

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.560
predatory animals.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.950
It was like he was giving me
a tour of the gardens.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.495
It was this grand mansion.

00:25:50.495 --> 00:25:54.100
He was going, over there, you've
got lions and tigers

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.580
and more-- he was saying this
in a less effeminate way.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.665
Tigers and falcons and eagles.

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:03.130
It was like Narnia.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.070
And then we went into his
kitchen, and it was Al and his

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.420
wife Judy, and his
bodyguard Sean.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.280
And I said, you know how I
said in my email that you

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.170
might have a special
brain anomaly?

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:14.740
And he said, yeah, it's
an amazing theory.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.970
It's like "Star Trek."
You're going where no

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.510
man has gone before.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.110
And I said, well, some
psychiatrists would say that

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.580
this makes you [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.290
And he went, what?

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.165
And I said, a psychopath.

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:30.790
And I've got a list in my pocket
of psychopathic traits.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.850
Can I go through
them with you?

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.230
And he looked intrigued,
because what saved me

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.990
was like all of us.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.370
He loved nothing more than a
mental health checklist.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.920
And he said, OK.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.900
So I said, grandiose sense
of self-worth?

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.990
Which I have to say would have
been a hard one for him to

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.130
deny, because he was standing
underneath a giant oil

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.860
painting of himself.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.970
And he said, you've got
to believe in you!

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.020
And I said, shallow affect?

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.670
And he said, who wants to be
weighed down with some

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:58.930
nonsense emotions?

00:26:58.930 --> 00:26:59.620
And I said, manipulative?

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.450
And he said, that's
leadership.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.220
So he basically went through
much of the checklist,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.270
redefining it as business
positives.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.500
But I have to say, something
happened to me the day I was

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.050
at Al Dunlap's, which was
whenever he said something to

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:15.400
me that was non-psychopathic, I
thought, well, I'm not going

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.140
to put that in my book.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.110
So he said no to juvenile
delinquency.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.070
He got accepted to West Point.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.910
He said no to many short-term
marital relationships.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.710
He's only been married twice,
and his second marriage has

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.950
lasted 41 years.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.965
And all of those things.

00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:35.220
I thought, well, I'm not going
to put that in my book.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.320
And then I realized, of course,
that becoming a

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.140
psychopath-spotter had turned me
a little bit psychopathic,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.840
in the way that I was desperate
to shove Al Dunlap

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.390
into a box marked psychopath.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.540
Desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.000
And I mean, I think that's kind
of what we all do is as

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.680
journalists.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.950
As my friend Adam Curtis
said to me, when

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.880
I got back to London--

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.800
he's a British documentary
maker--

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.290
he said, here we travel around
the world with our notepads in

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.160
our hands, and we wait
for the gems.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.780
And the gems are always be
outermost aspects of that

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.890
person's personality.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.250
And we're like medieval monks.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.710
We stitch together the gems and
leave the ordinary, normal

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.030
behavior on the floor.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.290
And those gems are always the
things that would be defined,

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:21.490
within the DSM, as
mental disorders.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.880
And he said, we all know that
what we do is odd--

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.200
and kind of leading to a
nefarious conformity.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.840
But we don't like to
think about it.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.900
What does it say about our
own mental health?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.520
And I think Adam's right.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.440
I think that that is what
we do, as journalists.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.640
And I suppose for the last few
years, I've been trying to do

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.440
the opposite of that.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.390
I've been trying to not define
people by their maddest edges.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.620
And I think it's a good point,
and I'll finish here.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.235
Don't know if anybody wants
to ask me questions.

00:28:53.235 --> 00:28:56.090
And I just think, as the new
DSM's about to come out and

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.550
it's going to be even bigger
than DSM-IV, there's going to

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.590
be even more mental disorders
in there, I think it's

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.850
probably a good time to think
about defining people by their

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.920
gray areas, as opposed to
their maddest edges.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.164
Thank you very much.

00:29:11.164 --> 00:29:16.828
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:16.828 --> 00:29:18.820
JON RONSON: I don't know if
anybody's got any questions.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.820
Hello.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.320
psychopath.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.820
PRESENTER: Please come
to the microphone.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.430
JON RONSON: Oh.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.048
Yes.

00:29:28.048 --> 00:29:30.000
Like that.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.290
PRESENTER: Think about the
psychopathic list.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.330
I wonder if you think, from an
evolutionary perspective, that

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.230
the traits that made somebody a
psychopath was giving them a

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.500
competitive advantage, a
lift through evolution.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.895
And even now, in today's
messed-up society, to use your

00:29:41.895 --> 00:29:43.810
words, if you think that it
still gives them an advantage.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.110
JON RONSON: Yeah.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.780
And that's certainly
what Hare thinks.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.770
And there's a new writer on the
block called Kevin Dutton.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.807
He's just brought out a book
called "The Wisdom of

00:29:51.807 --> 00:29:53.140
Psychopaths." So he
believes that.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.280
In fact, Kevin Dutton
would say that and

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.260
would go one step further--

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.940
and it's not a step that
I would take--

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.110
which is that it's actually, we
can learn from psychopaths.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.920
It's good.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.940
We can learn coolness
under pressure.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.300
So not only is it evolutionary,
but it actually

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.560
could be considered
to be positive.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.450
Which is something I don't buy,
because I think if you

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.960
don't have empathy, if empathy
just literally is absent from

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.600
your brain, what would always
grow in the barren landscape

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.080
is, you know, malevolence, is
this is the other items on the

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.290
checklists, and always
malevolent.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.840
And an Army recruiter
once told me--

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.930
it's a very popular belief
that capitalism rewards

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.280
psychopathic behavior.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.470
And I think that is true
to a certain extent.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.570
I think it's true in the kind
of industries where a

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.890
short-term kill is beneficial,
like hedge funds, you could

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:49.160
say, or fucking health
insurance industry.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.130
And so on--

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:50.690
journalism.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.980
But I think in businesses where,
actually, the long term

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.100
is important, it's never
going to work out.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.610
There's always going to
be a transgression.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.820
It's always going to chaos.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.820
And an Army recruiter said to
me, contrary to what certain

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.875
people believe, we don't want
psychopaths in our battalions.

00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:11.740
It's the last thing we want,
because they make terrible

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.900
team players.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.840
Hi.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.360
JON RONSON: Thank you
for having me.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.490
And I think for [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.917
I feel like Ray Kurzweil.

00:31:19.917 --> 00:31:21.050
AUDIENCE: What's that?

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.090
JON RONSON: Nothing.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.910
It's OK.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.850
AUDIENCE: So, question.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.650
How young do children
start to exhibit

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.620
some of these qualities?

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.850
And are there tests that are
specifically geared for them?

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.130
JON RONSON: There's actually
camps. "The New York Times"

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.930
did this incredible piece, a few
months ago, about summer

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.820
camps for psychopathic
children.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.920
Because the fact is, one of the
items on the checklist is

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.730
early behavior problems.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.690
And the behavior tends
to manifest

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.530
itself from the ages--

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.560
almost always, actually.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.540
This surprised me, when I asked
Robert Hare about this.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.530
He said this was
like a big one.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.830
Between the ages of 8 and 10.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.170
And that's obviously an age when
you're thinking about PR,

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.370
and you're not thinking about
your career, so you will

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.880
display these characteristics
in a pretty open way.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.520
And it's either 8 and
10 or 10 and 12.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.952
I think it might be 10
and 12, actually.

00:32:16.952 --> 00:32:19.262
I think I've got that wrong.

00:32:19.262 --> 00:32:22.650
Al Dunlap's saying that he had
no early behavior problems,

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.000
and if he'd got accepted into
West Point, that proves it,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.610
shows that he's actually not, as
much as we all want him to

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.250
be, a classic psychopath.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.720
So yes, between the ages of--

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.040
it's either 8 and
10 or 10 and 12.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.630
I can't remember.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.260
And there's an incredible "New
York Times" piece, which if

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.080
anybody wants to read more
about the possibility of

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.002
psychopathic children, I would
recommend you read that.

00:32:48.002 --> 00:32:50.810
Thanks.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.460
Hey.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.140
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.550
So your stories are just
awesomely random.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.815
I was wondering how you choose
stories, and also, how often

00:32:57.815 --> 00:32:59.970
you choose ones that
don't go anywhere?

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.340
JON RONSON: Well,
I mean, often.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.770
And I find it--

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.230
very hard to--

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.015
you spend months and months on
Google looking for the page

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:14.790
that nobody else has ever
found, for the story.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.430
And quite often.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:21.560
The most depressing one that
went nowhere, actually, was I

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.580
was going to write a book about
the credit industry.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.670
I had a prophetic sense that it
was all going to collapse.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.030
Because I wrote the piece in
"Lost At Sea," which is my new

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.120
collection-- which
is available for

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.150
sale just over here.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.895
I wrote a piece called "Who
Killed Richard Cullen?" about

00:33:37.895 --> 00:33:39.700
a man who committed suicide
because he was out of his

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.300
depth with credit cards.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.120
And people kept on saying
to me, you know, this

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.790
is a house of cards.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.620
This isn't going to last.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.100
And I became obsessed with
writing a book about the

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.220
credit industry.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.470
And I spent months and months
on it, and I failed.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.690
And the reason why I failed,
the terrible truth, is that

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.590
the people who I met, the people
who were coming up with

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.560
the tricks to keep
people enslaved--

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.960
the terrible stuff
they were doing.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.140
The late fees--

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.460
they were boring people, and
I couldn't make them

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.590
light up the page.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.100
And I'd go and meet them, and
nothing exciting would happen.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.520
And I say, in fact, in "The
Psychopathic Test," if you

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.090
want to get away with
wielding true

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.820
malevolent power, be boring.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.580
Because journalists like
writing about colorful,

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.650
engaging people.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.940
It makes us look good.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.909
So don't like Blofeld, all
monochord and ostentatious.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.000
Be boring.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.659
And then the next thing,
I suppose, is--

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.355
OK, you've got a mystery
to solve.

00:34:37.355 --> 00:34:40.210
And I like to think my books
always start with a mystery.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.250
And the mystery in "The
Psychopath Test," I suppose

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:42.980
there was a few of them.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.880
One of them was, is it true,
what psychiatrists say, that

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.440
psychopaths rule the world?

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.199
Is that true?

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.320
It's a huge thing to say, and
it almost sounds like a

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.780
conspiracy theory.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.090
Yet the people who say these
things are eminent.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.470
And so that's the mystery
that you leap into.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.490
And then you have to be
completely open to wherever

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.930
the story takes you.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:06.340
So in the book I'm writing now,
the opening mystery is,

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.660
why do court experts get it
wrong far more often than

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.430
other sorts of scientists?

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.920
And that's the mystery that's
leading me into a whole bunch

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.270
of incredibly interesting
areas, I think.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.560
And yeah, you have to be open.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:28.415
Not polemical, just open to
wherever the story takes you.

00:35:28.415 --> 00:35:28.858
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:28.858 --> 00:35:29.750
JON RONSON: Hi.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.550
JON RONSON: Thank you.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:37.190
AUDIENCE: So the thing I
wonder-- you gave an example

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.190
while talking about
your book--

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:44.070
is talking to these people and
confronting them about this

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.960
classification of
their behavior.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.650
I think if I were to do that,
I would panic, like you did

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:59.200
coming down from upstate
New York, every time.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.490
So how, as a person with
generalized anxiety disorder,

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.410
how did you manage to do that?

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.640
JON RONSON: Well, you know what
I think the answer is?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.980
And this is true for
people I know--

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.520
I've got loved ones
who have OCD.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.740
And I think it's absolutely
the same.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.610
The weird truth of it is-- and
I'm sure this isn't true for

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.530
everybody, with any kind of
anxiety disorder, but I think

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.750
it's true for a lot
of people--

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.450
which is that the anxiety always
manifests itself in

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.380
completely irrational ways.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.910
And in real life frightening
situations, just

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.750
like everyone else.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.120
You know, you analyze--

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.520
what risk am I actually
in, here?

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.872
And work it out, in a kind of
completely rational way.

00:36:39.872 --> 00:36:43.620
But you can't let your bloody
dog off the leash in Central

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.520
Park because of an irrational
fear it's

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.440
going to get run over.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.850
So that's the truth of it.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.680
It's that anxiety disorders tend
to manifest themselves in

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.110
irrational ways that don't
actually have any resemblance

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.210
to reality.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.120
And when you're in genuine
anxiety-inducing situations,

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.350
you're fine.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.615
Don't ask me why, but that
seems to be the case.

00:37:04.615 --> 00:37:07.480
AUDIENCE: And I've also been
asked to ask if you know if

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.730
Tony's still in Broadmoor.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.430
JON RONSON: Well, OK.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.040
I--

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.710
I--

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.550
is "The Psychopath Test" for
sale up there, or is it just

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.290
"Lost at Sea?"

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.010
PRESENTER: Just "Lost at Sea."

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:15.320
JON RONSON: OK.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.845
In that case, does anybody mind
if I sort of give away

00:37:17.845 --> 00:37:19.690
what happened to Tony?

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:24.130
The book's still fine anyway,
even if you know the ending.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:25.380
OK.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:31.500
Tony called me, and
for a while, I

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.790
didn't take his calls.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.450
Because frankly I found
the label terrifying.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.590
And then after a while,
I took his calls.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:42.680
And he said, you know why
you've been calling me?

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.140
And I said, because they said
that you're a psychopath.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.380
And he said, look, I'm
not a psychopath.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.435
And he said, trying to prove
you're not a psychopath is

00:37:49.435 --> 00:37:51.270
even harder than trying to prove
you're not mentally ill,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.050
because one of the items on
the checklist is lack of

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.970
remorse, and another one is
cunning, manipulative.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.360
So when I say I feel terrible
remorse for what I did, they

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.850
say typical of a psychopathic
to cunningly say they feel

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.110
remorse, when they don't.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.440
He said it's like witchcraft.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.240
They turn everything
upside down.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.230
And he said, anyway, I've
got a tribunal.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.060
And it actually was partly do
with me, I have to say,

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.370
because before my book was
published, I told Tony's story

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.580
on "This American Life," and
it had a bit of an impact.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.280
And Tony sent it to various
lawyers and got himself a

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.840
tribunal, in part, I think,
because of the publicity

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.590
because of "This
American Life."

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.000
And he got a tribunal.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.550
And in the tribunal,
they let him go.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.560
He'd been in Broadmoor
for 14 years by then.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.030
12 years in Broadmoor, two years
at the Maudsley, which

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.270
is a similar place.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:48.215
And they let him go because they
said that you shouldn't

00:38:48.215 --> 00:38:51.060
be locked up for the rest of
your life because you score

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.100
highly on a checklist
that would imply a

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.800
greater-than-average
recidivism rate.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.830
It's almost kind of Orwellian.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:04.340
And out in the corridor, Tony
came up to me, and he said,

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.560
you've got to realize, Jon, that
everybody's a little bit

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.770
psychopathic.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.006
He said, you are, I am--
well, obviously, I am.

00:39:12.006 --> 00:39:13.780
And I said, what are you
going to do now?

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.910
He said, there's this
woman in Belgium I

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.940
fancy, but she's married.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.910
And I'm going to have to get her
split up from her husband.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.935
But you know what they say
about us psychopaths.

00:39:22.935 --> 00:39:24.450
We are manipulative.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.970
And then he disappeared off
into the British night.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:34.140
And everything was fine
for about six months.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.530
Brian, the Scientologist, would
give me updates, and he

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.190
was making up for lost time.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.150
Which I know sounds
ominous, but

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.180
wasn't necessarily ominous.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.410
That he got into a bar fight
and ended up going

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.580
to jail for a month.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:52.330
As part of the release, part of
the probation, he couldn't

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.180
go back to the mental
hospital.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.280
He had to be treated by
the prison system.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.930
And by the way, the unit he was
in closed down, because

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.790
the government actually began
to think the same thoughts

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.960
about the DSPD unit.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.070
So the unit closed down.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.090
So he went to jail
for a month.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.930
Then he came out.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.220
And that's the last I heard
until about two weeks ago,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.560
when I got a tweet from somebody
in a bookstore, who

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.110
said that somebody in the
bookstore had said that he was

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.280
one of Tony's care workers,
and they'd got

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.650
talking about it.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.640
He was back in prison.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.690
So I looked him up--

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.330
I'm one of the few people who
know his actual name.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:39.800
And sure enough, he had racially
assaulted a station

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.220
guard somewhere just outside
London, and had gone back to

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.740
prison for--

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.130
I don't know how long.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:47.510
I think maybe a few months.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.920
And that's the last
I've heard.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.050
So it's not a happy ending.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.750
Which by the way--
let me just say.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.540
It then begs the question,
well, is it right

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.670
that Tony was out?

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:04.370
And it's a very difficult
question, but I still think,

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.640
yes, it was, for all the
obvious reasons.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.630
AUDIENCE: It seems like there's
sort of a movement

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.900
towards thinking that people who
have mental disorders that

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.500
have, you know, psychopathy or
things like that, should be

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.560
treated as criminals or
dangerous and locked up.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.200
What do you think about that?

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.030
JON RONSON: Well, this
is the big thing.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.370
And it's a huge thing in
America at the moment.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.850
There's these places
for pedophiles.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:33.240
There's one in Los Angeles
called Coalinga, where the day

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.530
somebody's done their time and
is released from jail, they

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.480
immediately get sent to
Coalinga, and they're locked

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.240
up, kind of, for the rest
of their lives.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.010
Because once you're in
that nexus, it's

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.460
impossible to get out.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.660
And there was a story in "The
Los Angeles Times" where one

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.980
of the doctors at Coalinga has
said a huge percentage of the

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.780
people there shouldn't
be there.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.880
And Robert Hare said that the
people who determine who is

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.950
and isn't a psychopathic on
behalf of Coalinga, he said he

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.420
teaches them, and they're just
picking their nails, and

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.730
they're doodling.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.510
And they're going to go off and
kind of have a huge effect

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.460
on people's lives.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.700
So on balance, even though
there's no question that

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.660
psychopaths exist, and there's
no question that they're

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.370
incredibly problematic, and
that they'll reoffend and

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:23.410
reoffend and reoffend, it's
still really hard, it's still

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.670
a real problem to think, well,
OK, lock them up for the rest

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.610
of their lives.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.080
It feels wrong, right?

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.920
So I feel that you just have
to take your chances.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.510
Lock them up for the amount of
time that each individual

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.730
crime deserved, because the
alternative is worse.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.050
But you know, I mean,
what do I know?

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:46.520
This is like three, four years
of my life, and that's the

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.100
conclusion I came to.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.170
But it's not an easy topic.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.050
Please can we not end on that?

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.955
JON RONSON: Maybe we
can end on that.

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:04.730
I've been told I can see rooms
at Google that people don't

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.730
get to go to, so that's
exciting.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.600
JON RONSON: Sorry?

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.260
AUDIENCE: The ones with
padded walls.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.410
JON RONSON: Right.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.770
The ones with the padded walls.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:13.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:15.600
JON RONSON: When I was at TED,
I feel like Scooter.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.250
I was in the elevator, coming
up, and talking about going

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.840
when I was at TED.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.510
But when I was at TED, there was
this kind of lady who runs

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.690
DARPA, and she kind of
released her killer

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.360
hummingbird.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.440
And everyone was kind of wowed,
and then they're, oh my

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.900
God, this hummingbird
can just kill.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.170
And now she's a bigwig
at Google.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:38.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.810
AUDIENCE: We can't comment
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:42.790
hummingbirds.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:47.461
So there's a suggestion that 1%
of people are psychopaths.

00:43:47.461 --> 00:43:49.766
Have they done a big enough
population sampling for that

00:43:49.766 --> 00:43:51.050
to be reasonable?

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.310
JON RONSON: I've got to say,
this is completely subjective.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.180
Hare is absolutely adamant
that that's

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.110
the percentage, 1%.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:02.530
And Hare is like a very
respected, eminent person.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.060
I've always thought
that sounds a bit

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.580
high, I have to say.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.550
AUDIENCE: The thing is, if it
skews, I don't know, white,

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.430
and it skews male,
and it basically

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.530
skews living in America--

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.980
AUDIENCE: Those numbers
seem atomically high.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.660
If it's 1%, and you're
up at 5% of all--

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.410
JON RONSON: CEOs.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.890
It seems high, I've
got to tell you.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.345
I mean, Hare is very--

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.750
he is cautious.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.090
I mean, I did have my slight
issues with him.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.480
There was this time-- and
I put this in the book--

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.940
when I met him at a
hotel in Heathrow.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.040
And I was looking for
him everywhere.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.740
It was late at night.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.700
I couldn't find him.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.550
We arranged to meet.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.970
And I decided to go to the
concierge desk to phone his

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.240
room, because the queue was
so long at the desk.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.160
And so I went to the concierge's
phone and pressed

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.010
0 to get through to
the operator.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.080
And the concierge was kind of
storming toward me, going, put

00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.710
down my phone!

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.820
And I said-- and he grabbed the
phone and slammed it down.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.980
And then I met Robert Hare,
and I said, you wouldn't

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.630
believe what just happened.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.690
The concierge just grabbed the
phone off me, and it was quite

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.310
frightening.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:13.322
And Robert Hare said, well,
that's because he's one.

00:45:13.322 --> 00:45:14.246
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:14.246 --> 00:45:15.632
And I said, really?

00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:18.310
And he said, you should
put that in your book.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.480
And I said, I will.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.760
So I mean, I agree.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.210
This is something I don't say
very often, because I have a

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.700
lot of respect for Robert
Hare, and I really do.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.170
And I think his checklist
is onto something.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:35.065
But I've always thought
1% seems high.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.315
Yeah.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:38.970
OK.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.990
Well, look, well, thank you.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.760
Thank you very much indeed.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.960
And happy Christmas.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.078
[APPLAUSE]
