00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.830
- Your weapons will now be piut
through a series

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.880
of three tests.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.040
Up first, kill test.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.290
Doug?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.670
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.210
I'll take your
[inaudible] design

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.710
and deliver thrusts and
slashes on this deer carcass.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.540
Nick, you're up
first, you ready?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.330
Guess so.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.620
Let's do this.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.040
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040
I'm just excited to see
what's gonna happen.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.710
I'm hoping this is the
only big, dead animal

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.750
I have to deal with today.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080
[intense music]

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.920
First up.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.540
Right here on your edge,
it picked up a chip.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.080
On the other side of
this, you can feel

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.210
where the edge also rolled.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.580
But, this weapon is sharp.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.170
On the initial thrust,
it's got a geometry

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.710
right there to penetrate
deep into the carcass.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.250
Your edge right here--

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.210
on slashing, it lacerated
easily on the side

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.960
of this deer carcass.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.880
On the third cut, the weight
of this weapon is so balanced.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.620
It's easy to lacerate
all the way through.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.790
Your weapon will kill.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.120
Thank you.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
All right, Alex, your turn.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.580
His seems to do really well.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.250
It stabs right through,
it slashes real nicely,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.210
so I'm excited to
see what mine does.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.080
And like, a little bit,
like, throw-y up-y like,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.750
to right there.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.580
[intense music]

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.120
All right, Alex.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.790
Your tip is sharp enough to
lacerate all the way through.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.830
On the slash of this edge, it's
lacerated easily on the side

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.790
rib of this particular carcass.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.290
On the wide swing, it did
break half of the spine off.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.620
It is, as you can see, a
little bit on the wider side.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.750
And with the heavy
weapon like this,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.330
a wide handle can make
it hard to control.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.420
But the most important
thing, it will kill.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.920
Thank you.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.500
All right, gentlemen,
it's time for the strength

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.830
test the pike chop.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080
That was intense.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.750
I wasn't ready for that.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.830
So to test the strength and
durability of your weapons,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.710
including the hook on
the back, I'll be pushing

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.120
these pikes up into
position then chopping

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.460
at them with the blades.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.880
All right Nick, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.460
Yes, sir.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.790
[intense music]

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.380
(WHISPERING) I'd say
that's pretty good.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.880
All right.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.170
So, Nick, it doesn't look
like your weapon took

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.880
any more damage to the edge.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.120
The weight of your blade
is very nicely balanced.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.290
The good design--
definitely a strong blade.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.040
Nicely done.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.170
Thank you.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.460
Alex, you ready?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.830
Yes, sir.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm in and out of "I
think I got this" too "I

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420
have no idea what's
going to happen" so, I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.580
still feel I got a good shot.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.500
I think I'm still
in the running.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.420
(WHISPERING) Kick ass.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.210
Don't break it.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.830
Be nice.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.210
[intense music]

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.420
That was brutal, dude.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.500
First off, your blade
did take some damage, here.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.000
There are very small
chips and rolls.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.040
Your flanges here
are just wide enough

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.420
that when I pushed
forward, I managed

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.580
to grab two rows
of pikes and pushed

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.040
them back at the same time.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.290
Balance is nice on it.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.040
The shaft is pretty wide.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.250
It's not too big, but it's right
on the outside edge of what's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.580
comfortable for my hand.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.080
But everything held
up, everything's solid.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.620
Thank you.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.960
Because Alex's blade
picked a couple of chips up,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.460
we're really even closer
to even at this point.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.960
Nick.
Alex.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.540
You've both done an
incredible amount of work

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.210
on your finale weapons.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.290
However, there can only be
one "Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.420
And that champion is--

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
[tense music]

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.290
Nick.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.380
Congratulations, you are our
next "Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.710
Alex, unfortunately your
weapon didn't make the cut.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.880
David Baker's gonna
to tell you why.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.330
Alex, you both brought
us beautiful weapons.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.080
Both your weapons took damage.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.960
Really came down to that large
handle and the forward weight,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.620
and it's that final point
that sending you home.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.580
Alex, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.830
So, the final judgment.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.580
I am not the "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.830
It was definitely a long
road to get all the way here,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.000
and it is disappointing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.500
But Nick won.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.580
He absolutely killed it.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.670
He made a great weapon.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.830
I'm super happy for him.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.580
It was a tight race, so.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
It's been a fun experience, but
it's since back to work now.
