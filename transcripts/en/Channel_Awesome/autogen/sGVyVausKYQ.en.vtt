00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.050
there there's some bad dreams uh that
can be a little creepy uh and and good

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
can be a little creepy uh and and good
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.170
can be a little creepy uh and and good
acting and good pacing and stuff like

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
acting and good pacing and stuff like
 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.430
acting and good pacing and stuff like
that but uh but this didn't really grab

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
that but uh but this didn't really grab
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.860
that but uh but this didn't really grab
me that much because even the characters

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
me that much because even the characters
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.199
me that much because even the characters
are not bad and the actors are not bad

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209
are not bad and the actors are not bad
 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.439
are not bad and the actors are not bad
but it's not really told in a way that's

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449
but it's not really told in a way that's
 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.170
but it's not really told in a way that's
like maybe because there are no real

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
like maybe because there are no real
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.939
like maybe because there are no real
super surprises in it I mean I know I'm

super surprises in it I mean I know I'm
not saying much and that's one of the

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
not saying much and that's one of the
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.430
not saying much and that's one of the
reasons of nothing that much because

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
reasons of nothing that much because
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.099

far the terrorist side and plus just the
 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.400
far the terrorist side and plus just the
simplicity of him there's a snake

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410
simplicity of him there's a snake
 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.440

delegates in the box and everything and

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450
delegates in the box and everything and
 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.909

it was trying to fight off the snake and

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919
it was trying to fight off the snake and
 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.740
it was trying to fight off the snake and
everything is will people get there in

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750
everything is will people get there in
 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.810
everything is will people get there in
time and I felt like that was such an

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820
time and I felt like that was such an
 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.440
time and I felt like that was such an
interesting new kind of idea but it

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450
interesting new kind of idea but it
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.029
interesting new kind of idea but it
really is just another survival quick

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039
really is just another survival quick
 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.620
really is just another survival quick
and I'm thinking this is a survival

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
and I'm thinking this is a survival
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.870
and I'm thinking this is a survival
quick to and just telling nothing really

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880
quick to and just telling nothing really
 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.730
quick to and just telling nothing really
that new was added if anything it felt

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740
that new was added if anything it felt
 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.540
that new was added if anything it felt
like a lot was taken away and the only

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550
like a lot was taken away and the only
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.580
like a lot was taken away and the only
thing I can figure is that maybe the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590
thing I can figure is that maybe the
 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.510
thing I can figure is that maybe the
idea is that by taking those elements

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520
idea is that by taking those elements
 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.600
idea is that by taking those elements
away kind of like you know the zombies

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610
away kind of like you know the zombies
 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.580
away kind of like you know the zombies
and the chase you know and stuff like

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590
and the chase you know and stuff like
 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.730
and the chase you know and stuff like
that you know and only focusing on the

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740
that you know and only focusing on the
 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.790
that you know and only focusing on the
people maybe it's just somebody wanted

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800
people maybe it's just somebody wanted
 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.930
people maybe it's just somebody wanted
to see a film where it's like oh I

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940
to see a film where it's like oh I
 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.219
to see a film where it's like oh I
really want to film about the people

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229
really want to film about the people
 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.440
really want to film about the people
that's not about the zombies even though

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450
that's not about the zombies even though
 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.820
that's not about the zombies even though
those films are really

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
those films are really
 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.110
those films are really
about the people it's never about the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120
about the people it's never about the
 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.840
about the people it's never about the
zombies uh so I feel like that's already

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
zombies uh so I feel like that's already
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.340
zombies uh so I feel like that's already
being done it's just now we know the

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350
being done it's just now we know the
 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.870
being done it's just now we know the
zombies so it's the only other thing I

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880
zombies so it's the only other thing I
 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.460
zombies so it's the only other thing I
can figure is that because there's two

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
can figure is that because there's two
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.900
can figure is that because there's two
interesting things happening in this

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910
interesting things happening in this
 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.390
interesting things happening in this
movie uh when I was watching it one is

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400
movie uh when I was watching it one is
 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.220
movie uh when I was watching it one is
that everything is kind of has this

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230
that everything is kind of has this
 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.810
that everything is kind of has this
impending doom about it and again

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820
impending doom about it and again
 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.520
impending doom about it and again
without giving too much away I mean that

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530
without giving too much away I mean that
 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.320
without giving too much away I mean that
a lot of movies have that but this one

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330
a lot of movies have that but this one
 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.030
a lot of movies have that but this one
especially can't have this impending

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040
especially can't have this impending
 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.190
especially can't have this impending
doom aspect so maybe that's kind of the

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200
doom aspect so maybe that's kind of the
 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.210
doom aspect so maybe that's kind of the
idea it's just watching you know people

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220
idea it's just watching you know people
 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.710
idea it's just watching you know people
sort of in this inevitable situation and

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720
sort of in this inevitable situation and
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.830
sort of in this inevitable situation and
what they do maybe but I just feel like

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840
what they do maybe but I just feel like
 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.870
what they do maybe but I just feel like
that's not that interesting or not it's

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880
that's not that interesting or not it's
 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.380
that's not that interesting or not it's
not not interesting as it could be uh

not not interesting as it could be uh
 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.690
not not interesting as it could be uh
and maybe that's because like even the

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.920
was a contrast you know maybe we could
see what they were like beforehand you

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930

that's interesting and then after
another cut they'll be a little closer

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940
another cut they'll be a little closer
 

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.960
