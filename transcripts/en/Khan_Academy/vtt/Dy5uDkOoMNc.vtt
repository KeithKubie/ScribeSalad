00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.567
- [Voiceover] So in the number 23,

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.370
we have a two in the 10's place.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.567
So, that two literally represents two 10s.

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:10.062
And we see it right over here.

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:12.971
We have two groups of 10 blocks.

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.951
This is a 10 and this is a 10.

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.696
So this two literally represents two 10s.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.762
One 10 and two 10s.

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.475
Now this three is in the one's place,

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:27.167
and it represents three ones.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:28.634
We can see them right over here.

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.820
One, two, three blocks.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.128
And of course, if you had three
ones together with two 10s.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:36.716
These two 10s, represent 20,

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:40.722
and these three ones represent
three, so you get 23.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.165
So, let's write that down.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.318
So we can write down the 23.

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:50.050
23 is equal to two 10s,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.534
two 10s plus three ones,

00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:59.433
plus three, three ones.

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:03.905
Now what would happen if I added 20 to 23.

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.057
Let me do that, so let's say...

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:08.122
Actually let me do
something more interesting.

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:12.148
Let's say we take 23,

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:15.100
and to that we add 30.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.967
So, let's add, let's add 30.

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:24.567
Three zero, three zero.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.680
So, what is this going to be?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.672
Well, I start with 23, which
I have represented here,

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:31.061
and I'm going to add 30.

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.502
30 has a three in the 10's place,

00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:36.145
so it literally means I'm
going to add three 10s

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:37.895
and I'm going to add zero ones.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:39.886
So, let me add those three 10s.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:44.228
So, that's one 10...

00:01:44.228 --> 00:01:48.734
this is two 10s...

00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:53.883
and then that is three 10s.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.800
So I've added one, two and three 10s here.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:02.467
So now, now,

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.333
how many 10s do I have?

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:10.366
Well, I now have one, two,
three, four, five 10s.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.531
Now notice, two 10s plus three
10s is equal to five 10s.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.300
So now I have five 10s.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.371
And how many ones do I have?

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.023
Well, I still have those three ones,

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:24.252
and you can think of it this way,

00:02:24.252 --> 00:02:29.036
three ones plus zero ones is
still going to be three ones.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:30.979
Three ones.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.640
So, what's 23, what's
23 plus 30 going to be?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.640
Let me rewrite it, 23 plus 30,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.571
is going to be equal to, well, five 10s,

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:51.875
we can just write that as
a five in the 10's place,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.723
represents five 10s, or 50,

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.405
and then we're going to have three ones.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:57.721
Whoops, let me do that in a different,

00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.205
in the ones color, in that orange color.

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:02.359
Is the three ones.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.559
So, 23 plus 30 is 53.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.907
You have two 10s plus three
10s, give you five 10s,

00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:13.907
three ones plus zero ones
is equal to three ones.
