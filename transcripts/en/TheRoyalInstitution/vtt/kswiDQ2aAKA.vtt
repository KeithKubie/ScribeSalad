00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.490
The coldest place in the universe

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.290
is the Boomerang Nebula
in the Centaurus constellation.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.900
At -272 C, or 1 K,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.320
it is only a single degree
above absolute zero.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.220
Here on Earth scientists have been
able to get even colder than that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.410
by using lasers to cool individual
molecules of sodium and potassium

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.110
to 500 nano Kelvins.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.690
But even they couldn't get
to absolute zero.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.680
The third law of thermodynamics
defines what absolute zero is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.800
and ties together the concepts
of entropy and temperature.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.960
It states that the entropy of
a perfect crystal approaches zero

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.170
at a temperature of absolute zero.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.030
An important idea to note is that absolute
zero

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.149
may not be able to be achieved experimentally.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020
This is because we know from
the second law of thermodynamics

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.890
that heat will spontaneously move
from a warmer body to a cooler body.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.390
So the object that you are
trying to cool to absolute zero

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.630
will be taking in heat from its surroundings.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.729
Despite this, absolute zero is
an important theoretical concept.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.959
The lowest possible entropy
can only occur in a perfect crystal

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.459
which is a structure where all
of the atoms that form it are identical

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.890
and positioned in
perfectly symmetrical ways.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.289
Any imperfections in the crystal carry an
energy,

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.940
so the entropy won't be minimised.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.700
Equally any residual thermal energy within
the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.539
crystal will create thermal motion within
it

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.610
and again, your entropy won't be at a minimum.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.330
Conversely that means that if we
can't get to absolute zero,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.690
then nothing in the universe
is going to be completely still

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.729
as we'll always have some
motion due to thermal energy.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.250
One of the earliest forays into low temperature
research was made by James Dewar

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.230
who was the first person who was able
to liquify and then solidify hydrogen gas.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.670
This reached a then record low temperature
of 13 degrees above absolute zero

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.080
at which point he postulated: "there
or thereabouts our progress is barred".

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440
Nearly a decade later Prussian scientist
Walther Nernst announced his heat theorem

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.670
which would later become known
as the third law of thermodynamics.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.510
This can be exploited when storing and using
gases.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.000
For example, carbon dioxide as a gas
has a high entropy and a relatively high temperature.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.590
We can reduce both by solidifying CO2
into a snow like consistency.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.780
By releasing the pressure, some of the
liquid carbon dioxide vaporises

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.700
and causes a rapid temperature drop
and this extreme cold makes the substance

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700
solidify.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.180
I have made dry ice.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.900
Similarly to the zeroth law, the third law
of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.060
thermodynamics may seem simple and obvious,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.740
however it is the final piece of the puzzle
which

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.840
helps us to explain our world

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.750
and the nature of its heat and energy.
