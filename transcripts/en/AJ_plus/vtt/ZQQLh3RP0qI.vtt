00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.350
There's a small group of refugees who

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.019
have made it to the U.S. and are

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.250
rebuilding their lives in this corner of

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.039
Chicago. They are the Rohingya.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.130
Their community has been fleeing genocide in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.340
Myanmar for years, in a crisis that has

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.769
displaced close to a million people.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.699
The Burmese government burn down my village,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.560
my house. They're killing our villagers.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.620
Abdul Samad is a 26-year-old Rohingya refugee

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.480
who calls West Rogers Park home,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.899
after moving to Illinois in 2014. I'm not

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.469
a citizen of any country. [I’m] gonna be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.719
[a first-time] citizen in [the] United States.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:56.340
But what does the future look like for refugees like

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.800
him in President Trump's America? My name

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
is Abdul Samad. I work in a hotel [in]

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600
downtown Chicago. When I [first arrived]

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
in the United States, in Chicago,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
when I see these like huge buildings

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.780
and big city, I feel so happy.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.360
I’m so excited. It’s a really beautiful city.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.369
So I love Chicago.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.680
[Music]

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.880
The Michigan Lake is frozen because of the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.939
winter season. I want to be a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.509
community leader for the Rohingya

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.159
people in Chicago. I want to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.900
help my people here who [have arrived]

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.090
in Chicago. In his spare time Abdul Samad

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.150
volunteers at the Rohingya Cultural Center,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.729
where he's a board member.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.500
Opened in April 2016 with charity

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.810
funding, the center has become a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.570
cornerstone of a new community with

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
growing needs. From translation and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
gifting winter coats to English classes

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.680
and helping with paperwork, this center

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.920
is a lifeline for new refugees.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.759
This is Rakhine state, this is Sittwe. I was born in Sittwe.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.009
[The center] is a very important for us

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.709
because we can meet. You know,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.620
everybody comes here,

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.900
it’s like a village. Also this is one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.200
of the platforms for our people.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.780
When I bring my wife here,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.510
my son here, they see [what the]

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.930
Rohingya look like, what’s our culture.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.830
How do we talk,  

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.830
how do we eat? 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.640
Abdul Samad coaches the center's youth

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.970
soccer team on Saturdays. When I was in Burma,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.120
I didn’t get this opportunity like here, 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.030
so I always wanted to play, like for the school, 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.300
for the university, for the state, but

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.350
we’re not allowed because I'm a Rohingya Muslim.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.680
Today, we lost by 8-5. 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.080
But still, my players did good. Yea, it’s not bad.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.200
This soccer team’s not only for fun,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.780
but you know, I want to [teach them

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.360
teamwork], how [to be a] team player

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.550
and teach [them] unity.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.260
I love soccer. Chicago has become a haven

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.489
to one of the largest Rohingya refugee

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.150
populations in the U.S. Around 1,500 have

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.150
resettled here. Chicago is like really, really

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.959
good for the Rohingya community

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.450
because we can help each other and we

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.579
can meet easily and we have so many

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.980
halal food markets here. And tucked among

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.560
the saree shops and curry houses in West

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.870
Devon Avenue, is the Shwe Myanmar

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.900
grocery store. It's where Abdul Samad

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.950
goes to buy some home comforts. This is,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.070
you know, a special spice mix. So when we

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.829
call our Rohingya food, Burmese food, we

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.410
have to have this. This store is very

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.750
important for us, for our Rohingya refugee

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.299
family in Chicago. Because whatever we

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.880
need, whatever we want, the foods, everything

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.250
is in this store. So, you know, all time we

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.230
can meet each other in this store.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.900
[Music]

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:26.360
This is West Devon, where I met 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.330
my wife [for the] first time. In this bus stop. I’m so

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.730
lucky, I saw her when she was waiting [at the]

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:38.450
bus stop. And then after one year, we

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:40.160
got married. Abdul Samad married his wife

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.280
in 2016.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.300
she's also a Rohingya refugee. This is my

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.270
son, Abdul Azim. He was born in Chicago, he

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.670
is a one year old. And this is my wife,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.880
Bibi Zainab. He was born in Chicago 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:04.340
but he's like Rohingya American. This is 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:08.990
coconut with sugar. When we make

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:13.190
this food here, I remember my village,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.740
my mom, my family. I think I realized that

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.720
we have to keep our culture, we have to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.180
keep our traditional foods, so this is

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.150
really important for us. I want to pass

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.910
on my generation [to] my son. So you do not

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.360
forget where you from, and then where

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.600
your parents are from. I was born in Burma, my father

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.970
was born in also Burma in Rakhine state,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.460
Site, so [was] my grandfather, my

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.040
great-grandfather. In 2012, the Burmese

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.460
government burned down my village, my

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.620
house. They burned not only house, they 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.900
burned but not only village. They burned

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.140
everything - my dream. They burned my

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.710
education, they burned my future. I was a

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:01.490
university student. So the after that, I

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.980
[fled]. Abdul Samad took a 10-day boat

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.960
journey to Thailand, where he says he was

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.750
detained by Thailand border police for

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.210
20 days. He was then able to make it to

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.370
Malaysia with the help of smugglers. But

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.260
the journey was treacherous, crossing

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.230
mountains and jungle on foot.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.480
I left from Burma, but my family is

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.510
still there. I still worry about my

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.220
people. I can't sleep sometimes [at] night

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:33.210
[from nightmares], because I saw so many

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:36.660
people get killed by the Burmese

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.500
government. I'm not a citizen of any

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.800
country. [I’m] gonna be [a first-time] citizen in [the United 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:47.820
States]. [That] we can meet again is my hope, 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:51.450
is my dream. Also, I hope I can meet

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.580
[my family] in Chicago. The number of

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.050
refugees entering the U.S. has dropped

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.690
dramatically under the Trump

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.440
administration. The yearly cap on

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:05.130
refugees fell 65% between 2016

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:09.840
and 2019. And those caps aren't always

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:13.080
met. In 2018 only half the 45,000

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.880
person cap was reached. And such

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.090
policies have hit refugee resettlement

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.580
agencies across the U.S. As the number of

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.520
refugees who can be resettled drops, so

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.460
does the amount of federal funding. In

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.640
Chicago, refugee agencies feel under

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.190
siege. We’re challenged. RefugeeOne has

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.980
lost over $1 million in funding

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.460
over the last year-and-a-half.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.660
Melina Kano 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.750
is the Executive Director of RefugeeOne,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:46.310
an organization that resettled 728 refugees

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:51.630
in 2017. It was their largest number ever.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:55.260
But in 2018, they resettled just 175

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.750
refugees. 41 of them were Rohingya. 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.200
We are certainly seeing an effort to

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:04.830
dismantle the network of refugee

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.830
resettlement in the U.S. In the last two

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:12.210
years we have seen refugee agencies

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:16.160
shutting down, and this is sad to see

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:19.020
this because as a country we are losing

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.940
institutional knowledge. Refugees do not

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.400
choose to leave their homes, they are

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.440
forced out of their homes. And the worst

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.040
things that can happen to them is what's

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.820
going on right now.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.850
Illinois is home to 200,000

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.100
refugees, and the state sets aside

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:38.280
$7 million to assist refugees and

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.260
immigrants. Due to closures, only five

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.919
organizations are left to help new

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.510
arrivals make Chicago their home.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.670
Abdul Samad still dreams of the day

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.940
he will be reunited with his mother in the

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:53.250
States. As he builds his new life here,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.520
the uncertainty for Rohingya refugees

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:59.160
in limbo weighs down on him. For this

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.810
family, calling somewhere home, while

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.340
continuing to pass on their Rohingya

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:07.530
tradition, is an act of survival.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.050
This spot has become a favorite among Rohingya

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.930
in Chicago. And Abdul Samad hopes more 

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.420
will join. We are here today at

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.000
the Tea Leaf Garden, a Rohingya restaurant

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.800
in Chicago by Devon. There is no

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.290
Burmese restaurant in Chicago. This is a

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.350
first. And there’s really good foods here.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:29.160
All time my favorite dish is Nasi Goreng

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:32.610
fried rice. Once we come

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.520
together with family, with friends,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:40.010
it's like really tasty foods here.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.010
It’s our favorite foods. It’s our dishes here.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.940
