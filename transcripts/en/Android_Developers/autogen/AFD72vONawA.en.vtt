scrolling is definitely usable but as

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260
scrolling is definitely usable but as
 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.500
scrolling is definitely usable but as
you said it wasn't the standout there

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510
you said it wasn't the standout there
 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.300

are apps that scroll a lot better than

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310
are apps that scroll a lot better than
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.670
are apps that scroll a lot better than
this but in general the performance is

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680
this but in general the performance is
 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.890
this but in general the performance is
pretty good and I really really like the

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900
pretty good and I really really like the
 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.800

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:20.169
this is about things that they're
 

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:21.659
this is about things that they're
looking at so they start basically

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:21.669
looking at so they start basically
 

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:23.730
looking at so they start basically
looking and realized that issue when you

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:23.740
looking and realized that issue when you
 

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.820
looking and realized that issue when you
mentioned it last Friday it was it and

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:25.830
mentioned it last Friday it was it and
 

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.749
mentioned it last Friday it was it and
they're looking they're looking at ways

they're looking they're looking at ways
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.429
they're looking they're looking at ways
to improve that so I definitely will be

00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:29.439
to improve that so I definitely will be
 

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.619

the other half of the button it's

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:24.730
the other half of the button it's
 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.000
the other half of the button it's
negative space basically it's like me

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.010
negative space basically it's like me
 

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.800
negative space basically it's like me
you almost see the other half of the

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:28.810
you almost see the other half of the
 

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.660
you almost see the other half of the
button overlapping with the home button

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:30.670

touch target it's gonna drastically

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.350
touch target it's gonna drastically
 

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.710
touch target it's gonna drastically
minimize the number of errors but yeah

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720
minimize the number of errors but yeah
 

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.000
minimize the number of errors but yeah
it is just you know something that's

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.010
it is just you know something that's
 

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.769
it is just you know something that's
difficult especially for camera apps

00:09:58.769 --> 00:09:58.779
difficult especially for camera apps
 

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:01.290
difficult especially for camera apps
where that is probably the most common

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.300

think we might have nailed the the jank

00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:58.009
think we might have nailed the the jank
 

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:00.879
think we might have nailed the the jank
eNOS part is a big challenge it is

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:00.889
eNOS part is a big challenge it is
 

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:02.439
eNOS part is a big challenge it is
really hard isn't it

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:02.449
really hard isn't it
 

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:04.119
really hard isn't it
it's um when you're dealing with this

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:04.129
it's um when you're dealing with this
 

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:06.759
it's um when you're dealing with this
much information and these bitmaps are

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:06.769
much information and these bitmaps are
 

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.590
much information and these bitmaps are
large enough that any one of them could

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600
large enough that any one of them could
 

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.809
large enough that any one of them could
just about blow your Java heap we've

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:10.819
just about blow your Java heap we've
 

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:13.660
just about blow your Java heap we've
actually I spent a long time here just

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:13.670
actually I spent a long time here just
 

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.910
actually I spent a long time here just
trying to figure out all of the best

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920
trying to figure out all of the best
 

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.619
trying to figure out all of the best
techniques for that dan galpin has been

00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:17.629
techniques for that dan galpin has been
 

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:20.079
techniques for that dan galpin has been
working on it I mean in his spare time

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:20.089
working on it I mean in his spare time
 

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:24.340
working on it I mean in his spare time
which sauce right but yeah I will say

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:24.350
which sauce right but yeah I will say
 

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.929
which sauce right but yeah I will say
that at least on this build the jain

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:25.939
that at least on this build the jain
 

00:11:25.939 --> 00:11:27.429
that at least on this build the jain
keenest does seem to be increasing a

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:27.439
keenest does seem to be increasing a
 

00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:28.869
keenest does seem to be increasing a
little bit making me think that there is

00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:28.879
little bit making me think that there is
 

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:31.240
little bit making me think that there is
a memory leak somewhere some kind of

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.250
a memory leak somewhere some kind of
 

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.449
a memory leak somewhere some kind of
resource leak but yeah the problem

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:34.459
resource leak but yeah the problem
 

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:36.999
resource leak but yeah the problem
exactly it's we do cache images so they

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:37.009
exactly it's we do cache images so they
 

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.999
exactly it's we do cache images so they
have to layer 2 2 layer caching yeah and

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:40.009
have to layer 2 2 layer caching yeah and
 

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:42.129
have to layer 2 2 layer caching yeah and
the disk caching it sees that in this

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:42.139
the disk caching it sees that in this
 

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:43.569
the disk caching it sees that in this
caching is causing some of these issues

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:43.579
caching is causing some of these issues
 

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:45.639
caching is causing some of these issues
as well as so the seek time on disk

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:45.649
as well as so the seek time on disk
 

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.379
as well as so the seek time on disk
which is what we're trying to figure out

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:47.389
which is what we're trying to figure out
 

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:49.780
which is what we're trying to figure out
right now and finalize okay yeah we'll

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790
right now and finalize okay yeah we'll
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.009
right now and finalize okay yeah we'll
definitely be keeping an eye out for

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:51.019
definitely be keeping an eye out for
 

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.840
definitely be keeping an eye out for
that it sounds like you've pretty much

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:52.850
that it sounds like you've pretty much
 

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.699
that it sounds like you've pretty much
already done all the things that we we

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:54.709
already done all the things that we we
 

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:56.350
already done all the things that we we
thought needed to be doing so I'm right

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360
thought needed to be doing so I'm right
 

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.129
thought needed to be doing so I'm right
you know we're we're still looking for a

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139
you know we're we're still looking for a
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.280
you know we're we're still looking for a
pure Java solution but I think that for

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.290
pure Java solution but I think that for
 

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.049
pure Java solution but I think that for
some photo things you actually do have

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.059
some photo things you actually do have
 

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.480
some photo things you actually do have
to drop down into the Linux layer and an

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.490
to drop down into the Linux layer and an
 

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.240
to drop down into the Linux layer and an
NDK because at that point you can do

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.250
NDK because at that point you can do
 

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.829
NDK because at that point you can do
efficient file mapping and you can do

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
efficient file mapping and you can do
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:17.769
efficient file mapping and you can do
decoding with neon instructions instead

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:17.779
decoding with neon instructions instead
 

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.449
decoding with neon instructions instead
of with Java instructions so that that

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:19.459
of with Java instructions so that that
 

00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:23.590
of with Java instructions so that that
may be part of it there's also one one

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600
may be part of it there's also one one
 

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.119
may be part of it there's also one one
thing that you have to avoid like the

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:25.129
thing that you have to avoid like the
 

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:27.429
thing that you have to avoid like the
plague is allocations during your

00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:27.439
plague is allocations during your
 

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:29.920
plague is allocations during your
scrolling because as you

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:29.930
scrolling because as you
 

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.079
scrolling because as you
as you acquire and release objects you

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:32.089
as you acquire and release objects you
 

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:34.750
as you acquire and release objects you
know every release as a possible GC yeah

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760
know every release as a possible GC yeah
 

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.660
know every release as a possible GC yeah
um so yeah well I mean we definitely

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:37.670
um so yeah well I mean we definitely
 

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.220
um so yeah well I mean we definitely
love to hear from from you and from your

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.230
love to hear from from you and from your
 

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.230
love to hear from from you and from your
team once you guys have the next launch

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240
team once you guys have the next launch
 

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.940
team once you guys have the next launch
out and if it is nice and smooth it

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:42.950
out and if it is nice and smooth it
 

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.130
out and if it is nice and smooth it
would be you know great to hear some of

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.140
would be you know great to hear some of
 

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.840
would be you know great to hear some of
the hints that you guys might have for

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:46.850
the hints that you guys might have for
 

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.010
the hints that you guys might have for
other developers which are gonna be in

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.020
other developers which are gonna be in
 

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.750
other developers which are gonna be in
countering the same thing I some of our

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760
countering the same thing I some of our
 

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.790
countering the same thing I some of our
other guests may may have some awesome

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800
other guests may may have some awesome
 

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.240
other guests may may have some awesome
advice as well now let's uh let's go

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.250
advice as well now let's uh let's go
 

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.360
advice as well now let's uh let's go
ahead and take a look at Romans redesign

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:58.370
ahead and take a look at Romans redesign
 

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.370
ahead and take a look at Romans redesign
uh you have one for that I think we did

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:00.380
uh you have one for that I think we did
 

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.470
uh you have one for that I think we did
for I am I think I think Roman left that

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480
for I am I think I think Roman left that
 

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.210
for I am I think I think Roman left that
one alone I think glimmer and cameras

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.220
one alone I think glimmer and cameras
 

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.889
one alone I think glimmer and cameras
are good the way it was I think so

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:05.899
are good the way it was I think so
 

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:07.420
are good the way it was I think so
except for that camera button for the

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.430
except for that camera button for the
 

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.790
except for that camera button for the
camera hood Roman did you you didn't

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800
camera hood Roman did you you didn't
 

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.440
camera hood Roman did you you didn't
feel like you wanted to spend half an

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.450
feel like you wanted to spend half an
 

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.750
feel like you wanted to spend half an
hour just you know talking about

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760
hour just you know talking about
 

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.430
hour just you know talking about
different ways to put a camera button on

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440
different ways to put a camera button on
 

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.910
different ways to put a camera button on
screen yeah I think the thing is what we

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920
screen yeah I think the thing is what we
 

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.769
screen yeah I think the thing is what we
try to do with with Android design in

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:20.779
try to do with with Android design in
 

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.230
try to do with with Android design in
action is we try to look at that apps

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240
action is we try to look at that apps
 

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.320
action is we try to look at that apps
that you know have a lot of you know UX

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:26.330
that you know have a lot of you know UX
 

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.980
that you know have a lot of you know UX
possibilities like a lot of you know

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:28.990
possibilities like a lot of you know
 

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.300
possibilities like a lot of you know
something that we can change drastically

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:31.310
something that we can change drastically
 

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:36.840
something that we can change drastically
and still maintain the core I think I am

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:36.850
and still maintain the core I think I am
 

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.340
and still maintain the core I think I am
pronouncing that right I think I am just

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.350
pronouncing that right I think I am just
 

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.860
pronouncing that right I think I am just
like you guys are very close the

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:41.870
like you guys are very close the
 

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.480
like you guys are very close the
redesign that the only reasons we would

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.490
redesign that the only reasons we would
 

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.790
redesign that the only reasons we would
do it probably be just very small visual

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800
do it probably be just very small visual
 

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.010
do it probably be just very small visual
tweaks here and there so we don't think

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.020
tweaks here and there so we don't think
 

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.449
tweaks here and there so we don't think
it was kind of worth spending too much

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:49.459
it was kind of worth spending too much
 

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:52.990
it was kind of worth spending too much
time on it yeah I think really the main

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000
time on it yeah I think really the main
 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.170
time on it yeah I think really the main
critique that I have of the interface is

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.180
critique that I have of the interface is
 

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.300
critique that I have of the interface is
that compared to some of the other photo

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.310
that compared to some of the other photo
 

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.420
that compared to some of the other photo
apps we saw it takes a long time to get

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:01.430
apps we saw it takes a long time to get
 

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.240
apps we saw it takes a long time to get
a full sized image and once I've drilled

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.250
a full sized image and once I've drilled
 

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.410
a full sized image and once I've drilled
down into the full size then you can't

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420
down into the full size then you can't
 

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.840
down into the full size then you can't
just move to another image really

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:10.850
just move to another image really
 

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:18.730
just move to another image really
quickly so yeah write it like I in

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:18.740
quickly so yeah write it like I in
 

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.130
quickly so yeah write it like I in
general and maybe rounds maybe you could

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:21.140
general and maybe rounds maybe you could
 

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.329
general and maybe rounds maybe you could
put Ramsey back up down I think um you

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:25.339
put Ramsey back up down I think um you
 

00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:27.130
put Ramsey back up down I think um you
know what I'm looking at this interface

book so this was this is a little bit
 

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:31.679
book so this was this is a little bit
different from some of the other apps

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:31.689
different from some of the other apps
 

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:33.089
different from some of the other apps
that we looked at in that it's not about

00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:33.099
that we looked at in that it's not about
 

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.609
that we looked at in that it's not about
taking photos it is about browsing

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:35.619
taking photos it is about browsing
 

00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:38.279

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:38.289
Flickr effectively so it's it's very
 

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:39.839
Flickr effectively so it's it's very
much here it's all about being able to

much here it's all about being able to
 

00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:41.819
much here it's all about being able to
create these rich smooth scrolling

00:15:41.819 --> 00:15:41.829
create these rich smooth scrolling
 

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:43.859
create these rich smooth scrolling
experiences so we gave him a couple of

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:43.869
experiences so we gave him a couple of
 

00:15:43.869 --> 00:15:45.299
experiences so we gave him a couple of
red marks but it was some stuff which

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:45.309
red marks but it was some stuff which
 

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:49.709
red marks but it was some stuff which
the app doesn't actually have to do so

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:49.719
the app doesn't actually have to do so
 

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:52.619
the app doesn't actually have to do so
but let's say let's go over once you

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:52.629
but let's say let's go over once you
 

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:55.349
but let's say let's go over once you
introduce yourself Paul so Paul is

00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:55.359
introduce yourself Paul so Paul is
 

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.549
introduce yourself Paul so Paul is
actually having some trouble rejoining

00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:56.559
actually having some trouble rejoining
 

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.439
actually having some trouble rejoining
our hangout maybe we can move on to the

00:15:58.439 --> 00:15:58.449
our hangout maybe we can move on to the
 

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:00.889
our hangout maybe we can move on to the
next app and get the next developer on

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899
next app and get the next developer on
 

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:03.269
next app and get the next developer on
back Paul yeah we can totally do that

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279
back Paul yeah we can totally do that
 

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.829
back Paul yeah we can totally do that
let's say let's move on to camera zoom

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839
let's say let's move on to camera zoom
 

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.349
let's say let's move on to camera zoom
effects while while we're waiting for

00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:06.359
effects while while we're waiting for
 

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:08.939
effects while while we're waiting for
Paul to get his hangout connection

00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:08.949
Paul to get his hangout connection
 

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:11.069
Paul to get his hangout connection
working once again so this is a little

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079
working once again so this is a little
 

00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:13.759
working once again so this is a little
bit more like I am in that it is

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:13.769
bit more like I am in that it is
 

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:16.199
bit more like I am in that it is
effectively a camera replacement I think

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:16.209
effectively a camera replacement I think
 

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.639
effectively a camera replacement I think
the the key difference here was that

00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:17.649
the the key difference here was that
 

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.259
the the key difference here was that
camera zoom effects wasn't so much about

00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:19.269
camera zoom effects wasn't so much about
 

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:21.359
camera zoom effects wasn't so much about
the community of photography it was more

00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:21.369
the community of photography it was more
 

00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:23.069
the community of photography it was more
about being able to create great photos

00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079
about being able to create great photos
 

00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:24.779
about being able to create great photos
with an app that replaces the native

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:24.789
with an app that replaces the native
 

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:26.099
with an app that replaces the native
camera or at least that was my

00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:26.109
camera or at least that was my
 

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:27.389
camera or at least that was my
perspective so it'll be interesting to

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399
perspective so it'll be interesting to
 

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:30.299
perspective so it'll be interesting to
hear Alexes I think where we gave it a

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:30.309
hear Alexes I think where we gave it a
 

00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:32.609
hear Alexes I think where we gave it a
red mark here again was the community

00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:32.619
red mark here again was the community
 

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:34.439
red mark here again was the community
stuff and some issues with the design

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:34.449
stuff and some issues with the design
 

00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:36.689
stuff and some issues with the design
guide and this is in fact an app which

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:36.699
guide and this is in fact an app which
 

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:39.179
guide and this is in fact an app which
Roman and his team took a look at so I

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:39.189
Roman and his team took a look at so I
 

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:41.549
Roman and his team took a look at so I
think we'll actually start by having a

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:41.559
think we'll actually start by having a
 

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:44.339
think we'll actually start by having a
quick look at some of those changes so

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:44.349
quick look at some of those changes so
 

00:16:44.349 --> 00:16:46.109
quick look at some of those changes so
Roman if you want to talk us through

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:46.119
Roman if you want to talk us through
 

00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:48.059
Roman if you want to talk us through
we've just got basically the two

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:48.069
we've just got basically the two
 

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:50.459
we've just got basically the two
screenshots on screen do you want to

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:50.469
screenshots on screen do you want to
 

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.199
screenshots on screen do you want to
give us a very quick rundown on

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:52.209
give us a very quick rundown on
 

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:54.359
give us a very quick rundown on
you know some of the thinking behind the

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:54.369
you know some of the thinking behind the
 

00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:56.910
you know some of the thinking behind the
changes that you did and we can let Alex

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920
changes that you did and we can let Alex
 

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.419
changes that you did and we can let Alex
tell us why they are not a good idea

00:16:59.419 --> 00:16:59.429
tell us why they are not a good idea
 

00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:02.639
tell us why they are not a good idea
yeah so like we said an Android design

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:02.649
yeah so like we said an Android design
 

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.500
yeah so like we said an Android design
in action I think the main thing that we

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.510
in action I think the main thing that we
 

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.090
in action I think the main thing that we
wanted to do is from an interaction

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.100
wanted to do is from an interaction
 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.210
wanted to do is from an interaction
standpoint just simplify the location of

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:09.220
standpoint just simplify the location of
 

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.429
standpoint just simplify the location of
things so we basically put the camera in

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439
things so we basically put the camera in
 

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:14.220
things so we basically put the camera in
settings and the right and then effects

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.230
settings and the right and then effects
 

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.169
settings and the right and then effects
which is I think the most awesome part

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:16.179
which is I think the most awesome part
 

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:18.149
which is I think the most awesome part
of this app so many awesome effects we

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:18.159
of this app so many awesome effects we
 

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:19.620
of this app so many awesome effects we
put that on the left just to simplify

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:19.630
put that on the left just to simplify
 

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.809
put that on the left just to simplify
the model for users and then we started

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:21.819
the model for users and then we started
 

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.699
the model for users and then we started
grouping things like the the shutter

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:23.709
grouping things like the the shutter
 

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.220
grouping things like the the shutter
time or the shutter type and the camera

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.230
time or the shutter type and the camera
 

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.240
time or the shutter type and the camera
settings we moved that along with other

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:30.250
settings we moved that along with other
 

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.639
settings we moved that along with other
settings into a single screen and then

00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:32.649
settings into a single screen and then
 

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:34.919
settings into a single screen and then
we made the image the entire camera

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:34.929
we made the image the entire camera
 

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.260
we made the image the entire camera
preview take up the entire screen which

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.270
preview take up the entire screen which
 

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.690
preview take up the entire screen which
I think can be it is not possible in

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:39.700
I think can be it is not possible in
 

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.000
I think can be it is not possible in
some cases but that's it was the entire

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.010
some cases but that's it was the entire
 

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.350
some cases but that's it was the entire
screen and all the controls are just

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360
screen and all the controls are just
 

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.539
screen and all the controls are just
overlaid the last point I wanted to make

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:45.549
overlaid the last point I wanted to make
 

00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:47.700
overlaid the last point I wanted to make
was that we branded just shutter the

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:47.710
was that we branded just shutter the
 

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.690
was that we branded just shutter the
shutter button itself and we made it so

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:51.700
shutter button itself and we made it so
 

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.610
shutter button itself and we made it so
that it was larger and kind of further

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.620
that it was larger and kind of further
 

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.950

there are kind of too hard to the apps

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860
there are kind of too hard to the apps
 

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.530
there are kind of too hard to the apps
there as you mentioned that the first

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:18.540
there as you mentioned that the first
 

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.100
there as you mentioned that the first
half is is at the capture time trying to

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.110
half is is at the capture time trying to
 

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.480
half is is at the capture time trying to
kind of improve on the ability that

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:23.490
kind of improve on the ability that
 

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.250

people have what they're composing and
 

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.020
people have what they're composing and
taking pictures so we're looking at

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.030
taking pictures so we're looking at
 

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.120
taking pictures so we're looking at
things like a grid compositions stable

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.130
things like a grid compositions stable
 

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.190

time-lapse but to make for example we

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:33.990
time-lapse but to make for example we
 

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.180
time-lapse but to make for example we
can take up to 10 10 shots per second

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.190
can take up to 10 10 shots per second
 

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:42.350
can take up to 10 10 shots per second
and I guess kind of where we're going is

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360
and I guess kind of where we're going is
 

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.330
and I guess kind of where we're going is
we look at doing a major update every

it's very good timing for us we haven't
 

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.520
it's very good timing for us we haven't
finalized the design so what you've

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:13.530
finalized the design so what you've
 

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.720
finalized the design so what you've
given us is the chance to kind of see

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:14.730
given us is the chance to kind of see
 

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.880

you know what we've got what's working

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:16.890
you know what we've got what's working
 

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.700
you know what we've got what's working
and where we can improve so you know a

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:19.710
and where we can improve so you know a
 

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.950
and where we can improve so you know a
lot of points that you raised we you

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960
lot of points that you raised we you
 

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.540
lot of points that you raised we you
know we completely agree with it so you

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:23.550
know we completely agree with it so you
 

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.800
know we completely agree with it so you
know starting with things like the

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:24.810
know starting with things like the
 

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.960
know starting with things like the
shutter button we have had a lot of

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:26.970
shutter button we have had a lot of
 

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.810
shutter button we have had a lot of
feedback around that you know we are

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:28.820
feedback around that you know we are
 

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.170
feedback around that you know we are
bigger we actually love Romans design

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:32.180
bigger we actually love Romans design
 

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.540

you know with the will you know the

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:35.550
you know with the will you know the
 

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.950
you know with the will you know the
context around that we think that looks

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960
context around that we think that looks
 

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.500
context around that we think that looks
really great

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:38.510
really great
 

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.760
really great
we'd like the fact that it's bigger it's

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:40.770
we'd like the fact that it's bigger it's
 

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.460
we'd like the fact that it's bigger it's
further away from the home button we

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:43.470
further away from the home button we
 

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.100
further away from the home button we
also agree probably the most useful

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.110
also agree probably the most useful
 

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.140
also agree probably the most useful
settings and yet are kind of the power

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.150
settings and yet are kind of the power
 

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.300
settings and yet are kind of the power
features that you like so the changing

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:50.310
features that you like so the changing
 

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.030
features that you like so the changing
the autofocus mode so we kind of agree

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:53.040
the autofocus mode so we kind of agree
 

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.950
the autofocus mode so we kind of agree
with with Romans points there about

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960
with with Romans points there about
 

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.030
with with Romans points there about
giving that to the right-hand side of

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:56.040
giving that to the right-hand side of
 

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.040
giving that to the right-hand side of
the screen I supposed to be the only

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.050
the screen I supposed to be the only
 

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.720
the screen I supposed to be the only
issue that we have is that because the

00:20:59.720 --> 00:20:59.730
issue that we have is that because the
 

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.370
issue that we have is that because the
app is kind of in two halves we have the

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380
app is kind of in two halves we have the
 

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.100
app is kind of in two halves we have the
you know the capture time and the FX

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.110
you know the capture time and the FX
 

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.020
you know the capture time and the FX
screens what actually happens once you

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.030
screens what actually happens once you
 

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.660
screens what actually happens once you
kind of flip to the FX mode

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:07.670
kind of flip to the FX mode
 

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.640
kind of flip to the FX mode
the effects becomes a kind of most

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:09.650
the effects becomes a kind of most
 

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.160
the effects becomes a kind of most
important toolbar what we try to do is

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.170
important toolbar what we try to do is
 

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.230
important toolbar what we try to do is
have a kind of a similar interface at

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240
have a kind of a similar interface at
 

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.790
have a kind of a similar interface at
the capture time as you would have at

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:15.800
the capture time as you would have at
 

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.430
the capture time as you would have at
the FX time so that's kind of one one of

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440
the FX time so that's kind of one one of
 

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.900
the FX time so that's kind of one one of
the reasons why FX has ended up on the

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:19.910
the reasons why FX has ended up on the
 

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.850
the reasons why FX has ended up on the
Reiko we are kind of reviewing that to

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:21.860
Reiko we are kind of reviewing that to
 

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.020
Reiko we are kind of reviewing that to
see if there is you know possibly

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.030
see if there is you know possibly
 

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.910
see if there is you know possibly
another another approach we can take

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:24.920
another another approach we can take
 

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.970
another another approach we can take
yeah I I can't remember exactly what

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:27.980
yeah I I can't remember exactly what
 

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.210
yeah I I can't remember exactly what
Roman did with this but I remember when

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.220
Roman did with this but I remember when
 

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.100
Roman did with this but I remember when
we reviewed it we said would be actually

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.110
we reviewed it we said would be actually
 

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.270
we reviewed it we said would be actually
interesting to put this on a viewpager

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.280
interesting to put this on a viewpager
 

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.130
interesting to put this on a viewpager
so I can go back back and forth between

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.140
so I can go back back and forth between
 

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.840
so I can go back back and forth between
camera and effects or have some other

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:37.850
camera and effects or have some other
 

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.340
camera and effects or have some other
way you want to keep the the interface

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:42.350
way you want to keep the the interface
 

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.020
way you want to keep the the interface
sort of similar in that once you learn

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.030
sort of similar in that once you learn
 

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.370
sort of similar in that once you learn
it in one mode you don't want to have

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:45.380
it in one mode you don't want to have
 

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.270
it in one mode you don't want to have
been a completely different experience

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.280
been a completely different experience
 

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.220
been a completely different experience
when you switch to the other mode yeah

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.230
when you switch to the other mode yeah
 

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.980
when you switch to the other mode yeah
so all right well so here's a beautiful

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:53.990

so yeah we what Roman what what all is
 

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.630
so yeah we what Roman what what all is
wrong with this interface or could be

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640
wrong with this interface or could be
 

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.360
wrong with this interface or could be
changed it could be better or Paul with

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.370
changed it could be better or Paul with
 

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.370
changed it could be better or Paul with
this is Paul right no this is Alex I'm

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380

we've actually got a whole bunch of
 

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.060
we've actually got a whole bunch of
changes coming down the line we're

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.070
changes coming down the line we're
 

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.640
changes coming down the line we're
actually moving up conversion 3.5 which

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:24.650
actually moving up conversion 3.5 which
 

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.770
actually moving up conversion 3.5 which
is on the google play now up to version

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:26.780
is on the google play now up to version
 

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.100

the features that are going in there

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080
the features that are going in there
 

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.360
the features that are going in there
auto-rotate man it's something that you

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:34.370
auto-rotate man it's something that you
 

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.220

mentioned on the day yeah absolutely

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:36.230
mentioned on the day yeah absolutely
 

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.020
mentioned on the day yeah absolutely
agree that that needs to be and there's

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.030
agree that that needs to be and there's
 

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.640
agree that that needs to be and there's
actually quite a bit of work because

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:39.650
actually quite a bit of work because
 

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.470
actually quite a bit of work because
there's so many controls on the camera

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480
there's so many controls on the camera
 

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.750
there's so many controls on the camera
screen and we actually have to in terms

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760
screen and we actually have to in terms
 

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.150
screen and we actually have to in terms
of the actual it's a landscape screen

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:46.160
of the actual it's a landscape screen
 

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.640
of the actual it's a landscape screen
being had to possess some controls kind

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:48.650
being had to possess some controls kind
 

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.370
being had to possess some controls kind
of turn on the side so that has created

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.380
of turn on the side so that has created
 

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.900
of turn on the side so that has created
work for us but we were pretty confident

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:52.910
work for us but we were pretty confident
 

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.430
work for us but we were pretty confident
we're kind of happy with the way that's

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440
we're kind of happy with the way that's
 

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.900
we're kind of happy with the way that's
gone that's great

we also following on from your feedback
you talked about being able to work on

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:00.680
you talked about being able to work on
 

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.130
you talked about being able to work on
devices with you know front-facing

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:03.140
devices with you know front-facing
 

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.810
devices with you know front-facing
camera only or devices that have no

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:04.820
camera only or devices that have no
 

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.270
camera only or devices that have no
camera and that's something that will be

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280
camera and that's something that will be
 

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.240
camera and that's something that will be
fully supported we'll keep doing more on

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.250
fully supported we'll keep doing more on
 

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.370
fully supported we'll keep doing more on

together and we can you know something
 

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:29.080
together and we can you know something
really good this is such a treat so we

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.090
really good this is such a treat so we
 

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.730
really good this is such a treat so we
review these apps and then within a

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:30.740
review these apps and then within a
 

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.900
review these apps and then within a
couple of weeks we're gonna have new

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:31.910
couple of weeks we're gonna have new
 

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.310
couple of weeks we're gonna have new
versions of all of them with all of the

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
versions of all of them with all of the
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.049
versions of all of them with all of the
features we asked for we should review

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:35.059
features we asked for we should review
 

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:41.380
features we asked for we should review
more apps that's great nice yeah I kind

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:41.390
more apps that's great nice yeah I kind
 

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.669
more apps that's great nice yeah I kind
of almost feel like there's not much

00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679
of almost feel like there's not much
 

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:44.409
of almost feel like there's not much
left to ask cuz we can just look in a

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:44.419
left to ask cuz we can just look in a
 

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:45.820
left to ask cuz we can just look in a
couple of weeks and see exactly what

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:45.830
couple of weeks and see exactly what
 

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.560
couple of weeks and see exactly what
that does I'm really curious to know

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:47.570
that does I'm really curious to know
 

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.100
that does I'm really curious to know
what sort of eye problems you had or

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:51.110
what sort of eye problems you had or
 

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.750
what sort of eye problems you had or
what what's her challenges you need to

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760
what what's her challenges you need to
 

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.149
what what's her challenges you need to
overcome developing this app for Android

00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159
overcome developing this app for Android
 

00:23:55.159 --> 00:23:56.919
overcome developing this app for Android
obviously it does a lot of very

00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:56.929
obviously it does a lot of very
 

00:23:56.929 --> 00:24:01.539
obviously it does a lot of very
complicated work yeah I guess you know

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:01.549
complicated work yeah I guess you know
 

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:04.000
complicated work yeah I guess you know
because we kind of with that from the

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.010
because we kind of with that from the
 

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.529
because we kind of with that from the
beginning we were always trying to

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:05.539
beginning we were always trying to
 

00:24:05.539 --> 00:24:07.899
beginning we were always trying to
support right back to you know Android

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:07.909
support right back to you know Android
 

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:12.880
support right back to you know Android
1.5 and when you look at cameras you

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:12.890
1.5 and when you look at cameras you
 

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.180
1.5 and when you look at cameras you
have so much the main complexity is in

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.190
have so much the main complexity is in
 

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.010
have so much the main complexity is in
the camera screen not in the FX screen

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:18.020
the camera screen not in the FX screen
 

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.260
the camera screen not in the FX screen
so I am on the camera side of things

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:20.270
so I am on the camera side of things
 

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.140
so I am on the camera side of things
it's really just trying to pull together

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.150
it's really just trying to pull together
 

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.299
it's really just trying to pull together
a consistent app which can deal with

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:27.309
a consistent app which can deal with
 

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:30.190
a consistent app which can deal with
everyone has different you know focus

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200
everyone has different you know focus
 

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.730
everyone has different you know focus
modes different scene modes different

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:32.740
modes different scene modes different
 

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.080

filters available the zoom works

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.090
filters available the zoom works
 

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.970
filters available the zoom works
differently on different phones we

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:36.980
differently on different phones we
 

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.130
differently on different phones we
actually managed to even provide zoom on

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:39.140
actually managed to even provide zoom on
 

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.919
actually managed to even provide zoom on
focus like it was the Nexus S which you

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:41.929
focus like it was the Nexus S which you
 

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:43.240
focus like it was the Nexus S which you
know didn't support any kind of aim at

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.250
know didn't support any kind of aim at
 

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.529
know didn't support any kind of aim at
all

00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:44.539
all
 

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:46.750
all
it really has just been a case of just

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760
it really has just been a case of just
 

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.779
it really has just been a case of just
carrying them I mean I have hope I have

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:49.789
carrying them I mean I have hope I have
 

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:52.630
carrying them I mean I have hope I have
eight eight devices myself and we have

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640
eight eight devices myself and we have
 

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.799
eight eight devices myself and we have
deserts all around the world who are

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:53.809
deserts all around the world who are
 

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:55.930
deserts all around the world who are
giving us feedback and saying you know

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:55.940
giving us feedback and saying you know
 

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.820
giving us feedback and saying you know
what works you know one of my test

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:57.830
what works you know one of my test
 

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.680
what works you know one of my test
devices is not not necessarily gonna

00:24:59.680 --> 00:24:59.690
devices is not not necessarily gonna
 

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.840
devices is not not necessarily gonna
work somewhere else yeah so you know the

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:01.850
work somewhere else yeah so you know the
 

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.360
work somewhere else yeah so you know the
real complex complexity is is to do with

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:04.370
real complex complexity is is to do with
 

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.070
real complex complexity is is to do with
the fragmentation but it's also you know

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
the fragmentation but it's also you know
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.779
the fragmentation but it's also you know
it's been a real opportunity because you

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:07.789
it's been a real opportunity because you
 

00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:09.610
it's been a real opportunity because you
know we're now in a position where we

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:09.620
know we're now in a position where we
 

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.340
know we're now in a position where we
have over a million users you know all

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:12.350
have over a million users you know all
 

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.080
have over a million users you know all
around the world and you know we're

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.090
around the world and you know we're
 

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.460
around the world and you know we're
getting this amazing feedback you know

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:15.470
getting this amazing feedback you know
 

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.220
getting this amazing feedback you know
through from all different places so

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:18.230
through from all different places so
 

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.409
through from all different places so
it's an opportunity but it's it's an

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:20.419
it's an opportunity but it's it's an
 

00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.360
it's an opportunity but it's it's an
ongoing challenge

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
ongoing challenge
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:22.920
ongoing challenge
and every type of major new device comes

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:22.930
and every type of major new device comes
 

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.770
and every type of major new device comes
out you know like the Nexus 7 before

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:25.780
out you know like the Nexus 7 before
 

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.360
out you know like the Nexus 7 before
that you know the Galaxy Nexus we were

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.370
that you know the Galaxy Nexus we were
 

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.890
that you know the Galaxy Nexus we were
always facing problems and on indicate

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:31.900
always facing problems and on indicate
 

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.360
always facing problems and on indicate
one of the runs that we have is that we

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:33.370
one of the runs that we have is that we
 

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.030
one of the runs that we have is that we
get the devices are to you point after

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.040
get the devices are to you point after
 

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.070
get the devices are to you point after
users will find problems before we even

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080
users will find problems before we even
 

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.680
users will find problems before we even
have a chance to fix them so it's an

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:40.690
have a chance to fix them so it's an
 

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.170
have a chance to fix them so it's an
ongoing battle but but you know we're

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:43.180
ongoing battle but but you know we're
 

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.520
ongoing battle but but you know we're
really happy where we've got to I think

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:44.530
really happy where we've got to I think
 

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.860
really happy where we've got to I think
I think this particular release we're

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:46.870
I think this particular release we're
 

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.900
I think this particular release we're
focusing a lot under design and adding

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:48.910
focusing a lot under design and adding
 

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.960
focusing a lot under design and adding
some additional camera features so for

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:51.970
some additional camera features so for
 

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.490
some additional camera features so for
example things like brightness exposure

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:53.500
example things like brightness exposure
 

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.160
example things like brightness exposure
controls closer controls which again

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.170
controls closer controls which again
 

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.480
controls closer controls which again
vary quite a bit between devices

00:25:59.480 --> 00:25:59.490
vary quite a bit between devices
 

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.940
vary quite a bit between devices
pinch-to-zoom we think we've got that

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:02.950
pinch-to-zoom we think we've got that
 

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.440
pinch-to-zoom we think we've got that
working now in a way which won't affect

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:04.450
working now in a way which won't affect
 

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.950
working now in a way which won't affect
the you know the older devices so you

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960
the you know the older devices so you
 

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.240
the you know the older devices so you
know we can calculate the way it's

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.250
know we can calculate the way it's
 

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.950
know we can calculate the way it's
looking we're going out to visa next

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960
looking we're going out to visa next
 

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.540
looking we're going out to visa next
week so you know we anyone who wants to

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:15.550
week so you know we anyone who wants to
 

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.280
week so you know we anyone who wants to
kind of take part in that just just you

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.290
kind of take part in that just just you
 

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.900
kind of take part in that just just you
need some takers yeah yeah so one of the

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:21.910
need some takers yeah yeah so one of the
 

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.010
need some takers yeah yeah so one of the
things that it's one we're kind of

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.020
things that it's one we're kind of
 

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.210
things that it's one we're kind of
running out of time a little bit but I

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.220
running out of time a little bit but I
 

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.920
running out of time a little bit but I
did want to dig a little bit deeper into

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:25.930
did want to dig a little bit deeper into
 

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:27.870
did want to dig a little bit deeper into
what you talked about having testers all

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880
what you talked about having testers all
 

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.360
what you talked about having testers all
over the world so you know I think with

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.370
over the world so you know I think with
 

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.490
over the world so you know I think with
a camera replacement app as you say you

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.500
a camera replacement app as you say you
 

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.390
a camera replacement app as you say you
know you're going to be right on the

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:33.400
know you're going to be right on the
 

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.550
know you're going to be right on the
forefront of really having to test on a

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:35.560
forefront of really having to test on a
 

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.500
forefront of really having to test on a
lot of different hardware because there

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:37.510
lot of different hardware because there
 

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.750
lot of different hardware because there
are just a lot of different cameras so

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760
are just a lot of different cameras so
 

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.520
are just a lot of different cameras so
are those people who work as part of

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.530
are those people who work as part of
 

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.960
are those people who work as part of
your organization or do you have sort of

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:42.970
your organization or do you have sort of
 

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.290
your organization or do you have sort of
a public alpha testing group of people

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:46.300
a public alpha testing group of people
 

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.270
a public alpha testing group of people
who you send out you know to test the

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:48.280
who you send out you know to test the
 

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.790
who you send out you know to test the
app on a lot of different hardware we

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:50.800
app on a lot of different hardware we
 

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.460
app on a lot of different hardware we
have a group who you know every time we

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:53.470
have a group who you know every time we
 

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.430
have a group who you know every time we
go to beta they big they pretty much you

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440
go to beta they big they pretty much you
 

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.660
go to beta they big they pretty much you
know there are our core group of testers

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:57.670
know there are our core group of testers
 

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:58.980
know there are our core group of testers
and that's going to be sort of between

00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:58.990
and that's going to be sort of between
 

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.890
and that's going to be sort of between
10 and 15 and then in addition to that

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:01.900
10 and 15 and then in addition to that
 

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.410
10 and 15 and then in addition to that
what we do is you know once you know

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:04.420
what we do is you know once you know
 

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.670
what we do is you know once you know
once we are at this stage where we're

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:05.680
once we are at this stage where we're
 

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.980
once we are at this stage where we're
ready to go to visa we do invite people

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:07.990
ready to go to visa we do invite people
 

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.390
ready to go to visa we do invite people

that's something we've worked on them
 

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:17.940
that's something we've worked on them
you know would you be interested in

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:17.950
you know would you be interested in
 

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.580

nine-time nine times
they're gonna say yes send this me

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760
they're gonna say yes send this me
 

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.779
they're gonna say yes send this me
straightaway and you know if someone's

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:26.789
straightaway and you know if someone's
 

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:28.519
straightaway and you know if someone's
emailed you recently you know that they

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:28.529
emailed you recently you know that they
 

00:27:28.529 --> 00:27:30.980
emailed you recently you know that they
have an active interest in your rack the

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.990
have an active interest in your rack the
 

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.390
have an active interest in your rack the
fact that they're talking to you know

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400
fact that they're talking to you know
 

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.799
fact that they're talking to you know
that they're going to spend the time

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:33.809
that they're going to spend the time
 

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:35.240
that they're going to spend the time
looking at it getting valuable feedback

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.250
looking at it getting valuable feedback
 

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.060
looking at it getting valuable feedback
so to be honest it's never been a

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.070
so to be honest it's never been a
 

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.210
so to be honest it's never been a
problem getting testers that's never

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220
problem getting testers that's never
 

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.070
problem getting testers that's never
been a problem until yes it's kind of I

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080
been a problem until yes it's kind of I
 

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.140
been a problem until yes it's kind of I
suppose having enough time to kind of

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.150
suppose having enough time to kind of
 

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.490
suppose having enough time to kind of
spend on each case I suppose it's

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500
spend on each case I suppose it's
 

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.590
spend on each case I suppose it's
probably more challenging sure I can see

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600
probably more challenging sure I can see
 

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.090
probably more challenging sure I can see
how that would work I mean it's as a

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100
how that would work I mean it's as a
 

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.649
how that would work I mean it's as a
user I mean that's what you really want

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659
user I mean that's what you really want
 

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:53.240
user I mean that's what you really want
is like you email the developer and go

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.250
is like you email the developer and go
 

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.560
is like you email the developer and go
yeah this thing isn't working on my

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:54.570
yeah this thing isn't working on my
