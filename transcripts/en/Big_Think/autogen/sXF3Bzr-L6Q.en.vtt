00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.589
I gather your question is wow how did

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
I gather your question is wow how did
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959
I gather your question is wow how did
this happen so there were there were

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
this happen so there were there were
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.549
this happen so there were there were
three there were several ingredients

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559
three there were several ingredients
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.200
three there were several ingredients
okay one ingredient was there was a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
okay one ingredient was there was a
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.230
okay one ingredient was there was a
bubble in housing prices people assume

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
bubble in housing prices people assume
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.599
bubble in housing prices people assume
that housing prices would just continue

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
that housing prices would just continue
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.250
that housing prices would just continue
to go up and up and up and that they

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
to go up and up and up and that they
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470
to go up and up and up and that they
could take on unrealistic amounts of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
could take on unrealistic amounts of
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.770
could take on unrealistic amounts of
debt because the appreciation and the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
debt because the appreciation and the
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720
debt because the appreciation and the
value of their houses would make it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
value of their houses would make it
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030
value of their houses would make it
possible for them to deal with that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
possible for them to deal with that
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459
possible for them to deal with that
amount of debt the other thing that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
amount of debt the other thing that
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.170
amount of debt the other thing that
happened was that there was a breakdown

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
happened was that there was a breakdown
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.860
happened was that there was a breakdown
in lending practices by mortgage lenders

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
in lending practices by mortgage lenders
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.500
in lending practices by mortgage lenders
so there was not sufficient oversight

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510
so there was not sufficient oversight
 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.279
so there was not sufficient oversight
the fee structure for for mortgage for

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
the fee structure for for mortgage for
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500
the fee structure for for mortgage for
people issuing mortgages with such that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
people issuing mortgages with such that
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.270
people issuing mortgages with such that
their only incentives were to get

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
their only incentives were to get
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000
their only incentives were to get
mortgages out there to grant them and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
mortgages out there to grant them and
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.390
mortgages out there to grant them and
then the other ingredient was sort of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
then the other ingredient was sort of
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.760
then the other ingredient was sort of
the rapid securitization of lending

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
the rapid securitization of lending
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620
the rapid securitization of lending
throughout the economy throughout the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
throughout the economy throughout the
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240
throughout the economy throughout the
world so what happened is these

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
world so what happened is these
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.719
world so what happened is these
mortgages got bundled and sliced into

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
mortgages got bundled and sliced into
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940
mortgages got bundled and sliced into
different pieces that supposedly

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
different pieces that supposedly
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620
different pieces that supposedly
represented different risk

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
represented different risk
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.280
represented different risk
characteristics and then there's the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
characteristics and then there's the
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.580
characteristics and then there's the
vast machinery of the securitization

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
vast machinery of the securitization
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.050
vast machinery of the securitization
industry which rated a lot of these

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
industry which rated a lot of these
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.330
industry which rated a lot of these
things as Triple A or you know very very

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340
things as Triple A or you know very very
 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.399
things as Triple A or you know very very
safe securities when they in fact were

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
safe securities when they in fact were
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.359
safe securities when they in fact were
not and so there was a hole under chol

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
not and so there was a hole under chol
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.929
not and so there was a hole under chol
of things that that that resulted from

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
of things that that that resulted from
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020
of things that that that resulted from
this that meant housing prices began to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
this that meant housing prices began to
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870
this that meant housing prices began to
fall this whole this whole business

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
fall this whole this whole business
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359
fall this whole this whole business
collapse and that and that caused panic

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
collapse and that and that caused panic
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.539
collapse and that and that caused panic
and essentially in the credit markets

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
and essentially in the credit markets
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.560
and essentially in the credit markets
because many people found themselves

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
because many people found themselves
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.790
because many people found themselves
holding these exotic securities that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
holding these exotic securities that
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.940
holding these exotic securities that
were

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950
were
 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.809
were
were dependent that were these bundled

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
were dependent that were these bundled
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.350
were dependent that were these bundled
mortgages or pieces of them that they

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360
mortgages or pieces of them that they
 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.140
mortgages or pieces of them that they
could not sell
