00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We'd determined that measuring the angle of the sun's rays in Alexandria can be done

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as precisely as we like, so this error is negligible, which is interesting.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You may not have thought that this actual measurement seems more difficult than just

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
verifying something that's vertical, but it turns out this was the negligible one

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and this could introduce about 20% error.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Next, we have been measuring distance between Syene and Alexandria

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and what is there to say about this one?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To estimate this distance between Syene and Alexandria, surveyors at that time would

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
time camels using some assumptions based on how quickly a camel would walk,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they would infer a distance between these two cities.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, you can probably tell this is not the best way to measure distance.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Maybe his camel walk in a perfectly straight line at constant speed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and the measurement went perfectly, but somehow, I doubt that.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In fact with all the zigzagging and the camel speeding up and slowing down, I'd estimate

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the uncertainty here to be about 10-20% and this is truly a pretty large source of error.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
An error in distance measurement of 10-20%, well, let's just say 15% for simplicity sake.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We need to propagate this through and determine how much this affects our circumference

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
measurement--so let's go back to our equation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the circumference is 360/α times this distance d.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this distance has an uncertainty of 15%, which means that instead of being 5,000 stadia,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
actually 5,000, plus or minus 750 stadia--so we can do we did last time and say well dmax

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the maximum possible value for d would be 5750 stadia, dmin would be 4250 stadia, and we can

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
calculate circumferences based on that and then use those calculations to determine the percent error.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We note that using d average, so just using this 5000 stadia,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
results in the circumference of 46,250 kilometers.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, I want you to fill in these blanks.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What is the circumference if we used dmax, so that would be 5000 stadia plus 750 stadia?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Once you've calculated that, how far off percentage-wise is that from 46,250?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Do the same thing for dmin, and as a reminder 1 stadium is 185 meters,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and α, which is this angle here in the equation is 7.2 degrees.

00:02:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Go ahead and fill this out.
