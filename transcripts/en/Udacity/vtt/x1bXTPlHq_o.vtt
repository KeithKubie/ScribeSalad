00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.600
An advanced pay for performance system
rewards providers who are able to

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.400
provide higher quality
care at a lower cost.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220
There's evidence that
these programs can work.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.690
Here are the results of the Physician
Group Practice, or PGP, demo,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.380
a well known Medicare pilot
conducted in ten medical practices.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.820
All of the groups achieved improvements
in 25 of 27 quality metrics for

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.540
the key diseases shown here, and you see
the percentage of improvement as well.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.870
Four practices earned a bonus for
outstanding performance.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.240
Marshfield Clinic earned
half of the total bonus.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.780
And in explaining how they did it,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.750
their CEO cited a well developed
electronic health record and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.110
went onto describe how it reduced
unnecessary duplication of services

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
by making information available to all
providers caring for each patient.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.230
In fact, Marshfield developed
the EHR system they were using,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.110
and in April 2015,
at the largest health IT industry

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.840
meeting held each year called HIMS,
they introduced a very innovative

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.190
new version of it that combines the
traditional charting functions of an EHR

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.350
with fully integrated population health
tools to better manage chronic disease

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.230
patients like Marla when
they aren't in the office.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.340
They also added fully integrated
analytics so that physicians could

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.160
easily understand the overall quality
of care being delivered by them to all

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.120
their patients and
a fully integrated patient portal so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.790
that Marla could engage with
her physicians in her care.
