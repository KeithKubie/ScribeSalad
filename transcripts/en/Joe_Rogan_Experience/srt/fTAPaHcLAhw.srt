1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Hmm.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,260
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,480
And we're going live.
Yes sir.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,150
[inaudible] your social media people
love you, Bro. People love you too. Oh,

5
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:17,850

now. So we've, we've uh, God, Oh,

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,370
what's the word? Gawked what's the word
when you are gold over someone's body?

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,200
Sure. Dude, you got jacked.
Skinny to shredded. Yeah. Yep.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,420
You're pretty serious about MMA training,
man.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,360
It's really just about like the lifestyle,
you know what I mean?

10
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,400
You're a martial artist, so, you know,

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,320
freak in the mind and the body
and the soul go together. So yeah,

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,090
for sure. These things I'm
learning about them. Um,

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,560
I'm able to put them all together.

14
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:45,940
You can't be a complete person until
everything is together. So, um, you know,

15
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:49,660
spiritually I've already
ascended above my peers.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,190
Now I'm taking my body up there.

17
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,230
How are you doing spiritually
through that giant jug?

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,040
A weed you got on the table.
Exactly. Yeah. They have. Yeah.

19
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,810
For the folks who only listen with his,

20
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:03,430
brought literally like a mason jar
held with we. Yeah. Yup, Yup, Yup.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,360
It is like halfway for a
specific strains that you like.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,630
They asked smoke the KK Khalifa
Kush. Oh, you've got your
own shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

23
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,580
absolutely. Because I got tired of
smoking or different types of weed. Um,

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,980
it's like a drink. You know
what I'm saying? Like alcohol,

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,780
people only drink dark liquor. Whiskey
or I only smoke cocaine. Only take care.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,430
Yup. If you mix it up though,
you'll get a big hit. Right.

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,120
Have you switch it up to somebody
else's stuff? You're like woo,

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,380
the body's not ready for it. In my head
will go crazy. Like I'll really feel it.

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:37,070
You'll see me like over in the
cornerstone, so I only have this smoke.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,370
KK, that's it. That's the weird
thing about, we'd write it like you,

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,120
you get used to a certain strain.
Yeah.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,450
Like I'll get physically like
ill if I don't smoke my strain,

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,110
I'll get runny nose coughing. Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,790
I need an Ekka. Wow. Yeah. Yup.
How much do you smoke a day?

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,950
Probably a ounce. Like the cool
is we burned in the cooldowns.

36
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,000
How about you? I don't
smoke that much. Yeah, no.

37
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,640
Like a joint while I got
joint a day. I'm like, yeah,

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,900
I would think that you were like
just getting stoned all day.

39
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,190
I get stoned all day when I
don't have shit to do. Got You.

40
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,320
But if I have too much shit
to I get stoned all day.
That shit doesn't get done.

41
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,950
Oh you said you like blitz.
Yeah.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,110
White light blues cause the little tobacco
gives you like this little extra high.

43
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,030
Yep. I'm glad you admitted it. Yeah. No
people who smoked blessed, they don't,

44
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:33,031
some of them they don't know that their
tobacco inc and they try to mask it and

45
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,890
say no,
you know it's a leaf and it's like no bro.

46
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,790
You like tobacco is tobacco with
weed? Yep. It's all like a combo high.

47
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
It cuts it a little bit too.
I like it before I go on stage.

48
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,070
That's my favorite before I go on stage.

49
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,590
That's certainly a little pickup but a
little bit high but a little like, Yay,

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,270
I'm happy how legal weed is these
days because it's like I would, I,

51
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:58,030
my son had a spring concert yesterday and
I would feel like shit back in the day

52
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:01,480
walking in there smelling like bud had,
cause he goes to the private school,

53
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,260
let me know this reflection
on him. Yeah. So it's like,

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,320
you know you got the weed head dad,
Blah Blah Blah and other things.

55
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,350
But it's like nowadays I should just cool
like no one cares. Nobody gives a fuck.

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,920
I've seen it happen cause I have a 22
year old daughter but then I also have an

57
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:19,150
11 and a nine year old and with the 22
year old when she was growing up it was

58
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:23,950
all weird. It was weird. It was like you
were a loser for smoking weed lay dates.

59
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,080
You know what I'm saying?
People coming over your house.

60
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,390
You got weed at the house.
Yeah Bro. Parents get weird.

61
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,180
I live like right up the
street from the school.

62
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,070
So like I'm getting real technical
with it. Like I'm in a school zone.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,840
You know what I'm saying?

64
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:41,920
Like legitimately like I
could be not here right now.

65
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,450
Incarcerated for real lady. They locked
up today in Dallas. Did you see that shit?

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,230
Nah, no. I See lady a grandmother. They
locked her up cause she had CBD on her.

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,060
Yeah, she was a Dallas airport
outside even psychoactive.

68
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:58,530
And I think she had the oil like
first skin. Right. [inaudible] hey,

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,730
it's just ridiculous.
She's a old lady,

70
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,920
old lady who needs it
for arthritis as trading.

71
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,570
My wife's mom uses it for arthritis. It's
great. So older folks, Shit, my, uh, my,

72
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,280
I started to call her my ex baby's mom.
She's still my baby's mom,

73
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,530
but she has another baby on the
way in or a new relationship.

74
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,670
But she's able to take a CBD during
her pregnancy to help her, uh,

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,110
her nausea and all of that stuff. I was
like, why would you hate on CBD Bro? No,

76
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,350
it's amazing. It's the shit. It's,
my friend's son had some seizures.

77
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:30,100
He has like some sort of an epileptic
seizure, gives them CBD. It's gone.

78
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,980
He said every day he doesn't have them
anymore. That's amazing. I love that.

79
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,670
It's incredible. It's so good. It's
almost, you feel like you're lying, right.

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,940
Does so many different things that when
you talk about weed you feel like you're

81
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,000
lying. Yeah. I mean like these
days, in this day and age,

82
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,380
I was just telling somebody the other day,
smoking pot is going to be old school.

83
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,510
Like, you know what I mean?
We're still going to do it,

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,960
but it's totally moving
towards just ingesting it,

85
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,150
rubbing it on and all that shit sprays
so people just scared of it and it works.

86
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah. Like fuck. Like, you know what I
mean? The thing about the animals though,

87
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,680
it puts you in a weird place if
you get too much. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,870
I've seen some people melt down.
Edibles are crazy.

89
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:12,390
So I got a homie who just took a THC
pill yesterday and he was talking about

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,950
types of Shit. Like that shit knocked
him out. He's probably still asleep,

91
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,990
but yeah, the edibles fuck you up.
You do edibles. Yeah, I do. But yeah,

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,810
I've had some bad experiences
like someone, not bad but like,

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,910
like completely lost touch with this
dimension. Damn. You know what I'm saying?

94
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,760
Like I had a friend who may THC pills.
Yep.

95
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,300
And I was taking him at a party once and
it was a party for a Jujitsu tournament.

96
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:41,350
So cause there was a Jujitsu tournament
and then there was this party afterwards

97
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,720
and by the time the pills would kick in,

98
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,690
I have no idea how much it was in there
cause he was like some handmade shit

99
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,090
that this guy put together himself.
A little capsules that you buy.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,110
It was as high as I've ever been in my
life to the point where I wasn't even

101
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:53,831
seeing people.

102
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:58,070
I was seeing like a two dimensional cut
out of the person and behind them I was

103
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:03,071
seeing like their true intentions
are so like a really high fuck.

104
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,720
And I was talking to this
one dude and he was just,

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,290
he was a high level Jujitsu
guy was who was a really odd,

106
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,000
it was a very strange feeling.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I got talking to this cat then I'm like
a month later he was on the run for

108
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,970
rape. Yeah. He uh,

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,300
raped some woman and then he escaped
and then he was so addicted to Jujitsu.

110
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,580
The story was that he started
training again with a fake name,

111
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,700
but he was like this high level black
belt. And there's only that this,

112
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,820
especially back then when this happens,
it's like the early two thousands,

113
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,760
there's only a certain number of high
level black belts that are running around.

114
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,091
Right.

115
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:42,800
So he put on this fake Brazilian name
and started training and like the Pacific

116
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,100
northwest, but he's strangling black belts
and everybody's like, what the fuck is,

117
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,010
who is this guy? So people ask, hey,

118
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,120
someone took a picture of
him and I go with that. Guys
want it for right. Oh Shit.

119
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,540
But I remember talking to him on
these THC pills being like, like some,

120
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,590
there's some wiring that's not correct.
Oh fuck yeah.

121
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,370
Damn dog. That's an whoa. Yeah.

122
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,250
THC pills. They expose things they
do, Bro. I did mushrooms in it.

123
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,900
Exposed there yet. Do you
do shrimps? Yeah, yeah, Yup.

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,900
I fuck with mushrooms because that's
what happened with me when I was on

125
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,291
mushrooms.

126
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:23,240
I was able to see people's true intentions
because being a rapper and shit like

127
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,030
that, you know, you'd be
having to peel back the layers,

128
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,690
layers and layers and layers and I
was trying to peel my own layers back.

129
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,940
It just for my own shore personal
every way I ended up. Yeah. Yup.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,780
And I ended up being like backstage
somewhere and I was like fuck. I was like,

131
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,620
I'm around all these people and like
I really see the true intentions.

132
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,500
Then there was like,
I see what crowd they are and it was like,

133
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,100
I felt like I was separated,
you know what I mean?

134
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,310
I mean it was like I was on a boat all
the way out here and they were on the,

135
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:56,120
on a all on an island party and
then I was like, damn, yeah,

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,130
I can see what's going on over there.
But it was cool.

137
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,940
Like I do mushrooms every now and then.
I don't fuck with it all the time.

138
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,920
I haven't done them in like three years
because they help you see shit like that.

139
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,060
So it's like for me, I'll
take that experience and
I'll just live with it. Yeah.

140
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,950
I don't need to keep going
through it over and over.

141
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,230
Like you've probably seen that
dude and was like, oh shit.

142
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,490
Now I know people who are rapey.
As soon as I see him,

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,200
I knew he was dangerous. Like he
was a legitimately dangerous person.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Like not just saying Bro, not just to
train killer, but he was dangerous.

145
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,480
Like the way he thought about things.
Oh,

146
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,020
that's why there's people like that
out there. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you,

147
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,380
you don't know until you experience it.

148
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,300
And that was a mild experience compared
to most people's counters to psychos out

149
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,300
there. Fucking crazy
motherfuckers bro. I know, I know.

150
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:48,800
Just probably in fighting too.

151
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:52,850
That's why I feel like more people need
to like smoke weed and a and train.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,250
I think so too because it balances.
Training's great man.

153
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,430
He alleviates all that
shit with most people.

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,250
But there's going to be some dude's
just like that guy that are just,

155
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,020
they're just out there. It's taken it
to that level, like, yeah, yeah. Yup.

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,580
That's crazy. When you think about the
world of fighting and competition, I mean,

157
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,550
you're dealing with people that are
taking the biggest risks. They don't,

158
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,880
they don't have to do that. Right. This is
like a choice. Right. They can get a job.

159
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,863
The choices.

160
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,100
I want to get a job trying to fuck up
other people who have a job trying to fuck

161
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:26,890
up people. The killers, the
trained killers is going after
each other. Right, right.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,230
And when you're around those dudes,
one of the things you want,

163
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:31,160
one of the things you realize
very early on you have,

164
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,040
you can have your preconceived
notions about them being like, Meh.

165
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,650
Like mean people are violent people.
They're people of character. Yes, sir.

166
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,730
You have to have extreme character
to pull off what they do. Yeah. Yup.

167
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,590
There's some of the best people I've ever
met in my life are fighters. Yep. Yep.

168
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,780
They, they're, they're a
different breed of human being.
Yeah. They chose that path.

169
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,000
They chose it, knows no one's
forcing them or not in more. Right.

170
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,430
They decide to go and do that. And that's
why it's so exciting to watch. Right,

171
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,420
right. Cause you know that they're
putting everything on the line. Right.

172
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,210
I look at it like, like
you said, they chose that.

173
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:08,040
So to become an athlete to, to choose
to fight, you know what I mean?

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,420
Like, and a lot of them are
really, like you said, smart,

175
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,050
they're technical and especially how the
sport is developing these days because

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,890
people don't want the longterm damage,
but they want to still like,

177
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,150
you know what I mean?
Go hard.

178
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:24,990
So they're coming up with fucking
all types of ways to do this shit.

179
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,150
And it's like,
at the end of the day,

180
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:31,680
you have to be creative or you have to
have some type of something up here.

181
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,120
You know what I mean? You're
not just fighting to be
fighting, you know? So yeah,

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,400
I think they all go in and for the
same reason, they're all there.

183
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,050
They're trying to find out if they can
do it right and the beginning get up and

184
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:44,320
they have a just a drive to prove
that they're the best. Right.

185
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,580
I was just talking to somebody
the other day about that. Um,

186
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,810
it was like a crazy argument because
they were saying how fight fans are just

187
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:59,160
there for knockouts and I was like, you
definitely have your, your knockout fans.

188
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,230
It's was like, those are probably
the people who pay the most.

189
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,600
You know what I mean?
It's like, but I was like,

190
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:07,410
you got to give credit to a lot of people
who understand fighting and love it

191
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,520
and are viewing it for that aspect.
It's like, yeah, you know, when you,

192
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,630
you watch football, like a lot of
people played football and you know,

193
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:19,020
wished they could have been that
person on the field. They just haven't,

194
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,900
you know what I mean? So I was
trying to explain to him, I was like,

195
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,990
it was a huge crowd of people who
actually know about this shit and who are

196
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,030
knowledgeable in those people support it
as well. It was weird. Yeah. I feel you.

197
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,530
I know exactly what you're saying.

198
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,680
There's some people that just want to
see people get beat up and some people

199
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:38,040
didn't want to see Floyd Mayweather
duck punches. Right. You know,

200
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,820
one of the best things about
Floyd Mayweather and Canelo
wasn't that Floyd beat

201
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:46,470
Canelo up. He out boxed him. Right.
But he showed this level of defense.

202
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,520
If you're a boxing fan, you're like
Jesus Christ. Like he knows everything.

203
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,354
That's comment.
Yep.

204
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,170
He's always in the right angle is always
one step ahead and that's why he's so

205
00:11:56,171 --> 00:12:00,610
good. His defenses Floyd's
only been hit like a few times.

206
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,470
His whole career. Really hard. See
like Shane hit him a couple times. Uh,

207
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,490
was it my Donna,

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,360
Donna hit him really hard one and they
fucking like save the clip and play it

209
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:14,500
over and over. Just cause
like so he can be hit. Yeah.

210
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,700
Really think about other boxers, how much
they get hit and compared to the flu.

211
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,760
I love watching that. I love watching
someone who could move like that.

212
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,400
My favorite fighter to watch the
UFC was mighty mouse. [inaudible]

213
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,440
not just because he was the best
pound for pound fighter on the planet,

214
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,040
but because he was not getting hit right.

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,200
He was occasionally someone would tell
like John May org attacked him on the

216
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,750
straight leg.
Occasionally some guys hit him,

217
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,930
but most times things are just grazing.
Yeah. Things are getting blocked. Right.

218
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,260
Even if he gets hit, he's
moving. He's a puzzle. Right?

219
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:49,930
Like if you're a fan of martial arts,
you want to see the master of the puzzle.

220
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,020
Exactly. Hell yeah. And I don't,

221
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,390
I don't count them people out and I
wouldn't fucking sit in front of the dude

222
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:01,660
and let him just be like,
oh yeah, everybody will see
knockouts like, Nah Bro.

223
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,740
Like it's not like that fail. I think
everybody likes both things though.

224
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,560
It's like when you get like
Arturo Gotti versus Micky Ward,

225
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,040
did you ever see that fight?
Uh, I will have to track.

226
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,760
It was a trilogy of fucking wars
between these two guys that weren't not

227
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,653
champion.
They were,

228
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,320
they were like one step below at
the time of their career being like

229
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:24,630
championship level. So they weren't like
in threat of fighting for the title.

230
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,720
No one talked through like Floyd was
better than both of them by far. Right.

231
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,980
But what they were doing was showing
the two guys that are similarly talented

232
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,860
can put on like the most entertaining
fight in the world. It was incredible.

233
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:41,200
It's crazy to watch it back
and forth, back forth. I
like watching that too. Yeah.

234
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,230
Yup. You know? Yeah. I want to
see a good fight. Me Personally,

235
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:48,280
I like watching both things.
I like watching someone
just completely Willie pep,

236
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:52,660
somebody just like pronounced Whitaker
used to do. Yeah. Yup. He's a great boxer.

237
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,750
He couldn't hit him. Nope.
He was so slick. Nope.

238
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,500
You know when you can only do that for
so long, like in any sport, you know,

239
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,640
it'd be at the top for so long.

240
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,370
Watch those performances when
those guys were at the top,

241
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,500
that shows you what's possible.
Hell yeah.

242
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,100
And it's just good to see somebody
like master their craft to, yeah.

243
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,510
Cause you see him come up like you watch
him be I and then it's like they become

244
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,810
the shit and it's like, oh yeah,
that, you know what I mean?

245
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,440
I seen this dude like start from just
being okay and now he's just fucking shit

246
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,710
up. You see them learn and you see them
develop and all of that stuff is fun.

247
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:24,910
Like you grow with them.

248
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,330
That's a good combination of
getting to the bottom of shit.

249
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:33,190
His weed and martial arts, that's
a good combination. 100% really is,

250
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,310
I do like a lot of my thinking is just
from like after I train I just sit there

251
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,640
and just think about nothing.
But you know what I mean?

252
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,200
Ideas come to me how to deal with
situations, you know what I mean?

253
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:51,440
Because it just, I don't know. It just
happens like that just flows. Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,303
It flows

255
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,910
and I think like the training helps
you get all the bullshit off your back,

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,630
right? Hell yeah. Right. Yeah.
Yup. Especially for me too,

257
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:04,631
cause like I party a lot and I'm
in the studio till like five,

258
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,420
six in the morning.
I'm drinking and stuff like that.

259
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,980
So to just be going down that path and
doing that every day, bro, I look crazy.

260
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll feel crazy. Like I have to
get that off of me, like out of me.

261
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,270
You know what I mean? Yeah.
That's why your gym is crazy.

262
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:24,050
But I need to do something like that for
myself. It's nice to have at some point.

263
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,850
Like that's how I look
at you like the old g.

264
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,640
So it's like I'm not going to
go do it tomorrow. Like, hey,

265
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:33,170
everybody built me a gym. But you
know, eventually that's the goal.

266
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:36,820
When I look back, I'll be like, I seen
Joe's gym in us. That's what made dude,

267
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,310
you train hard. I've seen your
videos. Yeah. I get to work.

268
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,060
You work at an unbreakable, your
spot. That's a great gym. Yeah.

269
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:48,680
It's a really good gym. Uh, Jay
Glazer. Yeah. He owns that spot. Very,

270
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,100
very impressive place. He put together
an awesome place. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool.

271
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,670
The team there is good. Um, like I said,

272
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:59,870
it's not all about like just fighting and
being, you know, the biggest, baddest,

273
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,080
meanest motherfucker.
Like they really taught me about my body.

274
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,640
That's what they do. They teach you there,
whatever your goals are, they bring you,

275
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,620
you know, up to that
speed. So it was like,

276
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,180
I weighed like 140 pounds ever since I
got out of high school and I was like,

277
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,500
fuck,
I gotta get some ways.

278
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,290
They helped me out and does it snoop
train there too. This is video.

279
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,720
Snoop sparring. He's fine. Daniel
Seraphim. Daniel's fucking crazy.

280
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,660
Yeah, I know that guy. He was
fights before. He said tank.

281
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,920
He is crazy. You like guys a
tank. Nuts. His thing is like, Yo,

282
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,400
I gotta get hit. I'm
like, all right Daniel.

283
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,810
You know he's got to get
him to wake himself up. Wow.

284
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,840
There is those hits and his barn with
them. Yeah. The soup was going at it.

285
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,340
So he's trying to take him out.
Dude.

286
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:49,760
Snoop throw some good shots of them
right there. Yeah. Snoop skills.

287
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,690
He really does. I'm glad Daniel
Duck that one. Yeah. I mean,

288
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,960
let him smoke. I guarantee you snoop
Dogg. That's funny right there.

289
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,660
A lot of people in the regular
fist fight. Yeah, he's tall.

290
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,380
His Shit to look at him and at him
like that. Look at those arms. Yeah,

291
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,440
bit. Ugh. Ah, you can
look pat. Go ahead snoop.

292
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,170
So that was ah,
that Seraphin kinds of tank.

293
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,310
Yeah. He fought in UFC for awhile. They're
still fighting. Still active. Yeah.

294
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,680
I think he's in Brazil
right now. Yeah. Yup.

295
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,300
He was working at the gym for
a minute. Then he, I guess
he chilled out. Yeah. It's,

296
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,620
anyway, my point was the videos. It's
nice to see because you're training hard,

297
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,540
like watching you do more time.
Get the pads.

298
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,910
You're really putting in work on this,
sir. Yeah. Yeah. It's a everyday thing.

299
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,990
It's a journey. Like, you know what I
mean? I'm just trying to learn. Ernie.

300
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,910
Ernie Reyes is my, uh, oh shit I sent
you. I right there. That was fun.

301
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,650
He was teaching me some stuff.

302
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,260
Why was early though? I suck
right there. It's still though.

303
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,320
Do you are sparring right there with
one of the greatest Muay Thai fighters,

304
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:01,770
if not the greatest of all time. Yeah.
Dues. Super tiny. He's amazing. Yeah,

305
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:06,510
he's really good. His videos
like highlights. You ever
see that jumping left?

306
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:11,180
Switch kick. He knocked that dude out with
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Outstanding.

307
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,200
Crazy kick. So how cool is that man, you,

308
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:17,910
you're sparring with one of the
greatest of all time. It's fun as fuck.

309
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,830
Cause it's like those people like, you
know about fighters, they're the majority.

310
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,820
Like you said when you meet them
they, they're cool as hell. Yeah.

311
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,730
So to meet him and him not wanting to
whoop my ass or like tell me like, hey,

312
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,960
you look goofy.
Sit down.

313
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,150
He's like showing me shit that I could
use later. So it was like, it was cool.

314
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,570
Well the Thais have a really interesting
way of sparring. Some of them do,

315
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:42,570
they play right.
They don't hit each other full blast.

316
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,000
They're like tap and they'd
laugh around and joke around.

317
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:48,000
They're just developing their timing
cause they fight so often. Yep.

318
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,090
John Wayne Pars,
a friend of mine from Australia,

319
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:54,640
multiple time world champion
and he, you know, he would, uh,

320
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,160
talk in depth about how they would play.
They just play. They just hit each other.

321
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:03,150
Just slap each other a little bit and
then you like that way they get understand

322
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:03,961
the timing of it,

323
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:07,230
but they never worry about it and they
don't get hurt and they can do it all the

324
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,180
time.
It's a really smart way to do it.

325
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,900
But you'll see guys like Seraphina and
he's capable of doing that so he could

326
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,300
spar with a guy like snoop
or it got like sand track.

327
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,220
It's barley with the guy like
you and just play with you.

328
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,970
Everybody just have a good time and it's
fun at the end. Yep. Super Fun. Yeah. Yup,

329
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,910
Yup. Hell yeah. Definitely
seen that a lot.

330
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:28,370
Like on Instagram and even with my
trainers, we'll do it like mid, early.

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,260
We was just doing that yesterday where
it's like developing the timing of the

332
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:36,150
kicks where it's like, you kicked me,
I kick you, I can't you, you kick me,

333
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:40,020
I kicked you twice, you kicked me three
times. I kick you was like you said,

334
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:43,020
just play it around. Yeah. And like
when you got a good sparring partner,

335
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:45,350
you can take care of each other.
Exactly. Don't hurt each other.

336
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,340
There's no ego involved and
the ties they do like knees,

337
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:54,000
they'll, they'll need the fuck out of each
other. Like it looks like kind of hard,

338
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:57,580
but they're just making
their bodies harder like you
said for later because it's

339
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,130
like they're used to it.

340
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,340
A lot of times they'll slap each other
with the side of their leg to write in

341
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,250
and really drive the knee
and you'll just hear yeah,

342
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,470
they're just slapping
each other a little bit.

343
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,450
But it's obviously it's very effective.
Like they figured something out.

344
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,780
You got some crazy kicks.
Thank you. Yeah, I seen uh,

345
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,180
what was it a sidekick that you did?
Probably turning sidekick. Yeah.

346
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,460
You gotta teach me then I'll
teach you that. Yeah, I want that.

347
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,340
I just need the form because I'm learning
just a regular psyche like a slide,

348
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,260
you know what I mean?
Go to like a taekwondo school.

349
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,840
They'd be the best at showing you how
to do. I'll definitely show you how,

350
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,070
but if you need a place to train,
find like a really good taekwondo school.

351
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,090
Cause one thing talk window has some
things that you know won't work in MMA.

352
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,510
If you're adding take downs
and punches to the face,

353
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,780
but because they don't punch to the face
and tournaments you get used to doing

354
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:50,680
crazy, cacs crazier. They have a lot of
weird, a lot of weird leg dexterity stuff.

355
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,450
And if you get good at that stuff,
I think that's a good,

356
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,670
I had a kid that wanted to fight,

357
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,050
I would say let's just do some kill
cushion or some taekwondo first.

358
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,790
Just do some karate. Something where you
develop in leg dexterity. Paleo, Dan,

359
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,400
as you get a little older than
move you into Moitai. Right.

360
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,390
So you could do both things because if
someone's caught you when guys are like

361
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,770
constantly chopping at the legs,

362
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,030
they never really developed the kind of
spinning kicks that you guys do where

363
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,930
they don't kick the legs.

364
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,020
Those are the guys that developed the
best spinning kicks cause it's so easy to

365
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,660
chop the legs and effective
the chop the legs out.

366
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,110
So a lot of those techniques don't really
get that dialed in to the level that

367
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:29,770
they get dialed in from a taekwondo guy
cause they can't kick each other in the

368
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,180
legs. Right, right, right, right.

369
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,360
It's kind of a dumb way to fight
cause you should kick the legs,

370
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,810
but at the end of the day it,

371
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,860
it allowed them to develop some crazy
shit and a lot of weird spinning stuff

372
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:42,640
spilling.
Know

373
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,070
some of those guys are so fast
and the powers insane. Yeah, yeah.

374
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:52,330
Cause just all momentum in torque
and book crazy shit. But it's just,

375
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,980
it's hard to develop,
right?

376
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,730
It's hard to develop those texts like
a lot of posture and you gotta really,

377
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,270
you gotta be balanced and you
got that knee is everything.

378
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,460
You gotta that Shit how you aim it.

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,060
So it's like when you're spinning or
even if you're just standing there,

380
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,830
you have to have correct posture and
to be able to do a couple of kicks.

381
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,431
Like you said,

382
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,431
it's like a lot going sh
coming at somebody spending
blitz and doing all types

383
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,680
of Shit.
So it's different for show,

384
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,670
it's really good for your balance to
do that as a young kid than learn some

385
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,760
other shit later. Right.
You'll have balance. Yeah.

386
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,130
That's what I've seen when you kicked
the fuck out of that show was like

387
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,110
yellowish, like really balanced and
straight. Like, you know what I mean? The,

388
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,480
the tech, cause a lot of people
you might be strong as fuck,

389
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,200
but you could see technique. Right, right,
right. You know what I mean? And this,

390
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,490
if you do the shit over and over
and over and really perfected,

391
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,890
that's different than just
being able to throw a strong
cake. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Um,

392
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,940
techniques, everything man that
way in Jujitsu so that way.

393
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,190
And it's gotta be that way in music.
It's going to be that way in everything.

394
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,280
Yeah, definitely. Man. I'm in a
studio like all the time practicing,

395
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,260
like I could write a song
before this interview's over,

396
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,090
but that's because I practice,
you know,

397
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:11,290
it's not because like I'm the
most lyrical person in the world.

398
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,740
It's like I just fucking rap every
day. Like, you know what I mean?

399
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:18,700
So it should come easy.
So when you write,

400
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,140
do you write things out or do you,
do you do it out in your head? Like,

401
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,600
I know Jay z supposedly
doesn't write anything. Right.

402
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,660
It just keeps it all in his head,
which is incredible.

403
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,460
It's awesome that he can do
that. Right? It's kind of
insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yup. I have,

404
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,230
I have different processes. So like
for me, I kind of, I've melodies,

405
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,300
like I'll sing and I'll wrap.

406
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,980
So it's a lot easier for me to just
have a melody in my head and make

407
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,010
up the words as I go.
But if I'm writing lyrics,

408
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,320
like writing words down
where I actually wrap it,

409
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,820
that's when I'm going to use the paper,
you know?

410
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,290
But there's different ways
to do it because I honestly,

411
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,170
this is what my studio set up looks like.
It's like a chair.

412
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,460
The Mike is right here.

413
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,640
I don't go in the booth for anything
in my engineer's sitting right there.

414
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,210
So it's like we're, we're
coming up with it as, as we go.

415
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,810
Like I'll take a little break, just write
something down and then I just jumped,

416
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,150
jumped straight back on it.
You know what I mean?

417
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,280
So there's different techniques though.

418
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,800
Cause a lot of the Times
sometimes I won't write shit.

419
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,300
I'll just go and just make it up
and just keep going, keep flowing.

420
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,410
Or there's times where I could just lay
a melody and then write the words to it

421
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:30,650
later. So it's just different,
you know, ways to approach it.

422
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,500
So you just do it based on
however you feel that day,

423
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,980
whatever to track really calls for.
It's like if,

424
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,390
if the song is something that I get
instinct inspiration, I'm like, oh,

425
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:42,590
I'm a knock it out right now.

426
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,990
Or if some that I want to
live with for a little bit,

427
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,370
I'll just do as much as I'm happy with
at that point and then move on to the

428
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:53,540
next thing, come back to it later and
just make sure everything is fresh.

429
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:57,590
I like to keep everything fresh,
keep it fun, keep it loose.

430
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:01,370
And I don't really overthink anything.
If it's not there, then I just go,

431
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,230
go away from it and find something
that's more fun. Hell yeah,

432
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,550
that's a, it's a beautiful freedom
to be able to do that. You know,

433
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,680
obviously pick the right fucking job.

434
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,880
I swear like, you know, it's,
it's, uh, it's work because I,

435
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm always looking for what's next.
You know what I mean? For the fans,

436
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,980
for the listeners, for the people who
supported me all the way to this point,

437
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,200
right. Like, okay, I got to push
myself, I've got to do what's next.

438
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:33,640
I gotta it's gotta be crazy. You know
what I mean? I've got a son, he's sick.

439
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:35,300
So I was like,
I got to impress him.

440
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,170
I couldn't have him just listening to a
whole bunch of other rappers and not my

441
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,910
music. So I was like, yeah.

442
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah. It's uh, you know,

443
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,010
it is an interesting responsibility
you have, right? Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,750
And a guy like you becomes
famous to interesting.

445
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,590
Like you have so many people that want,
you know,

446
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:59,890
and I think we need to call it a
different thing other than work. Yeah.

447
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,610
Cause it's like there's work, like,
fuck, I work for ups. Yeah. That's cool.

448
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:07,240
They've got good benefits,
but that's work. Right. But
what you're doing is like,

449
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,430
you love it. Yeah. Hell yeah. You know,

450
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:12,610
when you love something and almost we
needed better word. Yeah. For sure.

451
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:16,120
It's the same word as working at
Mcdonald's. The same word work,

452
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,050
work. Uh, mark. The word would
be you need a better word,

453
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,480
like a passion project and able to
do what you want to do. Exactly.

454
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:29,080
Whatever that thing is. Yeah. Yup. No, I
believe that that's, that's a good point.

455
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,580
Cause it's not the same work.
That's not the same thing. No,

456
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,240
it's not the same thing we needed. We've
done a work put in the work. Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,240
That's why we had shit

458
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,750
job at, in your life. You know what that
is? That's work. Yeah. We put in the work.

459
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,090
We've done that,
but saying I'm going to work.

460
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,210
When you go on to do something you
love, you're excited about. Yeah. It's,

461
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,550
we need a better word. Yeah.
That's why I think. No, it's true.

462
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,580
That's why people get pissed at me.
They're not going to work.

463
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,920
It is a hundred girls there.

464
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,450
[inaudible]

465
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,820
Bro.
I had to punch in just like you.

466
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,120
Yeah. And that sense, the world
is just not fair. You know,

467
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,520
some people's jobs are not the same.
Yeah.

468
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,290
I mean fuck you stop and think about
how fortunate you are. Yeah, Yup.

469
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,490
Yeah. I thank God every day, Bro.
Beautiful all the time. Cause it is,

470
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,383
it is a blessing.

471
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,390
I'm literally like last night I'm like
right in a song and the only problem that

472
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:33,030
I had was like a girls as was right on me

473
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,400
and I was like, baby, like I, I'm
enjoying this as much as you are,

474
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,230
but I gotta like physically,
right.

475
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,090
So it's like your ass is like moving
my arm around. Like you can do that,

476
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,980
but just right there,
you know what I mean?

477
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:49,110
Like I know and I started thinking
about it, I was like, wow,

478
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:51,780
these are my problems.
Like yeah, that's cool.

479
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,090
Just snapped a little bit of discipline.
I'm cool with that.

480
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,500
That's amazing. Well, I'm cool with that
for sure. That's amazing. Yeah. Yup.

481
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,470
And the song got written so
we beautiful job got done.

482
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,900
Yeah. That's it. There's another word,
right? [inaudible] you were off work here.

483
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,070
You're working, obviously you've been
working at it, but it needs a better word,

484
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,080
a nobler word. The fans will come
up with the word for shorter.

485
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:24,340
They're way more creative. You've got
way more time on their hands. Yeah,

486
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,430
I think they will figure it out and
we'll report back for show. Find it.

487
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,070
I did just make sense. There's no way.
It's the same thing. It can't be, Nah,

488
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,280
hell Nah for show. Nope. Yeah,

489
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,410
and that's why I was telling people when
people always try to think down there

490
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:46,530
was trying to think, man, that's easy for
you to say or not everybody can make it.

491
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,280
Yeah, you're right. Not Everybody can
truth, but maybe you can write like,

492
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,610
what do you, what does that mean?
Not Everybody can. Everybody can.

493
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:56,130
Everybody's going to do everything that
everybody's going to walk to the top of

494
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:58,530
the hill. That's the thing. Some
people are gonna stop halfway and go,

495
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:03,150
I can't do things. That's the thing.
People limit themselves in a crazy way.

496
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,480
They're like, oh yeah, everybody can't
do it. It's like you said, it's like, no,

497
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:09,960
everybody can't do it. It takes
a lot. You know what I mean?

498
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:14,190
You gotta fucking go through the Shit
to get it. But when you get there,

499
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:19,050
it looks awesome. Right? So yeah.
I mean fuck, it's whatever it is.

500
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,220
Try to figure it out and go
do it. Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

501
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,530
Like you said at the top of the hill,
it looks great,

502
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:30,330
but some people settle for the middle.
Yeah.

503
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,340
And they get mad if people get to
the top. This motherfucker, you know,

504
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,850
they get mad. Yeah. Yup. At the top, man,

505
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,040
there's no one who's like you.
It doesn't work hard. Right.

506
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,880
So that's the myth, right? That's the
thing too. It's like, man, it's a, again,

507
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:50,650
the wrong word for it, right.
Passion, hard, whatever it is. I mean,

508
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:54,760
you dedicated to your craft
and maintaining it is,
there's an art to that, right?

509
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,450
Because you work so freaking
hard to get to where you're at.

510
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,950
And then you get there and it's like, oh
fuck, what do I do? Like there's no rest.

511
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,731
There's no rest.

512
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:08,500
And everything that was acceptable
before becomes unacceptable because now

513
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:13,060
you're up here. Uh, you know what I
mean? So it's like, yeah, you have to,

514
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,390
you have to, you have to pick your shots
and like, you know what I'm saying?

515
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,570
Can't really like, just go crazy
like you did back in the day.

516
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,120
So there's a art to it,
you know what I mean?

517
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:26,830
And that's how you really maintain and
stay in that spot and even level up.

518
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,960
So do you consciously think,
okay,

519
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,910
a balance out enjoyment with things
that I have to do to stay disciplined?

520
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,500
100% yeah, 100% that's a very smart
way of looking at it. Yeah. Yup.

521
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,030
100% like those,

522
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,990
there has to be a balance of each
because it's like, all right,

523
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,710
now I'm at this new level.

524
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,500
Like whether I want to behave like
this or not. I put myself here,

525
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,420
I worked hard, now I'm with these
elite motherfuckers. So this is the,

526
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,990
this is how I have to act because
I'm not down here anymore.

527
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,700
I worked from here to get here.
So what happens? You balanced,

528
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,200
you put things into place,

529
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,160
you do a little bit of this little
bit of that instead of a lot of that,

530
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,180
you know what I mean?

531
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,400
And you just pick your shots and it's
like you're going to get everything in the

532
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:19,210
end. This is how it's just
planning how it's supposed to be,

533
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,930
but you just piece it together
just a little bit differently.

534
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:25,720
Like I just turned 31 walk down.

535
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,390
I'm about to be 32 as young too.

536
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,790
A lot of people that's old
to some people as well,

537
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,170
but for me it's like there's a whole
new mind state, you know what I mean?

538
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,910
And I feel like through my twenties I
was actually like a fucking teenager and

539
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:44,170
like now I'm an adult. So now I look
at things a little bit differently.

540
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,940
It's like, Yo, I was really a kid.

541
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,540
This is how you behave as an
adult for the rest of your life.

542
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,310
And it still involves a whole
bunch of partying and having fun,

543
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:58,450
but the business gets handled and things
get approached totally differently.

544
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,640
That's a balanced way of looking
at it. Man, I love it. Enjoy it.

545
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,300
That's how they think too.
Like people have to understand too,

546
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,600
to be someone like you,

547
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,660
to be a very successful rapper and to
not expect you to live the way you talk

548
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:20,830
about all the time. It's so
ridiculous. Right, right, right, right.

549
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,980
Like you don't think he wants to party.
He's talking about partying all the time.

550
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,690
I think he wants to party [inaudible]
party. This is just an act. Yeah. Yeah.

551
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,200
It's weird. Right? It's
crazy as fuck because people,

552
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,680
they want you to be you. They want me
to be myself. Right. They want to party.

553
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,070
They didn't want

554
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,060
to take shots. They want to smoke weed.
They want to stay up all night. Yeah.

555
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,700
Why is that bad?
It's not so many people want to do it,

556
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,710
but it gives us a image in some
people's minds like frivolous life.

557
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,940
[inaudible] frivolous thinking,
partying [inaudible] what are you doing?

558
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,940
Drinking and smoking.
What are you enjoying yourself?

559
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,480
And then they come around and do
the same thing cause they want it.

560
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,990
It's like I have like a weird place in
life where I think I'm like the key to a

561
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:13,100
lot of shit because it's like
if you want to enjoy yourself,

562
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm a guy. You know what
I mean? It's like, aw man,

563
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:18,350
I'm just fucking going to live
through wisdom. It shows up.

564
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:19,430
He's going to light the joint.

565
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,820
It's going to be amazing if you
want to fucking be professional,

566
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,800
like especially in what I do,

567
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:29,270
because there's a whole lot of
rappers who like aren't business,

568
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,390
you know what I mean?
They're not thinking like that.

569
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,930
So for those guys, I'm
their guy. Like they're,

570
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,660
they look at me like where's
has his shit together?

571
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:43,490
Like he really handles his
business. He talks to people,
he shows up, he does this,

572
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:47,300
he does that. So to be the
party guy and the business guy,

573
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,080
it's like amazing. You
know what I mean? It's a,

574
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:55,760
it's a lane that I kind of car for myself,
but it's me in real life.

575
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,623
So it's like,

576
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,350
that's the only thing I have to do
is really just completely be myself.

577
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:04,370
Just be 100 fucking show up. Do
my business thing. Tell people,

578
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:07,100
do the right thing and fucking
light to join. You know what I mean?

579
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,460
That's it. That's a crazy business, sir.
I'm, I'm good. I'm straight like that.

580
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,640
That's amazing. Yeah. Yup. People
listening to this support like wow,

581
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,660
he could beat yourself for a living,
for a show, bro. This blessing.

582
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,960
It's a blessing. I, John
Witherspoon on yesterday, but
the son, j d okay. You know,

583
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,670
pops with a spoon. Yeah. Yup.
And that's basically what he is.

584
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,630
He's one of the funniest fucking human
beings that's ever lived and just keep a

585
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,520
camera on them.
Just keep a camera on him.

586
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,570
That falls the guy from mass phase
it in real life. Oh, he's amazing.

587
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,750
He's so funny. He's, he's legit.
My face was hurting today.

588
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,740
Like the cheekbone muscles.
They're like, ah, hey.

589
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:48,230
He probably got some crazy ass stories.
Oh yeah.

590
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,130
That motherfucker been in the game
forever and he's, that's who he is.

591
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,240
He got paid to be who he is. Figuring out
how to just be who he is all the time.

592
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,620
Yup. It's the same damn bro. Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,690
It's not limited to a one
or two of us right now.

594
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:06,890
There's a bunch of different paths.
That's the Copart. Yeah. Nope. Yup.

595
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,680
Hell yeah. So how many years you've
been trained in martial arts now? Uh,

596
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,630
this is my second year. Wow. Only two
years. That's amazing. Again, what?

597
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:22,190
35 pounds. He'll pull up a video of
him hitting pads. That's incredible.

598
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,340
Is it? Cause I don't know.
Tell him, tell him what,

599
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,310
what video is probably going to be old.
But it's all good though.

600
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:32,100
You know how we are. You can hit hard.
You have good technique. You turn,

601
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,990
you turn your hips and shoulders in
the bay. Yeah. Yup. You do it right.

602
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,010
So it's very that it's only two

603
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,360
years in. Yo, I'm learning
that. Yeah. I love it.

604
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,010
I love it when people take a chance to
try something new. Yeah, that's old.

605
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:51,930
But you know, we'll get there. So
how many months had you been in here?

606
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,460
Like you say, this is old.
This was probably like a
year. A year ago? Yeah. Yep.

607
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,560
Still seriously though. Good technique
for someone who's been doing it a year.

608
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,770
The way you're moving. I mean,
there's no fat to your movements.

609
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,600
See what I'm saying?
Like everything you're doing,

610
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,750
it might not be the fastest in the
world are the most devastating,

611
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,130
but you're doing it perfect.
Thank you.

612
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,540
Doing exactly how you're
supposed to do it.

613
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,760
And then you just get better and
better from there. There you go.

614
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,580
We're talking about is the
change in your physique,

615
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,930
but mean you became fucking treaded.
It's oppressive. Yeah. Thank you.

616
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,070
That's only through hard work. You
can't do it any other way. Yeah, just,

617
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,220
just work and eat. And I was
all, oh, I'm sorry. That's mine.

618
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,200
That's hard to cut that off. Sorry
about that guys. That's no worries man.

619
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,300
Welcome to the wonderful world of
convenience. There we go. Bam. Um, yeah.

620
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,280
Eating like a motherfucker, bro. I, yeah,
I had to like force myself to eat, um,

621
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,200
to gain weight, to gain weight. I'm
fucking just moving around so much.

622
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,320
I already have a quick metabolism,
so then you add working out to that.

623
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,690
So it's like I'm burning so much old
setting alarms to eat really little. Yeah.

624
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,280
Yup.
Getting a little bit more arrest.

625
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:02,300
Too many alarms he eat
like how's that work there?

626
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,450
Like wake up and then you eat and then
go to sleep, eat, go back to sleep train.

627
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,460
He kind of to

628
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,180
by Jesus Christ.
I do a lot of like,

629
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,030
like ginger shots.
I'm like shit like that to help like yeah,

630
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,700
to read all of that shit too. Cause like
you said that fuck your stomach up. Why?

631
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,730
Who told you to get up in the middle of
the night? Neat though. My trainer. Yeah.

632
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,380
Yeah. Yup. I would, uh,

633
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,590
I would say that your sleep cycles more
important than anything. It wasn't,

634
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,760
it's not like breaking my sleep.
It's like more like yo eat.

635
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,970
Oh you mean like you set an alarm
like while you're awake? Yeah. Oh,

636
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,200
can I see what you're saying?

637
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,720
I've never heard anybody telling someone
to wake up in the middle of the night

638
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,850
and eat. Nah, not like to
hear that. That's why it was
weird. I heard that from a,

639
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,760
there was that movie with Clint Eastwood
where he played a boxing trainer and

640
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:57,070
his daughter, that famous
actress play the boxer. Man,

641
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,900
that billion dollar baby or toddler.
Yeah.

642
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,570
Yeah. When that actress, what
is her name? Hillary Swank.

643
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,410
Hilary Swank. The job. Hillary. Thank
you. We can change on the ball job man.

644
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,440
When she was training for that,
I think that's what I read,

645
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:17,190
that they had an alarm set but she would
wake up in the middle of the night and

646
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,830
have a protein shake. Oh really?
And then go back to sleep again.

647
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,060
Now I'm not doing that. Okay
now. No, no breaking asleep. Uh,

648
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,650
just regular eating habits just
reminded myself, you know what I mean?

649
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,880
Cause I was eating like
twice a day on some,

650
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:35,710
just some rock star Shit.
Can't live like that, bro.

651
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,120
That shit is wack. Do you
have a nutritionist or someone
who handles your meals?

652
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,820
Meal preps. Yeah. You got that.
Because I don't cook. Right.

653
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,280
So it's like they just deliver
my meals. That's nice. Yeah. Yup.

654
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,760
It's really nice actually.
Yeah.

655
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,690
Cause I'm single so it's like I don't
really got nobody in the house like

656
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:55,240
cooking or making all
that shit happen for me.

657
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:59,110
So it just comes through the door so
you can make sure everything's healthy.

658
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:03,880
Exactly what you want all that up for you.
It's fresh every couple of days.

659
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,730
That's a good thing to not
have to think about the food.

660
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,050
The food is like a big part of
it and working out as one thing.

661
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,890
People just want to get big.
Like you said. I'm a, well
like we were talking about,

662
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,370
it's like mind, body and soul.
Right. So the food is further, so

663
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,790
keep that fucking meet alive yet. Keep
the body moving. Yep. Are you, uh,

664
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,360
do you ever do yoga or anything like
that? I would. You would? Yeah. Yep.

665
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,510
I need a yoga instructor.
Who's the best yoga is,

666
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,900
I don't know man. You do yoga?
Yeah, I love it. Yeah. Yup.
How long do, how long you,

667
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,580
oh yeah, I see. You do like some hot
yoga and shit. Yeah, man. Yup. Yeah,

668
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:46,450
she's intense, right? It's
kind of intense. Yeah. But it's
a, it's great for you, man.

669
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,540
Just stretches you out. Loosens
you up. That's what I need to do.

670
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,760
I need to stretch, you know? Yeah,
I do like regular normal stretching,

671
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,710
but some yoga would be hot.
Yeah,

672
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,720
it's good too because because
of the heat in the room,

673
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,190
everything gets real loose.
Yeah.

674
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,260
You can really kind of dig into like
certain things stressed your frack to test

675
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:08,460
your flexibility to stretch things
out a little bit more. Gotcha.

676
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,350
Just keeps you pliable.
Gotcha.

677
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,240
You know when you're doing a lot of hard
things like Moy Thai or weightlifting,

678
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,150
everything's hard.
Like there's not,

679
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,710
not enough stretching things out and
totally maintaining your range of motion.

680
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,650
Yeah. Especially as you get
older, how often you do it.

681
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,800
I tried to do it at least once a week,
but I often fail,

682
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,580
but a two times a week in a good
week. Okay. Yeah. It's all mixed. It,

683
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,740
I can't do one thing every day board,

684
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,290
so in order to stay active I just have
to do a bunch of different things.

685
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,153
That make sense.

686
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:44,080
It's whether it's martial arts
running or lifting or whatever it is.

687
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,500
I feel like through time you like
added those things in, right? Yeah.

688
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,110
It was just like, all right,
I'm going to do this. Yeah.

689
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,190
The hill down into the most recent thing.
Okay, cool. So what's hill running?

690
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,590
Cause I take my dog running through these
steep ass fucking hills and then you

691
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:02,120
know, sprinting up these, it's
the most ruthless workout. Right.

692
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,000
And you know if you've ever
run hills. Yes. Yeah. Yes.

693
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,460
The worst sand dunes. I don't
like it. Sand dunes are the worst.

694
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:14,050
That's probably sucks. It sucks. You have
never get up there. He just, he keep,

695
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,380
you keep pushing and you're pushing
sand and pushing Sam. There's no hard,

696
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,830
you don't ever bounce off anything,
right. You just pushing through soft shit.

697
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,160
It's, you're trying to
find like balance and yeah.

698
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,730
That's some real martial arts shit though.
Yeah, for sure. That's a mental shift.

699
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,690
Exactly.
Yeah.

700
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:31,270
You're learning about yourself and
you're running up a fucking sand dune.

701
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,850
You're mastering a fucking moving thing.

702
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,630
Things Melton the whole time
you're trying. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

703
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,850
And you're forcing your brain, your body
to do what your mind wants it to listen,

704
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,910
bitch. I know you don't want to do this.
You're going to do this. That's like a,

705
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,280
I heard the Diaz brothers do some
crazy shit like swimming. Oh yeah,

706
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,070
they do triathlons. Yeah.
Fuck that Nick Diaz.

707
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,100
I think it's now five times that he
swam back from Alcatraz. Fuck that.

708
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,810
Yeah. I'll contrast man. Sharks.
Sharks. That, that's why I'm with you.

709
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
Fuck that. That's so crazy.
Those guys are so crazy.

710
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,710
That's like you and the sand
dunes though. Well, I haven't do,

711
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,800
I don't do sand dunes. Oh, if I had one
near me, I would do it. I run hills,

712
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:23,120
which is definitely easier than sand
dunes, but it's still hard as fuck. Good.

713
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:28,100
Steep ass hill. It's the best for
transit grass. Yeah. Dirt, dirt,

714
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,540
rocks. Just anything.
Just as trails. Damn, Bro.

715
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,400
Yeah. I'm gonna get there someday.
You'll see me come see me blazing.

716
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,020
I'll take you out. We'll go running
together. I like to hike. It's a,

717
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:46,190
it's a great workout, man. And the thing
about it is it amps everything else out.

718
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,600
Yeah. So like, um, it makes your
kicking stronger. There's more wind.

719
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,950
It just accentuates your ability to
explode because you're running hills,

720
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,630
so you're always going up.

721
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,990
It's like you're doing these crazy
plyometrics and use develop this.

722
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,700
Does that forward a stronger power
in your legs and your lower trunk?

723
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,960
Boom. Yeah. More kitten power.
Yep. That makes sense. Yeah.

724
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,510
I feel like I will fuck with
it. Dude. You'd love it.

725
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,450
Cause I like to just tune
shit out and just go. Yeah.

726
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:19,100
So like the pain from running up the
hill would just, I would be like,

727
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:22,400
yes. Yeah. I'm not even gonna think about
this. Let me think about something else.

728
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,970
Yeah. Well, and you get a goal,
right? You set a goal like a mile,

729
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,320
put yourself at one mile who and then turn
around and go back for the other mile.

730
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,000
Woo. Yeah. And if he can, if he can
do that, I'm good. Steep ass hills.

731
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:38,900
When you're done, you feel like you
fought a battle with your brain. Woo.

732
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,730
It's like, you know, you didn't want to do
that, but you did didn't dog. All right.

733
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,120
That's nothing compared to like some
people do. Yeah. But Dot. That's, that's,

734
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:51,110
that sounds like, you know, something
that we could unlock later on in my life,

735
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,670
I think for everybody.

736
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,950
Doing something that's super strenuous
for all the time is important. Yeah.

737
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:59,300
For show for sure.

738
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,050
That's part of the reason
why I fuck with training,

739
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,910
you know so much. Cause it's not
easy and it it, it breaks you.

740
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,430
Yeah. But you reach points
where it's like, okay,

741
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,620
now I'm just cruising so
I need another challenge.

742
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:16,010
Like you're just sharpening the shit
after a certain point. So it's like,

743
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:19,290
all right, now I'm gonna go
run some sand dunes. Yeah.

744
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,350
Swim from Alcatraz. So yeah, I can get it.

745
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,340
There's doing somewhere down there like
Orange County or they're pretty famous.

746
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,010
10 run up Manhattan Beach Park.
That makes sense.

747
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,580
It's a park. Yeah. Yeah. I was just,

748
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,330
there's a video of Kevin Durant and
Russell Westbrook train in there.

749
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:39,540
I was about to pull up shit that we
want to see somebody run on those dunes.

750
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,460
Okay.
Last broke be doing it.

751
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,340
I know a lot of fighters do
it in Australia. I believe
Robert Whitaker does it.

752
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,420
Yeah. See I'm backwards. When
you do shit like this on Sam,

753
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:55,890
that is phenomenal for your blog
is so hard to do, man. Dying.

754
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,740
Dying.
That's so hard to do.

755
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,330
And I wonder if they're running with just
socks on. It looks like they are. Yeah.

756
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,440
That's amazing. Too difficult. Fuck man.

757
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:10,050
Cause that makes your feet
strong cause you just,

758
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:14,490
you've using every muscle in your
toes to push through that sand.

759
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,500
That's difficult. Fuck. There's
levels to this life. Yeah.

760
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,820
That's literally who's going to go to
the top or who's going to stop in the

761
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:28,050
middle? Yep. Yeah, yeah. Fuck those
little decisions you make every day.

762
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,590
I just seen my whole life
just running up some dude.

763
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,590
Yeah, that was cool. Yeah. That's awesome.

764
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,910
It's like a mental martial art to wow.

765
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,100
You're testing the mind hellion and
like getting stronger at the same time.

766
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,840
That's the cold part.
Yeah.

767
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,500
So it's like you could be up here the
whole time and you're building all of this

768
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,530
and becoming more explosive
and more dangerous.

769
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,270
The lighter on your feet and just when
you started training and seeing these

770
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:06,960
awesome benefits will you
like, God dammit. Why wasn't
I doing this all the time?

771
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,720
Um, I'm actually happy that I, that I
waited for a little bit cause I enjoy it.

772
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,450
It's not like, oh, to
me, you know what I mean?

773
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:18,660
It's not something that I'm
tired of or that that's a chore.

774
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,870
I'm still figuring out new shit like
all the time and getting better,

775
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,380
you know what I mean? And like, uh,

776
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,440
for me I feel like the
physical was probably like
the first thing to come to me,

777
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,300
uh, as like a, as a reward, as benefit.
Like I see the, the, the physical shit,

778
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,710
but now it's like the feeling that I
get, you know what I mean? Or like,

779
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,731
like we said,

780
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:45,810
like posture and balance and technique
improving and shit like that.

781
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,310
So it's like learning that and feeling
that and having that being a part of the

782
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:53,300
process,
I'm happy that now is,

783
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,550
is happening as opposed to it being
like old and played out to me.

784
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,920
That's interesting. I think you'd love
it either way. Yeah. I still love it.

785
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:04,740
I still love training and I've
been talking forever and forever.

786
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,570
I'm 51 I started training when I
was really seriously when I was 15.

787
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,630
Oh Shit. Damn. So what the
fuck was I doing? Yeah,

788
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
I was feeling, I was rapping.
We wrap it when you're 15 wow.

789
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:19,290
When did you first get into student?

790
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,070
That's one thing I really admire about
a lot of rappers because we're always

791
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:25,500
working.
Rappers are always in the studio.

792
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:30,160
Hopefully that's like a big thing though.
It's like there's a discipline

793
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,000
aspect to it then I don't think that
gets appreciated. Yeah, you have to be,

794
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:36,640
you're always in the lab.
They always working on constantly.

795
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,200
It's like training and you gotta be, you
gotta work at it. It's competitive. Yeah.

796
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,620
Yeah. You gotta be in a
studio, work with producers.

797
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:49,621
You got to becoming new fucking no one
who's next and who's like working with

798
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,600
them and shit like that. So
like at the end of the day,
yeah, it's a crap. The Shit.

799
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,700
I've been in the studio since I was like
1415 and there was times where my dad

800
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,980
used to have to tell me like,
Yo, get out of the studio.

801
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,610
Like go play with your friends,
be a kid, be normal. Like wow.

802
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:11,410
Sound like there was times
that shit happen. And even now,

803
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,320
like I don't really do normal shit.
You know what I mean?

804
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:17,890
I might like go to the movies or like go
to Dave and Buster's or something like

805
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:20,440
that,
but like I don't do shit.

806
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:25,420
Like I just go to the studio much rather
just, you know what I mean? Create.

807
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,570
Well that's amazing that
you figured it out so young.

808
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,470
How old were you when you knew
you wanted to be a robber? Uh,

809
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,890
I think I was in third grade,
so real shit.

810
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,570
I think I was in third grade.
That's amazing. I want to,

811
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,620
I wanted to be an Ninja turtle and I
wanted to be a rapper and I think a rapper

812
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,070
was like a little bit more realistic.
I'm working on being a Ninja turtle now.

813
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:54,700
That's amazing. Fifth Grade, third
grade, third grade again, you're nine,

814
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,650
you're not. Yeah. Yeah.

815
00:48:56,651 --> 00:49:00,100
That's when I started writing my
first raps and shit is hilarious.

816
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,260
I was like watching music videos and I
remember seeing like puffy and biggie

817
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,700
bone thugs and harmony is like one of
my favorite groups. So it was like, Yo,

818
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:12,580
if I could do that I'll
be high. And then, um,

819
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,280
by the time I was like 13,
uh,

820
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,170
that's when the Internet was really
popular so you could download like

821
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,610
instrumentals and shit like that.

822
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:25,720
So you didn't have to like have beats or
anything. Then they started introducing,

823
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,490
you know,
uh,

824
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,640
at home equipment they had like little
task him for track little bullshit thing

825
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:37,390
that you could, you know what I mean?
So I started fucking around on that.

826
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,250
Mike doing my own little home studio.
Then fruity loops came out,

827
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,890
started making beats. Cool.
Edit pro was like the,

828
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:49,270
the program back then
before protools and yeah,

829
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,650
that's how I got my start. Like just
in the fucking in the, in the crib,

830
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,780
just putting it together. Then I turned
like, then by the time I was like 16,

831
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,770
I got like an internship at a,

832
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,000
at a studio in Pittsburgh where I was
literally like answering the phones and

833
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,530
running errands and going to pick up
like office supplies and shit like that.

834
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,020
And in return they will
pay me with studio time.

835
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,330
So like I will just record like off,
you know what I mean? Off the clock.

836
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,081
You know what I mean?

837
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:21,940
I had like four or five songs and
that turned into the record. Do. Wow.

838
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,890
Yup. Got My first deal at 16 that's
an amazing story. That's wild.

839
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,940
That's, that's a movie story. That's
crazy. You always knew. Yeah. Yup.

840
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,870
It was something that I worked at for
sure cause it was like being in in

841
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:37,990
Pittsburgh. You ever
been to Pittsburgh? Yeah.

842
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,940
You know it's pretty crazy
out there. Right. Crazy.

843
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:45,860
How like it's just a really wild city,
like the Midwest.

844
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:50,861
So it's like there's either a couple of
things you can do and there's not a lot.

845
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,210
And working a job is like the last thing
that anybody wants to do in Pittsburgh.

846
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:01,211
So all my cousins and everybody that I
know do different shit than what I was

847
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:04,790
willing to do. I was like, Yo, I'm not
trying to be that guy. Like, like that.

848
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,900
So it was like, how am I going to make
a way for myself? You know what I mean?

849
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:12,920
How the fuck am I going to get still
be fresh still. You know what I mean?

850
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:16,700
Enjoy myself. Have a good time
but be safe and like have fun.

851
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,660
It was music so it's amazing.

852
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,790
You nailed and nailed it young.
Yup.

853
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,490
That's a beautiful thing to
know what you want to do. Yeah.

854
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,960
And just be working towards it. Have
for many people that's the real problem.

855
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,600
The real problem was like
finding a thing. Yeah. You know,

856
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:36,170
finding a thing that they really love so
much to fit all their energy into. Yeah.

857
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,100
I mean I'm blessed to grow up in a time
to where technology was like taking over

858
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:45,101
and shit and I think like if you're my
age and you like make music or got a

859
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:48,530
camera or you know what I mean?

860
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:53,531
Anything around that you good like
and now I think it's like if you have

861
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:57,070
anything to do with weed, like you know
what I'm saying? You're not to grow it.

862
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:59,360
If you could sell it,
if you could brand it,

863
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,900
if you could come up with light technology
or whatever it is like that's going

864
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:08,330
to be the future for this generation.
It's like pot.

865
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,710
This is going to be a lot of that for
sure. It's going to open up to everybody.

866
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:17,120
I think once they realize how much money
there really is and pot and how safe it

867
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:20,290
is in comparison to liquor and all
these other established things that we

868
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:25,070
evolved. No one has a problem with
alcohol companies, right? No, no, no.

869
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,150
Nobody has a problem with them.

870
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,920
Nobody has a problem with you drinking
at 12 in the fucking afternoon.

871
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:34,700
Like I get on planes all the time. People
will be like, Yo, let me get a little,

872
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,080
it's like people getting fucked up,
Yo on a plane. That's totally fine.

873
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,960
We just have to shift
attitudes. Yeah. Yup.

874
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,740
People just have the wrong
attitude about it. They,

875
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,640
they think it's something negative and
something that could be negative to some

876
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:50,780
people, but that's like
everything else. That's like
food, sex, gambling, everything,

877
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,930
shopping, everything. You had been
shopping for sure. People go crazy.

878
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,870
People lose their mind chopping.
Yeah. They can't buy enough things.

879
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,320
Buying crazy shit.
Just cause just cause yeah,

880
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,160
that's, that's as much of a
addiction as anything. Nope.

881
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,660
But pod can definitely for
some people derail them.

882
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,020
I don't think it's for
everybody. Nah, it's a medicine.

883
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:15,860
So you got the right dosage. That's,
that's a good way of looking at it.

884
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,590
I think some people react to it weird too.
Yeah.

885
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,520
I mean certain people's experiences
on everybody else's experience.

886
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,160
So it's like if you got fucked up
on weed, that's you. So I was like,

887
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:30,240
don't put that off on everybody else.
And I think like, like anything,

888
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,730
it takes time to,
you know what I mean?

889
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,731
Like I can't take Percocet because it's
like that shit will fuck me up cause I

890
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:41,190
don't do painkillers.
But I think over a certain amount of time,

891
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:42,810
if I had an injury,

892
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:46,800
my body will start to react differently
to certain amount of Percocet.

893
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,830
But like off rip,
it's gonna fuck me up.

894
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,630
You know what I'm saying
is I'm gonna throw up,

895
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:54,990
I'm going to do all types of
Shit. But you know, after awhile,

896
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:55,681
you know what I mean?

897
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:59,430
There's people who just popped that
shit and just walk around like,

898
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,530
you know what I mean? Normally, yeah.

899
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,140
That same way with me smoking a joint
and it's like there's some people who

900
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:07,950
could hit this and be in that corner
for the rest of the day. For me,

901
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,830
I'm going to go do everything that
I have to do. So it's a medicine,

902
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:15,660
it's a dosage and you have to train
your body for it. I think that's true,

903
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:19,320
but I also think some people might not
react to it correctly in terms of like

904
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,260
biologically. Yeah, I think
they might have an allergy.

905
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,090
Like it might be like
Broccoli or something.

906
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,640
There's people out there that are
allergic to weird shit. Right.

907
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,170
There's some people I think that just,

908
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,540
I've heard of that that experience
is just not good for their,

909
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:34,440
like they're allergic to it. I don't,
I mean, you know, I'm just guessing.

910
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,710
I don't know. I mean it made sense.
I think it's opinion like if you,

911
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,940
if you believe it or not, you know what I
mean? Like, if you want to believe that,

912
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,490
I feel like you're
entitled to believe that.

913
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,850
And if you don't want to believe that,
then it's like, okay, cool. You're,

914
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,100
you're that guy too.
Okay.

915
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,800
I don't know either what you said. Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know either bro,

916
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,100
because it's like I'm on the
fence because it's like, you know,

917
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:04,260
on one hand people, I mean, I
don't know. Fuck yeah, yeah.

918
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,790
Whatever. It's medicine. It's
fucking medicine. And I like it.

919
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,260
A lot of people that like it,
it's not what everybody thinks it is,

920
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,310
is wrong idea of it. One of the
things I found out real early on,

921
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:20,850
it's how many Jujitsu guys
smoke weed and do Jujitsu. Yeah.

922
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:25,420
You've seen the high rollers state?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hi. Rowers has, uh,

923
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,930
all these awesome events where they do,

924
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,910
they smoke weed and then they fight
in a Jujitsu match. Yup. My partners,

925
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:36,420
uh, are, are, are a big part
of that. Lonnie and breeze.

926
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:40,800
And they're the ones who actually got
me like kind of, you know, into fitness.

927
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:45,310
So to see them like,
and I'm the one who got him in the weed.

928
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:48,050
So it's like to see it like crossover.

929
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,150
I never would have known like,
you know what I'm saying?

930
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:55,610
How many Jiu Jitsu dudes like smoke
weed and like our about it like, yeah,

931
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,410
the House that she helps her Jujitsu,
it really does.

932
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,220
It helps like slow it down for you. Right.
I don't even know if it's slow it down.

933
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:05,520
It's like a tunes out the rest of
the world. Like you me become freer.

934
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,930
It's very weird. Like more creative.
There's, it's definitely uh,

935
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,960
it's better for rolling
than it is for drilling guy.

936
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:13,560
Just like when someone's
trying to teach you something,

937
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:18,510
sometimes your brain's just not just
hide, your brain's not taking in.

938
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,320
But if you were sparring it would be good.
Got You. You just, you flow better. Yeah.

939
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,100
Yeah.

940
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,250
That makes sense. That makes
sense. I haven't done Jujitsu yet.

941
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,100
I'm gonna get there eventually.

942
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,360
You would love it and
you've got long limbs, man.

943
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:36,820
You'd be perfect for choking people.
Yep. Armbars triangles and shit.

944
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:40,120
And I'm going to get there. You could
do it. Yup. I told like bill for it.

945
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,660
I feel like I'm going to just fuck with
stand up for like a couple of years and

946
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:47,860
then just gradually do other
things like, and I'm saying, yeah,

947
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,160
I'll just probably do Jujitsu for
like four or five years. Yeah.

948
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:55,120
And for sure you should just learn some
shit. Yeah, that'd be great for you man.

949
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,440
Yeah.
You're like I said,

950
00:56:56,441 --> 00:57:01,210
you're built for it almost the perfect
frame for fighters as long it seems to be

951
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:04,870
a long, as long as you're strong.
It's like the John Jones frame.

952
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:09,370
That's the perfect frame, right? It's,
you can't get close enough to him.

953
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,430
He can hit you when he wants to and
then when he grabs a hold of you,

954
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:15,190
he's strong enough and he's better at
wrestling. He's going to throw you around.

955
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,350
Like if you could come up
like that's the perfect,

956
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,330
the perfect combination as long
and strong. Oh yeah. Perfect. Yeah.

957
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,840
Tweet dude's like [inaudible] they,
they bucked that trend,

958
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,870
right because it just tanks.
But the best I,

959
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:32,920
it seems to me like just mechanically
than best frame is the long frame.

960
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,650
So you have like the best frame for
fighting. Fuck graduations. Thank you.

961
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,720
I'm in there.
It doesn't guarantee success,

962
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,220
but it's a fucking awesome base. There we
go. I'm starting. I'm working with some.

963
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,290
Yeah. Yeah. Just like short dudes like
me can't put big guys and dry angles.

964
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,130
I was going to have enough leg room
does not enough. Like mechanically.

965
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,110
I'm sure you could figure
it out. Not really. Yeah.

966
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,450
Is he going to give up on that one?

967
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,760
But a long guys can get triangles
from all kinds of places. Okay.

968
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,740
You'd love it. Super. It's
a thinking man's game too.
You know? It's like, are you,

969
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:10,960
you're playing a game.
Yeah. You know? Yeah.

970
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:14,140
The thing that I like about it too
is that you can go full blast. Okay.

971
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,970
Whereas like if you're sparring,

972
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:18,250
you don't really want to go full
blast or hurt each other. Right.

973
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,490
You want to be tempered, measured,
and just kind of touch each other.

974
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,410
But when you do sparring in Jujitsu,

975
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,650
silly because you're not striking each
other. You just wrestling and grappling.

976
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:31,460
You can go full blast. Okay.
That's amazing. I'm with
it, bro. I'm super with it,

977
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,160
like the little bit that I've done, I was
like, all right, cool. I could see. Right.

978
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah. And I mean, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I'm down.

979
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,920
Okay.

980
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,360
Definitely got to go there.

981
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,360
I just love the fact that
you're interested in doing
different things. Yeah,

982
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:51,010
for sure. So I'm alerted. Do
you do read books? Do you, uh,

983
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,490
do you watch documentaries?
I watch documentaries. Yeah.

984
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,420
I have read some books,
uh,

985
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,470
that I gravitate towards. What kind of
documentaries you gravitate towards?

986
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,420
Dyke music really always
about, always about music. Um,

987
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,290
let me see what else. Yeah,
it's always about music.

988
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,330
Like musicians searching for sugar man.

989
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,740
What was that one that was about this
dude who was a guy who was making music?

990
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,310
I F belong,

991
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:26,310
I want to say it was in the 70s and he
had a like a little bit of buzz on his

992
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:32,231
album and then it died off for him and
he went back to work as a construction

993
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:34,304
worker,

994
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,020
but his music became insanely
huge in South Africa.

995
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,730
He was a superstar and there was all
these legends about him that he was dead.

996
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,590
That, you know, the, just the, just crazy
stories about who we was. Me and mom,

997
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:52,850
this guy was working as a construction
worker, so in South Africa,

998
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:55,490
he's a fucking mega superstar,

999
00:59:55,491 --> 01:00:00,470
like sells out arenas and spoiler alert,
it's a great documentary.

1000
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:00,801
Should see it,

1001
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:05,120
but he eventually goes to South Africa
and does this concert there. You'll cry,

1002
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,670
you'll cry. You're like, oh my God.

1003
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:12,590
Can you imagine this guy was working
as a laborer? And the whole time was,

1004
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,830
he was a superstar and he didn't
even know it. And the people see him,

1005
01:00:15,831 --> 01:00:20,120
they're singing along to his
music. I mean, the guys blown
away. I would love that.

1006
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:25,010
It's a crazy document. I checked that
out. It, it's, it's insane to watch.

1007
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,720
Like how could this be true?
Eh, Eh, Dale, it's amazing.

1008
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,930
I kind of feel like I heard
the name, but I never, never,

1009
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:38,440
never got to watch it grow. Yeah. It
made me cry. I gotta check that out.

1010
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,560
At the end of it, you'd be like, wow,
I'll Haley hajj in this guy's experience.

1011
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:47,600
They almost like being released from
jail or something. Yeah, exactly. Damn.

1012
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:51,270
Yeah. That's incredible. Holy Fuck.
Yeah, I'm gonna check that out ma.

1013
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:55,160
And seeing how comfortable
he gets on stage to wow.

1014
01:00:55,430 --> 01:01:00,410
There's amazing dam. Yeah. His
music is good too, man. Varying.

1015
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:04,910
Very interesting. Is he still alive?
I believe he is alive. That's fine.

1016
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,370
He's alive, right? Yeah.

1017
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,690
So he's able to see the proceeds from
his movie and his, yeah. Hell yeah.

1018
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,260
But someone said, I think he
gave away all his money. Really?

1019
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,010
I read something about that might be more
of those rumors and legends allege on

1020
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,890
another myth. Damn sure. Yeah.

1021
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,850
Jamie, find out that dude gave his money
away cause I felt like I read that.

1022
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,590
I was like, Bro. But life to
him is so surreal. Anyway,

1023
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:38,860
truth maybe he felt like he couldn't be
a real bonafide artist unless he gave

1024
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:42,170
away his money or something
crazy because you've got,

1025
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:43,340
the guy was living in like this.

1026
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,440
That's why I don't want to do
Iowasca or anything like that. God,

1027
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:47,930
I feel like that's what's
going to happen to me.

1028
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,950
You want to give away your money here?
Fuck that shit was like, whoa. No, no,

1029
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:57,950
no, no. That's hilarious. It's too
tricky. You could, you could get, so,

1030
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,270
you know, so, so charity driven,

1031
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,810
just give away everything and
then you're working for charities,

1032
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,630
which is walking the earth barefoot

1033
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:15,110
to her last year to run theaters all
over the good shit. Sugarman. He's back.

1034
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,240
He's back. He's smacking her
so much. That documentary did,

1035
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,790
he gave away all his money yet.

1036
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,910
Dave Matthews covered one of his songs
and then went on to help blow him up.

1037
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,850
Oh Man. Oh yeah. Damn.
You just doing good.

1038
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,340
So he ain't giving away nothing beautiful.
He might have,

1039
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:33,070
but I don't see anything back.
Yeah,

1040
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,070
it's,
the documentary is really amazing.

1041
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,580
That's one of the best music documentaries
I've ever seen. Perfect. Thank you.

1042
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,630
Yeah, that's a good one. Tell me a
good one. My documentary. Oh man,

1043
01:02:43,631 --> 01:02:47,020
it's called behind the camera.
Yeah. So apple music. Oh, okay.

1044
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,940
Yeah, just did that. I just did that.

1045
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,180
I just did that.

1046
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,270
Beautiful Man. Not um, I like to watch,

1047
01:02:56,271 --> 01:03:00,470
like I watch this pink Floyd documentary
about how they put together, uh,

1048
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,430
their albums, shit like that. Um,

1049
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,130
there's another one about like, uh,
background singers who never liked,

1050
01:03:09,131 --> 01:03:13,190
became super popular.
But they're like potter part of uh,

1051
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,760
songs that you hear and that you love.
And it's just like telling them the story,

1052
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:20,180
like how writers and you know what
I mean? Being in studio, home wit,

1053
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,920
it's like to live that life.

1054
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,750
It's really cool cause I
listen to the harmonies a lot.

1055
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:28,910
I don't know if when you hear music
I hear like all the textures of it.

1056
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:33,530
So it's like I get interested in what
goes on sometimes like in the background.

1057
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:38,150
And that was a cool story.
I'm fucking,

1058
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:41,150
what was the last one that I
actually watched? I just watched,

1059
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:45,790
I'm watching this show actually. You
ever heard Trenoble hurt? Hardly shows.

1060
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,790
Amazing that shit. It's kind of cool. I
heard it's great man. It's pretty awesome.

1061
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:53,540
But that's not music though. What
is that on? Is that Netflix, HBO,

1062
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,150
Hbo Coming Back,
game of Thrones didn't kill him to Nobu.

1063
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,210
Is it really? Yeah. Good. I'll
show lit. It's all you need.

1064
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:07,260
Here's a big show in HBO is back.
Chernobyl.

1065
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:10,010
What is it about the, the accident? Yeah.

1066
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,170
How many episodes is it? I'm not
sure. They're like streaming them now.

1067
01:04:15,171 --> 01:04:17,400
So it's like, oh, it's streams. Yeah. Yup.

1068
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,210
It's on like the fourth or fifth episode.

1069
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,960
I think all those networks
that don't stream everything.
Yeah. Like they must be,

1070
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,740
it must suck to have like a show that
has to be on Thursday night at eight

1071
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,080
losing out just today.
So weird man.

1072
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,780
Want to watch things whenever
they want it right now? Yes,

1073
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,060
for sure. Five apartment, new series.
The last episode is coming up this week.

1074
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,250
Oh, okay. There you go. How do you think
the movie theaters were always be here?

1075
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:46,160
Mm hmm. Shit. Nah, I want
that thing. Eventually.

1076
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:51,040
Ain't gonna be gone. What do you think?
I don't know. Just it's one of the,

1077
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,780
I kind of, I liked it. They're
real, you know, there's a,

1078
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,770
a place you go, they're already
kind of came and gone twice.

1079
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:57,880
If you look around all the Hollywood,

1080
01:04:57,881 --> 01:05:00,160
there's old theaters that
aren't theaters anymore,

1081
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,500
but there's new theaters
that have taken over them.

1082
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,910
But those buildings are still there for
whatever reason. I still use the number.

1083
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,440
Well, people still like going to the
movies. It's like a, it's a night out

1084
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,880
saying, yeah. You know,

1085
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,900
I go like it costs so much
to like keep screening,

1086
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,020
actually put movies in and then you

1087
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,560
got the popcorn.
It's like,

1088
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,210
but it's one of the few things that we
do in with strangers is like be a part of

1089
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:27,950
an audience. It's like one
thing, the few things we ran,

1090
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,560
we do at giant groups of strangers.

1091
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,400
I feel like technology is like removing
that because people don't like that.

1092
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,440
I think people are uncomfortable with
it because most of the time we spend on

1093
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:42,880
devices for communicating through
devices and especially with like virtual

1094
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:46,180
reality becoming more popular.
You know,

1095
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,980
like people love access.

1096
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:52,000
So it was like if you're making them
feel like they're, they're like,

1097
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:56,830
why would you want random dude walking
across your lap when you can just be in

1098
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:01,660
the movie? Like yeah, I feel like they
would just spend to spend that money on,

1099
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:05,800
you know, keeping you at home, like where
you want to be. That's just my opinion.

1100
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,530
I don't know. No, I think you're right.

1101
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,650
And I agree with you 100% but I also
think as a community of human beings,

1102
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,750
it's nice to have things that
we all do together. Yeah.

1103
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,820
It fosters like a kind of getting along
better and friendship. I love that.

1104
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,380
People that you don't know.
I think that's what's good about sports.

1105
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,530
I like concerts because of
the concerts. Yeah. Yeah.

1106
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:31,590
When you go to grow the whole group of
people to see something like it's nice

1107
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:33,370
you connect to tell you it feels good.

1108
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:38,410
Baseball Games cause I've had fun at
games and I gave a fuck about what was

1109
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,770
going on, but it's the community
that was going on for sure.

1110
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:46,090
100% that's what I mean. I mean never
everyone's kind of drinking. I'm fun.

1111
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,020
That is an important part of cities.
Communities.

1112
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,740
That's one thing that I think that or
like a movie theater does provide. Yeah.

1113
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,140
I mean for sure.
Concert for sure.

1114
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,030
And I'm not even mad that people don't
really go to the movies like that now

1115
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,130
because it's like when you
actually do want to go,

1116
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:07,090
you can go and it's not full and it's not,
you know what I mean?

1117
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:08,920
Like it'll be people there,

1118
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:12,330
but it's not overwhelming to
the point where you got like,

1119
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,690
it fucks up your movie experience.
So it's like, it's kind of, you know,

1120
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:21,550
it's doable. It's enjoyable.
It's handleable. Yeah.
Yeah. It's cool. It's fun.

1121
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,220
I like where the movies is that right
now I am worried that people are

1122
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:28,780
eventually going to all be living in
some sort of a VR world. Yeah. I mean,

1123
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:33,520
I feel like it's designed to move that
way. Like, you know what I'm saying?

1124
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:37,240
Like you give people something
and they're going to use it

1125
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,280
and they're going to get better.
Yeah. A new one. Yeah. Yeah.

1126
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:46,330
It was going to have extra features. Yeah.
So it's like, all right, like, you know,

1127
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:50,800
I get it. Like, fuck, have you fucked with
any of that VR stuff? Yeah. VR is awesome.

1128
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:54,640
Do you ever do that? There's a thing
outside of Disneyland where you uh,

1129
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:56,950
there's a VR game that you go through.

1130
01:07:56,951 --> 01:08:01,900
You go through like this little like they
have a like a giant room and the room

1131
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:04,300
set up for them. What it was they called
the void. Is that what it's called? Yeah.

1132
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:09,010
Holy Shit. Void VR. And there's a star
wars one and there's a wreck it Ralph one.

1133
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,950
Okay. And they're hilarious. I
mean you're, you're walking around,

1134
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:16,160
you feel heat from fire, they
pick up a gun, you shooting

1135
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,330
at storm troopers and it's crazy.
It's crazy. And while you're doing it,

1136
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:25,070
you'd like, this is just step
one. Exactly. This is going to be,

1137
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,480
is saying there's one a year in
those pieces. Bits and pieces.

1138
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:30,740
It's like they already have more.

1139
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:35,660
Do you think that Oh for show 100%
I don't think that really. Yeah,

1140
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,350
cause I think that what they're showing
you right now, state of the art,

1141
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,740
they're selling it. It's the best.
Again, that's in competition.

1142
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,390
It's getting better and
better all the time.

1143
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,360
But that's a good way to look at it
because they put it up myself, my find me.

1144
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,320
No worries man. Yeah. I just think these
people were very competitive. Yeah.

1145
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:56,690
The money is in getting the best
shit out the quickest. Okay.

1146
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,040
And they're all competing with each other.

1147
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:02,750
So they're putting out like the bootleg
virgin and letting somebody smarter,

1148
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,120
uh, test it, work it and
make the better version.

1149
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,780
Then they'll come back and do that later.
Well that definitely happens to,

1150
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,630
I mean that's a what China
does better than anybody.

1151
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,310
I take some shit and just redo it.
I'd be feeling like, this is just,

1152
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:20,180
my theory is like VR.
Right?

1153
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:25,430
It might be so fucking dangerous that
they don't know like how it will live it

1154
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:27,320
out. Yeah, exactly.

1155
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,240
So it's like they give us like little
bits and pieces of it. Let us, you know,

1156
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:37,160
they spoonfeed it to us so they don't
kill us and the world just go crazy.

1157
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,080
And it's like, you know what I mean? Like,

1158
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:42,930
cause they probably tested it on
somebody and they died like Taylor.

1159
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:47,300
You know what I mean? For sure. Yeah.
They was like, Oh shit, we went too far.

1160
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:51,490
It's like, oh, let's like pull it back
a little bit and just give them this,

1161
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:54,290
like you said, give them this version
of it. You know what I mean by,

1162
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:57,920
I feel like there's more,
well, I think when they,

1163
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,070
when you really don't know what the fuck
is going on, that's with military stuff.

1164
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,380
I think military stuff
like weapons and you know,

1165
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,720
space ships and aircraft
that they're developing.

1166
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,180
We don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1167
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,130
They're doing some shit
that we have no idea.

1168
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,470
But I think with things like consumer
electronics, like technology,

1169
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,000
I think what you see is what you get.

1170
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,250
I think this is as good as
they can do anything. Now.

1171
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,430
They're working on the newest best shit.
Right. You know, and that's coming around.

1172
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:27,020
They're always constantly in development,

1173
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,370
but they're all competing
against each other.

1174
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,060
There is no way they would
hold anything back. Really?
Yeah. I don't think so. Damn.

1175
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,640
I feel like there's a phone that
charges in two seconds. It's like, okay,

1176
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,030
if you're way you didn't have it
out if you're in a war. Right.

1177
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,280
And your cellular device goes down.

1178
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:47,990
It's like you can't plug it in and charge
it. It, it has to like happen quick.

1179
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:52,880
Right, right. So like they have that, in
my opinion, they just don't give it to us.

1180
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,950
But that all that stuff, the, I
can see your argument because it's,

1181
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,540
you're in a war.

1182
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,440
They might have better batteries like
that the military develops or some new

1183
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:05,480
kind of battery that's possible.

1184
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:10,350
But there's so much money in batteries.
Like there's so much money.

1185
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:14,850
If they had a better way of doing it,
right. If Samsung came out with a phone,

1186
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:19,870
right.
Charged 100% in 30 seconds and it you,

1187
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,650
apple would have to do it. I have to
figure out how to compete with them.

1188
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,350
They would have that out. Right.
I wouldn't hold onto that.

1189
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:28,490
No one would hold on to that because
that would just dominate the market.

1190
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:32,250
It would dominate the market
too. Powerful. But that happens.

1191
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:35,790
That's what always happens to me. That's
how blockbusters out of business. Right.

1192
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,820
You know? Right, right, right, right.
That's why there's no more tower records.

1193
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,700
I'll let,
I'll let shit happen in our lifetime.

1194
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:45,860
Yeah. For show like 100% music
isn't even physical. Right. Like,

1195
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:50,570
and I make music in this.
It's not real. Right.

1196
01:11:50,571 --> 01:11:55,130
It's a sound.
It's a sound and fuck,

1197
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,390
you know,
I don't know.

1198
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,870
That is a crazy way to look at music.
[inaudible] what is this?

1199
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,370
The [inaudible] 17 pro,

1200
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:04,220
which the company's latest is the
fastest charging smartphone in the world.

1201
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:08,510
It advertises that 35 minutes is all it
takes to entirely fill up a dead battery

1202
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,130
seven months ago. So, so it's probably
faster than again, something like that.

1203
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:16,700
For sure. 35 minutes. So what do you think
they can do? Like for a full battery,

1204
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:20,660
I would say that there's probably a
hundred cell phones out there that can

1205
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:24,590
charge in five minutes.
There's not a million, cause
they can't source that much.

1206
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,570
Maybe charge more than
this, Ken. Like yeah,

1207
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,540
I would say like there's a military phone
that they might have a hundred of them

1208
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,440
around the military, but it's not mass
produced can charge up in five minutes.

1209
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:37,670
Sure. For sure. For sure.
If this can do 35 minutes,

1210
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,030
Youtube,
she's seven times fast.

1211
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,920
You guys are all good spirit
toward [inaudible]. It's

1212
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,290
just, yeah, I mean to meet as normal
leap to me, that shit is normal.

1213
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,690
This is energy that we're talking
about. Right, right, right bro.

1214
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:56,080
Like cars still move off of gas.
Like that shirt.

1215
01:12:56,081 --> 01:13:00,550
It's like the stone age Bro.
Like shit's going electric.

1216
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,570
You know what I'm saying? Like that's
awesome. Spaceships Shit. So they,

1217
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:07,810
I mean like at the end of the day,
like they have this shit,

1218
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,120
they just can't give it to you because
they, they're killing people testing it.

1219
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:15,850
It's like, it's like food,
you know what I mean?

1220
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:19,030
Like they have to approve
this shit before it comes out.

1221
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:23,080
But they have a car that goes,
it just crashed into the wall,

1222
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,150
you know what I mean?
And somebody died in and they're like,

1223
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:29,020
well we can't put this on the streets yet.
It's like all of that shit energy.

1224
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:31,480
Yeah. Like, well you think
they have a car that's so fast,

1225
01:13:31,481 --> 01:13:33,530
they can't put it on the street.
They had,

1226
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:39,940
I just feel like transportation
in general. You know what I mean?

1227
01:13:39,941 --> 01:13:43,960
Communication, transportation,
technology. The way we hear music,

1228
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,780
the way that we do things
and shit like that.

1229
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,770
Our whole experience,
tech, technology, tick,

1230
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,540
whatever the fucking word is,
we're being spoonfed, facetime.

1231
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:56,770
You know what I'm saying?

1232
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:01,030
It was like you used to have to
have the service to facetime.

1233
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,360
Now everybody can facetime.
You know what I mean?

1234
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,410
It's like people don't even call each
other no more. They just facetime,

1235
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,740
so we feel like, oh man, came up

1236
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,070
this, this is blah, blah, blah.
Like we feel good about that.

1237
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:18,040
We feel excellent about it,
but there's more.

1238
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,150
I feel like that's just me. I just
feel like they're just sitting on it.

1239
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,040
You know what I mean?
They're waiting to give it to us.

1240
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,880
I don't think companies have
any reason to do that. Yeah.

1241
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,820
The only reason to do that would be to
get rid of the stock of the stuff that

1242
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,920
they're already selling.
That'd be the only reason.

1243
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:35,140
Cause sometimes when companies
announce a new products,

1244
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:37,330
common people stopped
buying the old product.

1245
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,130
Like corvette is having a
problem with that right now.

1246
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:43,650
Cause the corvette [inaudible] excuse me.
They got in this car, the Zr one thing.

1247
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,760
It's a demon.
It's ridiculous.

1248
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:49,360
So you could go to a store and buy
a car that has that much horsepower,

1249
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,870
but a lot of people don't want to buy
them because then there's a new corvette

1250
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:54,270
coming out in like a year.

1251
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:58,390
That's a mid engine total read new design
that we want to be stuck with the old

1252
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:01,930
one. Gotcha. People get weird.
Yeah, that's true. So in that sense,

1253
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:05,260
they might be holding out on what
they're about to be able to do,

1254
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:09,400
but like we saw with that foldable phone
at Samsung tried to come out with and

1255
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:12,250
then they had to take it back
because it was so defective.

1256
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:13,360
So many of them were breaking.

1257
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,210
It was a giant embarrassment and they
pulled the whole thing and now they're

1258
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,160
trying to rework it and
figure out what to do with it.

1259
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,550
That that's like if a company
has something like that happen,

1260
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,850
and that's the number two smartphone
company in the world. They're number one,

1261
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:28,090
right? Samsung's number one while
ways number two, apples number three.

1262
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:32,830
That's a number one cell
phone manufacturer in the
world and they got that kind

1263
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:36,610
of a fuck up. There's no way they're not
holding back anything. I don't think so.

1264
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:40,150
I think they're trying to sell the
best shit they have right now and then

1265
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:42,850
they're in development with
the next level shit right now.

1266
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:46,720
But as far as like what they can bring
to market but they have is what they

1267
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:47,554
bring to market.

1268
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,250
I think like those onscreen fingerprint
sensors that didn't use to be able to do

1269
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:55,000
that and now they can just touch
the glass and it reads it all.

1270
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:55,810
That shit is like,

1271
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,060
they're just trying to get it dialed in
to the point where they could sell it to

1272
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:01,660
enough people and it doesn't
break like that stupid folding.

1273
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:06,220
Did you see that folding screen is like
a fucking like it was a regular phone

1274
01:16:06,221 --> 01:16:10,990
but it folded them. Yeah, it would fold up
into like an iPad. IPAD, yeah. Yup. Yeah.

1275
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,890
That's just stupid.

1276
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,450
But that thing kept breaking and you
know when it came out everybody was like,

1277
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:21,370
Holy Shit, this is the future. The Glass
Benz. I think there's like, like you said,

1278
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,720
there's like the, the, the people who just
freak out about whatever's new, right.

1279
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:30,490
And then there's like, shit that really
moves the, you know what I'm saying? Like,

1280
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,250
like really changes shit.
You know what I mean? Sure.

1281
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,850
And there's a huge
difference between those.

1282
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,870
Like you've got the people who just
want the new shit and then you got

1283
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,220
motherfuckers who's actually like
doing shit that changes things forever.

1284
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,730
Like streaming changed music forever,
you know what I'm saying?

1285
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:53,170
So it's like many discs and all of
that other stupid shit that people were

1286
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:56,740
trying to do to change music. It
didn't work. You know what I mean?

1287
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:57,850
And it didn't exist.

1288
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:01,000
So it's like the one thing that
stands out and changes things forever.

1289
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:05,170
That's what motherfuckers remember.
I don't know if they're holding it or not.

1290
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,800
It is what it is. But like there's
some smart motherfuckers who

1291
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,300
designed this shit for us, you know what
I'm saying? And at the end of the day,

1292
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:18,920
like the pit, you got people who just
consume it and they're just like, aw man,

1293
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:21,410
I'm here for, for whatever,
whatever. Like you know what I mean?

1294
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:26,740
And then I feel like there's a lot of
people who understand it and know how to

1295
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:28,280
play off of,
you know what I mean?

1296
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:31,730
Those people's emotions and that's where
you get like, you know what I mean?

1297
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:35,600
What we have now and me personally,

1298
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,400
I love everything.

1299
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:42,401
Like I'm not a person who like it stuck
with the old shit or has to have all of

1300
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:46,760
the new shit either. Like I'm just
like obsessed with life in general.

1301
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:50,780
Like all of this shit fucks me up.
But it's crazy.

1302
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,790
It's insane. We living in same
time, we live in an insane time.

1303
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:59,650
What's cool about today too is that we
can go and still like appreciating you

1304
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,960
some of the shit from the past. Like
a record player. Yeah. User record.

1305
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,650
Listen to some old records. Right.
You know and realize like, wow,

1306
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:10,040
this is how people used to get their
music sit in front of the record player

1307
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:13,910
with headphones on. I remember being a
kid doing that would listen to the album.

1308
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:17,660
They open up the all album looking at
the art. That was a big part of an album.

1309
01:18:17,661 --> 01:18:20,710
Right. What was the photo layout?
What was the, the pictures were,

1310
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,780
it's crazy how everybody thinks like
the new shit ruins the older shit too.

1311
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:28,520
Right. It's like people still enjoy
everything. Yeah. Like you know,

1312
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:32,690
it's just stages of it. I love that.
That old should exist. Yeah. Hell yeah.

1313
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,820
Go back and listen to
some of that old stuff.

1314
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:39,240
People don't watch tapes anymore though.
Like you can't get like a VHS like that.

1315
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,210
That's not the move.
Yeah.

1316
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:46,750
Those are dead and gone be h s c h and
when someone would give you a copy of a

1317
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:51,020
copy and it was all like every now and
then I have a little lines through and

1318
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:54,290
shit. You get like second, third
generation copies of friends. Yeah.

1319
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:58,280
Vhs is are done, bro. Even me, I
don't know if you remember this,

1320
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,730
but you used to be able to buy
movies right after they came out,

1321
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:05,000
especially in New York because dudes would
sit in the back of the movie theater.

1322
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:09,110
I like the little bootleg
joints. Yeah, Yup. Yeah. And
watched the movie from like,

1323
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:13,460
it was like a video camera and be
like in their video in the movie.

1324
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:17,420
Yeah, that was, that was crazy.
That was a crazy time. Yeah.

1325
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:18,860
They weren't hiding shit back then.

1326
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:24,470
They were using all of their technology.
That's everything.

1327
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:26,720
They had everything they fucking had.

1328
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:30,920
The crazy thing is that not that
long ago per terms of the human race.

1329
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,680
That's not that long ago. That's the
nineties that's, that's so recent.

1330
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:37,610
This is what,
2019 so I 20 years.

1331
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,700
So you go back 2124 years maybe.

1332
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,540
And I imagine if you could see what the
fuck 24 years from now is just crazy.

1333
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:51,910
I've related to like when I was younger
in the 90s cause I was like a baby in

1334
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:54,710
the 90s I wasn't even a teenager.

1335
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,340
So 20 years from this was the
70s and shit was totally like,

1336
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:00,981
you know what I'm saying?

1337
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:05,750
So it's like now from 20 years from
to for that to be the same time frame.

1338
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:08,040
Like that shit is crazy me.
You really

1339
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,330
want to know how crazy it is man.

1340
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,360
Get yourself into like a 1970 Plymouth
and drive that thing and realize that in

1341
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:20,070
1970 [inaudible] that's how people drove.
They drive this thing,

1342
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:24,210
they like it barely knows where, where
your talents are. Yeah. Hell yeah.

1343
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:28,950
I could do this with the steering
wheel steering in the 60s and Shit Bro.

1344
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:33,240
Like you're ready to turn the thing. A
lot of them didn't, a lot of them didn't.

1345
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,190
But do you use,

1346
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,790
those cars were terrible and
that was just a few years ago.

1347
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,010
I mean in terms of like human history,
right?

1348
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,050
If you looked at a block
of time in history,

1349
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:46,920
like if you looked up difference between
1820 and 1840 and our head it's like

1350
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,460
that's the same shit.
1820 1840 what the fuck was different?

1351
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,323
There was nothing different.

1352
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:56,430
But if you look at our
generation 40 years ago to now,

1353
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,480
it's insane. It's true. That's insane.
It doesn't even make sense. It's nuts.

1354
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:03,270
It's a bear. We're barely
the same thing, bro.

1355
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:09,660
It's crazy. It's crazy.
Have you driven a Tesla?

1356
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:15,150
No, I have it. That good. The
preposterous to preposterous car.

1357
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,770
What's the deal with them? That's so
fast. It doesn't make sense really.

1358
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,940
Every other car you drive afterwards,
we'll feel stupid. You could drive mine.

1359
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,170
You've got Tesla. Yeah. Yeah. You
could drive it there. That legit.

1360
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,200
It's the most ridiculous thing I've
ever driven in my life. Fuck did.

1361
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:35,130
It doesn't make any noise.
It doesn't make, it makes
zero noise. This makes noise.

1362
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,370
It's a fucking rap

1363
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:45,280
music video.
Entourage

1364
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,183
style.

1365
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:51,250
Girls in their underwear house
dancing bottle of champagne.

1366
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:53,530
Girl in my house so much.
Just follow you.

1367
01:21:53,531 --> 01:21:57,090
The camera just to see who rings
your doorbell, right? I don't know.

1368
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,980
I know who that girl was at the party.

1369
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:05,890
What were we just talking about?
Teslas. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a spaceship.

1370
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,240
It's next level.

1371
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,060
If you think that they're holding
back anything in the automotive world,

1372
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:12,940
drive that thing and you'll see
Nah, that's, that's the thing.

1373
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,380
I feel like all cars are going to look
alike and they're gonna look like Teslas.

1374
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:20,710
So you're going to have the super fast
one for like the elite motherfuckers,

1375
01:22:20,711 --> 01:22:24,280
but then they don't have like regular
ones and then we're all going to have the

1376
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:26,710
same car or we're all going to have the
same phone where I'm going to have the

1377
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:30,170
same watch and we'll all,
because it controls everything.

1378
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:35,080
Like they control your house. So it's
like everything is integrated. The TV,

1379
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:38,260
the Xbox,
it's like you all wanted in one.

1380
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:40,630
So the only way to do that is
for everything to be the same.

1381
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,180
So like if the Tesla,
is that ill,

1382
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:46,210
I never drove driven one
but if it's that ill,

1383
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:49,800
I don't see why people wouldn't be into
it. Like it's just a pain in the asses.

1384
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,390
It takes a long time to charge it.

1385
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,880
I mean even if you have a
Tesla supercharger thing,

1386
01:22:54,881 --> 01:22:58,900
like I have one on a wall mounted
charger that's, it's like more amps type.

1387
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:03,070
It's nice, but it still takes a few
hours to charge if it's almost dead.

1388
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:08,710
Whereas you can get gas like five
minutes. Exactly. Portable chargers.

1389
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,600
No, no, no. They ain't do [inaudible]. No,

1390
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,930
you need insane amount of
power to power that thing.

1391
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:18,700
But how long giant batteries in it
just takes hours and hours to fill up.

1392
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,110
That doesn't sound like fun.
Well,

1393
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:24,070
because it goes 317 miles to see
this race they did with the tunnel.

1394
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,210
Two Teslas at the same spot, like I guess
it's in Hawthorne where they have it.

1395
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,100
The one on the right is using the tunnel.

1396
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,940
They haven't completed in the one
the left is going above ground. No.

1397
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,480
Is this tunnel like auto drive?

1398
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,620
It's got fuck things got those tracks on
the side so that it can stay in place.

1399
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:41,680
Look how fast ads going 127 miles an hour.

1400
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:45,490
So not comfortable with that and it
slows right down the way that it moves

1401
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:49,660
differently. That's how robots are
gonna kill us as crazy. It's so fast.

1402
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,800
You can't believe how fast it is.
That guy's not moving at the top.

1403
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:55,080
And the guy's moving very fast.

1404
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,930
Takes him four and a half minutes to go
the same time. It takes six guy a minute.

1405
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,820
That guy's battery's dead as fuck
on the right. I'll tell you that.

1406
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,620
If you stop on that thing for that long,

1407
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,570
you better be prepared for
that shit to drink quick.

1408
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:09,310
Especially when it's in ludicrous mode.
That's what they call it. Ludicrous mode.

1409
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,460
Yeah, and now they have
ludicrous. Plus I'm,

1410
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,710
I don't even want to turn that shit on.
I don't need that. What kind of assholes?

1411
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,810
Unhappy with ludicrous
mode was gonna ask before.

1412
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:19,990
Don't you think there's some car
company trying to beat them? Yeah.

1413
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,530
Has to be right. Tesla has a roadster
or have you seen the Tesla roadster?

1414
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,800
Oh my God. Jamie pulled
that up. It's a spaceship.

1415
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:31,630
It's this little sports car looking
spaceship that goes zero to 60 in 1.9

1416
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:35,830
seconds. It's a spaceship.
It's a spaceship.

1417
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:40,840
That's the Tesla roadster. I like
that. It's a dope look and little car.

1418
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:44,260
The roof comes off too. As Real,
Huh? Oh my God. That thing's a demon,

1419
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:46,540
I think is a dean.

1420
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:51,490
How much of that because
I think it's $200,000 it's
real. Yeah. It's not out yet.

1421
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:56,730
I'm working on it. Oh, okay.
They're working on releasing
it soon. Yeah. 200 grand.

1422
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:01,910
Look at that 1.9 seconds. Zero
to 60 yeah. I don't need that.

1423
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:10,210
They just seem the electric cars, it
seemed like the future. But again,

1424
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,360
that one's going to be interesting
because it has 600 miles.

1425
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:17,860
It goes 660 miles I think
without, uh, without charging,

1426
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:22,720
which is long distance minds
and like 317 the new ones,

1427
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,190
the ones that have now like
three 17 that's dope, man.
That's amazing. It's wild.

1428
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:32,200
Like my mind is literally blown
by this shit. Yeah. I mine too.

1429
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:34,510
Like for real,
like that shit blows Madsen.

1430
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,030
Imagine if you one of those people
that makes those things. Yeah.

1431
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,160
Like that's your job.

1432
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:43,600
I feel like it's like really a
process like scientific like,

1433
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:47,410
you know, cause you don't want nobody to
hurt themselves. You know what I mean?

1434
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:52,210
So you have to get it just right. Sure.
It's like, what's the process of that?

1435
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:52,450
Like,

1436
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:57,450
what are the fuck are they doing like
with technology and and electricity in a

1437
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:02,620
car? Yeah, and they have
all the, all these safety
features. They have auto drive.

1438
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:07,610
That's itself saying it's going to be so
fast. Guy Have Hell safety. Jesus Christ.

1439
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:12,110
I'm just going to let you in. I can't
turn this thing off. Oh, there it is.

1440
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,900
The same girl. I don't know. She's
persistent. She's a go getter.

1441
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,790
I don't know.
She need to go get something else,

1442
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,021
but yeah man.

1443
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:28,310
I mean it's when you drive something
like that and you realize like, oh, okay,

1444
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:33,020
just 30 40 years ago, cars were these
stinky, weird things that barely steered,

1445
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:33,670
right?

1446
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:36,710
And now you have these things that it
seemed like it seemed like there from a

1447
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:40,430
futuristic movie and you can
get them right now. It's crazy.

1448
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:44,810
Like it's insane because people like,
okay,

1449
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:48,200
where are we going to be
without transportation? We
got to go somewhere. Right?

1450
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,690
We got to get there somehow.
What is this, Jamie?

1451
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,561
I was looking up.

1452
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:53,960
I thought I saw something today
about a Lamborghini electric car,

1453
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:57,140
but this fell into this hole of
the tourism. Millennials, some new,

1454
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,660
it is an electric car.
Buy a Lamborghini that self heals.

1455
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:04,280
It has some sort of carbon fiber
technology that allows it to fix itself.

1456
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:06,470
If it cracks watts dry,
I don't know.

1457
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh yes.
We text cracks and damages to go.

1458
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:15,570
It's a fucking transformer. The
transformer, it's going to heal itself.

1459
01:27:15,571 --> 01:27:20,450
That I was hoping you had heard of it.
No. Self healing. Oh my God. There we go.

1460
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:24,470
It's going to fix itself.
Sorry to distract from that,
but yeah, it's Italian,

1461
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:27,530
right? Yeah. Listen to me. That's
my people. It ain't gonna work.

1462
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:31,750
Those savages.
It looks insane though.

1463
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:36,050
This they're thinking big. If you'd want
to go on a long trip and a Lamborghini,

1464
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:37,490
you're out of your fucking mind.
That thing.

1465
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:40,970
We'll leave you in the middle of the
desert. They thinking B. That's it. Yeah.

1466
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:46,490
That is a, it's got these weird, crazy,
unbelievably good looking car tires. Damn,

1467
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:49,690
that looks like the future. That's fine.
Look at that thing. Suspicious Shit.

1468
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,650
But you, if you take one of those, you
know that it's made by Italians. Right?

1469
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:59,180
You know, like, like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1470
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:03,710
It's the accident with the car. It
makes sense. It's so flamboyant.

1471
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:07,940
Look at the wheels on that thing. What
the fuck is with those wheels? Wow.

1472
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:12,200
That's crazy. And Italian
spaceship. Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,900
Cars are getting closer and
closer to spaceships. Yeah.

1474
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:18,020
What do people start flying around?
You comfortable with that?

1475
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:23,030
I'm not want anybody to landing
on my house. Landing on the house.

1476
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:27,480
Air Accidents. Yeah, man,
those don't seem too good. No.

1477
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,620
In the regulation of
what lane do you stay,

1478
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,500
because we worked so hard to
develop these roads. It's like,

1479
01:28:33,501 --> 01:28:37,010
well where are we going now?
Like what's going on here?

1480
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:40,660
You imagine if we had like a floating
bubble highway system, right?

1481
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:45,620
Like there's balloons held on by row by
rope that go all the way to the ground

1482
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,800
and that marks the past where you're
allowed to fly your flying car through.

1483
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:53,180
But people don't look and they
slamming each other and no man,

1484
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:57,380
you're out there in the park with your
kids regulation with suck on that. Yeah,

1485
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:01,950
man. Sure. How do you stop people
from, they would have to be autonomous.

1486
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,840
Who would have to be
like Tesla auto drive,

1487
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:06,120
so just takes you up and
it just brings you around.

1488
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:09,190
We'd have to be something like
that. That makes sense. Yeah. You,

1489
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,820
we couldn't leave it up to
people not with flying. Hell No.

1490
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,980
It's to me different personalities.
Yeah.

1491
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:16,620
But then there's going to be lazy people
that don't charge their fucking flying

1492
01:29:16,621 --> 01:29:21,360
car and then it gets up there and it's
like that did that, did that, that,

1493
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:23,130
that like you didn't charge it.

1494
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:27,210
You shouldn't be able to take off if
it's not at a certain, if it's, if it's,

1495
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,090
if it's capable of dying.
I agree.

1496
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:32,970
Grounded then when you're
gonna need more regulation,

1497
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
so we have more government
[inaudible] air laws have to,

1498
01:29:38,401 --> 01:29:42,900
that's the only way we need more
government. More regulations. Air Cops,

1499
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:47,940
Eric. Oh my gosh. They're police.
Listen to talk about those gaps.

1500
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,530
Please. Still be even on more on edge.
They ground in the ground police. Yeah.

1501
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:55,790
Yeah. Cause they're in
the air. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1502
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:59,010
They're probably going to be super
paranoid up there for sure. For sure.

1503
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,310
Well, if we ever do eventually
get to space travel,

1504
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:08,940
if human beings ever do figure out how
to like go to other planets and set up a

1505
01:30:08,941 --> 01:30:11,010
civilization on Mars
or something like that,

1506
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:16,550
that's probably what the real next level
future of humanity's going to be other

1507
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:20,760
than artificial life. If we can really
figure out how to set up a base somewhere.

1508
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:24,840
Do you think you would ever go
if there was a base on Mars,

1509
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:30,000
it takes six months to go to Mars. If
there was a threat on earth, a threat.

1510
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:34,140
Yeah. It was like Yo earth is not
to be fucked up like an asteroid.

1511
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:39,500
Yeah, I would. You know, I
would if Mars was all right,

1512
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:44,430
I would try to go, I will take my
family and go, yeah, totally. Wow.

1513
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:49,440
To save my family. That makes sense. To
save your family. Yeah. What if, yeah.

1514
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:53,120
What if Mars was awesome? What if they
figured it out? If it was awesome. Yeah.

1515
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:57,620
I'd rather just die on hers.
Yeah, I'm cool here. I'm good.

1516
01:30:59,040 --> 01:30:59,710
Yeah.

1517
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:04,170
I just wonder once they actually do
start going from Earth to other planets,

1518
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,270
how many people are going
to be willing to do that?

1519
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,740
All the rich folks you think so?
I think rich folks want to go into orbit.

1520
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,060
I don't think they want to go to Mars.

1521
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,290
I don't think there's a whole lot of
live there. Maybe if you can come back.

1522
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:20,190
Let's say we're far in the
future vacation. Yeah. Take
a little vacation to Mars.

1523
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,360
It takes six months to get there.

1524
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:25,320
Everybody think if it takes six
months to get there, hold on.

1525
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:28,410
That's another one's a long I think.
I think a lot of people would do that.

1526
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,990
I think a lot of people would do it.
I think you're right.

1527
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,990
If they knew they could come back because
then they'd be able to brag about it.

1528
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,980
People would love to brag about going
to Mars just like that time travel thing

1529
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:42,090
where like take six earth months to get
there, but for you it's like two weeks.

1530
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,000
Ooh. I don't think it
works that way, but yeah,

1531
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:47,700
I was wondering how does that have to be
like at the speed of light for that to

1532
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:52,140
happen? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Now
we're getting deep. Interesting.

1533
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:56,400
You might be able to go save some time
if you go do that months lose some time

1534
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:57,840
though.
I know that's a fact.

1535
01:31:57,841 --> 01:32:01,990
Like if you go into space
at a particularly high
rate of speed and then you

1536
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:04,570
figured out how to come back,
like your brother,

1537
01:32:04,571 --> 01:32:08,980
your twin brother would be way
older than you. Yeah. Damn.

1538
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,060
Yeah, that makes sense. I went
to see this Brian Cox show.

1539
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,260
Do you know Brian Cox is

1540
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:15,230
astrophysicists?

1541
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:20,700
He had a show he did in La and in the
back they have this gigantic screen and

1542
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:26,250
it's this real high resolution screen
and it showed all of the galaxies in the

1543
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:28,630
universe.
It showed all of them that you know,

1544
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:33,631
just all jammed in together with like
appropriate space in between them and you

1545
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:38,620
look at it and you just go,
what w what the fuck is that?

1546
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,820
Like we're in that thing.

1547
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:45,070
We're one.in just trillions of
dots of all these other galaxies.

1548
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,670
Dan, through the known universe. I've
never seen anybody show it that way.

1549
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:54,510
And one of the things he talked about
was that the rate of time is not the same

1550
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:57,610
for each person.
Even on earth.

1551
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:02,200
Like depending on where you go and what
you do and what speed you travel at.

1552
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:07,330
If you and I were born on the exact same
day and we both got to watch and that

1553
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:11,820
watch was perfectly calibrated and you
put your watch on and I put my watch on

1554
01:33:11,821 --> 01:33:15,190
and we met when we're 80 if
our watches are still working,

1555
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,940
the time would be different because
we've lived through different time and it

1556
01:33:18,941 --> 01:33:22,420
might be only incremental,
a tiny increment like a
second or a couple seconds,

1557
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,800
but enough so that in the whole
unit and I was high as fuck.

1558
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:30,520
So while I'm there watching this thing,
the whole thing just blew me away.

1559
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,700
I was like, this is a crazy way to look
at the universe. This is it right there.

1560
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,620
Yeah. If anybody gets a chance, if you,

1561
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:38,950
that's just one galaxy that
they're showing that was,

1562
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:44,980
it's a one Gaussi colliding with another
galaxy. It's fucking spectacular. Whoa.

1563
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:46,263
Yeah.

1564
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,900
Do you get into space?
Documentaries Mountain? You got to,

1565
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:58,170
I just don't believe everything
that everybody tells me.

1566
01:33:58,171 --> 01:34:00,540
So what about shit like that?

1567
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,170
So I would have to get it
from a reliable sports source.

1568
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:08,010
You would have to tell me like the
good, okay. Space Shit. And he,

1569
01:34:08,011 --> 01:34:12,930
Neil degrasse Tyson ones. Um, uh,
Lawrence Krauss has got some good stuff.

1570
01:34:12,931 --> 01:34:17,100
He's got good audio books too. Um, that
Brian Cox guides as good as it guys.

1571
01:34:17,101 --> 01:34:17,934
He's a genius.

1572
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:22,940
He used to be a musician is actually in
like a a pop band thinking the eighties

1573
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,610
and the eighties. Yeah. Like
a popular pop band and uh,

1574
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:30,810
he's a legit astrophysicist. He
just talks about space. Yeah.

1575
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:35,670
He gives these very entertained with this
Guy Robin Inns and they have this like

1576
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:39,330
stage show and you know, he comes out and
talks about things and explains things.

1577
01:34:39,331 --> 01:34:42,540
But explain when he explained that time
thing to me that if we live the same

1578
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:46,950
life that our watches would be
different. Yeah. That's crazy.

1579
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:51,960
I love shit like that. I'm writing
his name down. Brian Cox. Cox,

1580
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,050
not like the dicks. Yeah, I don't,

1581
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,160
I wouldn't put that name in there.
Of course

1582
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:02,860
that could be a problem. Ah, yeah. If you
get a chance to see that show, man, it's,

1583
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:04,370
it's a,
it's a good thing to see too,

1584
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,920
because it's so different than anything
else you go to see. Like for me,

1585
01:35:06,921 --> 01:35:09,620
I'm always at comedy clubs.
I'm always, you know,

1586
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:11,150
either in the audience or on stage.

1587
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,920
So to be there at this place in the
audience of this weird kind of like show

1588
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,930
slash science seminar, it's
amazing. It's tight. Yeah.

1589
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:25,560
That shit seems crazy as fuck
to learn and laugh. Yeah.

1590
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:29,030
I gotta I gotta get you on some
science documentaries. Hell yeah.

1591
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,080
When you're smoking weed and
watching science documentaries,

1592
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:36,230
that's helped my music that's in
the real thoughts come out. Kids,

1593
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,610
we realize there's no
getting away. If you, if you,

1594
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:43,160
you know that paranoid feeling that
you get sometimes you get too high.

1595
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,390
If you have that paranoid feeling combined
with a science documentary on space,

1596
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:52,490
then you realize, yeah, we're
moral. Very insignificant. Exactly.

1597
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,440
And you seem extra high cause you're
high watching space. It's like, Yo,

1598
01:35:57,441 --> 01:35:58,540
this dude is stolen.

1599
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:03,980
How have you gotten high your whole life?

1600
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:10,030
I started when I was 16 when you were
16 that started smoking every day.

1601
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:15,050
Wow. So right around the time where you
were becoming successful as a rapper,

1602
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:20,830
it was really like high school because
I hated school and I was just so done

1603
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:28,151
with it and I was selling pot and my
mom found out and she was low key.

1604
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:34,580
Just super cool with it. It was
like, oh like I smoke, you smoke,

1605
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,800
we smoke. And you know what I mean? Wow.
It actually helped me get through school,

1606
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:42,850
like to make it made it tolerable,
like, you know what I mean? Sure.

1607
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,790
I was able to deal with like the shit
that I did want to deal with it because

1608
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,670
I'm an intelligent kid.
I just really didn't like school.

1609
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:53,240
I didn't like the school that I went
to was good. I went to a nice school,

1610
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:56,750
but it was just, I grew up in a time where
it was like, you know what I'm saying?

1611
01:36:56,751 --> 01:37:00,230
Was we weird so well,
every school for every kid,

1612
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,580
it's not what you want to do every day.

1613
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:03,830
It was just not what you
want to do every day.

1614
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:08,780
And like you got teachers who say certain
things to you and it's like, all right,

1615
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,790
I understand what I'm really here for.
You know what I mean?

1616
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:14,540
And I see who I am to you
and you let it be known.

1617
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:18,780
It's kind of hard to like take those
people serious and want to do the work,

1618
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:21,600
you know,
want to follow their lead man.

1619
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:24,980
It's like for me that was the bare
minimum was like graduated high school.

1620
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:28,720
I was like, I could move on with the
rest of my fucking life after that. Yeah,

1621
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:32,730
we'd helped me get through high school.
I would say that for everybody.

1622
01:37:32,731 --> 01:37:36,190
I ain't gonna say it for everybody that
helped me. I believe you. Yeah. Yeah,

1623
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,080
that makes sense. Cause there's a
lot of shit that's not that fun,

1624
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:43,100
but when you're high becomes
interesting. A lot of shit. Yeah. Yup.

1625
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:47,420
That's why air travel, air
travel is always better when
you're high, way better.

1626
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:50,690
Way Better. You can take
the pills, you have edibles,

1627
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:54,290
you do whatever you want to come. Like
appreciative of the experience. Exactly.

1628
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:56,070
Yeah. Yup. Let's be

1629
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,130
up there flying for real.
Yeah.

1630
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,220
There's something to me about music,
listening to music too,

1631
01:38:02,221 --> 01:38:06,240
and a plane while you're high to
say that has like extra impact,

1632
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:09,000
like headphones on a plane
surrounded by all these people.

1633
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,190
No one's talking flying through the sky,

1634
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:16,191
going 500 miles an hour and 30,000 feet
above the rocks and then the music kicks

1635
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:18,950
in. Yeah. Yep.

1636
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:23,460
Something about old music too far for me.
Like,

1637
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:28,650
like lately I've been getting into a
lot of like really old rock and roll,

1638
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:30,270
you know,
just,

1639
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:35,270
just imagining what it would be like to
like to be around those people alone.

1640
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:40,530
You know. See Keith Richards and
Mick Jagger in the 70s, you know,

1641
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,510
to see little Richard and to
see James Brown live. Hell yeah.

1642
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:49,440
James Brown performed a live
God. Yup. There was nothing,

1643
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,970
it's hard for us to imagine there was
nothing like that before them. You know,

1644
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,080
like there's,

1645
01:38:55,080 --> 01:39:00,080
there's levels of like impact that those
early musicians have that it's hard to

1646
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:03,780
really historically put into place because
there wasn't anybody like them before

1647
01:39:03,781 --> 01:39:07,200
that nope. No rock and
roll stars. No rap stars.

1648
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,390
Think of how recent that is. Yeah. That's
super new. Standup comedy is only about

1649
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,810
maybe like 70 years old or some shit
like that. Maybe. Maybe. Really.

1650
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:23,550
Maybe you could say a hundred if you
want to get crazy. But rappers like 30,

1651
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,780
30 years old, 40 maybe, maybe four. Yeah.

1652
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:31,930
Aa and it keeps evolving.
Keeps a Bob and Jim.

1653
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,110
Yeah, like music in general. Um,

1654
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,560
my favorite genre is like pop music.

1655
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:44,340
Like I love anything that could be
considered pop because it changes with the

1656
01:39:45,251 --> 01:39:50,230
times, but you have these mega
stars, you know what I mean?

1657
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:54,880
Who just transcend like,
like it's, it's, it's like,

1658
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:58,300
so there'd be, they're larger
than life, like Michael Jackson,

1659
01:39:58,301 --> 01:40:03,160
you know what I'm saying? Like he's bigger
than just music, you know what I mean?

1660
01:40:03,161 --> 01:40:07,240
Like, and you, you become a legend,

1661
01:40:07,241 --> 01:40:11,230
like as time goes on,
but like to be a living legend,

1662
01:40:11,231 --> 01:40:15,070
like living in those times and to be
around those people and to really hear

1663
01:40:15,071 --> 01:40:17,590
their music and experienced
them and shit like that.

1664
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:22,480
I feel like that shit is crazy and it's
like a, it's a gift. Like for the fans,

1665
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,530
it's a gift to be that person.
It's a responsibility as well,

1666
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,900
but just like to be the one like,
like Beyonce, you know what I mean?

1667
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:34,690
Like that shit is crazy to me

1668
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:39,070
to be the one. Yeah. When
Michael Jackson was the one,

1669
01:40:39,071 --> 01:40:42,250
when there was no one before,
there was no real one like him.

1670
01:40:42,251 --> 01:40:44,260
I mean there was all
this and that's about it.

1671
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,710
There was other ones that were big.
They were very popular, very famous.

1672
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:51,070
But Michael Jackson Trans,
he transcended so hard.

1673
01:40:51,071 --> 01:40:54,280
I was listening to Wbcn in Boston

1674
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,740
as a rock and roll station
and they were like,

1675
01:40:56,741 --> 01:40:59,920
I know there's a rock roll station,
but this song is so fucking good,

1676
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:02,760
we're going to play it anyway. And
they played Michael Jackson. Yep.

1677
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:06,520
And we were like, wow. They
had been performance as a kid.

1678
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:11,521
So he worked his whole life to get to be
what it will look like 30 or something

1679
01:41:11,861 --> 01:41:16,270
like that. When he [inaudible]
up, there was nobody,

1680
01:41:16,271 --> 01:41:20,680
there was no roadmap for him. Nah,
that shit is amazing. Amazing.

1681
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:21,670
And he did,
you know,

1682
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:26,230
funk music and he went through disco and
you know what I mean? It's just like,

1683
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,160
wow. Yeah. Yeah man.

1684
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:34,060
I would've loved to have seen him live
before the controversy. Right. You know,

1685
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:37,870
just to just experience him as an artist
without having anything attached to it.

1686
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:41,500
Yeah. What he did or didn't
do, I don't know what he did.
You know, I have no idea.

1687
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,793
Doesn't look good,

1688
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,750
but I would have loved to have seen
him without the burden of that filming.

1689
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,510
It must've been insane.
And the only just to,

1690
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:54,511
just to see like he
was like a [inaudible].

1691
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,940
It needs to be a different word for work,
you know,

1692
01:41:57,941 --> 01:42:00,670
because sometimes it's not work.
It's a passion. Projects just,

1693
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:02,950
it's way better than work.
He's a different,

1694
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:05,080
you shouldn't have a different
word for a star. Yup.

1695
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:09,460
Cause he was like a supernova. He was
some rare thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1696
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,900
That might happen once every hundred
years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

1697
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,800
There's legends like Elton
John, Rod Stewart, and fucking,

1698
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:20,320
there's all kinds of legends.
But then there was Michael Jackson,

1699
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:24,670
he was above all of them.
It was a mania. Yeah.

1700
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:27,790
Kids would dress like them. Everybody
wanted to wear those thriller jackets.

1701
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:29,890
Right.
There's an art to it.

1702
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,430
I feel like every musician has a choice.

1703
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:36,310
Like if they want to go
there with it. Right. Yeah.

1704
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:40,870
I feel like Elton Elton John's and like
even like prints and shit like that,

1705
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,470
they stay true to exactly who they were.

1706
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,940
Not that Michael Jackson
didn't stay true to who he was,

1707
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:50,530
but he put himself into,
he put himself out there for the world.

1708
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,790
He did everything. He had
cartoons, he had sneakers, he had,

1709
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,330
he did everything, you know, the Beatles
music. Yeah. He bought, yeah. Like,

1710
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,440
you know what I mean?
Fucking dude on the other people's music.

1711
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,650
But like, yeah. Hell yeah. He was
doing hell of Shit. Yeah. I just think,

1712
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:13,000
um, there was no roadmap for
the poor guy. Right. You know,

1713
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,230
when you're living in that fantasy world
that nobody else can understand. Right.

1714
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:21,670
And there's no one before you, and then
everywhere you go, people are screaming.

1715
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,230
He never had a break down. There was no
breaks. There's nothing. You can do it.

1716
01:43:26,231 --> 01:43:29,770
He couldn't do anything. No. Hell Nah.
Hell Nah. Nothing normal. Nothing.

1717
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:32,820
That's crazy. That was up
the, I'm wondering if that,

1718
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:37,480
what that would be like until like if
Michael Jackson came around today and he

1719
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:40,570
didn't exist before,
he would for sure be a huge star.

1720
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:45,810
But I wonder if it would
be as crazy because there's
so many more stars now than

1721
01:43:46,421 --> 01:43:49,090
there were back then
because of the Internet,

1722
01:43:49,091 --> 01:43:52,280
because it's just more
venues now for musicians,

1723
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:56,390
for basically everyone, for Comedians,
for everyone, right. There's more outlets.

1724
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:58,580
So because there's more outlets
is more famous people. Right.

1725
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:02,930
I wonder if he would be as it would if
it would be as insane because back when

1726
01:44:02,931 --> 01:44:07,070
he was that famous, it wasn't like
anyone that was parallel, not even close.

1727
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:14,480
Yeah, man. What do you do? Listen
to old stuff. Yeah, I listened to,

1728
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:15,730
I like a,

1729
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,393
yeah,

1730
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:21,890
we,
I'll do like nineties R and B now.

1731
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:26,710
I like a funk music or like,
like Bootsy Collins. All right.

1732
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,450
I love Jimmy Hendricks. He's
one of my favorites. I like, uh,

1733
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:38,150
Curtis may feel, uh, Marvin Gaye, uh,

1734
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:42,980
freaking and cooling again. Fucking, uh,

1735
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:47,300
I listen to everything,
but I like a lot of the older soul music,

1736
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:51,200
like the spinners, uh, Patti
Labelle, you know what I'm saying?

1737
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:55,970
But I was raised on everything.
My Dad listened to Bob Marley.

1738
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,740
He listened to a freaking, uh, oh,

1739
01:45:00,741 --> 01:45:04,430
we used to listen to a lot of sting
and the police may, I love staying.

1740
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:09,230
He's one of my favorites. Um, just all
the jams, you know what I'm saying?

1741
01:45:09,231 --> 01:45:12,920
Like the classic shit, like if you could
put on any song, like for real, for real.

1742
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,470
And I fuck with it because I listened
to a lot of different music and yeah.

1743
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:23,090
Oh yeah. Marvin gay man. Yeah. He's one
of my favorite. He was phenomenal. Yeah.

1744
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:27,470
Marvin Gaye was really good and
it's tragic story. That was crazy.

1745
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:31,270
His Dad shot him. It's so
crazy. I, I dated a girl once.

1746
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:36,080
This girl was so nuts and, uh, I, we
were talking about shotgun. No, no, no.

1747
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,320
We're talking about Marvin Gaye.
You know what I'm saying?

1748
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:42,440
Like the second so insane that
his dad shot him and she said,

1749
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:45,500
imagine what a piece of shit he had to
be for his dad to shoot him. Yeah. Right.

1750
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:50,510
And I was like, what? I go,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1751
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:53,390
Why would you assume he's the Bz chicken?
His Dad fuck shot.

1752
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:58,010
If he's a piece of shit bothers his dad,
just get away from that shooting him.

1753
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:00,890
His Dad's a piece of shit like,
but it was amazing.

1754
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:03,920
She was like instantly thinking
he's a piece of shit. I'm like,

1755
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,770
I don't get your logic really.

1756
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:09,680
Someone with a good dad different because
she's someone who grew up with a good,

1757
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:14,300
she's still loved her dad. She was
close with her dad. Yeah. So I was like,

1758
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:16,550
Oh God, I'm, no. My Dad said to me,

1759
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:19,040
I'm like that that shot him
because he was Marvin Gaye.

1760
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:22,820
He's probably upset that his son
had become Marvin Gaye. Truth.

1761
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,850
Imagine being Marvin Gaye too weird.

1762
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:31,750
All your songs are like the best music to
fuck to. Yeah. Yeah. And he didn't have,

1763
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:34,370
there was nothing,
there was no slide into the DM now.

1764
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:38,770
They had to find them physically, but he
seemed like kind of like a faithful guy.

1765
01:46:38,771 --> 01:46:43,210
Like he seemed like he would find like
one chick fuck her right album about it.

1766
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:45,100
That would be a good narrative.

1767
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:49,330
I think it's hard for those
dudes if they're singing
about fucking all the time.

1768
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:50,160
It's coming

1769
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,360
their way to tsunami. They usually like
just want to fuck one girl like that.

1770
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:58,860
Right. Those, those love songs. Yeah,
exactly. Like when the music's dark,

1771
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:02,580
like easy either. You know what I
mean? Like he's fucking mad bitches.

1772
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:06,210
He wasn't talking about like, like
just one like right. Know what I mean?

1773
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,590
He wasn't on his Marvin Gay Shit.
I remember he said sexual healing.

1774
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,550
You know what I mean? When you get
that feeling he needs sexual healing.

1775
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:18,690
Like the shit made him feel
better. Yeah. When he was with her.

1776
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,180
That's a big difference
in the Nwa first album.

1777
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,740
I think difference in the message,
sexual healing.

1778
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:29,670
There's some shit from like the early
gangster rap days you listen to today,

1779
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:33,960
you're like, whoa man. Yup.
This is, this is crazy stuff.

1780
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:38,400
I remember it at the time when it was
first coming out and no one knew like no

1781
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:40,710
one could understand there was no music
like this before and then all the sudden

1782
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:41,790
you have ice tea.
Yeah.

1783
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:45,450
That was before they bought up the
freaking parental advisory on there.

1784
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:50,750
They made that because like it's like
your parents make sure y'all check this

1785
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:53,100
out before your kids get it.

1786
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:58,020
It was Al Gore's wife who was tipper Gore.
It was,

1787
01:47:58,110 --> 01:48:02,160
she was the one who was in charge. She was
like, she was leading the charge. Yeah.

1788
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:05,210
Against, I think it was her.
Make sure I'm right about that.

1789
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:09,560
Is that I'm not mad at that. That may
rap music better. You think so? Oh yes.

1790
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:13,270
Like made it more dangerous. Oh,
he put the, the extreme, the shoot.

1791
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:16,470
They were trying like a rated r movie.
They were trying to ban some stuff though.

1792
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,970
They were trying to ban
some amusing like uh Oh God,

1793
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,170
that was Florida. Florida's crazy.
Don't fuck around in Florida.

1794
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:29,370
Catch you in Florida.
They arrest people for anything.

1795
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:32,280
You can get arrested for absurdity
and boring. I'm straight, I'm good.

1796
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:35,250
I'm not going to Florida.
Florida was a, that's my goal,

1797
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:39,000
but I'm not going crazy in Florida.
Broward county. Yeah. Yeah.

1798
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,210
Just don't get arrested for
swearing. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1799
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:46,170
That's what they got two live
crew for explicit lyrics. Yeah.

1800
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:50,010
Fuck. I'm good on all that
shit about that. Right? Yeah.

1801
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:52,680
Those guys would like to
Lenny Bruce of wraps, right?

1802
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,770
Like Lenny Bruce is the guy when he got
arrested a bunch of times for stand up

1803
01:48:55,771 --> 01:48:59,100
comedy because he wouldn't change
his words and his, you know,

1804
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:02,720
swearing on stage in front of court.
That was two I've crew.

1805
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:07,080
And as you going to jail for
like for rap? Yeah. That's crazy.

1806
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,330
That's crazy for saying
some for saying something.

1807
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:11,640
Somebody doesn't like it so they
want to put you in a cage. Wow.

1808
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:14,610
Cause they don't like how you're saying
wow. They don't like what you're saying.

1809
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:15,650
They don't like how you're saying it.

1810
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,980
Could you arrest someone if
they just said that somewhere?

1811
01:49:19,981 --> 01:49:23,610
What if they're in the comfort of their
own house and they said the things that

1812
01:49:23,611 --> 01:49:27,790
are in that cause that illegal. Could
you yell it out the window? Yeah.

1813
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:32,070
Could I drive down the road yelling out
the window. Right. Should be able to.

1814
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,680
It should be able to see you man.

1815
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:38,340
How the fuck are you to tell people
that can't do that. But then Florida,

1816
01:49:38,341 --> 01:49:42,300
they're like nope, obscenity
for rap. Florida is like
its own world though. Like,

1817
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:46,380
that's why when shit goes down, it's
like, all right, and then this Florida.

1818
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:50,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is.

1819
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:55,410
It's so its own world that it's
being overrun with invasive species.

1820
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:59,140
[inaudible] a lady got attacked by a car.
A alligator just yesterday. Here. What?

1821
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:03,070
That Jamie. I feel like that happens
all the time down there all the time.

1822
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,090
More often than not.

1823
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:08,440
More often rather than not
necessarily in a good way.

1824
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:12,400
Set more often now than before
because there's a lot of them. Yeah.

1825
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:16,570
I could imagine being engaged or not
having nowhere to go scan it into Florida

1826
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,840
money. Eat some stupid lady like
clear. This is dumb and slow, bitch.

1827
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:23,480
I've been around for a long ass
fucking time. I'm hungry as fuck. Yeah,

1828
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:28,060
Florida's fucking crazy. Let's eat and
you just look at that lady and like,

1829
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:32,350
she's so annoying. Yeah. Maybe no one
will even notice. I don't even eat ladies,

1830
01:50:32,351 --> 01:50:37,180
but I'm going to do it today. They
dogs. They love the people's dogs.

1831
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,200
That's what's fucked up. I get snack
[inaudible] now. Yeah. I love dogs though.

1832
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:43,720
So I don't know.
But if I was at gator,

1833
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:47,890
a dog would be a good snack for sure.
I was a good meal per four.

1834
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,140
Prefer dog than the lady.
Yeah.

1835
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:54,890
People have closed on exact adjuster
sneakers and shit, man. Yeah.

1836
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:59,890
Yeah. Choose. It tastes good. If
you didn't live in California,

1837
01:50:59,891 --> 01:51:03,550
what state would you live in?
Hm.

1838
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:08,860
If I did live in Cali. What stayed
with, I live in not Georgia,

1839
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:13,360
not Florida. Not
Pennsylvania. Not New York.

1840
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:19,210
Not New York, Huh? Nah. Too
crazy. That'd be upstate New York.

1841
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:22,420
Ah Man. Maybe upstate. That's
going to call it though.

1842
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:24,970
Kinda worry about tickets to get.

1843
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,260
Fuck takes fuck text and then everybody
gets Lyme disease out there. Yeah.

1844
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:34,990
Damn. I don't, I don't know.
I never thought about that
with the shit hits the fan.

1845
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:40,030
I love California tsunami rolls over or
maybe I'll go to Australia every time

1846
01:51:40,031 --> 01:51:43,540
I'm on the highway nowadays and
it's jammed up bumper to bumper.

1847
01:51:43,541 --> 01:51:47,350
I just say imagine if something happened.
This is just Thursday,

1848
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:51,370
just irregular Thursday and it's bumper
to bumper magic or some shit went.

1849
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:54,370
That'd be fucked up. People wouldn't
know what to do when it rains out here.

1850
01:51:54,371 --> 01:51:57,910
People don't know what to do. Panic, they
slam into each other. This guy to drive.

1851
01:51:57,911 --> 01:52:00,970
It's like dog is just rain.
It's just water coming out the sky.

1852
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:05,260
Oh Jesus Christ. It's a
strange place to live. Right.

1853
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:09,590
Cause people aren't tested out here by
climate. Yeah. Yeah. On the east coast.

1854
01:52:09,591 --> 01:52:14,260
They're tested by climate. Yeah.
Yup. That winter comes, that's snowy.

1855
01:52:14,261 --> 01:52:18,710
Wind comes you gotta gotta
fuck pair guide. You got to
winterize your car. Yeah.

1856
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:23,350
Got To get snow tires. Yeah. That's for
fuckers out here. Don't know about that.

1857
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,750
They don't know. Hell No. They don't know.

1858
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,400
350 tornadoes last week where you just
heard about the Midwest, wherever.

1859
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:33,870
Tornado alley kind of shit. Yeah.
They got fucked up, man. Yeah.

1860
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:37,180
That was like Ohio. And
where else? Kentucky.

1861
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:41,470
I think just handing out tornadoes there.
He got hit hard.

1862
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:46,250
Yeah man. I mean, I don't know if that's

1863
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,890
really because of climate change.
Those are ramping up,

1864
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,400
but if they ramp up in an unprecedented
levels like that and it becomes

1865
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:56,720
impossible to live in Ohio or Kentucky
or anywhere where there's tornadoes,

1866
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,830
you imagine how nuts that is.

1867
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:01,160
If we find out that the center
of the country is just tornado,

1868
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:03,400
like a tornado bowling areas,

1869
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,260
both fill with tornadoes in Florida,

1870
01:53:07,261 --> 01:53:09,140
you just dodging hurricanes
most of the year.

1871
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:13,230
They just get lucky if it doesn't happen
where you are. Yeah. You get lucky. Yeah.

1872
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:17,780
You're a dick sticking out into the ocean
and it's right where all the tornadoes

1873
01:53:17,781 --> 01:53:21,090
get formed or all the
hurricanes get formed there.

1874
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:27,440
Right. It's like warmer waters. Right.
Here we go. We'll get started right here.

1875
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:28,730
Yep.
Fuck hurricanes.

1876
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:32,990
I've been in a little baby hurricane
before and I was living in Boston,

1877
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:37,370
which is pretty far away from the ocean
in terms of where my house was and it

1878
01:53:37,371 --> 01:53:41,630
still, it was like wow. And that was
a little baby one. It was nothing.

1879
01:53:41,631 --> 01:53:43,400
By the time it got to us,
it was nothing.

1880
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:47,480
I lived in Japan for two years and
they used to have some crazy fucking

1881
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:52,220
earthquakes over there. Oh really? Why
you were there? Earthquakes and typhoons.

1882
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:57,010
You saw both? Fuck yeah. Hell
yeah. Like what was the earthquake?

1883
01:53:57,011 --> 01:54:00,630
Black bad. You never been in
one here and the a baby ones.

1884
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:04,670
I've been in like a 5.5 bro.
Like I'm talking about whole room,

1885
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:08,810
just shaking like it's like
a ride at universal. Like,

1886
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:12,470
cause you see shit and moving. It's
like damn, is this really happening?

1887
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:17,990
And this shit happens bro. Like the
earthquakes over there and an insane wow.

1888
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:21,650
Yup. And they get some crazy rain
like one of the typhoons come.

1889
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:26,240
That shit gets really violent
too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Japanese or you know,

1890
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:29,420
they, they, they hold it down. What
were you doing living over there?

1891
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:33,560
My parents are military. Um, my
mom was in there for a little bit,

1892
01:54:33,561 --> 01:54:37,220
but then she got out and then my dad
was in there. He got out but remarried.

1893
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:42,120
So that's how I stayed in the
military thing was my stepmom.

1894
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:45,860
And uh, I would move, we would
live on base, you know what I mean?

1895
01:54:45,861 --> 01:54:49,580
For like two years or whatever. And
then I will move back with my mom. Wow.

1896
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:54,260
What was it like living in Japan? I
said it was crazy. Like it was fun.

1897
01:54:54,261 --> 01:54:56,030
I lived there in the late nineties,

1898
01:54:56,090 --> 01:55:00,020
so it was like when
technology was first changing,

1899
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:04,430
like music was just now going into
mp3s and shit like that. So, um,

1900
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:09,080
there was that, um, Pokemon
was really popular over there.

1901
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,270
Uh, it was fun. Like just
being a kid, like running
around fucking it up in Japan.

1902
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:16,700
It was cool, man. It was
funny as hell. That's, uh,

1903
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:21,280
an interesting little extra level to
your brain, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1904
01:55:21,281 --> 01:55:24,770
I grew up those two years in a
completely different kind of culture.

1905
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:28,790
Totally have a different understanding
of what's possible. Right. 100%.

1906
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:32,750
I think that's so big for kids,
man. Show them shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1907
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:37,180
Helped out a lot for sure. Um,
yeah, it was cool. How's do right?

1908
01:55:37,181 --> 01:55:40,100
Like as far as your perspective,
it's been around.

1909
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:44,460
I've only been in Tokyo for a few days,
only once where I was like,

1910
01:55:44,461 --> 01:55:47,770
this is one of the trippiest place I've
ever been in my life. So interesting.

1911
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:51,990
It was crazy. Live in there.
It was wild. Like no TV,

1912
01:55:51,991 --> 01:55:55,980
like regular TV. They don't got
any like American TV stations.

1913
01:55:56,160 --> 01:56:00,830
So for two years I was just
like disconnected. Yeah.

1914
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:03,250
Like I didn't have shit.
Yeah, it was crazy.

1915
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:08,220
So this was before Netflix and everything
too, right? And more youtube. Wow.

1916
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:12,300
Yeah. That's amazing. And then that
was probably really good for you.

1917
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,450
Not Sucked.
I couldn't watch wrestling,

1918
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:20,400
but it was really good for your brain.
No, no. It takes up. I need that.

1919
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:24,660
I need my entertainment man. Fuck that.
I needed to be a part of the world.

1920
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:29,400
I couldn't buy all the CDS and shit
that everybody was listening to. It was,

1921
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:33,030
it was whack. Did you learn
to speak Japanese? This a
little bit. Yeah. Yeah, Yup.

1922
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:36,360
Wow. Baby Japanese just to get around
and shit. But I forgot it though.

1923
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,530
You forgot it all. Not all of it
will. It'll come back if I like,

1924
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,850
you know what I mean?
You run me through it,

1925
01:56:41,851 --> 01:56:45,840
but I can't sit here and say no Japanese
words. How hard was it to learn?

1926
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:50,880
It wasn't difficult. No, Nah, Nah. It's
not difficult reading it is difficult.

1927
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,780
Oh yeah.
Because they have symbols or characters,

1928
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,410
so it's like one character
means like three of our words.

1929
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:02,160
Um, wow. Yeah. Yup.

1930
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:07,020
And then they have like three
different styles of writing it too.

1931
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:11,250
So it's like we have print and cursive.
They don't know three different ones.

1932
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:15,280
Oh, that sounds so annoying.
Yeah, it's weird with the,

1933
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:18,840
on one hand you don't want it to go
away because it's an ancient language.

1934
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:22,320
But the other hand you're like, can
you clean this up? Simplify this shift.

1935
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,680
Honestly think they got it down pat.
You know what I'm saying?

1936
01:57:25,681 --> 01:57:30,150
They only want us to have fucking know
that shit. You know what I'm saying?

1937
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:33,900
Like at the end of the day, they're
like, we'll learn English if we want to,

1938
01:57:33,901 --> 01:57:36,960
but if you want to learn Japanese,
it's going to be difficult, bro.

1939
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:40,740
I want to learn some
Asian language because I,

1940
01:57:40,741 --> 01:57:45,660
I'm fascinated by reading
like a Twitter messages from,

1941
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:49,050
you know, how much many more characters
they had. Yeah. They can write books.

1942
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:52,830
140 characters. It's like how many
words is that though? Yeah, no,

1943
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:54,090
that's a lot of fucking words.

1944
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:59,420
If it's two 82 80 of those Asian
where there's Chinese or Japanese,

1945
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:03,460
those little symbols that it's
a lot of talking man. Yeah.

1946
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:08,340
It's hard to put like the ingredients
on shit. Oh yeah, I'd imagine.

1947
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,550
Do they have symbols for
numbers or just use the numbers?

1948
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:16,030
I forgot what the numbers look like.
I think it's symbols. Really? Yeah.

1949
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,350
I don't imagine that. It's like one,
two and three. Oh Wow. Right. Yeah.

1950
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:23,070
Take something. Yeah. I never even
thought of that. Yeah. You're like,

1951
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:27,780
what does what? What is,
uh, let's go with Japanese.

1952
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:29,970
Does Japanese,

1953
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:34,800
does the Japanese language have
symbols that red out of your numbers?

1954
01:58:34,801 --> 01:58:38,850
Like you would write the letter, the
letters, t, h, r, e, e for three.

1955
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,850
Like that. Like you would write
three or you'd be the number three.

1956
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:46,990
Do they have that in Japanese?
Not because Japanese is like each,

1957
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:52,030
each knee son, she, oh, uh,
there's different, different,

1958
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:56,680
whole different words for it.
So it was like, one is Ichi.

1959
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,000
So however the symbol,
however you spell that in Japanese,

1960
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:05,080
I, I'm starting to cut her.
Remember what it looks like now.

1961
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,270
Do you think if you could
move back there right now,

1962
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:11,110
you just get right back into the
swing of things after awhile? Sure.

1963
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:16,180
[inaudible]
David Lee Roth moved their van Halen,

1964
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:20,950
the lead singer of on, he moved down
there and uh, took Kendo lessons.

1965
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,110
He lived there for like more than a year.

1966
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:27,330
I would probably appreciate it more now
as an adult. Do you think so? Yeah. Yup.

1967
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:31,210
Cause as a kid you kind of just want to
run wild and do everything that you see

1968
01:59:31,211 --> 01:59:35,620
on TV, but he must be annoyed. You
were stuck there. It was kind of weird.

1969
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:40,120
You know what I mean?
I was 13 like wanting to like go crazy.

1970
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:44,290
It was fun for a little while. But yeah,
you want to go back home and shit. Like,

1971
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,190
you know what I mean? Of course.
But as an adult I feel like I would,

1972
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:50,550
I would benefit a lot more from it.
There you go.

1973
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:54,130
So at this stage of your career,
when you're,

1974
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:57,220
when you're looking at like what you're
putting down w w when you're making

1975
01:59:57,221 --> 01:59:59,320
albums,
when you're putting together your music,

1976
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:02,740
like what excites you the most about it?
Um,

1977
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,300
I'm a huge fan of music in general,

1978
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,860
so I get just inspired off of like
production and shit like that.

1979
02:00:11,861 --> 02:00:15,640
Like the newest producers and
shit. Like, cause I like to go out,

1980
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:19,810
I like to enjoy myself, I like to have
fun. So whatever's popping like at that,

1981
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,700
that time,
whatever the sound is,

1982
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:24,940
whether it's west coast inspired
or if it's down south inspired,

1983
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,600
I'm just interested in finding my
own way of doing what's new and what,

1984
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:35,260
what my fans would love
from me because I'm like,

1985
02:00:35,261 --> 02:00:38,530
as a music person,
you want something new every time.

1986
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:41,170
You don't want the old shit all the time,
you could go by that.

1987
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:46,560
So I just love creating and
just coming up with what's new,

1988
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:49,390
you know what I mean?
Like I work with the newest producers.

1989
02:00:49,391 --> 02:00:53,390
I work with the newest artists I work
with, you know what I mean? I try to,

1990
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:56,290
I try to make my shit sound different
every time. I always tell my engineer,

1991
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,660
I'm like, Yo, let's fuck
with this shit sonically.

1992
02:00:58,661 --> 02:01:01,930
So it don't sound the
same as the last album.

1993
02:01:01,931 --> 02:01:06,931
Like come up with new ad libs or just
different shit that just kind of keep it

1994
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:10,930
fresh. Still do what people know
me for, you know what I mean?

1995
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:14,350
But it's like just coming up with new
ways of doing that. I get excited.

1996
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,060
That's awesome to hear.

1997
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:19,810
I love it when someone loves what they're
doing and it comes out great. Thanks.

1998
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:22,030
It's beautiful to see.
It really is.

1999
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:26,980
And that to me is one of
the most inspiring things
that I get at any artists.

2000
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:29,220
It's like hearing them talk
about their process. Right.

2001
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:32,170
In a why I always get jazzed up.
I love this.

2002
02:01:32,171 --> 02:01:37,171
It's crazy for me because like there's
different ways to to do what what I do.

2003
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:39,320
Like,

2004
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:44,320
I have so many ways I could sit there and
just come up with some shit like brand

2005
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:48,910
new or I have like this,
the oil commercial with my son wears.

2006
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,940
Like there's a team of people who like
come up with what could be the best for

2007
02:01:52,941 --> 02:01:56,600
me and I just do that shit and then it
just goes crazy. You know what I mean?

2008
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,960
It's like,
see you again is one of my biggest songs.

2009
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:03,580
And that song had like eight
different people on it.

2010
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:08,000
But I wrote two verses that the
person who made the original song,

2011
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,900
I wrote two versus for it that they
love more than anybody else's song,

2012
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:13,070
I mean anybody else's.

2013
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,780
So they gave me the whole record and
it ended up being my host. I mean my,

2014
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:18,730
one of my biggest songs,
you know what I mean? Wow.

2015
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,970
So it's like the process of just like
putting yourself in the situation and just

2016
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:27,350
being like, all right, cool. Let's
work. That's beneficial. As, as,

2017
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:30,770
as beneficial as being, you know
what I mean? A creative just, okay,

2018
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:32,120
I'm gonna do what I do.
You know what I mean?

2019
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:35,540
Sometimes you got to step outside
of that and just use your talents.

2020
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:38,450
It's like being an actor or,
you know what I mean?

2021
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:41,240
Like you just fill in that
spot that people need you lit.

2022
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:46,230
And I'm kind of at that point in my career
because I worked so hard and grinded

2023
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:49,170
and done so many things that
come up with so many, uh,

2024
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,740
waves and ideas that didn't exist before.

2025
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:57,320
Now I could use other people's ideas
and just be myself and still and get,

2026
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:02,300
you know, really big effect. And
everybody is happy. Beautiful. Yep.

2027
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:06,890
Dude, you live in the life. Got It nailed.
Oh, yeah. Congratulations. Oh yeah.

2028
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:11,880
I had a great time talking to you, man.
I appreciate you too, Bro. Very nice.

2029
02:03:11,881 --> 02:03:15,640
Thank you, sir. Thank you all. Yeah.
Um, that's it. Everybody. Bye. Yup.

2030
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:18,573
Awesome.

2031
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:23,670
[inaudible].
