00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Here's one way to define look up.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.870
Instead of needing the loop,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.240
we're just going to need to check to if the keyword is in the index,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.910
if it is, we can return the value associated with that keyword

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.150
using the dictionary look up like this.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.204
If it isn't, we return the value none.
