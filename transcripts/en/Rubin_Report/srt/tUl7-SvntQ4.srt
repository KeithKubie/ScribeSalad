1
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,410
All right people,
we are live on the youtube.

2
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,210
This is an impromptu live stream.

3
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:35,350
This came together yesterday because
there are so many forces in the world that

4
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,270
are moving so freaking fast right now.

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,990
And the man sitting across from me
has been tracking these things like a,

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,260
like a what? How are you tracking
these things? Like a mathematician,

7
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,590
like a mathematician, Eric Weinstein.
Everybody knows you already. All right,

8
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:50,110
we got a lot to do here real quick.

9
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,060
I'm going to go back to the camera
over there for just a second.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,430
So I'm going to do about an
hour and a half with Eric.

11
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,580
We're going to chat about all
kinds of stuff and then, no,

12
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm gonna keep talking to you.
Uh,

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,140
so we're gonna do about an hour and a
half together and then we're going to do

14
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:04,300
patrion only Q and a.

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,120
So only the Reuben select people are
going to get in on that patrion.com/uh,

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,610
Ruben report and a,
any people that joined at any level,

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,930
we'll be able to ask us
questions directly. No. Uh,
no censoring around here.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,430
Great. Are you all right with that?
Okay, so the reason I wanted to do this,

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,090
and we've been,

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,700
we've been trading a lot of calls the
last couple of days and the reason I was

21
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:24,821
like,

22
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:28,390
we gotta just do this tomorrow is that
I feel like I'm living in kind of two

23
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:32,530
worlds at the moment that I've been on
this tour with Peterson for the last,

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
you know, four months or so.
We've done about 50 cities.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,740
You've appeared at some of the shows
who where I've brought you on and you,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,000
you play the harmonica and get the
crowd going and 3000 people cheering as

27
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,420
you're playing the harmonica, which
I assume is your, your biggest great,

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,400
your greatest professional joy so far,

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,770
but I'm meeting quite literally thousands
of people every night in different

30
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,890
cities all over this country and
soon to be all over the world.

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,440
We're about to do 18 stops in,

32
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,170
in Europe that are coming together
over ideas that are putting political

33
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:06,010
differences aside, getting rid of the
hate, trying to figure out some answers.

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,330
They dig what, what we're doing, what's
going on with the IDW, all of that.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,210
Then you go on on Twitter
and everywhere else online.

36
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:17,020
And just the hate fest seems to have
been ramped up and it's not just Twitter,

37
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:20,170
I always talk about it in a Twitter
perspective, but just everything,

38
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,970
the articles of hating this one, hating
that one, all this stuff with cabin. Ah,

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,821
everyone,

40
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:29,821
these siloing of opinions has
just increased exponentially
and it all seems to

41
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:33,310
be getting worse. And that brings
me to why you're sitting here,

42
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,130
because you came on this show about
two years ago for the first time.

43
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:40,300
We had just met a little bit before that
and we started talking about fake news

44
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,650
just as it was bubbling up.

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,550
And I think some of your predictions
that you laid out or kind of right.

46
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,440
And I suspect that maybe you have a couple
answers to some of the theories that

47
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,570
you, that you dropped back then.
How was that for an intro? Well,

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,260
Einstein is, is, uh, a lot of
that matches my own experience.

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,723
And

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,080
I do think that these,
these parallel worlds, uh,

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,120
are very confusing. If you've never seen
what I've termed the vampire effect.

52
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:15,121
So a vampire is supposed to not reflect
in a looking glass when it passes by and

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,770
in, uh, in essence,

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,980
the shows that you're doing with Jordan
are a vampiric that at some level they

55
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,870
don't really exist.

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
He can produce people coming together
extraordinary impacts on people's lives.

57
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,391
He can talk about his disdain
for reactionary movements
and it doesn't change

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,930
the narrative at all. And so at some
level, there are two Jordan Peterson's,

59
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,020
there are two day Rubens.
There may even be too Eric Weinstein's,

60
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,250
but I'm a smaller fish in
this, in this pond. Um,

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,970
and one of them is a fictional character
that is drawn using details of your

62
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,400
actual life.
And the other is your actual life.

63
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,830
So one's just the media
caricature basically.

64
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,800
But it's a very interesting caricature.
In other words,

65
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,690
it's as if somebody has a
fixed strings to your hands,

66
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,920
into your feet. And so every time you
make a motion, your character has to move.

67
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,400
Um, so you have to start
doing these calculations.

68
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,680
If I say something a little bit nuanced,

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,580
I have to run the risk that it
will be taken out of context.

70
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,310
And my media character,
uh,

71
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,150
will end up saying something
that I find absolutely abhorrent.

72
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:36,151
And so the goal is to get you to consider
the consequences of your actions.

73
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,790
If I tell you that every action you
could take would be mapped to some

74
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,630
consequence that I will,
uh, right into a story,

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,930
then you start thinking, okay, it's
not a question of what I want to do.

76
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:50,980
It's a question of what do I want to
do given the fact that you're going to

77
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,560
caricature me.
So do you think that these,

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,940
even if they're self imposed constraints
have now been placed on many people

79
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,380
about how they speak and it really
had a think and how they act? Um,

80
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,580
you think it's significantly worse now
than it was even two years ago? Well,

81
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,780
because right before the election you had
all these people saying, oh, you know,

82
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,450
the polls were off because all the Trump
people that say they didn't want to say

83
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,380
what they really thought.

84
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,320
The teams like those screws have
been tightened even more. So I'm not,

85
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,770
I don't mean it just in its own
context and one lens through one Lens.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,300
Things have gotten much worse,

87
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,650
but I'm actually in a kind of a different
mood about all of this, which is,

88
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,640
um,
I would say that when I first came on,

89
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:35,641
I was quite cautious and I
said that this fake news meme,

90
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,860
if you will,
felt very inauthentic.

91
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,970
Trump had just won the
election in November of 2016.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,280
And my interpretation at the time,
uh, which hasn't changed much,

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,480
was that the people who had lost
control of the major narratives,

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,853
um,

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,520
realized that they needed to buy time
to figure out how they were going to

96
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:03,380
reestablish narrative control. And so
what they did was they created a shell,

97
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,340
in my opinion,

98
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,870
that they were going to have to fill as
they had meetings and figured out what

99
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,240
they wanted to do.
And that Shell was fake news.

100
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,980
So basically by pushing the idea of all
the Trump voters were paying attention

101
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,450
to fake news, that's what caused
them to vote for Trump. Right.

102
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,350
Well, so you have this
problem, which is that, uh,

103
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,070
when you have to call 50% of
your electorate deplorable, um,

104
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,750
because they're voting for someone
beyond the Pale. Now keep in mind,

105
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,080
uh, I think it's absolutely essential, uh,

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,180
that we unelect Trump as
soon as possible. So, uh,

107
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,130
I've called him an existential risk from
before the election and I continued to

108
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:50,750
do everything I can do
honorably in decently, uh,

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,920
to figure out how to unelect
him. You're a Bernie guy. Well,

110
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,700
I was a Bernie guy in the
sense that I voted for Bernie,

111
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,730
and I definitely saw him as the most
survivable survivable of the three major

112
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,580
options with Hillary, Bernie and, and, uh,

113
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,010
and Donald what I,

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,030
what I felt then at the time,
and I said so,

115
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:18,570
is that we should not have a
choice between three boomer, uh,

116
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,210
candidates, um, or older
candidates. We need fresh,

117
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,720
new ideas and none of these people's
experience speaks at all to me.

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,920
So it's not that I was wildly supportive
of Bernie and his economic policies,

119
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:32,450
which made very little sense to me.

120
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,720
It was that he was struggling
to be a decent human being,

121
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,790
and he was an absolute
maverick like Trump,

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,380
but he was a maverick who had
managed to survive within the system.

123
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,110
So there was a level of
trust that I had with him,

124
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,710
even though I thought he was
economically confused. What,

125
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,640
what I believe now is that we've,

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
we've been shown what got put in to
that container called fake news or media

127
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:03,431
manipulation and rather
than it being terrifying,

128
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,310
um, I, you know, I'm, I'm sort
of on the fence about this,

129
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,190
but I think I'm going to go
in the direction of funny,

130
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,770
like this report that just came
out from data and society. Yeah.

131
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,880
On the alternative influence network.

132
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:20,390
Had you ever heard of these people before
this report, by the way? I'd heard of,

133
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,960
uh, the woman who founded
it, Dana Boyd, and uh,

134
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,990
I've actually co-ran sessions with an
advisor of theirs named Hillary Mason who,

135
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,820
uh, you know, as a top
notch, a data scientist. Um,

136
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,640
so I didn't have the most negative
impression of the roster of people.

137
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,270
There's some people who I've used very
ideological, uh, over, over there,

138
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:49,070
but I didn't actually know about
data and society. It's sort of, um,

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,400
seemed to be an echo of things that
you see in the Tim O'reilly network.

140
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,160
Uh,
or

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,020
what is it?
The Berkman center at Harvard.

142
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,260
So it's connected up through
all of the major institutions.

143
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:07,800
If you look at the funders of data and
society, it's the Sloan Foundation.

144
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,830
Uh, it's The New York Times. It's,
I think it's open society. Yeah.

145
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,550
So bill and Melinda Gates. So what's
going on? Let's pause for a second.

146
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,760
People that don't know
what this thing is at our,

147
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,060
I think most people watching probably do,
but basically they issued this report,

148
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,460
the alternative influencer network,

149
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,730
and it was sort of how the reactionary
right is monetizing and extending their

150
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,560
influence throughout youtube.

151
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,490
And it was heavily based
on me as one of the people.

152
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:42,000
I think I was mentioned 77
times in this report. Uh,

153
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,020
Joe Rogan of course was included.
Jordan Peterson was included. Tim Pool,

154
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,330
who I've had on the show,
Dennis Prager.

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,720
Prager was interesting that he was
included because they included his name

156
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,660
Dennis Prager,
even though this was about youtubers,

157
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,270
but really they were going
after his channel. Prager U.

158
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,300
I think that's just an interesting
distinction that they went after the man,

159
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,134
not the channel.

160
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,190
Then there was a series of other people
on there that I have no idea who they

161
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,490
are. There were real white
nationalists, I suppose, on there,

162
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,190
from what I understand, one, uh, and,

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,090
but basically they issued this insane,
uh,

164
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,540
graph linking us all together
that looked like a cat,

165
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,460
six degrees of Kevin Bacon on steroids.
And there were, there were errors. I mean,

166
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:26,220
I know there's areas even related to me.
They didn't have me in Rogan connected.

167
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,950
I've been on the show three times. I mean,
you're going to ruin the whole thing.

168
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:32,430
Okay. Go ahead. Everything that's
wrong. Okay. Please. You know,

169
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,530
there's this fill out
to say that I know well,

170
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,220
but the thing is that at first
I thought it was like the 80s,

171
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:42,740
and I'd forgotten that we had
these channels. So, you know,

172
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,310
three's company was on there, he couldn't
believe it. The, uh, the funny thing is,

173
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,350
is that before there was no
way to fight these things.

174
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:54,351
Like if you couldn't jack into the
network of newspapers and radio stations,

175
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,060
there was no way to fight back.
So all of these things were terrifying.

176
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,800
But I noticed that I wasn't
a part of this graph.

177
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,820
And at first I had this like sense of
relief and then I thought I should just go

178
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:10,170
on Dave Ruben show and become part of
the alternative reactionary influence.

179
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,200
Now work as a Bernie voter
because, oh, this is gay poet,

180
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:19,200
pro choice pot smoking against the death
penalty on the air, right winger. Right.

181
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,550
You know what I mean?
As fellow, by the way,

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,810
just as a fellow Neo Nazi. Can I ask how
you spent Yom Kippor oh, it was lovely.

183
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,900
I broke it with bagels.
Yeah, exactly. I mean,

184
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,370
they've got Ben Shapiro on there
saying he's a white nationalist.

185
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,510
It's so completely insane. Yeah. And uh,

186
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,870
that it, it, it really
doesn't require reputation.

187
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,900
What it requires is a middle schooler
with an Iq of above 80 and a,

188
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,160
and an assignment to say what's wrong
with the methodology of this report?

189
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:54,160
Because so far as I could tell, there
is no methodology. The report, um, it's

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,120
not just that it's got errors and what's
what you explain what in a report like

191
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,220
this,
what a proper methodology would be.

192
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,460
Because from what I could understand
in the 61 pages of this thing,

193
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,570
they basically just tried to link us
together. This person talk to this person,

194
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,670
this person once interviewed this person,

195
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:13,360
this person appeared somewhere with this
person for getting the errors in those

196
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:16,420
connections. But that to me
doesn't strike me as a methodology.

197
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:21,160
It strikes me as just it.
Just human connections. People
Cross paths with people.

198
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,330
It doesn't mean you're promoting them.

199
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:25,010
It doesn't mean you're secretly
working with them or that you're in,

200
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,760
in a network. I mean, that's what
they were really going for here.

201
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,890
And I think there's a bigger reason for
that that we're going to get to in a

202
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:34,820
little bit. Well, okay, so, um, what,

203
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,230
what could they have done?
Yeah, if you were, if you
were doing it properly, right,

204
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,340
and you were trying to show,

205
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,341
here's a small group of people that have
created this network to extend these

206
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,630
horrible ideas or alternative,

207
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,370
we do have influence and there is a part
of us that is a network. So in fact,

208
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,070
that's not really where the problem,
right?

209
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,190
What you would do normally is you
would set out some list of qualities,

210
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,660
characteristics that didn't
pick names that you selectively,

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
uh, wanted to feature. And you
would say, okay, here's what we did.

212
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,420
We came up with the following rule.
Uh, somebody needs to appear, uh,

213
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,910
on at least three shows. We've done
this so that it's exhaustive. Uh,

214
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,940
and everybody who fits these criteria
is listed on this graph and look what

215
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,470
emerges. Or they at least
hold certain beliefs. Right?

216
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,950
Could you do it that way or is that
trying to say, you're asking me what,

217
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,690
just what I would think would
be a proper method. Okay.

218
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,980
So you'd stay at something
that was fairly neutral,

219
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,530
that didn't name anyone,

220
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,450
and then it would emerge that the
network was the solution to the carefully

221
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,550
stated problem.
And then you'd say,

222
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,880
isn't this interesting that when
I looked for at, at those, um,

223
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,570
criteria, it picks out Dave Ruben, uh,

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,770
and Richard Spencer,

225
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,730
and it doesn't pick out a
Ezra Klein and Sarah John.

226
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,160
Unfortunately, uh, you know, Ezra
Klein does a podcast with Sam Harris.

227
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:13,870
Sam Harris is named in the appendix, but
he's not on the graph, I think. Yeah, the,

228
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,020
you know, Noam Chomsky has
appeared on Stefan Molyneux.

229
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,200
So if you actually put all of the people
who would occur as part of a proper

230
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,520
methodology,
methodological discovery of a network,

231
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,340
there would be things
that didn't go your way.

232
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,740
And then there'd be a
section at the end that says,

233
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,890
we note that the following anomalies are
present people who are clearly opposed

234
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,220
to, you know, you might have Linda
Sarsour with a node on the network. Right.

235
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,300
And you'd say,
okay,

236
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,930
why is Linda Sarsour to two degrees
separated from Richard Spencer?

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,590
And then you'd have to say like, these are
maybe some deficiencies, may, you know,

238
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,750
here's some,
here's some ideas for further research.

239
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,370
But the point is that there
was nothing like a methodology.

240
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,050
And when you look at the
authors ideological commitments,

241
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:07,400
which she's very comfortable sharing,
they fly in the face of facts.

242
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,300
So there's no,

243
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,750
she's not trying to present herself so
far as I can tell as a dispassionate

244
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,900
researcher, she's trying to
present herself as an activist.

245
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:22,310
She has tweets from August since deleted
because she uses that tweets scrubber

246
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,240
thing or whatever it is.

247
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,430
Talking about how d Platt
performing people is the
answer to these problems that

248
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,150
she proposes. We have so, but it's
pretty clear what's going on there. Dave,

249
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:35,630
I could understand somebody saying,
look,

250
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,130
let's talk about what d platforming is
and let's talk about it in neutral terms

251
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,160
so that it,

252
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,530
it's not being used selectively to wipe
out reasonable ideas that I disagree

253
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:50,060
with [inaudible]
there's no pretense.

254
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,460
There's no semblance,
and that's why I think this is,

255
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,670
I have a different feeling about this
than I had expected, which is like,

256
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,830
bring this on.
Give me more.

257
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,030
Because if you show me who is
willing to salute this report,

258
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,441
you know,

259
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:11,360
is this going to be featured by
the Berkman Center at Harvard?

260
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,570
I went to Harvard. You couldn't
turn something like this in. Yeah,

261
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,170
into a statistics department or a math
department and be considered a researcher.

262
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,640
You'd be considered a lunatic.
And so if Harvard then salutes this thing,

263
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:28,190
that's going to tell us about
an ideological commitment.

264
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,190
Does the New York Times support this?
There's certainly funding this, um,

265
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
and they're funding the
center for data and society.

266
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,500
So we know that the Guardian liked it.
We know that vox liked it.

267
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,330
[inaudible] buzzfeed wired. I didn't see
buzzfeed actually. Yeah, buzzfeed did.

268
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:44,980
I saw New York,

269
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,680
I saw a New York Times reporters tweeting
at NBC news reporters tweeting it.

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,480
And it did it did it, did it occur in the
New York Times? Because I'm seeing no,

271
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,620
I haven't seen that.

272
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,770
I'm seeing that even the publications
who probably would like to find that this

273
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:02,570
report is reasonable.
No,

274
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,700
they gotta be very careful because
if you embrace this report,

275
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,840
you're telling,

276
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
it's so bad that you're telling people
what your standards are for intellectual

277
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,950
discourse. And that's what
makes it fascinating. So,

278
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,473
um,

279
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,070
so you want more of this
because you believe this will
hasten the destruction of

280
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,630
the monster we've been fighting.

281
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,660
Basically I want to know how I can help
them to produce more reports like this.

282
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,730
Um, you have to understand what the
purpose of a report like this is.

283
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,530
And I think somewhere,
this is my fifth appearance on your show.

284
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,160
So I'm probably getting close
to winning something. Um,

285
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,480
doesn't get more [inaudible] some
whiskey for the Q and a about that.

286
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,770
There you go. All right. The, uh,

287
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,670
I brought up this gated
institutional narrative,

288
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,590
and this is where this report
is supposed to slot in.

289
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,650
In other words,
it's not meant for individual consumption.

290
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,920
It's meant to be a sizable report.

291
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,850
And so it's got like high
production graphics and Hey,

292
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:15,210
it's a pdf PDFs or hard to make.
Like it's not a word document.

293
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,400
We go let you fix a pdf.
It's locked in.

294
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,930
So the idea is you're supposed
to be able to hold a conference,

295
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:26,610
let's say under the auspices
of the National Academy of
Sciences or Brookings or

296
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,540
Berkman Center, whatever it is.
And you're supposed to say, well,

297
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,600
earlier in the year we had
this fabulous report, uh,

298
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,110
by Rebecca Lewis at the center
for data and society and, and,

299
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,560
and they're doing some remarkable work
about how people are being radicalized.

300
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,690
And I think this is very
important and pressing.

301
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,110
And so you have a big serious conversation
in a closed conference and the

302
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:51,990
release proceedings, and then maybe
you'll allow the public in for the,

303
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,070
for the final day and you say, well, thank
you all for joining the conversation.

304
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,311
Of course,

305
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,280
none of those people in the audience
is allowed to join the conversation.

306
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,150
And that's what the gated
institutional narrative is all about.

307
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:07,440
That if you don't own a seat somewhere
on the institutional network,

308
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,300
you can't get into that conversation.
So you,

309
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,150
there's nobody who's going to be in a
position to say you realize that report,

310
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,040
uh, would not be acceptable at
any reasonable middle school,

311
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,040
uh, as a, as a data project.

312
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,090
So that's what there are some,
someone was hoping for this,

313
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,850
but I think even for these institutions,

314
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,690
they're going to be a little bit wary
because it's so nakedly ideological and so

315
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:42,060
piss poor on, on the analytics. Okay.

316
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,570
So when I saw this thing come out and
I called you and I was pissed and I was

317
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:49,080
like, Oh, here we go again. Just another
one of these things. And I was saying,

318
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,471
you know,

319
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:54,450
this is just their way of inching us
closer to d platforming and may be you

320
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,370
think, but you think that's
a secondary issue here? Well,

321
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,300
what I'm trying to say is, and by
the way, thank you for having, uh,

322
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,930
my friend, uh, Peter Teal on oh yeah,
no problem. That was great. Yeah,

323
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,720
we can talk about that too. Um, you know,

324
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:14,721
Peter has this brilliant way of analyzing
things is that you have something that

325
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:19,680
a powerful entity could
do. Uh, and then he says,

326
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,770
but the level of violence needed to
accomplish that goal is probably not

327
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,840
something that that entity could stomach.
Well,

328
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,000
I have no doubt that people
are fantasizing about doing
to all of these people

329
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,960
what was done to Alex Jones,
right? With Alex Jones,

330
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,990
there's so much over the top stuff that
a lot of people who breathe a sigh of

331
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,570
relief, thank God somebody rid
us of that terrible Alex Jones.

332
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,430
And I'm not going to get into whether
Alex Jones, good or bad. No. But putting,

333
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,460
putting lemme lemme can continuously with,

334
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,520
they could try to take the alternative
influence network that they have

335
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:01,480
identified off the air. Okay.
What would that look like?

336
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,490
You've got to somehow get rid of Joe
Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro,

337
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,080
Dave Rubin, Sam Harris, etc. Etc.

338
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,110
And we've got new kids coming up all the
time who are said to be a major voices.

339
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,600
So are you going to get rid of all of
these people? Because if you do that,

340
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,830
the only way to do that is
in such a visible way. The,

341
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,390
the way they can do with this now is,

342
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,380
is harassment through algorithms where
suddenly you don't get the number of

343
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:36,760
views that fit the pattern. You're,
you're D monetize, you can't make money.

344
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,063
Um,

345
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,890
you know that maybe there's a glitch and
you're thrown off the platform and then

346
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:45,350
they say, sorry, sorry, sorry. Et
Cetera, et cetera. So this is just like,

347
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,520
they're harassing us.
It's digital harassment.

348
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,990
So do you think that we decided w crew,

349
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:54,460
whoever they say is at this point,

350
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:58,390
do you think we kind of dropped the ball
on not offering Jones a better defense?

351
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,200
Not having anything to do
with the content. I don't,

352
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,590
I've watched maybe 10 minutes of him ever.
So put the content aside,

353
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:09,460
but that there was this digital
assassination basically where it's like,

354
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,330
all right, well if this guy can't be on
Twitter and camping on paypal and Campy,

355
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,850
I knew to Megan can eat, can he have a
phone? Is He allowed to have a phone?

356
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,730
I have running water at
his house. I mean, what,

357
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:22,630
what is the publicans be allowed to
use streets? That's a good question.

358
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,890
That is a good question. Where are
we going with it? I don't know. Um,

359
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,540
so should we have offered, not because we
were defending him or any of his ideas,

360
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,170
but should we have offered man these
platforms doing this basically in

361
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,960
conjunction with each other
cause it all happened, you know,

362
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,740
within a 24 hour period. Yeah.
I thought about this. I mean I,

363
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,040
I tweeted about it and I said something
about this is ominous having nothing to

364
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:49,000
do with Jones, that all of these
platforms, Ddi platform to him d platform,

365
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,380
Tim sudden suddenly. Yeah. Um,

366
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,540
but my belief about this is that because
the platforms occupy a very strange

367
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:02,010
position, I don't think we have good
jurisprudence around these platforms. No,

368
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,641
we clearly don't.

369
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:07,641
It bothers me that we don't realize
that the shift has been so dramatic.

370
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,810
Or these companies,
are they utilities,

371
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,090
are they natural monopolies because of
the Cordy problem of path dependence? Um,

372
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm not positive that we
have the economic theory,

373
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:23,440
the legal jurisprudence to just
refer to precedents and say, well,

374
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:28,360
this is a clear violation of the Sherman
and Clayton acts or, um, that, you know,

375
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:32,530
this is covered, uh, under New York
Times v Sullivan or who knows what.

376
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,870
I think we're going to
need a lot of new thinking.

377
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,720
And so the problem that I'm having is,

378
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,380
I don't know exactly where to fight
this and fighting it around Alex Jones

379
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,280
particularly.
But the sandy hook issue

380
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,940
strikes me as I want to
be maximally effective.

381
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,950
So I said I was very clear about taking
issue with the sudden d platforming.

382
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,640
But you know,

383
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,910
to the point where you're saying that
businesses should be allowed to do what

384
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,050
they want to do. Well is this,
is this simply a business?

385
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,510
And you know,

386
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,470
keep in mind that we have
very good information about
how our government used to

387
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:14,471
harass people who held dissident political
perspectives in the fifties sixties

388
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,920
and seventies.

389
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,170
But we've got no information about
whether or not this is being coordinated

390
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,540
through the intelligence communities.
We don't know.

391
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,310
I've talked to before about
Tim and sometimes people
call it time for technology,

392
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,350
intelligence, media. And
if you add education,

393
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,770
that is the universities and
the research infrastructure, um,

394
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,020
that conglomerate that,
that Association of major institutions,

395
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,160
we don't know what we're up against.

396
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,570
So how do we start
thinking about this issue?

397
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:46,330
I actually think that this issue
that you've just laid out here,

398
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:50,020
not just because it affects us in a
very obvious way. If I were doing this,

399
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,700
I actually believe this is probably a
far bigger issue than anything going on

400
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,900
with Cavanagh right now.

401
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,410
Or certainly the other ridiculous
political machinations are half this stuff

402
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:04,411
going on in terms this way that we conduct
and transfer information and who in a

403
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,940
sense of who you can get it and,
and yeah.

404
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,300
Well sensemaking comes on the back of our
ability to communicate with each other.

405
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,330
And I think this is probably the
biggest issue out there. And by the way,

406
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:14,590
I'm glad you just called me out on it,

407
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:18,520
but this is where I'm running my
classical liberal part that veers into

408
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:21,730
libertarianism is starting where the
rubber's meeting the road and I'm going,

409
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,400
maybe there isn't, I don't want the
government to come in, you know,

410
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:26,910
that's against everything I stand for.
It's not against every is everything

411
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,421
you stand for.

412
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:32,421
Look at one of my goals is to get you
off of the Canon hardcore libertarianism.

413
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,760
I think competition is still the answer,

414
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:40,110
but I do think we agreed that where
competition works is the answer.

415
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,890
But if you are truly free marketeer,

416
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,880
you should know about market failure.
Yeah.

417
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,310
And you should not pretend that markets
can solve all problems because you will

418
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:53,370
have a world that is absolutely
red of tooth and claw. Well,

419
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,530
I think we're sort of heading
there with this. I understand that.

420
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,960
I can't create a youtube, but
I'm trying to say that, you know,

421
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,580
all I'm asking is that you reconsider
your position because of the complexities

422
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:06,960
about, you know, path dependent monopoly,
which we refer to sometimes as Courtney,

423
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,380
um, after the typewriter, uh,

424
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,070
may have a funny structure and it's not
clear that we should break it up or not

425
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,630
break it up or regulated or not regulated.

426
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,210
These are open questions
and I'm absolutely,

427
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,730
I agree with you as somebody
who's much more in a,

428
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,710
in a classic progressive position.
Uh,

429
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,220
although that has nothing
to do with what people,

430
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,660
client claim is progressivism
now that where the market works,

431
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:35,430
you let the market work. Yeah. Right.

432
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,660
But it's not clear that the market is
meant to work here because there's too

433
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:44,550
many asymmetries of information. I
mean, Google so many of our secrets.

434
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:44,970
Yeah.

435
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,170
And so what happens when they've got a
problem and they can also read all your

436
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:53,980
email and then you're thinking like,
okay, well that's a level of power.

437
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:58,030
That's not like a company. You know,
maybe somebody can invent some,

438
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:01,420
some sort of email where the
company can't read your email,

439
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:05,230
but then the question is,
are they responsible for
regulating, right Zach? Well,

440
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:05,890
okay,

441
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,250
but that's exactly what the data and
society people are supposed to be doing.

442
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,830
Or the, uh, the Berkman
Center. The problem is,

443
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:16,831
is that we have a situation in
which it's as if the grownups,

444
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,510
whoever they are held a conference,

445
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,980
which we were not invited to and they
made a whole bunch of findings, you know,

446
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:27,580
that, that these people are extreme. These
people are good if you think about it.

447
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:30,970
And in terms of like the
hulk, the hulk, you know,

448
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:34,300
often talks in sentences that don't
have one part of speech, you know,

449
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:39,130
so the Harvard good, send it strong. Yeah.

450
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,173
Um,

451
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,960
well somehow they have an idea that
Harvard has our best interests in mind.

452
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,700
That,
uh,

453
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,730
more or less the Democratic Party is
that which has to defeat Trump and the

454
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,100
progressive agenda.

455
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,240
And I put huge scare quotes around
progressive here because it's anything but

456
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,000
yeah. Um, those forces,

457
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:08,500
the grownups as they see themselves
need to take this thing back.

458
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,540
And my point to them is,

459
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,800
are you aware of who you have in
this alternative influence network?

460
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,153
Because

461
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,710
I think you're sadly mistaken if you
don't imagine that the fire power outside

462
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:26,070
of the institutional network,

463
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,100
intellectual firepower is as great or
greater than the intellectual firepower

464
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,660
inside of the institutions,

465
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:38,661
which are constantly requiring
people to say absolutely outrageous,

466
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,340
ridiculous,
false things.

467
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,790
And so good people tend to eventually
get so fed up that they can't stay inside

468
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,210
of the institutions and the magic
of this alternative network.

469
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,750
Um, and I, and I mean that
in the good sense. Yeah. Uh,

470
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,920
is that it's based around individuals.

471
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,040
The main war is not left
versus right at the moment.

472
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,420
[inaudible] it's institutions versus
things that are much closer to being

473
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,170
individuals.
So the Ruben report isn't just you,

474
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,630
but it's a team that is relatively small,

475
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,370
and these relatively small teams don't
take on these terrible characteristics of

476
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:21,720
the large institutions. And so the reason
that we're able to be so effective,

477
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,610
in my opinion, is that all of
the institutions are fighting.

478
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,360
MMM.
[inaudible]

479
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,740
certain problems having to do with,
we don't have a,

480
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,790
a really dependable source of growth.
We don't have a great national story.

481
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,100
They're all sputtering.
They're all struggling.

482
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,130
And the individuals are where
the vitality and the energy is.

483
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,980
So if Jordan Peterson has given us a
biblical lecture on this right now,

484
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:47,170
I think he'd be talking
about David Verse Goliath.

485
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:50,530
And in this case it might be Dave
verse Google, but, but right. I mean,

486
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,740
that's the idea that the small operation,
the individual,

487
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,110
or it can be just a
small set of individuals.

488
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,700
We have a lot of leverage because
we don't have this cumbersome,

489
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,910
cumbersome machine around
us. And we don't, you know,

490
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,120
I have to answer to myself and a couple
of other people that I hold in close

491
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:11,710
confidence, but that's it. And that,
that's nimble and that's great.

492
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,400
Yeah. So that's powerful. That's powerful
even though it feels kind of scary.

493
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,720
But what are you writing on your right?
Great people.

494
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:23,350
I think you're riding on,
um,

495
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,640
internals pipes stories. Oh, you
meant you meant literally, right.

496
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:32,140
We are still using their stuff.
We're still using their stuff.

497
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,090
And if you take this idea, you see the
d platforming movement is quite clever.

498
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,753
MMM.

499
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,280
Because free speech is
enshrined in the constitution,

500
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,430
so they can't really go around,

501
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,783
uh,

502
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,360
you know, it's like somebody saying
you're entitled to play Your Guitar,

503
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,350
Your Electric Guitar,

504
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,130
but we have the right to cut off your
power while you can barely hear an

505
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:59,810
electric guitar, uh, without an amp.
Right. And so the platforming is, they,

506
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:03,680
it's a fail over into the next level
of where can we take this fight.

507
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,480
And I think it's very
important that people read a,

508
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,870
I think it's a transcript of a speech
by the founder of data and society

509
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,380
institute or Center, um, Dana Boyd,

510
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,210
where she talks about two important
concepts. One of, one of, in a speech,

511
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:25,211
one of which is data voids in a data
void is some place where people want to

512
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:31,330
search for something, but there's
not a lot of information around.

513
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,463
And

514
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,000
that's fascinating because

515
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,900
that's a lot of how the mainstream
institutions control us.

516
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,280
So I have a very clean example of this.

517
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,820
The idea that you can be a immigration
restrictionist and a clear xenophile like

518
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,910
everything throughout your life speaks
to your interest in foreign cultures,

519
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,650
your openness to other people.
But you happen to be a restrictions.

520
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,670
There is a complete void.

521
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:06,671
If you go search xenophile restrictionist
you'll probably find me at the top

522
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:11,600
because what may be a majority position
in the United States is acknowledged

523
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,470
nowhere. Meaning that you might
be into other cultures do,

524
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:19,640
you might even be married to an Indian
woman. You might love all sorts of things,

525
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:22,100
speak a kajillion languages.
Every time I get in a car with you,

526
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,360
you're speaking in another language,

527
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,320
you might care about all these other
cultures for a million other reasons,

528
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,310
but it doesn't mean you want open borders,
which is what most people think.

529
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,140
I think. Well, it's very confusing.
The Di, uh, an analogy would be, um,

530
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,640
do you wish to adopt, uh, every
person have over for dinner.

531
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,700
The idea of being open to dinner guests
and expecting that as much as you love

532
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,110
them,
they will probably leave,

533
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:52,280
if not after dinner that after a few
days or a few weeks you kicked me out.

534
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:56,990
But I was drunk. I did, I'd be
Runco. Alright. Focus. Sorry.

535
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,220
So we have a situation in
which these data voids, um,

536
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,630
are real and they're created
by the unwillingness to report.

537
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,870
Now this is what's radicalizing people.
So that's what,

538
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,860
that was one of the forest types of fake
news you originally discussed, right?

539
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,080
Avoidance about an important
topic is actually a title.

540
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
Let's see if I can remember the, yeah,
let's see if he can do it. All right.

541
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,520
So there was algorithmic, there
was institutional, I mean,

542
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:26,521
give me an example of each one as your
algorithmic fake news has to do with the,

543
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,810
there's something important, but you
can't find it via via search and it's,

544
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,590
it's down ranked. So that a, it's,

545
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,270
it's effectively suppressed and
something else is accentuated. Um,

546
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,620
there was institutional where
any institution that wants, um,

547
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,990
can, uh, broadcast information and
people treat it as if it's news. Um,

548
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,820
but individuals can not do this.

549
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,320
Then there was narrative fake news where
the New York Times is the principle

550
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,690
offender here,
which they figure out the narrative,

551
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,250
the narrative arc ahead of time.

552
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,330
And we don't know why they would do that
because the, the facts haven't come in,

553
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:06,210
but they have an idea of how the facts
should be organized as they come in.

554
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,200
And then there's just false news. Yeah.
So these, but wasn't one of them. Oh,

555
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,610
so the first one is what you're saying
[inaudible] is the closest Scott it,

556
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,040
but sometimes that occurs just naturally.
Like what if nobody thought, why aren't,

557
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,390
why don't we have articles on
xenophile file? Restrictionist oh,

558
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,630
we just forgot.

559
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,640
We forgot about what may be a majority
position in the United States. Um,

560
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,361
but it's like,

561
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:35,190
it's so large that it's pretending that
you can't find an aircraft carrier in a,

562
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,770
in a,
in a community harbor.

563
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,600
So that's what makes people
crazy. So the, the, the,

564
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:46,410
the big data voids if you will,
are people who believe that, um,

565
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,440
let's say that a trade is generally good,

566
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:57,650
but that it isn't a rising tide that
raises all ships and that you have to do

567
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,490
work around it to make sure you don't
decimate communities and states, you know,

568
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,060
uh, there was very little,
um, real work done on what,

569
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:11,190
what the effects of trade would be.
Uh, immigration we just mentioned.

570
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,430
And then there's the, the, I believe that
there is a linkage between terror, uh,

571
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,510
and Islam,
but I'm,

572
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,260
I would think is Llama fillic because
I'm fascinated by the culture,

573
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:25,890
religion and uh, find it
very easy to, to, you know,

574
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,820
socialize in that portion of the world
because it's very similar to many of the

575
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:32,130
values that I hold.
We just had a great night with your,

576
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,230
what best friend from college who
happens to be Muslim damn. Well,

577
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:37,440
it's like who even noticed it doesn't,
right.

578
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,140
So the,
by creating these voice saying,

579
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,010
don't mention the following obvious fact,
because if you do,

580
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,280
we have an interpretation.
If you disagree with us on policy,

581
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,970
we can infer that you're a bad person,
a moral failing,

582
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,880
we'll have to be fixed to
your name in perpetuity.

583
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,530
That thing is making people
absolutely hate these institutions.

584
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,480
And my goal and trying to
unelect Donald Trump is to say,

585
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,770
there is no reason that
Donald Trump should be running
the table by monopolizing

586
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,390
these data voids.
Yes,

587
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,510
you can believe that there is a link
between terror and Islam and not be

588
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,950
Islamophobic.
Yes,

589
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:21,090
you can believe that we have a problem
with the way in which we negotiate trade

590
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:24,090
agreements and you can still want to be
open to the world and not protectionists

591
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,060
that heart. Yes, you can be uh, uh,

592
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,930
a restrictionist and the xenophile
simultaneously though the,

593
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:35,760
those are my big three examples of what
makes people hate the institutions.

594
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,120
And in some sense I've been thinking
that Donald Trump is like a company

595
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,970
fragging it senior offers,

596
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,210
like we don't want to be led by people
who tell us that we're deplorable because

597
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,940
if you pee on our leg and tell
us it's raining, we say, no,

598
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,730
you're peeing on my
leg. Please stop. Right?

599
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,610
And those people who want to say,
look,

600
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:04,530
we are the natural guardians of America.
We know who needs to be the platform.

601
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,700
We know, um, who, who shouldn't
have access to paypal.

602
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,200
We should be able to write our terms of
service in such a way that pure virtue

603
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,860
is boosted and not niceness
is pushed down. By the way,

604
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,870
pure virtue is everybody. I
like nobody. [inaudible] right,
right, right. Okay. Well,

605
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,820
none of us want to be governed by this.

606
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,360
Nobody who loves liberty and loves
this particular country and loves the

607
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,520
enlightenment,
wants to be governed by this.

608
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,510
And so this is an unwanted institutional
class and we're trying to throw them

609
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:38,490
off. What happened was it was so uniform
throughout the institutions that they

610
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,710
couldn't field candidates

611
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,770
that spoke to this fed upness.
I mean we were just fed up who are,

612
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,580
who are these baby boomers who are
entitled to tell us how to think.

613
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,050
And I'm saying, this is somebody who
comes, you know, from, from the left.

614
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,860
It shouldn't be a left,
right. Distinction. Yeah.

615
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,910
More or less people who have interesting
perspectives as individuals are looking

616
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,070
at this and say, we know you're
trying to get us off the platforms.

617
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:11,980
We know your engineers hate us,
or are you reading our dms?

618
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,110
Are you going through our emails?
What are you doing over there?

619
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,950
And that's where this the Alex Jones
incident to changes in the terms of

620
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:24,120
service.

621
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,540
So now like you can be thrown off of a
platform even if you conduct yourself

622
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,400
properly on platform because of
you're off platform behavior. Yeah.

623
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,240
A lot of people probably don't know
about that. You are not making that out.

624
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:38,020
But this is, this is what happened when
I came on your show and I said, um,

625
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,590
I said the fake news story is inauthentic.

626
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,070
What I was doing was I was
putting a marker and I was saying,

627
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,750
watch this space because what they're
going to do is they're going to fill it

628
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:53,770
with some kind of machinery. And so
there's been a lot of changes. One,

629
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,220
they're all of these reporting mechanisms.
Uh,

630
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:01,240
you've got loud groups who objects
to things that you put them on a, a,

631
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,880
a truth in safety council.

632
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,770
And then the idea is that all of
the squeaky wheels, uh, who are,

633
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,920
who are upset with things,

634
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,920
if you give them free pizza and you
give them a place at the table, uh,

635
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,970
they may shut up,

636
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:17,260
but they're also doing this free work
with probably often doesn't need to be

637
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:19,750
done. I'm not saying that there
isn't abuse on these systems,

638
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,880
but you want the abuse to be even
handed. If you have a Hashtag, uh,

639
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,700
like as your client brought
up, uh, kill all men.

640
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,360
Why is kill all men? Did you
read this article? I'm not,

641
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,970
I'm not a huge fan of his, frankly. That's
actually in the last couple of days.

642
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:40,930
I find him quite personable. He's been
very nice. Uh, I'm putting him on a list.

643
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,030
He's had dinner at your house.
I've had dinner at your butt,

644
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,150
but he's also been set on a, but
he's also been savage, so I'm better,

645
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,710
I'm trying to understand the perspective.
Yeah.

646
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,780
So I'm trying to figure out is
the Nice intelligent guy, uh,

647
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,910
who came over for Shabbat dinner.
Uh,

648
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,900
the same guy as the guy who's
rationalizing kill all men.

649
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,340
I didn't actually mind his rationalization
of kill Altman. What he said is,

650
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,970
is that within a small
group of feminists Twitter,

651
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,150
which I don't think really exist,
people talk like that,

652
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,130
but since it's an open platform,
it doesn't have any walls around.

653
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,000
He said that inside that community,

654
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,030
that phrase meant it would be nice if
the world were slightly better for women.

655
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,920
So take that,
take him at his word.

656
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,260
You would imagine that that
same community, if it was
epistemically consistent,

657
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,120
would also believe,
hey,

658
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:34,510
we can't police microaggressions because
we have to figure out whether those

659
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,520
things are actually not
as toxic as they sound,

660
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,430
but that this is what's fascinating is
we think that the same community that

661
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,790
should object to anything like,
you know,

662
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,180
referring to mankind as bigotry.
Yeah.

663
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,260
That community should also be allowed
to use the Hashtag kill all men.

664
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,540
Now,
that doesn't make any sense.

665
00:40:55,541 --> 00:41:00,541
I'm very focused on are you
granting yourself a privilege
that you will grant to

666
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,310
no one else, because if you recall,
but created the reformation, uh,

667
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,260
it was the selling of indulgences.

668
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,440
And I believe that what the left thinks
it has is an indulgence system that is

669
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,530
Sara Jong,

670
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,280
when promoted to the editorial board of
the New York Times should be granted an

671
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:22,660
indulgence because she's actually a
great person and she engaged in some bad

672
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,720
twittery and we should be, uh,
there should be compassion.

673
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,600
There should be forgiveness. There
should not be a black mark on the record.

674
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,030
So basically she believes
in all the right things,

675
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:34,150
according to the New York Times, you can
say whatever she about white journal,

676
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,310
but she believes in prove, you know,
she's a progressive and blah, blah, blah.

677
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,570
But this other guy who once said
something which was ambiguous,

678
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,270
should be be platform

679
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,060
for life. Yeah. And

680
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,630
I don't think without profanity,
uh, I don't think I have any way of,

681
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,580
of communicating how hateful
that is. How dare you. Literally,

682
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:02,581
how dare you suggest that some community
is entitled to own both of these

683
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:04,330
things.

684
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:07,660
Ultimate forgiveness for their members
and the right to police everyone else.

685
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,070
And that's what we have to fight.

686
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,260
So what do you make of what I would
argue is the lack of clear thinking on

687
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:16,230
behalf of these people. I don't want to
make it about as her, it doesn't matter,

688
00:42:16,231 --> 00:42:20,310
but like look, a report like this comes
out. And if we were to Parse, I honestly,

689
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:22,640
I didn't know at least 10 of the people,
I'd never even heard of them.

690
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,560
A whole bunch of them I've had muted
on Twitter because they don't like me.

691
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,950
So it's like the idea that we were
all connected is, is just silly.

692
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,030
But if they had done a report just on
true white nationalists, right. You know,

693
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,940
they actually probably could
have got some of us on our side,

694
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:38,490
not maybe not to have them d
platform because that's not where,

695
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,840
where I would want to go with it,

696
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,200
but that there's this group of
people doing some really bad stuff.

697
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,120
Here's what it is. But they do a
sloppy version out in out racists.

698
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,030
There's an oppression they need.
They need a certain amount. Look,

699
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,430
there is still structural
oppression in the world.

700
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,420
I don't want to have to argue that I can,
I can make a convincing case.

701
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,630
So I do believe that there is
structural oppression in our society.

702
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,910
The problem is disrupted.
What do you mean by structural?

703
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,930
Cause this will be a big hangup point
for a lot of people. Well that you know,

704
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:10,860
you, you don't have anything that
is explicitly against one race,

705
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,190
but when you have a decision about where
road has to be placed in the level of

706
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,240
disruption or how

707
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,870
schools are paid from property
taxes, uh, that are local,

708
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,010
um,
you have self perpetuating system

709
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,000
is where the, the rich become
more advantaged in the poor,

710
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:33,410
become more disadvantaged over time. Um,
that wasn't necessarily racial though.

711
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,800
That was rich versus poor.
Well,

712
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,220
but the point is that what if
that correlates and you know,

713
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,800
there might be rich versus
poor. There might, it might

714
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,060
be male versus female.

715
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,140
I don't think it's the case that
we've gotten rid of all oppression.

716
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,070
And I just think that that would
be silly to suggest and it's not,

717
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,250
it's important that we not lose sight
that because our progressive's at the

718
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,730
moment are terrible that
we couldn't steal man.

719
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:58,820
That point if that was in our
interest in my intention is to do so.

720
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,300
That said there isn't enough oppression
to explain all of the phenomena that

721
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:06,134
we're seeing.

722
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,310
So I go to the very simple example
of top hundred chess players.

723
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,510
One of them is female.

724
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,630
Now that cannot be in my estimation,

725
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,850
likely caused by the law. Is oppression
encoded into the rules of chess?

726
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:27,320
Is it because you know chess is is sort
of cryptically male and that if we,

727
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:29,950
if we did it with Barbie dolls or or,
or,

728
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,330
or some other body positive female thing,

729
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:36,300
that girls would suddenly
become 50 50 I don't know.

730
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,030
I think it's unlikely to imagine that.

731
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,470
I don't think that it would have to be
one versus 99 and maybe it's 20 versus 80

732
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,180
or 40 versus 60 who knows?

733
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,690
But it's unlikely that it's
100% structural oppression.

734
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,050
Like one of my jokes is and
depression and online anonymous chest.

735
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,410
Yeah.
Cause it's just like it's all day.

736
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,110
Well,
so you have a situation where my,

737
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,130
my team guessed wrong. We thought
if we could get rid of red lining,

738
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:06,200
if we could get rid of literacy tests,

739
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:10,040
if we could get rid of all of the things
that were holding people back that were

740
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,720
just nakedly ridiculous,

741
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,200
that we would have this
much more even society.

742
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,110
And while there's still
more work to be done,

743
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,500
I would say that
preliminary indications are,

744
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,000
is that that solves some of the problem.

745
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,850
But it didn't solve as much of
the problem as we were hoping.

746
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,210
So now you have two
very difficult choices.

747
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,420
Do you decide that really the problem is,

748
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:35,730
is that the oppression is super
cryptic and it's much, you know, it's,

749
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,660
it's much worse than anyone imagines.

750
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,960
But that's why you're policing
microaggressions or do you decide, Huh,

751
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,520
I wonder if there are other factors.

752
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,580
And that's kind of disturbing and I'm
scared to even consider that question.

753
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,360
And that's,

754
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,360
that's the choice that the progressives
and the lefties have have faced.

755
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,720
Can I take it to a slightly
less heady place perhaps,
which is, I get you on that,

756
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:01,230
on the intellectual level,
but I think there's just a lazy,

757
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,780
it's just lazy thinking for young people.

758
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:06,660
It's just lazy to think the
system's rigged against you.

759
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,530
It's just lazy to think they're coming
after you because of your gender or your

760
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,900
sexuality or your color or,
well,

761
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:15,780
most of the aiming after you because of
your age. But it's, but it's empowering.

762
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:16,111
In other words,

763
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,860
it's empowering to these people to
think the whole systems against me,

764
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,740
I'm going to destroy it.
So it's like,

765
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:25,740
it just an easy answer as opposed to
clean up your room and get your shit

766
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,530
together. Yeah. When we had that,

767
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,010
by the way, it was tremendous
fun having Jordan and Ben, uh,

768
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,050
on the show did that. Um, but I
pushed back on that, which is no,

769
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,640
there really is an issue, particularly
intergenerationally a lot of these people,

770
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:49,130
if I take the standard child
rearing house where somebody,

771
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:50,821
you know,

772
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:55,821
at age 26 wants to propose to
somebody at age 24 and say,

773
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:56,934
Hey, I, you know,

774
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,710
I've got enough means to have a house
and we can have a few kids and you can

775
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,680
take off work for for a few years to,

776
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,790
to raise them with kids
with the most demanding.

777
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,210
That's very hard to do at the moment.

778
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,420
The labor market needs
to get much tighter.

779
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,340
We need to have employers writhing in
pain before that becomes possible again,

780
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,030
and I support making the labor market
tighter in order to redistribute some of

781
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,980
the wealth using market
mechanisms to people who need

782
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,060
to start their lives and
to become homeowners and to
have a stake in the system.

783
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,350
And we made a huge mistake in my opinion,

784
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:42,880
not understanding that when it's so
difficult to start a life in your 20s that

785
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:43,870
feels adult,

786
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,730
that those people are now pissed as hell.

787
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,940
And rightfully so because we're not
really hearing them. So I think that the,

788
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
the one that is most important to
me is that we missed the boat on

789
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,380
intergenerational oppression.
I think that one really feels salient.

790
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,390
Now. There are other things having
to do with, with race and gender,

791
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,290
um, which we have to get to.
And I'm not gonna pretend that,

792
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,900
I don't think that there are problems
in those areas. They're very, very,

793
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,060
very clearly are, but there isn't
enough problem at the moment.

794
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:22,721
I mean,

795
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:27,721
we have so many opportunities with a
world crying out for diversity that,

796
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,260
um, you know, we have,

797
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:36,330
we have to be looking how much of this
is solvable by going after oppression and

798
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:38,380
how much are we having to invent,

799
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,890
invent oppressions in order to avoid
looking at more disturbing questions.

800
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,690
And I think that what's
going on is that the,

801
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,930
our betters in the institutional
world have already decided that anyone

802
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:56,800
searching for explanations that
are not oppression based, uh,

803
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,160
and things that can't be cured
with diversity is a bad person.

804
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,890
And that's what's so disturbing.

805
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,310
Let me ask you something just on a kind
of personal note that we've talked a

806
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:09,990
little bit about privately that as a
guy that came from the institutions that

807
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,810
has plenty of friends and
colleagues in the institutions,

808
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:15,540
I mean you talk about all this
stuff and it in a certain way,

809
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,550
there's a level of kind of kissing that
goodbye, right? I mean at some level by,

810
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:23,520
by being here and calling
these things out constantly.

811
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,970
And I liken that to I forward you emails
probably every day now from people from

812
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:32,370
a zillion walks of life. I mean, you know,

813
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,400
high school teachers to choreographers
to lighting people to all scared,

814
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,730
scared of the exact same
thing that you're describing.

815
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:46,970
They are seeing this photo diversity come
down on them and certain people now by

816
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,450
their gender,
usually male by their skin color,

817
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:55,860
usually white and all of these other
things are realizing their careers or

818
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:58,920
coming to an end that they are afraid
that their future no longer works,

819
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:01,950
the things that they believed
in no longer work. Um,

820
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,140
so first I just want to know
just you personally like it,

821
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,800
that is a real shift for you.
It has to be right.

822
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:10,290
I don't even know if you want to do
this publicly, but I'm, no, I know.

823
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,140
Let me see if I,
if I even

824
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,060
understand that we are,

825
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,740
let's talk about what it is that we
learn when we do shows and we meet people

826
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,720
afterwards. Here's what we know that
nobody else in my opinion knows.

827
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,200
We know that people are terrified.
Yeah.

828
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,720
The people who are coming to these shows
are saying, thank you for speaking out.

829
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:31,850
I'm almost ready to say something at work,

830
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,190
but I'm fear that I'll lose
my job and my livelihood.

831
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,300
And I've got two kids at home.

832
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,070
And by the way, it's often things
like, I believe in low taxes. It's not,

833
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,110
you know what I mean? With God, it's,

834
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,690
it's like it's nothing I
believe in free speech. Yeah.

835
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,950
I think maybe James Damore
was, was railroaded. Oh my God.

836
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,040
But he's James Damore. He's
that. He's that tech Bro.

837
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,370
That's bro on the end of anything.

838
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,870
But also the idea that group,
the bro report, it's like, okay,

839
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,160
now we don't have to take it seriously.

840
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,600
But also him as tech bro in praying
that he's like this frat boy, like,

841
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:10,290
like cocky as well. This is
the most do mujer word. Yeah,

842
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,640
this is the most, no, he's like, yeah,

843
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,750
I think he's openly on the spectrum,
right? He, he's a, he's a total,

844
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,470
he's the shyest. I mean really in all
the shows I've done, I don't have any,

845
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,220
how many hundreds of interviews I've done.

846
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,730
He's the only guests that I felt I needed
to spend probably a half hour in the

847
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:28,370
green room just chatting with them
to get comfortable enough to talk.

848
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:31,670
This was not a bro who wants
to get in there and grow it up.

849
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,270
But this is the fun part. Yeah. Like I
think Bernie Bros were totally, you know,

850
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,120
it was basically an invention

851
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,400
that institutional voice is dying because
it's so funny and I think that this,

852
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,230
cause it's so ludicrous at this point.
The thing is,

853
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:53,800
you and I happen to have really good
information about how many people are

854
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:54,634
scared.

855
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,710
And we also know that the reason that
they're scared is that a tiny number of

856
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:04,600
people who hold these very
extreme positions have found
their way into the high

857
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:08,890
leverage seats. If you're sitting on the
editorial board of the New York Times,

858
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,400
that's a high leverage cedar. If you're
a columnist, that's a high leverage seat,

859
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,760
or if you're in the admissions office or
if you're in human resources or if you

860
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:22,870
are, you know, uh, a judge or a lawmaker.

861
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:27,871
And so people are seeking out these high
leverage positions if they hold very

862
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:34,900
radical perspectives, which has to
do with alternative logic. I mean,

863
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,231
I think,

864
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:40,231
I want to say very clearly that the
real reason that I'm so dead set against

865
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:45,421
this is that people can't be trusted with
this level of epistemic inconsistency.

866
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,520
And I've referred to this as
the alternative logic network,

867
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,610
and I just want to say one or two things
from a mathematician's perspective.

868
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:57,610
You asked me like how I see this
from a, from a math, but yeah,

869
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,960
give me a little math for God's sake.

870
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:04,350
There's a principle called the principle
of explosion and it says roughly that

871
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:09,760
from a contradiction
you can deduce anything,

872
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,970
smuggle one contradiction
through airport security.

873
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,890
And on the other side you can come
up with anything. Two equals seven,

874
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:20,500
two equals a chicken. Um, you know,

875
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,140
the United States doesn't exist.

876
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,590
And so this is where scientists get
very persnickety about somebody saying,

877
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:34,800
oh, come on, just let us tweak what we
say about biology a little bit. It's like,

878
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:39,750
no, there will be no tweaking of logic
itself. We are not going to allow you,

879
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:44,751
if we can avoid to smuggle one structural
contradiction in because once you get

880
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:51,000
one in, it's all over. This is, this
has to do with the unity of nature.

881
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,590
I don't want biology to give me many
of the results that it gives me.

882
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,120
Tough biology is what it is.
I don't have the right to say,

883
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,180
uh, you know, let's say
microcephaly. Small heads, uh,

884
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,040
has no effect on intelligence or that
people with down syndrome are just as

885
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:12,090
capable as anybody else because
it's not true. I want it to be true,

886
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,600
but my wanting it to be true
doesn't have that effect.

887
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:18,570
And if I start making those adulterations,

888
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,360
then the whole thing falls apart.

889
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:25,650
So this is sort of where you and your
brother Brett and, and your sister in law,

890
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:28,110
Heather and many other pejorative and a
bunch of other people have been saying

891
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:31,830
that that's the fear that if the
gender studies stuff and all of this

892
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,640
progressive, then you ask
Jack gets into science. We,

893
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:39,840
we literally blow apart all the progress,
all the real progress.

894
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:40,620
We'll never make sense.

895
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,490
You can actually make progress on the
male female stuff if you're pretending

896
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:48,480
that males and females or
both simultaneously totally
different and totally the

897
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:49,410
same. Yeah. Right?

898
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,430
And you have to pretend both in order
to get this new version of progressivism

899
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:57,060
to work. So you're literally
smuggling in a contradiction.

900
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,340
So if you say, look, we really
need a diverse workplace, um,

901
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,660
let's say between men and women.

902
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,730
And we noticed that in this particular
occupation, it's 80, 20, um,

903
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:13,230
and that has to do only with oppression
because otherwise it would be 50, 50.

904
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,930
Well,
what you've just done is you've said,

905
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,440
we know that there's no cognitive
difference between males and females, um,

906
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,150
because we've just assigned all of
the difference to oppression, right?

907
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:29,610
Because it would be exactly equal. But
if you allow males and females to, to,

908
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:31,740
um,
to coexist,

909
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,780
you're going to get this huge bonanza
because now you're going to have

910
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:35,970
intellectual diversity.
Now there,

911
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:39,720
there's actually something very clever
and very important to say that has to do

912
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:41,590
with the kind of fishers,
uh,

913
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:46,230
notion of equivalence of males and
females in terms of fitness strategies.

914
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,570
Um,
so there is a kind of equivalent,

915
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,010
but when you destroy the true
biological understanding of the,

916
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:57,960
of why males and females have the same
expected return is fitness strategies in

917
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,270
favor of this dime store nonsense,

918
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,550
you actually destroy the
ability to correct for
imbalances. And so we're, we're,

919
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,950
and Heather and I come down,
um,

920
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,940
is that we say in your
rush to build utopia,

921
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:19,080
you're going to destroy everything
that we've done and you can't take the

922
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:21,480
shortcut.
That's really what's important.

923
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,100
The intellectually these

924
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,130
shortcuts will eventually
cause the system to collapse.

925
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:32,230
And so it's not that were not sympathetic
with the idea that we'd love to see

926
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:35,380
more, more female programmers,
but let's figure out,

927
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:37,330
and this is actually what
Dimauro was focused on.

928
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,580
Like what changes can we make in order to,
you know,

929
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:46,560
respect the biology and make this work?
And so I, I, I think that that's what's,

930
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:51,970
what's so confusing is that
this push to assign so much,

931
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,073
um,

932
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:59,070
to what is essentially an intellectual
universe of pure contradiction is what's

933
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:03,190
offending many people who
consider themselves progressives,

934
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,490
which is like w I think
absolutely we're in the row,

935
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,050
we progressive's are in the right.
But you have to do it honestly.

936
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:15,740
You can't just cheat and pretend
things that you wished to be true and,

937
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:18,870
and close your eyes and put your
fingers in your ears and say, ah,

938
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,740
I'm not going to listen
to data and analysis.

939
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:26,160
But do you see any people on the left
besides you guys trying to fix this thing?

940
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,470
Well, this, yes, but, but
they're scared. You see,

941
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:36,310
this is what's so terrifying about
these current fake progressive's is,

942
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:39,040
is that they're just scary
people. They, they, they say, oh,

943
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:42,370
we need more empathy and then
what are they interested in?

944
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,270
Are they interested in the notion
of progress or justice? Well,

945
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,600
justice is all about
sticking it to somebody.

946
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,390
Like you have something that
belongs to this other person,

947
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,550
but progress is just like, let's make
things better. And hopefully, um,

948
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:01,240
you know, where there is injustice,
we can, we can identify a bad guy,

949
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:05,320
but where there is no injustice
and it's just somebody out of luck.

950
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:08,470
You're just trying to
try to raise people up.

951
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,560
I want to say one other thing that I
realized I forgot to say somewhere else.

952
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,423
Yeah.

953
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,670
Dana Boyd brought up a very interesting
issue which she called strategic silence

954
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,510
and the idea which isn't a bad one and
initially is that if somebody should not

955
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,750
have their voice amplified,

956
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,320
let's imagine that you have a manifesto
and you decide that you're going to kill

957
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,450
30 people.
Um,

958
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,780
and in the desire to figure out what the
motivation is that you're going to have

959
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,090
your manifesto broadcast
all over the world.

960
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,210
So the UNI bomber didn't kill
30, but he killed a bunch, uh,

961
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,500
killed a few people and names and people
and his manifesto was read widely.

962
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,680
So strategic silence is the idea that
reporters should not be played or used and

963
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,980
they should be silent
about certain things.

964
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:05,790
I think that what she did not realize is
that this much strategic silence cannot

965
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,540
function in an intelligent,
open society.

966
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:19,110
People are simply to mute in the press
about all sorts of things that the rest

967
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:21,770
of us have a very legitimate
interest in knowing.

968
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,500
And if you're going to
be strategically silent,

969
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:29,501
you should be sharing the idea that the
policy of this paper is that it doesn't

970
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,520
look at motive on individual instances
unless the constitutes a pattern.

971
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,950
But like if you take terrorists killings
when somebody reports, you know,

972
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,900
10 people were killed today and the
attacker said something religious in a

973
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:48,740
foreign language at the end,
you're not helping things.

974
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:54,190
You're creating a belief that there is
some kind of conspiracy and we don't know

975
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:58,580
what that's about. Is it an honest desire
to protect our vulnerable communities,

976
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:02,120
in which case many of us would be
supportive or is it because the Kingdom of

977
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:03,550
Saudi Arabia,
uh,

978
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,180
has some relationship with our government
that may be strategic that we will

979
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:12,140
want more information about? Is that, is
that a special favor to a foreign power?

980
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,320
I don't know what that is,

981
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,600
but what I do know is that if people are
dying and that there's a motive that's

982
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,580
linking multiple killings,
for example,

983
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,470
you can't afford strategic silence and
pretend that this thing just doesn't

984
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:29,150
exist.
I think that that's partially where this,

985
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:33,860
uh, our overlords in the
institutional class are so far off,

986
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:38,850
is that they're not realizing that
there's no possible way to get rid of t to

987
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,150
get away with this level
of strategic silence.

988
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,660
And that's what created Donald Trump is
that he was willing to break strategic

989
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:49,160
silence everywhere and people were
willing to say, look, he may be crazy.

990
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:50,180
He may be immoral,

991
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,010
but at least he's not under the thumb
of whatever this thing is. Right.

992
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:58,810
But they're crazy. And Mro, he's
just showing us his crazy anymore.

993
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,660
I think that if I'm allowed to be mean,

994
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,760
I think that's the way the average Trump
voter felt. They're crazy and a moral,

995
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,090
these people, I felt somebody is probably
crazy and, but he's doing it. Okay.

996
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:11,820
I just don't like being lied
to in, in terms that, uh,

997
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,060
a stupid child would never
accept because these lies,

998
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,260
I need better lies. No, I do.
This is what I talk about.

999
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,220
Adult level fiction.

1000
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,910
Are you talking about the lies of the
nature of the gate institutions or are you

1001
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:27,770
talking about the rise of Trump
and of the gated institution there?

1002
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,420
I understand that you want to not create
an incentive structure so that people

1003
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:35,270
murder people so that they can
get their message out and amplify.

1004
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,710
That makes good sense to me.

1005
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,650
And when we get to the point
where this thing is big enough,

1006
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,360
we may have to consider all of the
issues that the traditional media had to

1007
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:49,070
consider. However, what is
absolutely not acceptable,

1008
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,610
nobody from the State Department has ever
contacted any one of us and said, hey,

1009
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,760
I'm a little bit worried, uh,
as to what you guys are doing.

1010
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:59,270
Do you understand how this fits
in? Can you come in? Uh, you know,

1011
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:02,440
we understand that you guys are,
are trying to do good, but let,

1012
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,790
let us tell you what you s objectives are.

1013
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,020
I've never been a part of any
conversation like this, uh,

1014
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,090
in the last 20 years,
right?

1015
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,080
Voc Salata buzzfeed things were so
dangerous and yet nobody's getting

1016
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,800
radicalized in the name of Vera
client's time. Well, but you know,

1017
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,480
we're also d radical.
Most of us are.

1018
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,680
Most of us are patriotic and I will
definitely tailor some of what I say,

1019
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,590
uh, to national interests if I'm aware
of what those national interests are.

1020
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,520
But if you're not contacting
us and then you're smearing us,

1021
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:34,200
then that's your only means of control.

1022
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,680
You're not talking about a free society,

1023
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,870
you're talking about a Potemkin democracy.

1024
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,030
And I'm not going to participate
in your Potemkin democracy,

1025
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,740
either have the conversation or be
prepared that nobody's going to obey your

1026
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:49,740
strategic silence and you
can get rid of all of us,

1027
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,040
but you're not going to get rid of the
number of people are going to take our

1028
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,890
seats and the more force
you use to get rid of us,

1029
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,930
the more you're going to radicalize
people in the name of liberty.

1030
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,070
And I think that,
you know,

1031
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:07,071
this is very important that this is really
a war over sensemaking and we have a

1032
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:10,890
right to be,

1033
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:15,150
I mean I wanna I want to state
this rather emphatically,

1034
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,230
this idea of d platforming,
sensible,

1035
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,650
rational people who are smarter than the
people who are being platform to where

1036
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,170
more moral,
more decent and saying,

1037
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:28,080
well you can't come in because you're
not part of the narrative agreement.

1038
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,970
That's how you get something like the
French revolution. And so if you want to,

1039
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,390
if you want to say thank you to things
like the Ruben report, we are taking this,

1040
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,780
the pressure off of this system.

1041
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,990
You are alive so transparently about so
many things that no sane or smart person

1042
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:46,920
as an adult can believe.

1043
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,090
And thank God there's some place
where people can come and say,

1044
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:53,910
I thought I was losing my mind.
And then here you guys are,

1045
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:58,270
and it's clear that you're not radical.
You're not mean spirited, you're not bad,

1046
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,120
bad hearted.
There's no shortage of PhDs in our system.

1047
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:07,410
There's no shortage. You know, Comedians
as an alternate intellectual universe,

1048
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,640
you guys lost the plot in
the institutional space.

1049
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,280
Why don't you come out to the
comedy store? Why, why, why,

1050
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:18,330
why don't you come out at for dinner, uh,
the, you know, the next time we have it,

1051
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,600
why didn't you call us into
Washington and say, look,

1052
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:24,060
here's what our strategic
objectives. And then we'll say, okay,

1053
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,890
you can't lie that much to people,

1054
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,690
but what you can do is you can present
the truth in different ways and stop

1055
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,430
making everyone feel like they're
being gaslit. All right, so here's what

1056
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,960
I do. I think we've done probably about
an hour or so right now. Maybe an hour 10.

1057
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,060
We're going to do about an hour and
a half total, just the two of us.

1058
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:39,680
Then we want you guys in on this.

1059
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:44,150
So patrion.com/ruben report
and whatever level you're at,

1060
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:48,050
we're going to take your
question. So jump in on that. Um,

1061
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,920
all this being said, do you think, I think

1062
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,980
perhaps that we're
winning and I say winning.

1063
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,170
I've been floating this idea
for a couple months now,

1064
01:04:57,171 --> 01:05:00,320
and it's partly because of what I'm
seeing out there with Jordan and when I've

1065
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:01,700
been saying it to the audiences,

1066
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:04,550
I always say it with the kind
of tongue in cheek, you know,

1067
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:06,200
I think maybe we're starting to win guys,

1068
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:09,530
and 3000 people cheer at once because
they haven't heard that before.

1069
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,920
They haven't been around a huge
group of people where they can go.

1070
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,380
These people are all sorts of different,
I don't know any of these people,

1071
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:17,060
but we're kind of in on this together now.

1072
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,700
Jordan always brings up the point often
in his talks that it's not about winning

1073
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:23,710
per se,
because if this was a marriage,

1074
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:28,120
you don't want to beat your wife in an
argument because then you're just married

1075
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:32,400
to a loser. You want to get to a place
where you can both maybe have one in lost.

1076
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,020
Maybe you won the argument,
but there was a lesson learned.

1077
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,060
That's the type of
winning I'm talking about.

1078
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,740
I suspect that they now think we are such
a huge threat for all the reasons that

1079
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:42,880
you've just laid out,

1080
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,020
that they're going after us in crazy ways.

1081
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,860
That to me shows we're winning.
When I saw the veracity of the,

1082
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:55,360
of the pieces that came out
after this lovely report here,

1083
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,650
uh, I thought, wow, we're actually
bigger than these guys now.

1084
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:03,280
I don't have hundreds of millions
of dollars behind me like vox does.

1085
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,720
I've got patrons and super chat money,
you know, and it's like we're doing,

1086
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,850
what you referred to before
is this sort of slim thing,

1087
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:11,740
which is really cool right now.

1088
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:13,850
And there's reasons that it's really
strong right now and maybe, yeah,

1089
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,590
we'll all grow ferocity. That do
you mean the veracity of the for us?

1090
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,380
I think I meant the veracity.
Okay. That these are not,

1091
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:23,120
these are not very truthful reports.

1092
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,300
Well, I meant the, that they,
there were so many of them.

1093
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:30,060
Oh, okay. Wait, give me those
two definitions there. What
do I do? What did I say?

1094
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,590
It doesn't matter. Um,
this is why I shouldn't be
interviewing smarter people. No,

1095
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:39,110
I don't know. Maybe I'm getting it
wrong. Yeah. So the um, but there's,

1096
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:43,080
there's a signal being read by
these people. Like holy cow,

1097
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:45,960
they've got all this money and
they've got all this power. Yeah.

1098
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,600
I've been tricked my rule in general.
I need a dictionary when I'm dealing with,

1099
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:51,810
with, with, with the, with
the intelligence community.

1100
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,910
So whenever you're talking
about something sensitive,

1101
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,080
you should clump around because they
don't like to be surprised is what I'm

1102
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,690
talking about. Immigration and
stuff. I try to make a lot of noise.

1103
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:05,760
I tried to make a lot of noise.
This, this alternative network. Um,

1104
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,780
and the good part of it, which is what
I'm focused on, I'm not talking about,

1105
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,860
I don't know, whatever Richard Spencer
is saying to baked Alaska cause who, who,

1106
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,040
who gives a shit. Yeah. Um,

1107
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,070
the good part of this network has
been making a ton of noise. Hey,

1108
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:23,430
this is important. People are
listening. The events, you know,

1109
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:28,140
our large people are fanatical
and they're normal people.

1110
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:32,900
Um,
we are winning at some level,

1111
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,480
but we are losing,

1112
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,070
we're not winning quickly enough and clean
enough. Well, that's what I always say.

1113
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:43,610
What do I say to you every week? We're
not moving fast enough. Well, okay,

1114
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,800
but this thing has its own pace.

1115
01:07:45,801 --> 01:07:50,801
So somehow when the gated institutional
narrative issues or report that tries to

1116
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:55,610
take you all out, um, next
time guys, first of all,

1117
01:07:55,611 --> 01:07:59,450
assigned somebody better than Rebecca
because she just doesn't have the chops

1118
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:03,200
yet. Maybe, maybe in five years
if you're going to come for us,

1119
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:08,120
come loaded for bear and do
it intellectually correct. Um,

1120
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:13,440
my concern is, is that the next moves
are going to be highly personal.

1121
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,980
Like how do we take out, you
know, you saw this thing with

1122
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,200
Rogan talking about white
farmers in Africa. You know,

1123
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,400
Rogan says some crazy stuff on his show.

1124
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:24,740
I'm not sure whether what
he said was crazy or not,

1125
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,450
cause I haven't looked at this,

1126
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:31,160
but I have no doubt that Joe holds
some positions that are, that are off.

1127
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,470
I certainly hold positions that are often,
when I find them,

1128
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,310
I try to correct them,

1129
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,000
but suddenly the litany of people going
after him as if he's a racist because he

1130
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,640
even talked about this.
Well, yes. And you know,

1131
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:44,330
Rebecca Lewis is very adamant that we
shouldn't have gotten angry at Elan Musk

1132
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:46,670
for smoking dope. Uh, on the show.

1133
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:50,960
We should have gotten angry that a Elon
Musk went on Joe Rogan because he gave a

1134
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:55,460
platform to James Moore and
Jordan Peterson. Jordan. I mean,

1135
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:56,990
doesn't that tell you everything?

1136
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:02,620
This kind of bananas a inside of
this tiny little bubble stuff,

1137
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,350
um,
they're going to get more sophisticated.

1138
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,950
So just thinking about it as a video game,
um,

1139
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,820
we've been playing with like lots of
low level orks on level zero and, okay.

1140
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,360
So then things got ratcheted up.
This isn't terribly serious.

1141
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:22,130
It's going to get more serious because
as the narrative outcomes to understand

1142
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,050
just how big these channels are,
just how influential they are. Let,

1143
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,160
let me be open about something.

1144
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:32,660
Part of the theory behind
defining the Idw, uh,

1145
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:36,980
has to do with my understanding of
how demography works in presidential

1146
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:37,814
elections.

1147
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:42,680
So one way of winning an election is
that you find a demographic that nobody

1148
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:47,681
knew existed and then you speak to them
and they're large enough to sway things.

1149
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,990
So soccer moms remember soccer moms.
Okay.

1150
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:55,670
Another one of these things was Karl
Rove's discovery of the excerpt where you

1151
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,504
have urban,

1152
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:01,040
suburban something and then rural
in between suburban and rural,

1153
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,470
there was this thing that nobody
understood called the excerpt.

1154
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:07,880
And so by finding that you could
find some demographic chunk.

1155
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,600
So both parties, uh, let me
be very clear about this.

1156
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,570
The IDW nation is quite large.

1157
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,630
It's people who've had
enough of low level lies.

1158
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:21,470
They don't mind adult level fictions that
are in the best interests of everybody,

1159
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,640
but they cannot put up with this
level of nonsense coming out of our

1160
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:29,540
institutions and part of what's going
on inside the institutions at the

1161
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:34,541
institutions have a fake public facing
front and then an internal group.

1162
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,510
And this is how they
handle things. So like, um,

1163
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,180
I think Danny Roderick talked about,
um,

1164
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:46,820
public voice and seminar voice that as
an economist you can say certain things

1165
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,740
to your colleagues,
but when you're talking to the public,

1166
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:49,850
you have to say different things.

1167
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,210
And unfortunately they don't even really
mirror each other too closely. Right?

1168
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,220
And so it's okay to lie to the public.

1169
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:57,650
And so when you've talked to
an economist and you say, well,

1170
01:10:57,651 --> 01:11:00,350
you can't possibly believe what, what, uh,

1171
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:04,520
that immigration and trade or pure
positives of course not. Well,

1172
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:07,730
but you just said that or you allowed your
colleague to say you stayed know well,

1173
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,310
that's what you have to say in front of
the public because they can't follow the

1174
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:14,970
analytic argument. Well, okay, that's
a, that's academic malpractice.

1175
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,160
You're engaged in academic
malpractice when you do that. Um,

1176
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,630
whatever you say to the public has to
be a version of what you're saying in

1177
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:26,680
private or you're engaged in
some kind of Potemkin statecraft.

1178
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:30,910
And if the idea is that we can't have
a country, because actually if you,

1179
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,220
if you took the constitution seriously,
it wouldn't work.

1180
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:34,720
Then we have to talk about,
okay,

1181
01:11:34,721 --> 01:11:38,500
well what are we going to do that would
work that, that would actually be viable.

1182
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,260
But right now what we have
is we have a bunch of, um,

1183
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:44,680
not very intelligent adults
who are not very honest,

1184
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:48,190
who are sitting in the most important
chairs telling us that we're all idiots

1185
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,550
and world deplorable across
this political spectrum.

1186
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,890
And that's not going to work and
that we are going to win that battle.

1187
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,550
So for all the people that at
every Q and a that I do anywhere,

1188
01:11:57,551 --> 01:12:00,160
either with Jordan or at the standup
shows that I'm doing are we got,

1189
01:12:00,161 --> 01:12:03,610
I think basically this question, we, we
did a little IDW, is it pretty awesome?

1190
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,690
Actually, within a day we set up
an IDW, there's an IDW group now,

1191
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,220
which they're springing
up all over the place.

1192
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:13,630
This one sprung up in New York City. We
did a, a room down on Bleecker street,

1193
01:12:13,631 --> 01:12:17,110
300 people standing room only. We
did it for free. They, you know,

1194
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:21,730
whatever we grifters, I know it's such
grifters you did it for free. Uh, but,

1195
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,990
but putting that aside, uh, the question
that consistently comes up is, okay,

1196
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:27,820
we get all this people go, you know, get,

1197
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:30,460
all the ideas were onboard and we like
what you're doing. We want to help.

1198
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:34,720
We're ready to, you know, show our faces
and, and be part of this whole thing.

1199
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,790
We know there's a technological answer.

1200
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:39,130
How is it that you morons
haven't come up with it yet?

1201
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,570
There's some version of that,

1202
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:43,870
like aren't you guys the ones
supposed to be doing all right?

1203
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,770
Well you and I have been talking
and working on this in various ways.

1204
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,350
Let's just be honest about this.

1205
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,620
We haven't known when the right time
is because the investment in trying to

1206
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,590
rebuild the infrastructure
and then there's a question
about how are you going,

1207
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,780
you know,
if on the other side of this thing,

1208
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,940
there really is a collaboration between
technology, intelligence and media. Uh,

1209
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:09,900
it doesn't make sense to build the system
only to have it torn down by people

1210
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:14,490
with special access, um, in a non
competitive non-market kind of a way.

1211
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,150
But make no mistake,
um,

1212
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,810
this is a viable concept.
I think it's going to happen.

1213
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,740
I think it's important that
it happened before 2020. Um,

1214
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,560
and the key,
you know,

1215
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,410
people should know that there's a
lot of billionaire interest in this.

1216
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,840
There's a lot,
and I don't mean one person.

1217
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:37,320
I mean several billionaires
are sniffing around this. Um,

1218
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,060
and I think Ben Shapiro just
got to this show on Fox.

1219
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,110
I'll be on this Friday. Okay. So, uh,

1220
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,310
this is going to heat up.

1221
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:52,260
And I think what's really important is
to watch what happens to data and society

1222
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:57,070
as this particular, um, report, uh,

1223
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,950
finds its course.

1224
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,280
Because if what we see is
that the institutions agreed
to cite this because it's

1225
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,170
a big serious report in a pdf file.
Um,

1226
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,710
then that's going to tell us a lot
about how far the institutions are gone.

1227
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,460
And I,

1228
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,450
you and I differ somewhat where I believe
I want to rebuild the institutions

1229
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,520
because I think it's a shame to,

1230
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,640
we've got some bad hermit crabs
and some perfectly good shells.

1231
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:24,220
I don't want to crack the shells
just to get it. The hermit crabs.

1232
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,470
I think your feeling is,

1233
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:29,110
is that things are so rotten that it
might be better starting from scratch.

1234
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,400
Well,
I feel that mostly about the Democrats.

1235
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,830
I don't feel that about our institutions,

1236
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,040
so I don't feel that about our academic
institutions and things of that nature.

1237
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,110
I think those things, I agree.
I want to keep that Shell.

1238
01:14:39,111 --> 01:14:44,090
Let's get rid of the bad crabs that are
in there. Fine. Um, but the Democrats,

1239
01:14:44,091 --> 01:14:47,680
I think it's basically through and
through at this point, but maybe not. And,

1240
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:50,180
and I would be, believe
me, if the day comes,

1241
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:53,210
and I have to eat crow on that one because
they came back to sanity and there's

1242
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:58,211
suddenly a new JFK and a Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and I will gladly eat crow and

1243
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,270
mia culpa,
the whole Shebang.

1244
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,620
I think one of the big questions is how do
we save the, uh, you know, I think I've,

1245
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,170
I've asked before, does this come down
to the University of Chicago or the,

1246
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,410
are they the only ones who
are holding the line, uh,

1247
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,010
on the enlightenment standards?

1248
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,660
But I think one of the things
we should be doing in the,

1249
01:15:17,661 --> 01:15:22,661
in the academic institutions is having
debates where two departments are

1250
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:27,800
studying the exact same
thing like gender and sex,

1251
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,420
uh, in biology departments and gender,
women's studies departments, uh,

1252
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:36,380
or for example, the wage gap where you
have the economists version of this.

1253
01:15:36,381 --> 01:15:40,970
And then you have like, let's say the
women's studies version of this. Um,

1254
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,550
we should be holding debates to
bring about the unity of knowledge.

1255
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:51,320
And so we understand where are we divided
if you have two different academic

1256
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:53,030
standards,
uh,

1257
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:58,060
I think people would be shocked if they
looked at the article which introduced

1258
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:02,430
the concept I think of white
privilege and maybe mail,

1259
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,470
which was like unpacking the
knapsack coming out of Wellesley.

1260
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:10,070
If they looked at the, that's where
a lot of this stuff was born. Right?

1261
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:13,640
That very piece, well that some of it was
born in that piece. Some of it was born,

1262
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:17,840
I think it a woman's name is
professor Crenshaw at Ucla.

1263
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:18,890
The intersectionality,

1264
01:16:18,891 --> 01:16:21,500
which originally had a very
different flavor than what we call it

1265
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:26,080
intersectionality today. Um, it's
very important to look at the,

1266
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:31,140
at the genesis of these ideas and to
look what is their academic pedigree.

1267
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,470
And you know,
they're not all terrible ideas,

1268
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:37,430
but a lot of them are just puristics
that are fighting things that are much

1269
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,230
farther down in the stack.

1270
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:43,670
And it's not tamale
anybody. You'll look if, if,

1271
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,810
if the wage gap is really 25 cents,
I want to know,

1272
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,770
but I don't trust that
the wage gap is 25 cents.

1273
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:54,670
If somebody refuses to control
for things like, you know,

1274
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,880
the choice of what field they get,

1275
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:58,900
their training or how much kin
work they're doing. And you know,

1276
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:02,900
as I've said on this program before,
if the problem is, is that uh,

1277
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,950
too much kin work is falling to
females and that this is uncompensated,

1278
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:08,960
we may have to do something which

1279
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,310
this real labor that is being done
for society in monetary terms,

1280
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,710
women may need to get paid more,
you know,

1281
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:18,770
but let's make the arguments honestly,

1282
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:22,280
and let's stop lying about everything
where if you don't sign up for the idea

1283
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:25,010
that there's a 25 cent wage gap,
um,

1284
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,580
which has no known source
other than oppression, uh,

1285
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:31,270
that you need to be deeply
informed and not be able to learn,

1286
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,210
earn a living because your, your views
are beyond the pale. That's, that's,

1287
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:38,630
that's moronic.
I think that's a break right there.

1288
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:42,050
That was pretty sad. You
want to do something so you
finally focused, you know,

1289
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:44,900
I do all the shows with you and I'm
like, ah, what is he saying? Really?

1290
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:48,290
I want to get back to the tits for and
Thall Magic Square and large exceptional

1291
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:51,830
lead groups or whatever the chaff. I
really only did that just so in the title.

1292
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:54,980
We could put tits,
Freud and Dorcas tits on youtube plays.

1293
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:56,630
We never saw what happened
with that experiment.

1294
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:00,410
Whether it got a higher view
camp. Oh, I should check him
out. I have no idea. Well,

1295
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,990
you never know how youtube is manipulating
these things. All right people,

1296
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:03,830
here's what we're going to do.

1297
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:06,740
We're going to take literally
one two minute break. We
are going to pour whiskey.

1298
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,850
You always say that is going to be one
or two. Do you have to pee this time?

1299
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,170
Probably.
All right,

1300
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:16,100
well then depending on how long
Dr Eric Weinstein has to urinate,

1301
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,350
that will be the length of the break.

1302
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:21,530
We're gonna pour some whiskey on the
rocks and then we're going to take some

1303
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,740
questions.
So patrion.com/ruben report,

1304
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,620
we're going to give you guys
preferential treatment. Uh,

1305
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:30,410
you can jump in on super chat as well. Oh.
And by the way, I'm the, on October 5th,

1306
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:33,350
I am going to be at wise guys in Utah,

1307
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:37,040
a comedy doing about an hour of comedy
and there will be a special guest from

1308
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,930
the intellectual dark web.
It's a big one.

1309
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,660
I don't want to say who
you've joined me. Pq, can you,

1310
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,680
I'm going to ask for a plug for my,
a new youtube channel.

1311
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:49,430
And you're doing the youtube and I'm
on Instagram because I'm getting,

1312
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,910
I want to diversify so that if I get
kicked off of Twitter for something,

1313
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,410
I'm not completely dependent on that
place is sort of depressing. So they did,

1314
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,120
they put out this alternative
influencer network about youtubers.

1315
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:01,740
You've put up at least three
videos. Yeah. You didn't get on.

1316
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:05,270
I'm a major youtube or man Erickson,
the a on the youtube. What is it?

1317
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:09,210
Just a slash Eric r Weinstein or
how do you know what it is? I,

1318
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,300
I actually will fire.
We're going to find it.

1319
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,140
We're going to comment on the
video after the livestream. Ah,

1320
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:18,560
give us like two minutes. Whiskey your
questions. patrion.com/rubin report.

1321
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,110
Uh,
we'll be right back.

1322
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:37,983
Okay.

Huh?

1339
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:32,190
All right guys. We are
back. We've got whiskey.

1340
01:26:32,191 --> 01:26:35,310
First off chairs my friend.
Cheers.

1341
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:39,450
Let's see what happens because
of all the guff that, uh,

1342
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:43,140
Ilan took when he went on Rogen your shot
telling everybody this is not actually

1343
01:26:43,141 --> 01:26:47,490
whiskey. It's, it's IOWASCA. It's
Iowasca that's right on the rocks.

1344
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,520
You wouldn't smoke weed on
camera with you. Pardon me?

1345
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,650
You wouldn't smoke weed on camera
with you? Never. Alright, here we go.

1346
01:26:58,651 --> 01:27:02,610
So real quick, uh, we're gonna take
questions from a patriotic people first.

1347
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,540
So Reuben, select
patrion.com/rubin report. Uh,

1348
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:08,370
we've got a whole bunch
of questions already. Uh,

1349
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:10,110
we'll do some stuff on super chat as well.

1350
01:27:10,111 --> 01:27:13,200
I will be at wiseguys in Salt
Lake City on October 5th,

1351
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:17,670
Dave ruben.com/events and the links
in the description right down below.

1352
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,533
All right.

1353
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,820
What us normies get is that the very
personal attacks against famous people are

1354
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:27,510
a warning to the normies. Not to step
out of line. Do you agree with this?

1355
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,630
Absolutely. Yeah. That's what I've
been pushing for a while. Well,

1356
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:34,320
this in terms of this network
diagram, um, I just, you know,

1357
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,790
so this guy,
Cody Wilson,

1358
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:40,320
who had the three d printable
guns defense distributed.

1359
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:44,010
So I follow him on Twitter and
there was just an ominous tweet,

1360
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:48,540
which is like Cody Wilson is
followed by the following accounts.

1361
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,411
Well,
I,

1362
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:53,550
I'd follow Adolf Hitler if you were
on Twitter to know what he's thinking.

1363
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,190
I mean the fact that you follow somebody,

1364
01:27:56,191 --> 01:28:01,191
if that's evidence of your moral
turpitude and how base and file you are.

1365
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,320
I mean, for God's sakes, if I was at war,

1366
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:08,670
I would tune into my enemies broadcasts.
You can't tell anything from that.

1367
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:12,510
So this is part of the scare tactics and
I think that those of us who are trying

1368
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:17,310
to be the advanced guard and have
to make fun of this. Yeah. So yes,

1369
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,940
you're, they are trying to scare you
that if you listened to these people,

1370
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:25,170
you will be radicalized,
you will be unemployable.

1371
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,090
And,
um,

1372
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:31,080
let us take the first few
steps and make fun of this.

1373
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,290
And then it would be great if you
followed in behind and made fun of us,

1374
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:37,110
made fun of not us, but well they
can make fun of us. That's fine.

1375
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:41,520
But they certainly do. But yeah, that
make fun of this mania about saying, well,

1376
01:28:41,521 --> 01:28:43,560
so and so talked to so and so talked to.
So and so.

1377
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:46,590
And I just want to say one thing about
this I haven't gotten to yet. Yeah.

1378
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:51,860
The whole concept of a safe space is
not about people being triggered that I

1379
01:28:52,471 --> 01:28:56,370
think is false. I think what it
is is about safety for narratives.

1380
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,710
And so if you have a nonsensical
narrative as you do in cult,

1381
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,810
that narrative cannot survive
direct contact with outsiders.

1382
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,950
And so if you think about it,

1383
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,960
it's funny that the institutions are
actually a cult like network that aren't

1384
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:15,990
confident enough of their
opinions. I mean, look,

1385
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:19,530
I've never taken any kind
of class in my life. Uh,

1386
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,750
I want to tell people that their
calculation, the calculation of CPI, um,

1387
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,960
on a cost of living a basis with
changing preferences is completely wrong.

1388
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,660
And I know how to do it. And my wife
knows how to do it. And so far as I know,

1389
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:36,810
nobody else knows how to do it.
And if you want to come at me and say,

1390
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,130
that's nonsense and this is the,
the ratings of an amateur, uh,

1391
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,390
name the time and the place.

1392
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:47,100
I'll show up at any ECON department
and make that argument that kind of a,

1393
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,350
a narrative,
um,

1394
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:54,330
which is that you have to have a secret
group of people adjusting the CPI. Um,

1395
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:56,490
because so much is indexed to CPI.

1396
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:00,610
So billions of dollars change hands when
you change the calculation of CPI. Uh,

1397
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,760
that's a nonsensical statement.

1398
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:07,170
And so you need a safe space that says
only the experts can understand this.

1399
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,160
That's the same thing that we're
seeing with so many of our positions,

1400
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,600
which is that people imagine,
um,

1401
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,650
that the safe space is about not wanting
to hurt people's feelings. No, no, no.

1402
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,320
It's about not wanting,
uh,

1403
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:24,410
these nonsensical narratives to come
into contact with intelligent critics.

1404
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:28,770
And I think that people have to understand
that you're being warned away from

1405
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:31,320
PhDs, from, uh,

1406
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:36,330
other alternative intellectuals who have
a lot to say. Like Noam Chomsky, um,

1407
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,310
because the narratives
are being protected.

1408
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:42,520
So a couple of people have
asked me questions like
this that I've gotten before

1409
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,460
just now, but I did get it here. So I'm
just going to sort of paraphrase it.

1410
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:49,150
I think you saw the moment when I had
Shapiro on a couple of weeks ago and we

1411
01:30:49,151 --> 01:30:51,340
got into the gay cake thing again.

1412
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:55,120
He said he would not bake me a
cake for my anniversary party.

1413
01:30:55,121 --> 01:30:58,870
He said he may not even come to
my anniversary party. And I said,

1414
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:02,650
my hope is that if we can remain friends
for 50 years, I can move you on this.

1415
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:07,300
Now I understand that I cannot be
friends with Ben exactly the same way.

1416
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:11,230
I can be friends with you
because of that particular issue.

1417
01:31:11,231 --> 01:31:15,480
We can be friends and friendly and,
and allies in a lot of ways. But we,

1418
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,410
there's a separation there for sure.

1419
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:20,650
But I do consider him a friend who I
have differences with and that's okay.

1420
01:31:20,651 --> 01:31:24,190
And I want to respect his differences
and he's not trying to take away my

1421
01:31:24,191 --> 01:31:27,940
marriage or jail me or take away my things
as people keep telling me he's trying

1422
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:31,270
to do. I'm curious what you
just thought of that exchange,

1423
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:36,300
just as watching somebody talk about
morals and sin and how that's related to

1424
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:42,430
your ability to be friends with someone.
Yeah,

1425
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,490
I've got a terrible view on this.
That's why I ask.

1426
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,750
Um,
I don't know,

1427
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:58,080
I think Ben is actually being very
genuine in terms of the analytics of it,

1428
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,430
but are you don't sense that he's got,

1429
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:09,510
I think it's a very formal homophobia as
opposed to a visceral homea homophobia.

1430
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:14,780
Like, okay, there's some, uh,
there's some passage in the,

1431
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:19,540
in the Torah that says this is not good.
And so it says,

1432
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:22,180
thou shall not lie with a man
as you would a woman basically.

1433
01:32:22,181 --> 01:32:26,020
But I don't lie with women that way,
so it's all good. You know what I mean?

1434
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:30,790
Let's not make a big deal in.
Yeah. Um, okay, so focus the, uh,

1435
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:36,280
so I think that Ben is actually
being reasonable and you know,

1436
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:39,280
in the same way that as a,
as a guy with a,

1437
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:43,510
a fair number of clothes,
a gay male friends,

1438
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,590
I know that there are some parties that
you guys feel comfortable inviting me to

1439
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:52,000
and other parties that you wouldn't
feel comfortable inviting me to.

1440
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,110
I'm not sure what you mean. Not Go higher
than me. I'm not having those parties.

1441
01:32:56,111 --> 01:33:00,370
You can come to any of my parties.
Somebody whose name will not be known,

1442
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,620
would not be known to your
audience. Once said to me, um,

1443
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:09,820
if it's boys soup, uh, and there
are a lot of twinks running around,

1444
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:13,300
you're not going to be the one getting
the invitation and I hope you're okay

1445
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:17,110
with it. So that would be a
kind of discrimination that
would be for my benefit.

1446
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:18,500
And I think that,
you know,

1447
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,540
this is what happens when Ben brings
his own food to the dinner party you're

1448
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:24,070
having,
he's trying to say,

1449
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,760
how do I integrate into your life in
a way that allows me to keep my modern

1450
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:33,850
Orthodox position?
And I actually really valued,

1451
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:38,200
I is honesty and I, and I, and I
just, I want to get something across.

1452
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:42,250
And Ben's defense, which is, yeah,
it does seem kind of backward.

1453
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:45,700
And on the other hand it
seemed kind of awesome. Um,

1454
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:50,140
which was that he was owning
that this was a discomfort.

1455
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:52,990
There was no real bar in my opinion,

1456
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:57,700
to the depth of your friendship and
he's just going to be formal about it.

1457
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,360
Yeah. By the way, if you hang
around with Orthodox Jews, they,

1458
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,470
there's a lot of this,

1459
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:06,190
they're very formal about rules and
they're also very adept at getting around

1460
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:06,940
them.

1461
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:11,530
And so this is exactly what I expect
from an Orthodox Jew is that he is open

1462
01:34:11,531 --> 01:34:12,920
minded in some ways.
He's,

1463
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:17,170
I think he's very progressive on this
front and he's going to be upfront,

1464
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,900
like formally, I can't
do these things. Uh,

1465
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,960
but it's very similar to when I
have Muslim friends in, you know,

1466
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:27,980
I have Turkish friends and stumble
and you're having an fs beer and um,

1467
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:30,010
then you say, hey, you know,

1468
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,040
isn't it strange that you're a Muslim and
you're having this beer? And they said,

1469
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,470
you know, I really shouldn't. And they put
the beer down for the rest of the meal.

1470
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:39,190
Or in India you talk about people being
confirmed, bachelors that are gay,

1471
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,920
just give people their formal out.
Uh,

1472
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:44,770
and that's the way that they're dealing
with their form of formal homophobia.

1473
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:47,920
I don't think it's very deep. Yeah. And I
just thought all these people were like,

1474
01:34:47,921 --> 01:34:50,770
oh, she Reuben such a sellout. He's
letting, he's sitting there with someone,

1475
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,990
tells him he's a sinner and it's like,

1476
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,880
well then when they're ready
to come to the adult table,

1477
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:59,550
we'll welcome them
there. We all right. Uh,

1478
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,280
well we answered it.
You answered a couple of,

1479
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:07,570
there's a lot about just like how can
a business be built around this? Um,

1480
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:08,800
okay.

1481
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,440
Eric, I'd love to see you have a
discussion with the free market.

1482
01:35:11,441 --> 01:35:14,950
Economists like Brian Kaplan. Would you
be interested in something like that?

1483
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:18,670
I've had Brian Kaplan on the
show. He's, yeah, he's an
endcap guy. I really, I mean,

1484
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:22,000
I like those ideas. I just liked
the intellectual place that those,

1485
01:35:22,001 --> 01:35:24,940
I didn't know you'd be happy to do
that. Right. I think so. Yeah. Why not,

1486
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:29,050
right. Talk to Tyler Cowen a lot in
Tyler and I disagree on some stuff,

1487
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:33,130
but um, you know, just
as people should know,

1488
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:38,790
the universe of smart generative people
is so small that we don't usually screen

1489
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,220
each other on ideology.
We're just so happy to,

1490
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,720
to meet somebody who's
thinking deeply and his open

1491
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:46,860
or just basically will act in good
faith. And then it's like, oh,

1492
01:35:46,861 --> 01:35:50,070
you think differently. Okay.
It's all good. I didn't know
about this, maybe you did,

1493
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:53,940
but how do you feel about the nation of
Hungary proposing to ban gender studies

1494
01:35:53,941 --> 01:35:56,520
as a discipline at their universities?
Had you heard about this?

1495
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,020
No. Um, I mean I think
it's very important to,

1496
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:06,000
I would not ban gender studies. I think I
would do what I just said, which is, uh,

1497
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:11,230
make sure that you have a uniform
standard of scholarship and not, um,

1498
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,330
a form of scholarship that
is friendly to activism.

1499
01:36:15,331 --> 01:36:19,560
You have to make sure that
activist scholarship, uh,

1500
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:24,240
is recognized as something
other than pure inquiry. I mean,

1501
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,970
are you capable of disseminating a,

1502
01:36:26,971 --> 01:36:31,110
finding that you're very upset to find
that that's a prerequisite for having

1503
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:36,030
professorial privileges, uh, in
terms of tenure and academic freedom?

1504
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,850
I suspect there's very
little of that these days.

1505
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:43,620
People that truly go in without any
sciences, there's tons of it. Yeah.

1506
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:45,790
Yeah. And you know, this is my,

1507
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:50,820
my basic take on the universities is
the heart and soul of the great research

1508
01:36:52,261 --> 01:36:54,230
universities.
It's hard core disciplines.

1509
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:58,830
We've done much more in those
disciplines than anybody else.

1510
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:03,810
And so who are you and get out of my
lab, uh, is an important principle.

1511
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:08,870
And as long as we have something that
keeps bad scholarship from getting in,

1512
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:12,480
from, you know, bringing
the principle of explosion,

1513
01:37:12,481 --> 01:37:15,650
as we talked about before
into the sciences, um,

1514
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:20,690
we should start exporting a scientific
notions of rigor and we should be holding

1515
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,890
debates between disciplines to make sure
that everything is other piece rather

1516
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:29,430
than saying, okay, well you have no
wage gap and you have a wage gap.

1517
01:37:29,431 --> 01:37:32,960
We don't even know if it's
the same word. Um, so I,

1518
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:35,100
I think that it's a bad move.
Instead,

1519
01:37:35,101 --> 01:37:38,130
what we should do is we should make sure
that all of these fee, and by the way,

1520
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:41,760
if gender studies has figured out some
things that the biologists don't know,

1521
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,460
we have to take our lumps in
biology. It's not, it's not a,

1522
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:45,750
there's no fix in that game.

1523
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,590
Do you have any recommendations for having
a more s epistemological? The honest,

1524
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:51,880
yeah,

1525
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,290
responsible conversation.

1526
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:59,940
I think that the anti is much higher
than people imagine that one of the w you

1527
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:02,730
know, I think about, um, I
don't know why I do this,

1528
01:38:02,731 --> 01:38:07,470
but I think about the old shows love
boat and fantasy island versus game of

1529
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:11,970
Thrones in the Sopranos. Like the
Auntie is a lot higher these days.

1530
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,680
We are smart and we have
long attention span,

1531
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:20,340
put down love boat on my show. I have
a thing, I carry a torch for Julie.

1532
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:23,790
Um, but, uh, the cruise director,

1533
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:29,970
um,
I,

1534
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:35,700
I think that people have to understand
that if you want to behave in a more

1535
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,490
epistemically consistent fashion,
uh,

1536
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:42,870
you're going to need to budget one or
two orders of magnitude more brain space

1537
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,740
because most of them,

1538
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,420
the heuristics that have been pushed out
or completely unworkable in our modern

1539
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:52,530
world. And once you open up that
brain space, once you say, okay,

1540
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:55,770
I'm going to follow game of Thrones for
season after season in episode after

1541
01:38:55,771 --> 01:39:00,280
episode, you're having a much
better time than you ever had, uh,

1542
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,750
with shows that had to have their entire
narrative arcs concluded within 30

1543
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:07,620
minutes.
And that sadly they did that on love boat,

1544
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:09,110
right?
Like it's like you got an hour,

1545
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:11,930
it was about we're going to do this and
we're going to wrap this thing around in

1546
01:39:11,931 --> 01:39:13,730
40 minutes. And there you go. Eric,

1547
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:17,750
what do you think about a potential
satellite based Internet solution?

1548
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:21,470
Because it seems like I SSPs are going
to start banding content over landlines.

1549
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:24,110
I mean this goes to all the technological
things that people are talking about.

1550
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,680
Well, right, so you, you tell us, uh,

1551
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:31,740
how much you want to persecute us and
then you'll cause the development of a

1552
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:36,250
crypto and smart contracts and satellites
and that can be free market guy.

1553
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:41,020
I'm like, no, I just want people
to be happy. Free market. Okay.

1554
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:44,030
Um,
is,

1555
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:46,330
well, there's again,
there's a lot about that.

1556
01:39:46,331 --> 01:39:49,510
Is there anything to be done with social
media and funding platforms and payment

1557
01:39:49,511 --> 01:39:53,200
processors who are in the sensor sip
business? It's sort of the same question.

1558
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,210
You can give me something on
that while I'm looking here.

1559
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:57,520
Um,
look,

1560
01:39:57,550 --> 01:40:02,550
there are some very serious problems that
the major platforms are facing that we

1561
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:06,370
are not facing.

1562
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:11,910
And I think it's very important for us
to recognize that once you break it,

1563
01:40:12,701 --> 01:40:15,310
you've bought it.
So if we start our own thing,

1564
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,100
they're going to be all
sorts of intellectual half
measures that are going to

1565
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:19,780
have to happen.
Um,

1566
01:40:19,781 --> 01:40:23,530
so we're in a relatively luxurious
position riding on top of somebody else's

1567
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:25,480
platform and they're
handling the problems.

1568
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,560
I do think they're going to have to
be innovations. As I said earlier,

1569
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:32,950
there's something I forgot to say that
it's very important that I'm just going

1570
01:40:32,951 --> 01:40:34,000
to shove in here.

1571
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,380
There's this talk about whether
or not Google is biasing search.

1572
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,340
Oh, I'm glad you're bringing this. This
is super. Let's really do this. Yeah,

1573
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,180
we should have done this in the
first part of my bed. All right.

1574
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,440
Google is biasing search and the
way in which they're able to say,

1575
01:40:50,441 --> 01:40:55,270
we don't buy a search is how they buy a
search, so need to look up m l fairness,

1576
01:40:55,271 --> 01:40:56,650
machine learning,
fairness.

1577
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,680
Google has released a video and they
talk about their need to unbiased search.

1578
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:06,340
That's how the bias is coming in.
This is the Google is acting,

1579
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,480
and I think I said this in a tweet
as an incompetent ophthalmologist,

1580
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,060
you have a very mild case,
let's say,

1581
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,930
of a stigmatism or myopia and Google says,
oh my God,

1582
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:20,410
you're suffering from some terrible,
they're sightedness in your eye.

1583
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:23,380
Your eyeballs are all misshapen here.
We're going to give you the craziest,

1584
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:26,890
thickest glasses you can imagine.
Now you're blind as a bat when you,

1585
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:29,290
when you're putting those on.
But from their perspective,

1586
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:33,840
they're helping you unbias
your bias problem. Uh, can,

1587
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,620
can you just for people
that haven't got this,

1588
01:41:35,621 --> 01:41:38,680
can you explain why they think
and biasing makes sense? Sure.

1589
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,850
It is definitely true that physics,
let's say,

1590
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:51,030
used to be a much more European
dominated male activity.

1591
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,580
It just is.
It was now it is less so now,

1592
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:02,610
but it is still very often dominated
by men who are a fair of you.

1593
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,350
Right?
There perspective is,

1594
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,100
well that's a bias because in the past
that's what physicists looked like.

1595
01:42:12,101 --> 01:42:15,310
So if you do an image search,
we should be correcting for that bias.

1596
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:18,840
So we're going to show you,
uh, Neil degrasse Tyson. Uh,

1597
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,330
we're going to show you Stefan
Alexander or James Gates.

1598
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:27,430
And so you know that they're showing
you African Americans and then maybe,

1599
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,030
you know, surely, uh, what's
her name? Shirley Jackson,

1600
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,350
a black female. And so suddenly you're
saying, well, wow, this is really crazy.

1601
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:39,070
I'm doing the search on physicists and
I'm seeing all black faces or something

1602
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:39,904
like this.

1603
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:44,410
And so what they're doing is that
they're claiming to undo latency bias,

1604
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:46,990
which is the data hasn't
caught up to the world.

1605
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:49,540
That will be where things
are much more equal.

1606
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:51,310
And so we've just fit you
with the prescription,

1607
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:53,560
but you're looking at this and saying,
wow,

1608
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:58,390
you're really biasing your data in
order to have a social justice agenda.

1609
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,590
And so whatever's going on with Donald
Trump, he's not saying the magic words.

1610
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,320
The question isn't to Google.
Are you biasing your data?

1611
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,780
The question the Google is,
are you an biasing your day?

1612
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,500
Tell me how your unbiased
in your data. And the, the,

1613
01:43:10,501 --> 01:43:12,520
the phrase that pays is ml fairness.

1614
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,890
I should also say that anybody who knows
engineers within youtube and Google and

1615
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:21,250
all of these things knows that
some of them are very unhappy.

1616
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,770
And some of those very unhappy engineers
are talking about all of the ways that

1617
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:31,720
they're being forced to degrade the
product and to privilege certain sources.

1618
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:36,721
Like I've seen a list of rankings
of various news sources as to how

1619
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:42,190
authoritative they should be.
And so the no,

1620
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,170
no surprise,
um,

1621
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:49,620
very liberal institutional medias
and gets very high rankings.

1622
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:52,010
And so from their perspective,
none of this has

1623
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,270
nothing to do with politics.

1624
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:56,120
It just has to do with
biasing authoritative sources.

1625
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,090
Well that has everything to do with
the fact that you think it's authority.

1626
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,160
Please just open this up
so the rest of us can,

1627
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:08,930
can toggle these switches because if,
if you're going to tell me, I mean I,

1628
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,600
I know that a lot of things in the
New York Times happened to be true,

1629
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:16,100
but I also know that it has a very strong
ideological bias at the moment that's

1630
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:16,934
getting worse.

1631
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:21,110
And so I don't feel the same way
about privileging the New York Times.

1632
01:44:21,111 --> 01:44:25,130
I think this is something else that
I want to talk about. There are no

1633
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:32,200
authoritative sources that we can use
as baseline at the moment and it's a

1634
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:37,361
little bit like having a
dollar denominated fund at
a point when the dollar is

1635
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:40,670
falling or rising rapidly
relative to everything else.

1636
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:44,600
If you are referencing yourself,
like Wikipedia says,

1637
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:48,650
we accept authoritative sources and then
there's some activists that gets into

1638
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:53,330
one of the sources that they consider
authoritative and then Wikipedia says,

1639
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:57,050
okay, well we have to print this because
it occurred in an authoritative source.

1640
01:44:57,290 --> 01:45:01,400
That's why the danger of letting
the Sarah Johns of the world in,

1641
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,140
in their activist role,
um,

1642
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:07,200
is because we now don't know
what an authoritative sources.

1643
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:11,300
I would say that there are
no authoritative sources
of an institutional nature

1644
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:14,330
at the moment because all of
the institutions are scrambling.

1645
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:18,530
And quite frankly, this is the one
thing that keeps me up at night.

1646
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:23,560
And the whole IDW concept was an answer
to the question from where will we

1647
01:45:23,661 --> 01:45:25,760
reboot when this madness is over?

1648
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:30,320
Like it's not going to be from,
um,

1649
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:35,600
departments in universities that have
been taken over by activism or news.

1650
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,440
Oregon's or political parties.
It's going to be from individuals.

1651
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:42,830
And I think that the thing that is
most authoritative right now are the

1652
01:45:42,831 --> 01:45:45,980
individuals with a lot of surface
area who are pretty trustworthy.

1653
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:48,410
Do you think there's a cutoff point,
uh,

1654
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:51,920
for the individuals who
the good guys inside?

1655
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:55,310
I'm not just talking about the average
person right now for the people that are

1656
01:45:55,311 --> 01:45:56,180
inside that get it,

1657
01:45:56,181 --> 01:46:00,260
but that are cowards right now and maybe
for good reasons that a coward better

1658
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:02,360
that are acting cowardly. No, no, no.

1659
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,790
Or that they don't afraid for
a litany of boundaries there.

1660
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:06,620
I don't want to say Karen,
I'm just going to push,

1661
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,960
but you know I'm a little more
frustrated with these people because they

1662
01:46:08,961 --> 01:46:10,120
privately come up.

1663
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,870
But you know what the thing is is that
how many nights do I wake up in a cold

1664
01:46:14,871 --> 01:46:19,740
sweat? Like, oh no, what's going
on at, you know, it's a, it's a,

1665
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:24,290
so when they come for you,
yeah. And there, you know, it's,

1666
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,500
it's merciless and its life destroying.

1667
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:30,920
So I don't think these people are cowards
take on the level of risk that you can

1668
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:32,060
afford to take on.

1669
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:36,620
If you've got two really young kids at
home and you're just getting by on a gig

1670
01:46:36,621 --> 01:46:39,080
economy thing,
don't do it.

1671
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:42,500
Don't stay at some level.

1672
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:46,160
Safe enough that you can meet your
obligations. But if you happen to have,

1673
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:49,620
as Joe Rogan says, f you
money, uh, [inaudible]

1674
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,920
that's not it. It needs to be more
than just the f you money people. No.

1675
01:46:52,921 --> 01:46:55,230
If you have a little bit of a few money,
you don't have to be,

1676
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,170
you don't have to have
eight figures of wealth.

1677
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,420
If you're in a position where you have
very few dependence and you know, you, uh,

1678
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,710
you do a go pro videos, uh, and with
extreme skateboarding on weekends,

1679
01:47:07,711 --> 01:47:10,290
you're already taking major
risks. Get in here, help us out.

1680
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,200
Don't be a pussy about it.
Right?

1681
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:14,430
I think there's a cutoff point
though for certain people,

1682
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:17,220
like once we fix things and
if you didn't get onboard,

1683
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:21,990
[inaudible] are two more
Qurans private truths,

1684
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:22,980
public lies.

1685
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:28,170
Because the idea is you have some number
of people who are willing to go first

1686
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:31,500
and then you have some people who are
willing to take on slightly less risk,

1687
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:33,150
but they're really right in behind you.

1688
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:38,160
But the thing is is that we need
more people evaluate your risk.

1689
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:42,810
If you can afford to join us, join
us. That's the point. But look,

1690
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:45,210
there are people who,
there are people who are being cowardly.

1691
01:47:45,211 --> 01:47:47,610
They have all the advantages in
the world and they won't step up.

1692
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:50,820
Those are the ones that I'm frustrated
with. Not The average person. Yeah.

1693
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:54,360
But I don't want to attack. And eyes are,
are people who are saying like, you know,

1694
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:58,320
you know, but when I, if I lose my
job, how do I provide for my children?

1695
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,393
We don't understand yet,

1696
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:01,810
of course. And I'm not talking about
those people. You know, when, when, uh,

1697
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:02,331
there was a,

1698
01:48:02,331 --> 01:48:05,810
there was a dinner we got into where
it got pretty heated because there is a

1699
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:10,700
certain set of very wealthy Hollywood
people that are down with what we're doing

1700
01:48:10,701 --> 01:48:14,000
and they won't do it publicly. And
it's like, and I was the one that was,

1701
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:18,720
it's, it's, it's what Morpheus says to
neo. He says, I'm not gonna lie to you.

1702
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:23,130
Everyone who has ever faced an agent,
you know, uh, has met their end. Um,

1703
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:26,220
but sooner or later somebody is going
to have to and when it's time you'll be

1704
01:48:26,221 --> 01:48:26,941
able to,
okay.

1705
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:31,941
Well you have people who are going to
try to fight the agents first and the

1706
01:48:31,951 --> 01:48:36,951
least you can do is don't undermine the
people who are taking the risk in order

1707
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:42,630
to sell them out to feed them to the
crowd. Right. So don't be cipher. Right.

1708
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:45,240
Cause you think it gives you a little
more time or something. Right. But,

1709
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:47,010
but in general,
um,

1710
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:51,090
if you don't have a lot of obligations
and you've got a little bit of change in

1711
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:53,880
your pocket and you don't need that
much, get in here and help. Yeah.

1712
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,550
Uh, David, if you ever had
to have tosh 0.0 on the show,

1713
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:00,550
seems like a guy who benefits from free
speech. I don't think we have tried.

1714
01:49:00,551 --> 01:49:03,490
I will look into that. Um, oh, I like,

1715
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,690
I like this one for you because this is a
very Jordan Peterson question. Uh, Eric,

1716
01:49:07,691 --> 01:49:11,470
I have a three month old.
How do you raise a responsible,

1717
01:49:11,471 --> 01:49:16,471
critical thinking son in this
polarized postmodern world of bananas?

1718
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:23,080
Well, first of all, do something like
Peter's give, give me some hand motions.

1719
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:27,670
Little of this. No, Jordan, Jordan
on me. All right, fine. Um, you know,

1720
01:49:27,671 --> 01:49:32,040
I kept my son off of social media,
just introduced him on my channel. Uh,

1721
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:36,670
and Zev is just opened his own his
own channel. So check that out. Um,

1722
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:41,700
the thing I did was I took my children
as seriously as they deserved to be taken

1723
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,180
as soon as they were ready.

1724
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:52,020
And I was astounded really at how
quickly a smart child's mind comes online

1725
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:59,580
ready to deal with things. And I
think I remember when was sandy hook,

1726
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:05,200
it's over two years ago now.
It's maybe it was, there was,

1727
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:06,280
it was a school shooting.

1728
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:10,090
And I talked to the children about
risk extensively and they weren't that

1729
01:50:10,091 --> 01:50:14,410
disturbed because they had an intrinsic
sense that the odds of anything

1730
01:50:14,411 --> 01:50:18,190
happening in their school were quite low,
but that there is no guarantee.

1731
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,570
And you know,

1732
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:24,430
if I think back on all of the crazy
conversations I had with my two children,

1733
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,170
a daughter and a son,
uh,

1734
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,970
be prepared that it's not just children.
Say The darndest thing.

1735
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:35,890
Children are ready for much
more adult interaction, uh,

1736
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:39,430
while still being they're
adorable child like cells.

1737
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:42,730
And don't be afraid if you find yourself,

1738
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:44,163
uh,

1739
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:45,491
in a,

1740
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:48,880
in a conversation that you can't believe
you're having with a three or a four

1741
01:50:48,881 --> 01:50:52,780
year old. Both of those happened with
my children. I remember when I was away,

1742
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,300
um,
I had,

1743
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:00,520
I taught myself to play the Vivaldi Largo
Movement from a guitar concerto and my

1744
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:03,280
daughter said, I miss you Daddy.
And she said, listen to this.

1745
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:07,420
And she played it on violin. So I knew
she wasn't getting it from sheet music.

1746
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:12,220
And I just thought like, okay, what
you're F you're five [inaudible] six.

1747
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:16,630
I don't know. I don't remember what age
your children are going to astound you.

1748
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:19,810
Take it seriously and don't
treat it as if it's adorable.

1749
01:51:19,811 --> 01:51:22,720
Treat it as if it's serious.
Well said.

1750
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:29,160
There's a lot of Peterson
style questions here.

1751
01:51:29,161 --> 01:51:32,040
You want to keep going on that
whatever you want. All right. Uh,

1752
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:33,780
if what Peterson has said is true,

1753
01:51:33,781 --> 01:51:38,180
that we're living in a 13 year old girls
reality and most of the people who want

1754
01:51:38,181 --> 01:51:41,760
a d platform,
the ITW are possibly emotionally stuck.

1755
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:45,030
Is attacking their ideas
directly effective at all?

1756
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:49,020
Or is there any value in starting an
emotional discussion that goes on a little

1757
01:51:49,021 --> 01:51:49,770
bit more from there?
Yeah,

1758
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:52,620
well it's, we'll go from
that. I think that, um,

1759
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:56,670
this is something I said at the end
of our performance in New York, uh,

1760
01:51:56,780 --> 01:52:01,080
on that panel. Um, if you can,

1761
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:04,440
if you're in a position to love
your opponent out of their cult,

1762
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:10,260
do that. You don't have to always
return costs and assume, you know,

1763
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:13,680
very often you're dealing with frightened
and scared people who don't realize

1764
01:52:13,681 --> 01:52:16,740
that they're much more resilient
than they think. They're stronger.

1765
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:18,490
The world isn't as hostile.

1766
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:23,310
People form completely insane ideas
about what they're up against.

1767
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:26,670
And you know, I remember, um,

1768
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:33,760
my, my, my defacto uncle,
uh, Mike Brown, um,

1769
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:38,230
who used to invite us onto, onto his,
his island up in Washington state,

1770
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:43,390
um, I think it was a republican and
a positive. He was like the kindest,

1771
01:52:43,391 --> 01:52:47,450
most generous person. Uh, I could imagine.

1772
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:51,410
And people who came to the island who
had very strong left of center ideas that

1773
01:52:51,411 --> 01:52:55,100
had this idea that somehow republicans,
we're all selfish.

1774
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:59,660
I can't tell you how common that
belief and I'd have to point out,

1775
01:52:59,661 --> 01:53:03,350
you realize that your host is providing
everything for you and it's just the

1776
01:53:03,351 --> 01:53:07,110
kindest best person who give
you the shirt off his back. Uh,

1777
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:10,730
is voting in a way that you would think
of is selfish because he wanted low

1778
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:14,300
taxes and he believed that this was the
best way to help people out of poverty

1779
01:53:14,301 --> 01:53:18,380
is to give them self reliance. Try. Yeah.

1780
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:21,600
I really believe that in some sense.
Um,

1781
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:26,990
set an example and try to show people
that who they think they're dealing with

1782
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:29,900
isn't too, they're dealing with. Um,

1783
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,090
have you guys discussed the possibility
of this movement becoming a third

1784
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:37,820
political party?
Is that actually even possible?

1785
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,430
Not only sort of hit on this button
needs to be a third political party?

1786
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:42,290
I think it should infect both political.

1787
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:46,070
I think our system of selective pressures
determined by the constitution more or

1788
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:47,330
less selects for two parties,

1789
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:50,300
whether it's Democrats or Republicans
or the weeks come back, doesn't matter.

1790
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:53,180
The key thing is that we,

1791
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:58,070
we on the left need you on the right to
be responsible and you need to know you

1792
01:53:58,071 --> 01:53:59,570
have a party on the other side.

1793
01:53:59,571 --> 01:54:04,160
And I think that was the magic where Ben
Shapiro after the joint appearance came

1794
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:05,960
to me and he said, you know, Eric,

1795
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:10,420
the thing that I fight on
the left is these claims that
the market or society is,

1796
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,200
is all off.
And he says,

1797
01:54:12,201 --> 01:54:16,520
when you come in with a highly specific
complaint about some aspect of the

1798
01:54:16,521 --> 01:54:19,160
market or, or an impression or
something like this, he says,

1799
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:23,240
I'm absolutely willing to
listen. And I thought, wow. Um,

1800
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:28,280
this is how we do it,
is that we sh the left takes out,

1801
01:54:28,281 --> 01:54:31,010
it's garbage on the extreme left.
The right takes should take out.

1802
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:35,120
It's garbage on the extreme right.
And you'll start to see,

1803
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,400
I think Ben,
for example,

1804
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:42,200
engages in a certain amount of live
baiting that he'd love to stop.

1805
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:47,540
And it's really targeted on the extreme.
It's not targeted on the center.

1806
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:49,400
And I think he would come in.
So

1807
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,030
the center and left and right,

1808
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:56,810
it needs to go fight its own wings
that are polarizing everything.

1809
01:54:57,050 --> 01:55:00,980
But the IDW doesn't live in one
party and it's not a separate party.

1810
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:05,540
What it is is an agreement about what
constitutes conversation and what

1811
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:07,250
constitutes a legitimate argument.

1812
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:11,300
And part of the rap against us is that
we're snowflakes and that we don't want

1813
01:55:11,301 --> 01:55:13,820
to talk to people who think things
that are very different from us.

1814
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:15,470
In a weird way,

1815
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,460
I think we don't want to talk to people
who have really novel ideas about what

1816
01:55:19,461 --> 01:55:23,000
constitutes an argument because we have
a clear idea of what constitutes and

1817
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:27,560
argument and everybody's willing to
submit. Okay, you got the better of me.

1818
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:27,801
You know,

1819
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:30,620
I remember a particular moment where
Sam Harris got the better of me and my

1820
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:35,150
first podcast with them.
Um, the key thing that,

1821
01:55:35,151 --> 01:55:38,750
that we don't like is when you
just make up your own logic,

1822
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:42,110
you're not entitled to your own logic
and you're probably not entitled to your

1823
01:55:42,111 --> 01:55:45,440
own facts. And you're not entitled, uh,

1824
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:48,810
to just go off on your own.

1825
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:53,400
Epistemically inconsistent tangent to
get all the goodies. Once you meet some,

1826
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:55,700
some of these criteria,
I think we'll talk to Moralis.

1827
01:55:56,190 --> 01:56:01,190
Anybody who's got a decent heart and a
desire to figure out what would generally

1828
01:56:01,681 --> 01:56:04,920
be seen as best for society, but it should
be, have a both the left and a right.

1829
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:07,260
I'm not interested in it
becoming a third party.

1830
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,880
I like that you call it an agreement.

1831
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:12,150
I don't think I've ever heard you say
that before. I like that. Um, all right.

1832
01:56:12,151 --> 01:56:14,160
So we're going to take a
couple more on Reuben select.

1833
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:18,810
It's patrion.com/ruben report and then
we're going to keep drinking whiskey.

1834
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:19,711
Uh,
Eric,

1835
01:56:19,711 --> 01:56:24,090
what do you make of the metaphysical
implications of the Big Bang?

1836
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:30,480
I'm not a lot. Well, give me
one more sentence on that. Sure.

1837
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,750
Uh,
when you solve Einstein's equations,

1838
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,930
there are two essential
singularities that you encounter.

1839
01:56:36,931 --> 01:56:41,400
One is the black hole singularity, um,
that you associate with a collapsing star.

1840
01:56:41,401 --> 01:56:43,410
And the other one is the Big Bang,
uh,

1841
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:47,160
initial singularity that you associate
with the beginning of the universe.

1842
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:51,570
And really in some sense what they tell
us as mathematicians and now I'm going

1843
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:52,890
to take some guff for saying this,

1844
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:57,330
but is that Einstein's equations aren't
the final aren't the end of the story

1845
01:56:57,331 --> 01:57:01,110
because they probably wouldn't
have these defects if you will.

1846
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,890
And so there's the big bang that occurs
with respect to, you know, the, the,

1847
01:57:05,891 --> 01:57:07,860
the moment of last scattering or what,

1848
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:11,160
however you want to think
about what we can observe. Um,

1849
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,920
and then there's the initial singularity,

1850
01:57:13,921 --> 01:57:18,090
which has to do with the Einstein
equations. And in general,

1851
01:57:18,091 --> 01:57:22,980
you don't want to make
metaphysical inferences around
the points of your model,

1852
01:57:22,981 --> 01:57:27,660
which are least reliable. And so it just
for the simple 10 on this one, so if the,

1853
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:31,110
so the argument would be that if it was,
if these were perfect theories,

1854
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:36,150
that the big bang and basically wormholes
wouldn't, wouldn't exist. Our molds but,

1855
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,440
but, but like black holes,
courts, chills, singularities yes.

1856
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,840
That's what the argument is that,

1857
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:46,180
that those are the signs that
you're not done yet. Got.

1858
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:51,090
And so the problem is some people become
very attached to the idea that they

1859
01:57:51,091 --> 01:57:54,450
should be investigating those
for metaphysical implications.

1860
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:58,650
But likely all your work is going to be
wiped out when a better set of equations

1861
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:02,280
becomes available if you're trying to
make metaphysical meaning out of that.

1862
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,600
So it's super tempting.

1863
01:58:03,601 --> 01:58:07,830
And the reason to do it would be that
you wanted to push the equations so hard

1864
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:11,040
that they broke so you could find the
true ones. That doesn't bother me at all,

1865
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:16,220
but don't spend too much time thinking
about something in a system pushed beyond

1866
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:20,490
its domain of reliability. All
right, here we go. Two more.

1867
01:58:20,491 --> 01:58:23,940
Cause we got some stuff to do
tonight. Uh, I'm just a regular dude.

1868
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:26,910
Other than daily exercise
of basic critical thinking.

1869
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:31,911
What is the role of regular dudes like
me improving the quality of sense making

1870
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:35,970
a midst the corrupted institutions
you've been discussing the regular guy,

1871
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:40,020
not that fuck you money guy. First of all,
I don't, I've never met a regular dude.

1872
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:44,260
My belief that everybody has something
extraordinary in them. So first of all,

1873
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:47,800
stop, stop claiming you're just a regular
dude unless it's your false modesty.

1874
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:50,740
And, um, and then the question is,

1875
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:54,170
if you're already here asking
these questions and you're a PA,

1876
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:57,890
a patron of the Rubin report,
uh,

1877
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:02,400
think about yourself as already in a
tiny minority and take on some goddamn

1878
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:06,640
responsibility for where you want to steer
this thing and, uh, and ask for help.

1879
01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:10,870
If you, you know, pick up an
order and start rowing man.

1880
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,890
All right, one more. Um, this
is, I'm going to go to super
chat. This is Tim pulled.

1881
01:59:14,891 --> 01:59:16,930
Do you know Tim, by the
way? I've never met him,

1882
01:59:16,931 --> 01:59:19,870
although I think he's reached out to
me. Yeah. So Tim is doing great work.

1883
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:24,580
He's actually an honest journalists on
the graph. He's new, he's on the ground,

1884
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:27,280
like in the fricking dead center of
the graph. And from what I understand,

1885
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:32,140
Tim pools, reactionary journalists, um,

1886
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:37,320
idiots. I can hear laughter. Yeah, yeah.

1887
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:41,440
Well we know what part we're using
as the promo now. Um, Tim Pool,

1888
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:45,640
the half Korean white supremacist.
It's all so stupid. But, um,

1889
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:48,160
Tim and also by the way, I think
for the record, if I'm not mistaken,

1890
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:51,220
some of the connections that they
actually had to Tim don't even exist and a

1891
01:59:51,221 --> 01:59:53,980
bunch of other stuff. Okay.
Uh, Tim said and super chat.

1892
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:56,050
They know they're lying about our views.

1893
01:59:56,051 --> 01:59:59,830
This is the death rattle
of an archaic media system.

1894
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,490
We didn't really talk about
their bad intentions enough.

1895
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,060
I think perhaps because I think
you, you always, and I try to,

1896
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:08,860
I try not to judge people's intentions.

1897
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:11,890
He's going right to their intentions here.
They know they're lying.

1898
02:00:11,891 --> 02:00:12,724
They know what they are,

1899
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:15,770
they know they're lying and they think
that they're doing it in the service of

1900
02:00:15,771 --> 02:00:17,510
something beautiful.
Yeah.

1901
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:22,540
Well then the problem is just the
reason I'm left off of this graph with,

1902
02:00:23,211 --> 02:00:26,030
uh,
this white supremacist Korean Tim Pool.

1903
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:29,280
And again, I'm super sorry about that.
I know that if they would've asked,

1904
02:00:29,281 --> 02:00:32,570
I wouldn't know. Look, I'm trying to clue
for now your brother, everybody. I was,

1905
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:36,570
I was too busy trying to organize
Nuremberg style rally. Um,

1906
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:39,000
the reason that they leave us off

1907
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:44,210
is because they can't handle the fact
that you have like a Bernie supporter

1908
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:49,250
who's never voted Republican in
the supposedly reaction. I mean,

1909
02:00:50,490 --> 02:00:55,410
they're going after Tim pool like children
and they're trying to find something

1910
02:00:55,411 --> 02:00:58,740
that sticks all right? Doesn't
seem to work extreme, right?
Reactionary this, that,

1911
02:00:58,741 --> 02:01:00,140
and yet,
um,

1912
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:05,210
let them empty their revolver because
they don't really have many bullets left.

1913
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:10,890
Um, yes, they don't, they
know that they're lying,

1914
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:15,630
but they think they're lying
in the service of good. And

1915
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:23,150
I might lie in the service of good if
the good were extreme enough and the lie,

1916
02:01:23,281 --> 02:01:27,960
we're small enough so don't get upset
with somebody just because they're lying

1917
02:01:27,961 --> 02:01:31,230
in the service of put. Of course, they
know they're lying. And of course, uh,

1918
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:34,710
they think they're doing it in the
service of good. But the point is,

1919
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:40,010
we're going to have to live
with each other as a nation and

1920
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,420
we're going to have to love each other.

1921
02:01:41,421 --> 02:01:44,840
And there are a lot of people with
this mimetic complex in their mind.

1922
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:47,270
This is why I went and I talked to Kanye.

1923
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:52,980
I thought what Kanye was going to do
was d trumpified Manga with people who

1924
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:58,580
wanted their towns in Ohio and western
Pennsylvania to start working again.

1925
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:01,370
People who, uh, you know,

1926
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:04,790
we're drinking themselves silly feeling
that they were part of the American

1927
02:02:04,791 --> 02:02:06,170
dream and got sidelined.

1928
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,390
We are going to have to find common cause
and it's just not that hard, you know,

1929
02:02:11,391 --> 02:02:15,680
it's just not that hard to have a friend
who's Hugh is different than yours is

1930
02:02:15,681 --> 02:02:17,060
not that hard to have a friend.

1931
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:20,570
You and I have serious political
differences at this point.

1932
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:25,790
It just doesn't cause me
to want to silence you.

1933
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:27,120
And so my claim is,

1934
02:02:27,121 --> 02:02:30,590
is that even though they're lying and
even though they know they're lie,

1935
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:37,480
you've got to experiment with love and
forgiveness to the best of your ability.

1936
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:40,940
And I can't tell you
that I never lash out.

1937
02:02:40,941 --> 02:02:44,420
I think I lashed out a little bit at
Rebecca Lewis because she was lying.

1938
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:49,421
She said it will never not be funny
that the entire intellectual dark web is

1939
02:02:50,001 --> 02:02:52,580
only located on Youtube.
Oh really?

1940
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:55,760
So the 12 rules of life
isn't a book that exists.

1941
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:59,330
And the waking up podcast isn't
something that has no video,

1942
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:01,610
even if it's exists on youtube.

1943
02:03:01,611 --> 02:03:04,670
People listened to it off of Youtube
is it's not true that we don't have any

1944
02:03:04,671 --> 02:03:07,220
events. Of course, Rebecca
Lewis is like, she knows,

1945
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:11,720
she's like Dana and society is lie.
These people all know that they're lying,

1946
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:16,850
but they think that they're lying for
some beautiful reason to keep our country

1947
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:20,090
together, to make sure that we're
not in the hands of a tyrant,

1948
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:24,740
to make sure that every child has
a shot at a beautiful tomorrow.

1949
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,560
And I'm sorry that they're this confused,

1950
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:30,920
but have some compassion because
they don't have the compassion.

1951
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:35,870
When we hear about empathy,
okay, the onus is on us.

1952
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,000
They don't have this great empathy.

1953
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:42,110
They like I Aye so care about Trans people
that I can't care about white people.

1954
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,390
Okay,
that gives me a headache.

1955
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:49,810
You're either empathic and you care
about people in general or it's selective

1956
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:52,160
empathy and you really have
a lot of hate in your soul.

1957
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:57,260
So I set it Goddamn example
that that's my basic take,

1958
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:00,140
which is you've got to love
the people who are lying,

1959
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:02,660
thinking that they're
advancing the world's cause,

1960
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,580
and you have to love
them out of their cult.

1961
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:09,080
And if we're not willing to take that on,
then I don't know what we're doing.

1962
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:13,250
But I can't always make this,
this high bar that I'm setting for myself.

1963
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:17,420
I will fail. I would lash out at somebody,
but have a forgiveness narrative.

1964
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:20,960
There is in general, no redemptive
redemption narrative on the left.

1965
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:23,600
That's why it's not even a religion.
People say it's a cult.

1966
02:04:23,601 --> 02:04:26,510
It's religion without a redemption
narrative. There's nothing.

1967
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:30,110
If what you're really excited
about is sticking it to the man,

1968
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:34,280
whoever the man is,
you're not fundamentally a good person.

1969
02:04:34,281 --> 02:04:37,980
You're a person who's working
through your own personal. And

1970
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,840
so my claim is,
is that

1971
02:04:41,370 --> 02:04:46,370
love the people who are aligning against
you and figure out what an incredible

1972
02:04:46,951 --> 02:04:51,630
power, incredibly powerful weapon that
is. Because at the end of the day,

1973
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:53,880
after you knock them
senseless to the pavement,

1974
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:57,510
you better offer them a hand up
and say, look, it wasn't personal.

1975
02:04:57,511 --> 02:05:00,750
It's just you were, you were
threatening our system and you know,

1976
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:03,870
I felt like I couldn't communicate to
you while you were still in the cult.

1977
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:04,973
That's where I am.

1978
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:09,760
I'm joining you on that adventure,
my friend the Ohio. There you go.

1979
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:14,230
All right guys. That's it.
Remember October, fifth
wise guys in Salt Lake City.

1980
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:19,000
We've got your links. You do have
a, uh, a custom name, by the way,

1981
02:05:19,001 --> 02:05:22,450
for your youtube channel. I'm going
to, it's gone. It was here before.

1982
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:26,420
It's up.
It's up top guy.

1983
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:29,030
It's Eric r Weinstein on Instagram.

1984
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:32,330
And if you just search Eric
Weinstein on Youtube, it's on there.

1985
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:36,650
Dave rubin.com/events for a bunch of more
standup stuff that I'm doing and we're

1986
02:05:36,651 --> 02:05:39,760
going to Europe with Peterson and a
whole bunch of other stuff. And, uh,

1987
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:41,420
patrion.com/ruben report,

1988
02:05:41,421 --> 02:05:44,360
we're trying to get our Reuben
select members to 5,000 people.

1989
02:05:44,361 --> 02:05:46,450
We've got a great community
growing over there. Uh,

1990
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,450
you want to get dinners on something?

1991
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,860
Sounds like a plan. All
right. That's it. See Ya.
