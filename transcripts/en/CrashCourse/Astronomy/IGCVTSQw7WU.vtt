00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.980
Hey folks, Phil Plait here, and for the past
few episodes, I’ve been going over what

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.700
we know about the structure, history, and
evolution of the Universe, and how we know it.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
Now it’s time to put that into action. We
can use this knowledge of physics, math, and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.500
astronomy to figure out what the Universe
was like in the past, going all the way back

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.280
to literally the first moment after it was
born.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.290
So, here you go: a brief history of the Universe:

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.790
In the beginning there was nothing. Then there
was everything.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.490
Oh, you want more?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.159
It may seem a little weird to suppose that
we can understand how the Universe got its

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.999
start. But it’s much like any other field
of science: We have clues, observations, based

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.600
on what we see going on now. Knowing the rules
of physics we can then run the clock backwards

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.510
and see what things were like farther and
farther into the past.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.410
For example, as I’ve talked about in the
past couple of episodes, the Universe is expanding.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.280
That means in the past it was denser, more
crowded, and hotter. At some point it was

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.909
hotter than the surface of a star, hotter
than the core of a star, hotter than the heart

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.920
of a supernova. And as we push the timer back
even farther we find temperatures and densities

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.479
that make a supernova look chilly and positively
rarefied.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.839
A lot of what we know about the early Universe
comes from experiments done in giant particle

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.180
colliders. When the cosmos was very young
and very hot, particles were whizzing around

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.450
at high speeds and slamming into each other,
creating other subatomic particles in the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.149
process. That’s exactly what colliders do!
The higher energy we can give our colliders,

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.369
the faster we can whack particles together,
and the earlier phase of the Universe we can

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.789
investigate. That’s one of the main reasons
why we keep making ‘em bigger and more powerful,

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.640
to test our ideas of what the young cosmos
was like.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.340
So let’s wind the clock back. Looking around
us, peering into the Universe both near and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.979
far, what can we say about the beginning of
everything?

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.890
When the Universe got its start, it was unfathomably
hot and dense. It was totally different then

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.649
than it is today, because when you pump more
energy into something, the way it behaves,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.280
even its fundamental physical nature, changes.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.970
If you take a snowball and heat it up, it’ll
melt. We call that a phase change, or a change

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.280
of state. Heat it more and it vaporizes, changing
into a gas. It’s still water, still composed

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.730
of water molecules, but it looks and acts
pretty differently, right?

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.890
When you heat something up what you’re doing
is giving it more energy. In a solid this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.670
means the atoms wiggle around more and more
until they break free of their restrictive

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.300
bonds with each other, and the solid melts.
The atoms are still bound by other forces,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.780
but if you heat them more they break free
of those, too, and the liquid becomes a gas.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.500
Heat them more, give them more energy, and
the atoms whiz around faster and faster. Heat

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.340
them to millions or billions of degrees, and
the atoms themselves fall apart. They collide

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.380
so violently they can overcome the hugely
strong forces holding their nuclei together,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.540
and you get a soup of subatomic particles;
electrons, neutrons, and protons.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.840
Heat them more and even protons and neutrons
will collide hard enough to shatter into their

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.900
constituent subatomic particles, which are
called quarks. And as far as we know, quarks

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.150
and electrons are basic particles, so they
can’t be subdivided any more.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.100
Maybe you can see where I’m going here.
As we wind the clock backwards, the Universe

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.480
gets denser and hotter. At some point in the
past it was so hot that atoms wouldn’t have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.510
been able to hold on to their electrons. A
little farther back and it was so hot that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.500
nuclei couldn’t stay together, and the Universe
was a small, ultra dense ball of energy mixed

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.730
with neutrons, protons, and electrons.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.530
Go a wee bit farther back and even that changes.
Neutrons and protons couldn’t form, because

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.650
the instant they did they’d whack into each
other hard enough to fall apart. The Universe

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.810
was a sea of electrons and quarks.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.430
The cosmos was a bizarre, unfamiliar place
back then. Even the basic forces we see today

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.840
— gravity, electromagnetism, and the two
nuclear forces responsible for holding atomic

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.590
nuclei together as well as letting them disintegrate
in radioactive decay — were all squeezed

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.340
together into one unified super force.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.930
Like the snowball melting and vaporizing,
each of these moments in the history of the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.290
Universe was like a phase change. The very
nature of reality was changing, its laws and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.240
behavior different.
At some point, we go so far back, so close

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.190
to that first moment in time, that our laws
of physics… well, they don’t break down

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.670
so much as say, “Here Be Dragons.” We
just don’t understand the rules well enough

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.530
to be able to say anything about that first
razor thin slice of time.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.600
How far back are we talking here? If we call
the instant of the Big Bang “time zero,”

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.980
then our physics cannot describe what happens
in the first 10-43 seconds.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.100
Now let me just say, only semi-sarcastically,
that that’s not so bad. The Universe is

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.960
13.82 billion years old, so being able to
go back to that very first one-ten-millionth

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.700
of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
of a second is a massive triumph of physics!

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.140
What happened after that fraction of a second
is better understood. The Universe expanded

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.180
and cooled, the four forces went their separate
ways, and the first basic subatomic particles were

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.960
able to hold themselves together. This all happened
in the very first second of the Universe’s existence.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.080
Three minutes later — yes, three minutes
— the Universe cooled enough that these

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.360
subatomic particles could start to stick together.
For the next 17 minutes, the Universe did

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.450
something remarkable: it made atoms.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.760
It was still ridiculously hot, like the core
of a star, but it’s at those temperatures

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.590
that nuclear fusion can occur. For a few minutes
the particles smashed together, forming deuterium,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.250
an isotope of hydrogen, helium, and just a
smattering of lithium. A little bit of beryllium

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.000
was made as well, but it was radioactive,
and rapidly decayed into lithium.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.080
Then, at T+20 minutes, the Universe cooled
enough that fusion stopped. When it did, there

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.840
was three times as much hydrogen as helium
in the Universe. This primordial ratio is

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.840
still pretty much true today. When we measure
the Sun’s elemental abundance, we see it’s

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.130
roughly 75% hydrogen, 25% helium.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.139
At this point the Universe is still hotter
than a star’s surface, but it’s also still

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.250
expanding and cooling. As it does, structures
start to form as the gravity of matter can

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.480
overcome the tremendous heat. These will become
the galaxies we see today. This is important

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.710
and a bit weird, so I’ll get back to it
in a minute.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.760
The next big event happened when the Universe
was at the ripe old age of about 380,000 years.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.070
Up to this point, electrons couldn’t bond
with the atomic nuclei zipping around; every

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.630
time they did it was so hot that random photons
would blow them off again. The Universe was ionized.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.270
But then, after 380 millennia, it had cooled
enough that electrons could combine with protons

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.610
and helium nuclei, becoming stable neutral
atoms for the very first time. We call this

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.540
moment “recombination.”

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.510
This was an important event! Free electrons
are really really good at absorbing photons,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.300
absorbing light. When the Universe was still
ionized, prior to recombination, it was opaque.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.520
A photon couldn’t get very far before an
electron sucked it up.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.880
But after recombination, the photons were
free to fly. The Universe became transparent!

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.380
Why is this important?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.120
Because the light emitted at this time is
what we see as the cosmic microwave background

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.710
today! Those neutral atoms emitted light;
they were as hot as a red dwarf star. Those

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.710
photons have been traveling ever since, fighting
the expansion of the Universe, redshifting

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.220
into the microwave part of the spectrum, and
seen today all over the sky. That background

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:30.620
glow predicted by the Big Bang model has been
on its journey to Earth for almost 13.8 billion years!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.700
This light is incredibly important, because
it tells us what the Universe was like

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.120
not long after it formed.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.030
For example, that light looks almost exactly
the same everywhere you look in the sky. It

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.919
looks “smooth.” That tells us that matter
was very evenly distributed everywhere in

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.669
the Universe at that time, and also that all
the matter had the same temperature. If there

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:54.850
had been one spot that was denser, lumpier,
then it would have been hotter, and we’d

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.639
see that in the background radiation as a
patch of bluer light.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.430
That’s pretty weird. When you look at the
background radiation from opposite sides of

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.710
the sky, you’re seeing it coming from opposite
ends of the universe! Even back then, those

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.000
regions of the Universe were separated by
vast distances, and had plenty of time to

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.620
go their separate ways, change in different ways.
They should look pretty different. But they don’t.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.960
As telescopes got better, very tiny variations
in the light were found. But they were really

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.290
teeny, only a factor of 1 in 100,000. In other
words, one part of the sky may look like it

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:35.740
has a temperature of 2.72500 Kelvins, but
another spot is at 2.752501.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.550
The Universe had lumps, but they were far,
far smaller than expected. Something must

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.910
have happened in the Universe to force it
to be this smooth even hundreds of thousands

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.420
of years after the Big Bang.

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:50.940
This led theoretical physicist Alan Guth to
propose a dramatic addition to the Big Bang

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:56.949
model: At some point in the very early Universe,
the expansion suddenly accelerated vastly.

00:08:56.949 --> 00:09:02.139
For the tiniest fraction of a second, space
inflated hugely, far faster than the normal

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:07.149
expansion, increasing in size by something
like a hundred trillion trillion times!

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:11.629
We call this super-expansion “inflation.”
It sounds a little arbitrary, but it actually

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:16.259
has quite a bit of physical foundation now;
in a sense it’s like one of the phase changes

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:20.389
of the Universe that happened in that first
fraction of second dumped huge amounts of

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:24.829
energy into the fabric of space-time, causing
it to swell enormously.

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:29.079
Inflation explains why the Universe was so
smooth at the time of recombination: Space

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:33.939
expanded so rapidly that any lumps in it were
smoothed out, like pulling on a bedsheet to

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.529
flatten out the wrinkles.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:39.709
Inflation explains several other problems
in cosmology as well, and although the details

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:44.909
are still being hammered out, the basic idea
is almost – pardon the expression – universally

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:46.600
agreed upon by astronomers.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.019
The fluctuations we see in the background
glow now were actually incredibly small perturbations

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:57.299
in the fabric of space at the time of inflation,
which got stretched by inflation to macroscopic

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.000
size. These denser spots were seeds, eventually
growing even more, their gravity attracting

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.040
flows of dark matter.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.779
Normal matter collected there too, condensing,
eventually forming the first stars about 400

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:14.779
million years after the Big Bang. Eventually,
those teeny little bumps from the beginning

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:19.879
of the Universe became galaxies and clusters
of galaxies, now tens of billions of light

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:24.660
years away. Our own galaxy, our own piece
of the Universe, started the same way, as

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.869
a quantum fluctuation in space 13.8 billion
years ago.

00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:31.720
Now look at us. How’s that for an origin
story?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.920
There are still many unanswered questions
in our understanding of cosmology. What’s

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.540
dark energy? What was the role of dark matter
in the early Universe? Where did the Universe

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.119
come from in the first place? Are there more
universes out there? Hidden away where we

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:50.029
can’t see them? If time and space started
in the Big Bang, does it even make sense to

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:54.319
ask what came before it, or is that like asking
what’s north of the north pole?

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:58.850
We don’t know the answers to these questions,
and trust me, there are thousands more just

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.720
like them. But here’s the fun part: we might
yet be able to answer them! After all, even

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.269
asking if the Universe had a beginning, let
alone what happened between then and now,

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:14.049
was nuts just a century or two ago. Now we
have a decent handle on it, and our grip is

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.980
getting better all the time.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:21.960
Science! Asking – and answering – the
biggest questions of them all. I love this stuff.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.619
Today you learned that the timeline of the
Universe’s history can be mapped using modern

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:30.199
day physics and astronomical observations.
It started with a Big Bang, when the Universe

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:34.949
was incredibly dense and hot. It expanded
and cooled, going through multiple stages

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:39.269
where different kinds of matter could form.
It underwent a phenomenally rapid moment of

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:44.490
expansion called inflation which smoothed
out much of the lumpiness in the matter. Normal

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.920
matter formed atoms between 3 and 20 minutes
after the bang, and the lumps left over from

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.579
inflation formed the galaxies and larger structures
we see today.
