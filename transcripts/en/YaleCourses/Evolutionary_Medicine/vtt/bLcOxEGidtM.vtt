00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.270
The final area.

2
00:00:02.271 --> 00:00:07.271
We're going to discuss the concerns reproduction has to do with the difficulties

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.970
that a shift in our posture brought for childbirth.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.700
Human childbirth is extremely difficult because the pelvis has been modified for

5
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:19.750
upright by Peter Walking.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.120
Maternal mortality has only recently declined in developed countries and it

7
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:28.130
remains high in undeveloped countries,

8
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:32.570
so there is a real cost to childbirth is dangerous from others.

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.170
The female pelvis constraints bur brain size at birth,

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.780
and it also means that in order to get through the birth canal,

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.250
the infant head must rotate and it can exit directly in chimpanzees.

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.120
Most human infants are therefore born facing backwards,

13
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.060
whereas in other primates they are born facing forward.

14
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.660
This means that the mother is not in as good a position to help clear the baby's

15
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:08.020
nostrils and help it breathe when it first comes out.

16
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
So this may imply that females have had assistance during birth for a very long

17
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:19.030
time in our evolutionary history.
Now first,

18
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:22.170
let's take a look at maternal mortality.

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.310
So this is maternal deaths per 100,000 this is a log scale over here.

20
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.330
Maternal deaths from other causes are staying fairly steady,

21
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.850
but from puerperal fever,

22
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120
maternal death started to decline in the 30s and that's gone down nearly to zero

23
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.080
as a result of antibiotic use.

24
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.770
So much of the decline from poor portal fever,

25
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
which is the infection that can result in the uterus after childbirth

26
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.840
has been controlled by antibiotics,

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.560
but maternal mortality remains significant in developing countries.

28
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.490
So internal childbirth is costly.
It's a risky business.

29
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.280
The difficulty in human childbirth results both from the fact that we now walk

30
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:19.420
upright.
You can see the remodeling here of the hip,

31
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.510
which is indicated in orange,

32
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.850
and the fact that our brains have increased in size and our babies have large

33
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:28.600
heads,

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.600
so it is harder for a baby to get through the human pelvis than it is for a

35
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.300
chimpanzee offspring to get through the chimpanzee pelvis.

36
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.340
Bye.
Pete Elysium preceded the narrow birth canal.

37
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.050
We know that Sahil anthropics was probably by peatal about 7 million years ago.

38
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.280
Australopithecus was by peatal and it was small brain.

39
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.930
It was probably frugivorous.

40
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 0>The narrow birth canal in Homo habilis about 2 million years ago.</v>

42
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.613
<v 1>Now</v>

43
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.800
<v 0>if we take,</v>

44
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
if we look at the cranium of an infant in the birth canal,

45
00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:16.460
it's sketched here in gray and the diameter of the birth canal is sketched in

46
00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:17.360
light orange.

47
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.410
What we see is the infant cranium could not be any larger and still fit in the

48
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:26.570
birth canal.
It is stretching the birth canal to its limits.

49
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.820
The rotation of the infant head during birth suggested health has at birth has

50
00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:34.850
long been needed.

51
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 1>Okay,</v>

52
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.410
<v 0>so bipedalism originated in Australopithecus or earlier and the rotation of the</v>

53
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:45.220
infant head in the birth canal causes humans to be born facing backward.

54
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.740
In other primates,

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.390
the mother can actually reach down and clean the nose of the infant to help it

56
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:57.391
because it is being born facing forward so she can actually look down at it as

57
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:03.010
it is coming out of the birth canal and cleanout its nostrils.

58
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.110
Human Mothers and infants then benefit from uh,

59
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200
having a midwife or Duaner at birth who can catch the baby and clean its nose.

60
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.050
So there is evidence in our own pattern birth of our increased sociality.

61
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.370
And this could very well be done by sisters,

62
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.020
aunts or grandmothers.

63
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.460
It's notable that human brains are actually small at birth relative to their

64
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:35.311
adult size.

65
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:38.610
So they're big in the sense that they completely fill the birth canal,

66
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.630
but there's small relative to how large they're going to be in an ETL.

67
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.200
So despite pushing the limits of the birth canal,

68
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:51.201
human brains are still much smaller at birth relative to their adult size than

69
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.890
are those of other primates.

70
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.810
They continue to grow after birth more than do the brains of other primates.

71
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.500
That period of post postnatal brain growth,

72
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.420
it lasts until about age seven and it defines this developmental period we call

73
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.780
childhood that does not occur in other great apes.

74
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.400
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 0>because brain growth is essential and it requires fat.</v>

76
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.740
This is one reason why human infants contained so much fat at birth.

77
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.220
Human infants are actually is fat or fatter than BB elephant seals at birth.

78
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.450
So to summarize,
upright posture,

79
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.820
which evolved four to 7 million years ago,

80
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.420
along with rapid long distance pursuit of prey,

81
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.210
which evolved about two to 3 million years ago,

82
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.980
led to a remodeling of the pelvis,
which constrained size at birth,

83
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.190
primarily size of the cranium,
and thus of the brain.

84
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.310
<v 0>Selection to increase.
Infant size of birth is being balanced by selection,</v>

86
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.700
acting through maternal mortality in childbirth.

87
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.440
There trade offs between the health and the development of the infant and the

88
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.510
survival of the infant in the mother.

89
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.230
These morphological constraints have contributed to the evolution of the

90
00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:13.190
uniquely long human childhood during which the brain grows to adult size.
