00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.669
And now it's time for the much

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.771
heralded #HashtagWars.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.507
(cheering and applause)

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.812
Tomorrow's St. Patrick's Day, a

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.347
day dedicated to drinking and

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.283
assuming every redhead is Irish.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.753
Uh...

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.488
(laughter)

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.224
That's a photo from redditer

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.659
LilRedWoodPecker of a T-shirt

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.793
featuring Scotland's national

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.795
motto.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.230
The only problem with St. Pat's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.431
Day is by the time everyone's

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.599
drunk enough to start singing,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.734
the only Irish song they can

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.235
remember is Danny Boy, and

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.537
maybe, maybe that YouTube song

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.471
from the Batman Forever

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.672
soundtrack.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:39.806
You guys remember that one?

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.275
Nope? All right.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.776
No Irish people here, I guess.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.411
No Irish people.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.812
But we're here to help with, uh,

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.080
tonight's hashtag,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.649
#MakeASongIrish.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.083
Examples might be "Uptown

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.787
Drunk," and "Me neck, me back,

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.690
me pussy and me Lucky Charms."

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.625
(laughter and applause)

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.568
