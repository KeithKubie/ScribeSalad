00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.410
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Great.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.990
I'm very happy to introduce Tomas Sedlacek,
the author of The Economics of Good and Evil.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.820
He
teaches at Charles University and is a member

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.650
of the
National Economic Council in Prague.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.800
He's worked as an
advisor to VÃ¡clav Havel.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.530
He's going to take us on a
whirlwind tour of intellectual history, from

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.510
the epic of
Gilgamesh to the Hebrew Bible, to Greek philosophers,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.080
the New Testament, the medieval period, Mandeville,
Hume,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.530
Adam Smith, Marx, points at the many stories
in

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.219
economics that don't show up in the formulas,
but still

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.359
resonate in people's lives.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.429
We've over-mathematized, and
so missed important philosophical issues that

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.159
are
hidden in the formulas that would rather be

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.160
precisely
wrong than roughly correct, or which mistake

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.760
beauty for
truth in Krugman's phrase.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.481
It's time to remember the
alternative stories to get us out of the mess

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:54.481
we're in.

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.559
It's time to realize that invisible hands
and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.100
equilibrium are every bit as much myths as
unicorns and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
dragons.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.210
They may be useful for a story, but they need
to be taken with a big grain of salt.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.939
Please join me in
welcoming Tomas Sedlacek.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.630
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: So thank you.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.439
It's a great pleasure
to be here with you today and let's really

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.329
do this quite
quickly, and let's try and see how far we

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.720
can go down
the history of Economics of Good and Evil.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720
Okay.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.170
So
one of my basic points is that we've never

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.460
separated the
two.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:36.350
It was always economics and morality being
connected really together, not -- well, with

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.990
Adam Smith
being sort of a climax of the debate; Adam

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.119
Smith did not
really start this whole notion of economics,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.390
but Adam
Smith was a moral philosopher, and so was

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.720
Hume, and so
were actually all the classical philosopher

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.539
-- I mean
economists were basically philosophers.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.549
Now, what I
think is one of the struggle and the trouble

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.020
we have today
in 2011 is that we view these two words absolutely

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.020
separate.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.819
We have this impersonal, technical,
math-looking ideology of the free market that

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.860
simply
runs like an engine, like a robot, and is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.250
value free,
allegedly, is absolutely inhuman, it's just

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.030
like a
machine.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
And that's why we treat it with calculus,
that's how we treat it with all sorts of mechanistic

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.390
approaches, as if it was a computer program,
as if it

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.590
was a stimulation of work.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.610
And that strange body,
zombie, that does not really have a soul -- we

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.170
made it
to look like it doesn't have a soul -- produces

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.650
results
that we don't really like.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.200
And of course if you look
down on the best selling books on Amazon or

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.750
at any
bookstore, it would all be books that are

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.620
critical on
economy.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.930
Where did we go wrong, the animal spirits,
the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.810
myths of the rational market, you can go on.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.260
You can
actually go through all the books that you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.500
see on the
best selling list and you will not find one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.760
that goes
praising the economy for whatever good that

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.070
we have
around us.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.430
So it is disjointed, it creates results that
we're not happy with.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.310
On the other hand, we have moral
expectations that the market is going to solve

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.310
everything, it's going to make everybody happy,
and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.120
everybody better off.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.110
So the problem was or is what we
had together is now disjointed.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.950
So you know in the book
of Job in the Old Testament it says "Should

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.680
I only
accept from the hand of the Lord the good

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.710
things and not
the bad things?" and I think we have a similar

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.580
--
similar guiding narrative when it comes to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.690
this myth of
the market is supposed to do everything right.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.020
So the
markets in a way are either hated and they

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.680
are the cause
of all problems as we have quotes in the New

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.260
Testament
and other spiritual sources that there is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.600
a huge divide
between money, and money is the root of all

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.800
evil --
which is a misquote by the way, but never

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.769
mind and then
we have this spiritual, soft, human, wishy

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.630
washy zone of
life, and this one is supposed to correct

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.870
the doings of
this machine called the market.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.310
So in practical
application you have the government, which

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.590
is supposed
to, the story goes, soften the results of

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.990
the market,
but these two are disjointed, they're not

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.940
together
anymore, and that's where kind of the problem

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.640
comes
from.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:56.180
Now, the remedy is not in correcting the -- so
okay.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.260
Let's go into mythology.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.080
If you look on all
myths that we have around us or if you look

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.960
at horror
stories, there are basically two things that

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.160
we fear.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.070
We fear when the body and soul gets disjointed.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.190
All
right?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.290
So if you get the body disjointed from the
soul,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.900
you get zombies on the one hand, or you get
ghosts and

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.180
spirits on the other.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.150
The thing doesn't work very well
if it's -- if it's disjointed.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.920
Also mark that if you go
and analyze all the myths and -- including

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.550
modern myths,
we fear two things.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.360
When a human being is mixed with an
animal, vampire, werewolf, all sorts of wizards

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.930
that
live in the forest and they have animal-like

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.590
behavior on
the one hand; and then there's another guarding

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.700
fear,
really, that we have, and that is that of

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.040
robots.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.260
You
see that in Matrix, you see that in the War

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.260
of the
Worlds.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.920
So, how to read this.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.220
I think this is exactly
the same area.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.020
We've disjointed something that should
have been together, body and soul.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.020
You disjoint that,
you get horror figures that we are afraid

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.970
of, tremendous
fear out of these things.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.440
They look like human beings,
zombies for example, but they act like animals.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.110
They
eat, I mean, the common narrative of all zombie

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.419
stories
is this used to be my wife; or my friend;

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:31.200
or my father;
suddenly he, or she, or it ceases to be human,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.860
it
becomes an animal, and it attacks you, and

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.710
it treats you
as if you were just a piece of meat.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:45.780
And the other
problem is that of human beings becoming machine-like.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.390
So how do we read this economically?

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.160
I think the moment
you start disjoining these two, you get into

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.021
a
catastrophe situation, which is the place

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.180
of a human
being is always to be together.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.930
A rational,
mathematical way of thinking needs to be part

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.370
of human,
but it mustn't be only that.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.080
These are all the
Hitler-like characters.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.280
You saw quite nicely in the
last movie, for example, Avatar, you have

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.850
this soldier
who only wants profit, who calculates who

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.770
doesn't care
for who he kills while he does that.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.110
So that's a true
horror figure.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.480
And, on the other hand, you have these
animalistic -- animal spirit tendencies.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.550
So as an
economist, you can see one extreme being homoeconomicus,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:45.610
rational, calculating, mathematical, cold,
calculus of

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.210
consumption and production, nothing else matters.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.540
And
on the other hand animal spirits, which is

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.310
a concept
that John Maynard Keynes talked about in his

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.370
general theory,
something that we economists fear but we don't

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.370
understand.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.370
It's a singularity.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:10.070
It's an animal that
reacts, that propels us forward, that's adventurous,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.340
but
it's not controlled by reason.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.889
So you can see this fear
when you disjoin two things that should be

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:22.350
together, and
I argue that this is exactly what happened

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.350
with the
economy.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.690
We got ridiculous results with the market
that

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:30.750
nobody really likes, often, and we have ridiculous
expectations that really can't be matched

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.240
by anybody
else except for maybe God or maybe a host

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.869
of gods;
definitely not the market.

00:08:38.869 --> 00:08:41.490
So that's one way of looking
at it.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:47.730
Let me take another fly through -- fly through
the history of economy, and maybe because

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.720
I am speaking
in the premises of Google, maybe answer the

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.110
question why
Plato would love Google.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.360
Okay.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.180
So if we actually go
fast forward the history of the economy, you

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.920
will learn
that it was -- in the beginning it was important

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.779
to
actually master material things such as acts,

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:14.680
and be
close to sources of iron, or maybe salt, or

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.269
be at the
cross roads of a passage that people had to

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:20.629
pass
through, or information you had to pass through,

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:23.230
or --
but more likely material things that you had

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.230
to pass
through.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.180
That was the time of matter, where matter
mattered the most.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.009
Then we had the time of
manufacturing where it wasn't all that important

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:35.040
where
that thing -- there we go.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.380
Advertisements are falling
apart.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.579
What kind of a world are we living in?

00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:44.980
Founding
superstructure.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.230
Manufacturing, it wasn't really
important where you got the stuff from, but

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:56.310
the nations
that owned companies -- I mean, owned manufacturing

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:03.629
infrastruc- -- I mean, yeah, manufacturers,
that's where

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:06.290
Ford's T-time.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.480
. These nations were the rich nations.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:15.000
We move from that from a -- from things, from
things to

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.730
thinks, where thinking was important.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.709
This was the time
of lawyers, this was the time of accountants,

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:24.880
this was
the time of advisors.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.839
And eventually we are moving into
the area, I argue, of non-things where -- and

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:38.379
I think this
is the time where we actually witness is thinking,

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:43.420
planning, doing things rigorously is no longer
important.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:50.059
What's important is the soft skills and
moving into further level of abstractness.

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:54.040
Let me give
an example of three titans -- let me get rid

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.390
of this --
of three titans of the past.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.970
One was actually IBM which
you know you could actually knock on the product

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.880
of IBM
and you had to ship it, and you owned a piece

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.319
of matter.

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:09.019
If you tried really hard you could turn it
into an ax or

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.689
something else; it was matter.

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:14.050
Second generation was
Microsoft.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:22.720
Now, the product of Microsoft is extremely
abstract; you can't really knock on it, but

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.790
at least you
can put it in a box and you can sell it, and

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.600
you can
come home and you can say to your family,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.339
"Look, I
bought a new product by Microsoft" for example.

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:40.649
Okay,
and third in this legion of titans is Google,

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:43.930
where you
can't really box Google.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.139
That's absolutely absurd
thought.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:55.529
You can't actually buy anything from Google,
and the wonderful trick is while Microsoft

00:11:55.529 --> 00:12:02.110
is trying to
employ people and pay them for doing things

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.749
for it,
Google does it exactly the other way around.

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:09.170
It employs
people voluntarily.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:14.819
So you guys have millions of
employees uploading things to YouTube, putting

00:12:14.819 --> 00:12:20.709
things on
also Wikipedia is running down the same logic,

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:25.499
where you
absolutely conquered the whole idea of matter.

00:12:25.499 --> 00:12:29.290
What's
wonderful is the thing that you can't look

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.119
for in
Google -- once I had high fever and I was

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:36.490
at home and I
was looking for a particular book, a physical

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.490
book,
okay.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.610
That was in the times that books were actually
printed in paper.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.529
And I was looking through my study
and I couldn't find the book, and as I was

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:47.170
in my high
fevers I thought okay, well, I'll just Google

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.910
it.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.220
Google -- the trick of Google is it will not
find

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.160
anything real.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.629
All the things that you deal with is
information, and of course it has a value

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.430
of its own,
but it's not real, it's not really anything

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.529
that you can
knock on or you can actually situate or localize.

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:08.649
And
this is why I think the original idea of the

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:13.269
mind
conquering the matter kind of materializes

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:17.079
in our
generation in the development of Google where

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:22.340
you
actually create sort of a rule, an upload

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.739
space such as
YouTube or the Internet, and then you live

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:35.309
as the gate
to this enumerable chaos.

00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:39.050
That I think is something
where we will go forward.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.769
One last thought and then
I'll be ready to take your questions in this.

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:48.299
Nietzsche
wrote about the age of a child.

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:52.239
He says, "In the
development of a human being, we have three

00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:53.239
ages.

00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:54.630
One
age is the age of a camel.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:01.879
Now, a camel takes upon
himself heavy burdens and wants to travel

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:09.889
or travels
through dry deserts without water and is actually

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:12.589
enslaved for a purpose of somebody else.

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:15.350
Then you have
an age of a lion.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:22.220
Lion fights, and rebels, and attacks
everything in the surrounding, and it is impossible

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.130
to
saddle him and impossible to tell him to walk

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.740
on and
serve somebody else.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.639
It doesn't lend towards it.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.980
And
the third age is the age of the child.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.370
The child is
playful, the child doesn't t really worry

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.610
about
anything, the child wants to be educated,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.939
the child
wants to learn, the child wants to stand in

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:41.939
awe.

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:45.920
Now, I
think this is one other way how we could actually

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.569
read -- and Nietzsche had this under personal
development,

00:14:48.569 --> 00:14:51.129
but it's easy to see how we can apply this
into the

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:56.860
development of our day and age where the whole
thing

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.410
with iPod, for example, is the advantage of
an iPod is

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.779
that it's fun.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:11.060
A small child can operate it and it is
not serious, it is not meant to be serious,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.589
and this is
what's beautiful about [pause] this is what's

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:20.389
beautiful
about Google.

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:25.760
It is -- for many people it's the gateway
into the chaos of Internet, but the page itself

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.959
is
empty.

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:31.529
It's a white page, which we just saw, and
the

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:35.439
only thing you have there is a line where
you, yourself,

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:39.160
type the way you like it.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.480
And this is something, a direction, into
which we are moving.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.730
Who would have thought 20 years
ago that you can make any money on searching

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.730
in the
Internet?

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.541
You're not even providing Internet access,
you're not providing Internet space, you're

00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:56.839
not
computers, you're not providing anything except

00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:57.839
for
searching.

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:05.629
And the searching also we can look at it
from a completely opposite view.

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:09.649
We think that we're
searching information where, in fact, we are

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:12.509
searching
the 'not'.

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:18.749
Because what Google does, it filters out all
the things that you don't want to know.

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:26.149
There was a
medieval monk, Meister Eckhart -- you've probably

00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:30.069
heard
of him -- and when he was asked what will

00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:36.100
burn us in
hell, he said, "In hell, it will be the not,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.809
the
negative that is burning."

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:43.149
In other words, my hand will
burn from coal only because my hand is not

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:44.559
coal.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:47.239
So
everything in my hand that is not coal, burns.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:52.079
If my
hand was made of coal, then you could torture

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:56.129
me as you
want, but it would not hurt me because it

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:57.129
is the not.

00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:59.759
It is the difference, it is the gap between
these two

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.649
elements that is burning.

00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:06.389
Similar, Google actually
filters out the 'not' more than it actually

00:17:06.389 --> 00:17:09.610
looks for the
things that you want to do.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.730
So the economy is
becoming -- and this is I think one way to

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.990
contemplate
about where the future is developing, and

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:22.669
it's
developing from things through thinks, rationality,

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:27.929
to
non-thinks, to personalization, to emotional

00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:32.380
enjoyment,
to playfulness, and these, I think, will be

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.220
the products
in the future that will gain the attention

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.360
of customers.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.460
And surprisingly this emancipation of economy
from

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:48.820
matter to pure mind jumping over the rational
period is

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.640
something that we're witnessing today.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.040
In my book, I
touch upon subjects such as these.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.991
I start with the
epic of Gilgamesh only to show that there

00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:06.010
is a lot of
economic thinking in ancient myth.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:11.710
You can go down any
basic three founding cultures that we have

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.870
in Europe and
America, which is the Old Testament, the Greeks,

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:21.360
Christianity, and the Sumerian mythology,
which was a

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.240
founding inspiration for a lot of the Greeks
and a lot

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.130
of the Hebrews.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.460
So the first half of the book talks
about economics and mythology, and the second

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.950
half talks
about mythology in modern economics.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.610
What do we believe
today as economists?

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:43.500
And let me just give you one
example of an ancient story which explains

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.260
current
situation maybe better than all these models

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.429
that we
have.

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:57.220
It's -- [INAUDIBLE] -- I don't know if you...
we

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.750
now are witnessing what we call a business
cycle.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.559
It's
the most recent business cycle.

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:10.409
So it's always useful
to ask for the oldest ever business cycle.

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:12.260
Anything
comes to your mind?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.000
The oldest business cycle in
recorded history of mankind.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:33.380
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.500
But a business cycle proper.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.190
&gt;&gt;Male #1 [INAUDIBLE]
TOMAS: There you go.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:47.240
This is in the old
testament where Pharaoh has a dream, and he

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.110
dreams about
seven fat deers -- seven fat cows, if you

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.139
recall, and
seven thin cows.

00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:57.039
That is the oldest business cycle
proper.

00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:02.510
Here's grain, GDP as we probably say today.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.720
We have
seven years of surplus, and seven years of

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720
famine.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.130
Now,
Pharaoh immediately asks Joseph okay, what

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.130
am I to do
with this?

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:18.640
This is obviously a situation, and how do
I

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.830
deal with it?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:28.029
And Joseph, because he read Keynes a lot
when he was younger, gives him an answer.

00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:34.279
Well, in the
good years, do not eat everything that grows.

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:43.190
Save your
energy and build silos -- I mean, store houses.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.000
So it's
a form of consumer energy that you don't use.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.830
In other
words, you could be on this level of joy -- or

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.870
consumption, but do not eat it all.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.419
Decrease your
consumption here so that in the bad years

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:03.789
you can
increase your consumption from, I don't know

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:10.090
-X to a
level which you can survive at.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.130
This level of
consumption we were all dying; this level

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.470
of consumption
we can survive.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:21.000
So what's the lesson to take from this
story?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.350
First of all, the role of economist never
was

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.259
increase of GDP growth.

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:35.159
It was only in the times of
crises when we are to increase GDP growth

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:38.409
from let's say
-20 to -7.

00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:46.850
Incidentally, by the way, in the year 2008,
if we had balanced budget -- if you guys in

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:53.059
America had
a balanced budget, your GDP would be -23 percent.

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:57.470
Now,
the number itself isn't important.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.380
What's important is
that nobody asks this question.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:06.190
So we consider whatever
growth, no matter how much debt-induced it

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.970
is, to be a
true, healthy, natural level of growth.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.240
But in fact
we're just dealing with energy.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.910
Energy and money travel
in time.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:27.710
So this is, of course fiscal policy, you store
the energy, you run fiscal surpluses.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.380
That means you slow
down the economy, which is the role of the

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.380
economist.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.539
The role of the economist is decreasing the
amplitude of

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:38.309
a business cycle, never, never in the long
run to

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:43.419
increase GDP -- GDP growth, definitely not
by fiscal

00:22:43.419 --> 00:22:45.380
stimuli.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.080
And here you have fiscal deficits.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.580
Okay.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.259
So
what did we do to bring it to some sort of

00:22:56.259 --> 00:23:00.390
a catharsis?

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.570
We also -- by the way, from the year 2001
with we had

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.730
the September 11 attacks, we had seven very
good years

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.370
that were bracketed by two very significant
events.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.820
This was one not only geopolitically, but
this was the

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.740
year when America produced its last budget
surplus, this

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.870
is the year when Fed started the policy of
extremely low

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.429
interest rates, etc., etc.

00:23:25.429 --> 00:23:31.360
And the hike of the crises
was collapse of Lehman Brothers, which was

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.320
by the way,
2008, September 15th.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.050
So of course I think this is just
a pure coincidence, but you see seven very

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.830
good years
bracketed by two significant events.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.690
Now, the question
is, what did we do with our fiscal policy

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.799
here?

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:55.179
We did
exactly the opposite.

00:23:55.179 --> 00:23:59.010
Either we didn't do anything,
some countries just stayed on the level of

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.490
debt that
they had before, but many countries, including

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.809
United
States, increased and was not running fiscal

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:09.990
surpluses,
but was running fiscal deficits, in other

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:15.620
words,
increasing GDP growth during good years.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.690
So not only did
we not save in the in the store houses, but

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.750
that
imaginary storehouse was full of IOUs.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.110
So we took the
energy -- and this is why there is such a

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:33.559
huge, huge
divide here, and this is why the crisis is

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:37.330
much deeper
than it should -- than it had to be, because

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.590
we wasted
that energy boost during good years when we

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.400
didn't need
to do that at all and now when we want to

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.460
boost the
economies, we are running into bankruptcies,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.779
not only in
Europe, but also here.

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:56.590
So what's my point here?

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.029
My
point here now is that we had similar situations,

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:04.100
similar stories, back in the history 4,000,
3,000 years

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.100
ago.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.230
People were aware of it and they treated it
--

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.549
instead of mathematical, apparently they treated
it with

00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:15.610
stories that a seven-year-old child could
understand.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:21.700
What's even more striking is that we -- well,
you could

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.769
go as far as to say that we were blinded by
all the

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:30.629
self-assuring mathematical models telling
us basically

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:37.320
this, that we didn't -- it didn't -- Well,
the wisdom of

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.549
this story, again, that a seven-year-old child
understands is something that we trespassed

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:49.090
against and
we couldn't be wise enough to act at least

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:54.200
the way
Pharaoh acted in the time where, you know,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.870
economic
studies were primitive.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.759
So there's still a lot of
things that we can learn from this.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:04.980
I think this is
exactly the rule that we should adopt also

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.980
in our
thinking.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.019
That means in good years target some level
of

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:11.019
growth.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.429
Let's say we could have grown by 6 percent,
but

00:26:13.429 --> 00:26:19.179
we will only grow by 2, and this energy we
will

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:22.929
recuperate so to speak so that we can use
it in the

00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:25.019
times of the crises.

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:26.769
Yeah.

00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:32.039
I'll end here.

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.940
Instead of
giving you an overview of the book, I think

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.840
it's better
that I gave you these three stories that I

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.220
think are
sort of explaining or guarding the development

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.300
of our
economic thought.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:53.179
The first story was animal and human,
and we -- and robot, sorry, and we human beings

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:55.789
have to
be in the middle.

00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:58.259
There will never be psychological
beasts.

00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:01.309
You will always have these two tendencies,
and

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:08.160
also the economy, homoeconomicus and animal
spirits as

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.179
to inborn tendencies or market and ethics.

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:15.820
We, if you
separate them, it becomes a horror.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.210
So that was the
first story.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:24.249
The second story from the book is the
economy going more and more abstract, more

00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:27.540
and more
playful, and less and less serious.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:35.090
And the third story
is the behavior of age and Asians when it

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.409
came to
business cycles and a comparison of how we

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:43.830
foolishly
from this point of view behave today.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.480
So thank you for
your attention, and let's move into the debate,

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480
please.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480
Okay.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.429
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So you showed us that Keynes is
right.

00:27:53.429 --> 00:27:56.779
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Do we need a microphone?

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:57.779
Probably.

00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:00.320
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.660
So the intriguing thing here is
you've shown us that Keynes, was right, at

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.470
least within
the context of the particular story that you

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.470
told.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.470
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.070
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And that there definitely is a
role for

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.249
fiscal policy and it's a role -- I think and
the

00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:17.450
important thing that you said is that we need
to

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.830
understand you don't do fiscal policy, fiscal
stimulus

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.830
all the time.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.830
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Right.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:22.830
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Only when it's --
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Right.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.830
Exactly.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.830
&gt;&gt;Male #2: -- When it's necessary.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.830
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Right.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.940
&gt;&gt;Male #2: But this other side of the world,
you

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.299
know, the Friedman and company, the monetarists
. Do the

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:34.730
monetarists appear at all in the Bible?

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.210
What is their
role in the world --

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.210
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.210
&gt;&gt;Male #2: -- as opposed to the fiscal?

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.940
TOMAS: Those are very good questions.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.559
So you
know if somebody asks me about Keynes I say

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:47.290
okay, yes I
am Keynesian but we are all Keynesians.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.290
This is what
Friedman says.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.419
We are all Keynesians now.

00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:54.350
I think once
you go further we are left of Keynes.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.440
In other words,
if we were to apply Keynesian policies, we

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.220
would have to
be right wing and more conservative.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.720
So let's first go
to Keynes and see if we can be actually -- because

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.970
okay
here.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.830
What is a more conservative value?

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:13.499
Higher GDP
growth or balanced budget?

00:29:13.499 --> 00:29:18.909
Because here you have a
choice.

00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:27.149
You can either be growing towards balanced
budget, or you can be stimulating your GDP.

00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:30.149
What is
more conservative, and what is more populist

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:33.610
, and what is more leftist and what is trying
to please all?

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.610
I
think higher GDP.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.950
That's -- everybody can do.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.539
That is
populist.

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:44.260
And we have a -- because we have right-wing
populism which means decreasing taxes when

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.920
you can't afford
to do so at the expense of deficits, and we

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.590
have leftist
populism, otherwise increasing expenditure

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.700
which you
can't afford to do so, at the expense of government

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.159
--
of deficit.

00:29:57.159 --> 00:30:02.220
So this is a Keynesian bastard, what we're
doing today.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:08.890
Our economic policy I describe as a
Keynesian bastard because half of it government

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.379
can run
deficits, we took, can we multiplied it by

00:30:12.379 --> 00:30:17.070
two, which
you know will not get you to the original

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.080
hole.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.200
So
that's why I think Keynes got some negative

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:31.570
press is
that he was accused of allowing budget deficits,

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.210
yes,
under conditions that you can run budget surpluses.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.049
So
we really took half of Keynes and bastardized

00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:45.429
him with
sweet-tooth political populism.

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:47.940
So that's just the
comment on Keynes.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.620
Now, going to fiscal policy, you
could re-tell the story in fiscal policy as

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.749
well, and
instead of fiscal surpluses you would have

00:30:55.749 --> 00:30:58.850
cheap --
cheap money.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.610
Did I say fiscal?

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.610
Yes, sir.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.610
Okay.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:07.440
You
can re-tell -- I'm more of a fiscal macro-economist,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.139
but
you can re-tell the whole story in monetary

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:13.710
policy,
sorry, saying here you should have high interest

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.510
rates
slowing down the economy, here you should

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.009
have low
interest rates.

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:20.640
And again the story is the same.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.129
What
is the problem that got us into the -- not

00:31:23.129 --> 00:31:26.059
the only
thing--, but what is the popular understanding

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:27.740
about what
got us into crises?

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.970
Over consumption.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:33.350
How are we going
to get out of it?

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.400
By consuming even more.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.220
And, you
know, Obama gets blamed by many economists,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.110
oh, you're
not inducing the economy to spend, and this

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.249
is the
debate that we have in Europe as well.

00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:49.499
We have to run
fiscal deficits to get everything moving.

00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:53.809
So we will
spend our way out of the crisis.

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:58.669
And the same story in
terms of monetary policy.

00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:00.169
What got us into trouble?

00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:02.809
If
you open FT or Wall Street Journal, cheap

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:03.809
money.

00:32:03.809 --> 00:32:06.700
Too
much cheap money, too low interest rate.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.600
What's the
solution to that problem?

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.809
Even more cheap money and
even lower interest rates.

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:18.580
This does not work, and my
problem -- and this is I think this is getting

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:24.259
to the
core of the issue and I thank you here.

00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:25.259
Will we go
bankrupt?

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:26.539
Will we not go bankrupt?

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:28.749
I don't care.

00:32:28.749 --> 00:32:29.909
Here
I think I'm a Keynesian.

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:33.230
I don't care how much deficit
you run here.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:39.289
It is okay to run a deficit in crises,
and it is okay to run low interest rate monetary

00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:41.139
policy
in crises.

00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:51.039
But what we don't have as a part of the
story is a firm commitment that we will not

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:53.700
get drunk on
a Friday evening.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:59.789
And while are we talking about
drinking, there's another parable I have when

00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:01.220
it comes
to monetary policy.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.019
[sounds of paper flipping] Let's stay here.

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:08.669
Energy can travel
in time in terms of fiscal policy.

00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:12.929
We do that by
surplus, because surplus is our first fiscal

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:13.929
deficits.

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:17.409
Now, we know -- this is Economics 101 -- that
the

00:33:17.409 --> 00:33:21.230
government has basically two ways to steer
-- not really

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.799
guide, but steer the economy.

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:31.770
One is fiscal policy, and
the other one is monetary policy.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.929
Here you manipulate
with debt, and here you manipulate with money.

00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:39.669
So --
and I simplify here, and I do that willingly

00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:42.379
because we
only have a little time -- monetary policy

00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:45.020
is the
monopoly, the right of the government to print

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.970
money,
simply put.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:54.140
Fiscal policy is again a monopoly of the
government to print debt.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.139
You -- I cannot make you
indebted.

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:59.440
I cannot come see you and say, okay.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440
This is
what politicians do.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.510
They give you a gift which you
have to pay for yourself.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.149
This is -- whoops [cell phone rings].

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:13.160
I thought
I had it switched off.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:20.030
So here -- So printing money,
printing debt.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:26.500
We, as mankind, have realized that it is
not healthy when a politician has the right

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.240
to print
money.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.830
So what we did is we took that right away
and we

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.840
gave it to a Fed central bank.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:40.040
In the case of Europe and
America, we have a central bank or European

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.630
Central Bank
so Italians can no longer print money; Californians

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.040
can
not print money because they're in default.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.050
So always
in the past, take Californian situation, or

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.170
Greek
situation, or any other situation, we are

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.130
in problem; we
will just print money; we'll inflate our way

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.780
out of
this.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:05.410
This was a temptation too large for any
politicians to carry.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:10.990
So that ring of power, so to
speak, had to be destroyed.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.630
While we're talking about
the ring of power, why did Aragorn, why did

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:22.110
Gandalf, why
did Galadriel never touch the ring?

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.310
Too much power.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.280
It
was a temptation that all of the wise in this

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.990
trilogy
knew it's too much of a temptation.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.810
So the conclusion
was, we will not use the ring, albeit it is

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.120
extremely
powerful and we could use it against Sauron

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.320
and Saruman
themselves.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.900
This was Boromir's mistake.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.820
That's why he
died.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.400
The ring of power must be destroyed because
the

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.801
ring of power exits one characteristic is
called by

00:35:50.801 --> 00:35:54.710
psychologists "objet petit a", which is something
that

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.940
is created to serve, you end up serving it.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.540
This is the
basic plot in Matrix.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.870
We've created robots, computers,
machines to serve us, blah, blah, blah; at

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.390
the end of
the narrative, we serve them.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.750
This is what Kundera, if
you read Kundera, writes about.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:19.100
A male starts usually a
sexual game with a female thinking that he

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.410
can control
it.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.090
At the end of the day, the game sort of has
a will

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.870
of its own and it controls.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.840
So from a puppeteer, you
become a puppet.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.810
And you can -- and 10,000 stories are
like this.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.350
And it also, by the way, goes nicely for
debt.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.740
Why do you take a debt?

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.440
It's something that I
can control.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.170
I need a new computer, I need a new car, I
need a new investment.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:48.250
I take debt, I think I can
manage it, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.400
At the end of the day, you
are a slave to that debt.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.450
By the way, in all New
Testament languages: Greek, Aramaic, and even

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.950
Latin,
the word "debt" and "sin" are synonyms; you

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.780
have it in
modern Germany -- in modern German to this

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.100
very day.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.150
Okay.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.540
So I would argue here that what we need to
do is

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.180
we also -- what's the difference between printing
money

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.650
and printing debt?

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.190
At the end of the day, the
difference is not that large.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:28.450
Why should politicians be
standing up against the temptation to print

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.450
debt?

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.260
If
we -- let's imagine how the crises would look

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.750
like if we
had fiscal -- monetary policy.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.560
If politicians had
monetary policy at their disposal what would

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.920
be the
result?

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.120
Tremendous inflation.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.450
Ridiculous levels of
inflation.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.450
We can't do that.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.350
This hand is bound behind
our backs.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.650
So what do we revert to?

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.650
Debt.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.110
The sin
of monetary policy is hyperinflation, the

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.600
sin of
fiscal policy is debt.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.030
This is why we don't have a
problem with inflation, by the way.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.270
This is why we have
problem with debt.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:09.510
Let me finish this answer by giving
a similar analogy to in what way is alcohol

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:17.220
similar to
interest rate? [paper rustling] What makes

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.730
money time travel possible is
interest rate.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.900
We live in a society where you earn
money like this.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.380
This is your retirement age, this is
where you become a CEO and CFO, be you you

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.650
need money
like this.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.940
When you establish a family you need a new
car, you need a new house, you need blah,

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.040
blah, blah
children and everything.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.940
So, how to solve this
conundrum?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.890
Interest rate.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.410
So we live in buildings that
are -- in houses that are not ours, it's called

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.070
leasing -- mortgage; we drive cars that are
not ours; we

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.220
watch screens that are not ours.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.450
This is fine as long
as these two hills meet.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.840
If this hill is smaller, you
break a leg, you have a crisis, the oil prices

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.600
go up or
the future expectations of your future do

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.520
not match,
we're in a problem.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.310
This is another way to read the
crises is this happened.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.310
Fine.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.290
So it is really
interest rate that allows money time travel.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:20.190
When I
take on a loan, let's say I borrow $10,000,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.880
it looks
like I'm getting it from a bank or from a

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.980
friend, but
really what's happening is I'm tunneling that

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.890
from my
own future because there will come a time

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.700
when I will
need to pay back, and that's where my consumer

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.760
energy
will decrease.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.980
I will have to either work hard or
consume less at my current expense.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.250
So I cannot vacuum
clean and laser point that energy from the

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:45.770
past which I
think I will not need into the future -- from

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.320
the future
to current present when I think I need it

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.330
more than I
need it in the past.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:56.230
Now, alcohol does the same thing
like interest rate.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.430
How exactly?

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:05.030
Friday evening you
are occasionally dancing in the bar 'til three

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.680
in the
morning having all that energy and you're

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.940
being very
witty, and you talk to people you would never

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.000
have the
guts to talk to and these girls are -- which

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.190
is most
surprising -- they talk back to you, and where's

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.880
all
this energy coming from?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.970
We think it's the alcohol,
that it's giving us the energy.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:24.160
That is not correct.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.230
The only thing alcohol does, it time travels
energy over

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.420
short distances of time, namely, Saturday
morning.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.590
So -- but the energy of the weekend is constant.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:42.800
But
alcohol allows energy time travel one direction

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.800
only.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:51.110
You can't save up your mood by not drinking
over short

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.880
distances of time.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.030
Interest rate, on the contrary --
and by the way, interest rate is something

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.280
that all
ancients starting with Aristotle, which I

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.190
deal with in
the book, Aristotle, Holy Koran, the Old Testament,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:07.190
Vedas , anywhere you look, all the ancient
-- the wise

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:12.370
wizards or founders of our culture and society
warned us

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.760
against interest rate.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.720
They said don't use it.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.170
If you
don't have to, don't use it.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.910
You will remember all
these rules all the way until Thomas Aquinas,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.290
interest
rate was banned.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:29.110
It was one of the worst sins that you
could do in the medieval period.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:36.230
There was a special
place in hell reserved for usurers.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.230
What have we done?

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:41.270
We have done -- we have made interest rate
a founding

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.280
pillar of our society.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.980
Our society's unimaginable
without the interest rate.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.210
Now, the ancients knew
exactly why interest rate is bad.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.770
If you read it
Aristotle, his argumentation is very weak.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.680
He acknowledges
it.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.750
And here's why, I think, and that's in the
analogy

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.830
with alcohol.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:11.720
It's fine to get drunk on a Friday
evening if you know you have Saturday morning

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:17.180
awaiting
for you; it is not clever to get drunk on

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.121
Sunday evening
when you have something important to do on

00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:23.570
a Monday
evening, such as go to work maybe, or have

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.950
an interview,
or travel a long distance.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:31.480
Now, the trick difference
between these two here is that we can, with

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:38.310
reasonable
probability, see one day ahead in the future.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:43.760
You
cannot see 40 years ahead, and this is yet

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.870
another way
how to read the crises.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:51.070
We have landed with our
hangover into a period where we cannot afford

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.070
one.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.970
The
growth is slowing, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:55.970
blah.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.920
So
that's why maybe we should be very cautious

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.560
about the
redistributing time and money, money, energy.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.690
So that's
the monetary policy story.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.650
&gt;&gt;Male #3: If I could, just one more.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:16.650
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.050
&gt;&gt;Male #3: The story as you tell it, especially
with

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.790
the business cycle before, obviously you have
to -- you

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:28.230
know, build up a surplus during the good times
and then

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.830
you spend it during the bad times, etc., because
you're

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.820
trying to basically cut out the variability
in the

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.820
system, etc..

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.590
But it's a profoundly simple story.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.650
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:44.470
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It is attacked every day and declared
to

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:45.470
be wrong.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.460
There are -- there are millions of people
out

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.470
there, leaders of our country, unfortunately
appearing

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:53.440
to be the majority of the movement, who attack
this and

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.260
say it is absolute idiocy, it is lunacy, it
is wrong, it

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.590
is evil, it is bad.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:03.590
Why?

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.940
What's wrong with the story?

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.640
It's simple, it's compelling for me, but apparently
it

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.640
isn't for others.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.180
What's wrong with this story?

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:17.760
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: I think it's more what's wrong with
our perception of what we deserve today.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.930
We believe we
deserve -- and this is I think we believe

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.200
we deserve
this.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.810
We could have -- it was -- okay.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.760
I'm going to be
simplifying here.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.110
The economy grew at 6 percent.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.660
We could
have afforded a house this size.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:39.770
We could have gone
down, and we should have, to prepare for the

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:44.310
winter in the
summer.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.050
Not only were we not content with what we
had,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.990
but we wanted more and this is the role of
politicians.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.550
If they can manipulate money supply or debt,
why not

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.250
promise more when you can?

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.820
Nobody will give you what I
can promise you.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.940
I think this is the key story of
politicians.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.820
This is why I think we need to for the sake
of

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:15.460
politicians, get rid of this temptation by
confiscating

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.330
monetary policy -- fiscal policy the same
way we have

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.110
confiscated fiscal policy two generations
ago, by

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.760
creating -- it's okay.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.780
You can go many different
directions and either way you like it, either

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.150
there'll
be -- and there is a lot of talk about that

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.850
among the
economists, so-called fiscal council, which

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:40.680
-- or on the
level of Europe and on the level of any federation

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.180
such
as the United States, a conglomerate of, say,

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.160
minister of
finance or treasurers will agree according

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.700
to a formula,
this is something that I have suggested with

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.200
the
National Economic Council for the Czech government,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.740
something that I think it would be workable
for European

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.720
Union as well, especially after the Greek
experience.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:06.750
Have a rule, a fiscal rule such as GDP growth
plus

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:13.010
deficit should be smaller or equal to four,
or constant,

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.010
depends on the economy.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:19.360
In other words, target a
4 percent GDP growth.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.140
This is the case of Czech
Republic, I think, a reasonable level of growth

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.520
for
developing economies.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.420
For America this would be less,
lets say two.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:37.970
And if GDP is let's say 6 percent, then
we should create 2 percent budget surpluses

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:41.250
so that this
is Czech Republic, let's say Greece is going

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:49.700
-7, then
they can go into 11 percent budget deficits.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.950
This is a
rule that allows you to use the power of fiscal

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.930
policy
in the bad years, 11 percent budget deficit

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:59.210
is huge
that will help in the crises.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:03.760
But, it also forces
you -- this is the only rule that forces you

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.330
into fiscal
surpluses during good years.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:12.460
And I think this
autopilot -- we already have this autopilot

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.510
in monetary
policy, by the way, Milton Friedman invented

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:20.130
it, and that
is, money supply should mimic the development

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.510
of GDP.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.500
And also deficit should go against -- should
be

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.000
anti-cyclical , so to speak, of growth.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.520
So when it grows,
yeah.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.800
I've already explained that.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.700
So that's another
way how to just you know get the discretion

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.150
out of it.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:43.660
And of course it will be still question for
politicians

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.760
who to tax.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760
Do I tax the poor?

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760
Do I tax the rich?

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760
Do
I tax the successful?

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.600
Do I tax the unsuccessful?

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.710
This
is a political debate and it must remain a

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.610
political
debate.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.570
And the other question is, who do I give the
money to?

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.490
Do I support the poor or do I support the
rich?

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.880
Do I support the successful, or do I support
the

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.880
unsuccessful?

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.490
Do I support the strong, or do I support
the weak?

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.090
Those are good questions.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:11.490
They're not easily
answered and they should remain political.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.860
What
shouldn't happen in the meantime is that politicians

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.410
get
to print.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.820
I tax little, I give out a lot.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.900
How can I do
this trick?

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.010
Well, this is called debt.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:27.110
This -- so you
collect money and you print 20 percent more,

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:28.110
and you
give it out.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.850
This print of 20 percent more should be
confiscated.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:38.090
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Given that politicians lie, I mean,
the

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:40.260
Greek problem in large part was they had some
rules as

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.810
far as what they could do --
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: [soda spraying] Whoa.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:46.380
&gt;&gt;Male #4: And they had big bang -- they had
big

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.180
banks help them --
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Big bangs, or big banks?

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.180
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Big banks --
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Okay.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.180
&gt;&gt;Male #4: -- help them cheat.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.180
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Right.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.890
&gt;&gt;Male #4: And politicians will always cheat
if they

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:58.470
can because the -- the last stoic politician
died

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.560
probably about 500 years ago.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.130
We all have really stupid
epicureans running the place.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.130
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yeah.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.000
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So how do you keep them from lying?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.820
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Then you shouldn't put your hopes
up

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:13.410
into electing a politician who is honest and
sincere,

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.570
and good, and good meaning, and faithful,
and truthful.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:20.460
Instead, change the system so it doesn't matter
if he or

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.460
she is thus.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:28.130
In other words, if you take this tool away
from them, you can have an idiot who will

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.530
not be able to
do harm.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.290
Do you know what I mean?

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:38.660
I have no -- I
have -- so I think all of us suffer Messianic

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.660
Complex.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.190
We believe somebody should come and take things
in

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.510
control.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:47.420
Some sort of a messiah, a
politician who is as you describe, honest

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.540
and sincere.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:53.760
Well, he's not coming, or he didn't come for
a long

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.660
time, and even Jesus, who was expected to
do this, to be

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:02.330
a political messiah, didn't play that role
intentionally .

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.700
He was not a political messiah.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.451
So my answer is,
instead of hoping for better people, let's

00:50:08.451 --> 00:50:14.210
just create a
better system where you do not leave that

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.440
to a
discretion of people.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.910
You don't allow this propensity.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:28.580
&gt;&gt;Male #5: What you seem to be going for if
we don't

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.940
go with the fiscal council, which would be
hard to do in

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.940
this country, one would would hope because
it's pretty

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.611
antidemocratic and relies on people of privilege
and

00:50:41.611 --> 00:50:46.290
such, but if we go with the formula --
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: We already have that in monetary

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.290
policy.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:48.730
&gt;&gt;Male #5: We do, and there are a lot of people
that

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:49.730
are unhappy about that.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.130
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: But should we give it back to
politicians?

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:52.349
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Okay.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:56.790
But it sounds like to go with the
formula, whether or not the formula is enforced

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.310
by
council or by law, this would be the sort

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:04.350
of thing where
you would write in saying that essentially

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:08.060
the tax rate
is determined by a calculation of a GDP or

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.450
some portion
of it?

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:12.900
How do you --
&gt;&gt;Tomas: You can have a Swedish model

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.030
here where you have high expenditures and
high taxes.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.710
No problem, as long as you don't do deficits.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.560
&gt;&gt;Male #5: What is the definition of how the
adjustments are made?

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.680
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Same way it's done every year.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.630
Every
year we determine this year we're going to

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.050
have that
level of deficit.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:31.710
And we will -- and yeah, we'll have
to have more anti-cyclical taxes or some sort

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.080
of
anti-cyclical expenditures.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.080
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Okay.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.810
So at this point the adjustment of
the anti-cyclical component.

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:37.810
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Yes.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:38.950
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Taxes.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:44.980
So every year you'd have your base
tax then every year there'd be -- or anti-cyclical

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:45.980
tax
and then --

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.980
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: For example.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.980
&gt;&gt;Male #5: -- and how it goes up or down,
depending on

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.980
how the GDP wants?

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.790
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: And the economy actually does that
itself if it is not disturbed by politician.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.330
In good
years, you tend to have higher tax revenues

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:58.240
because
companies collect more taxes, and less unemployed

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.970
so you
don't have to give out that many expenditures.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:03.320
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Are there any actual real-life
countries

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.070
that divide their tax into components, the
base, plus

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.800
the anti-cyclical, and then do actually adjust
the --

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.930
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: You, taxes are that way.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.730
Progressive
taxes are -- in progressive taxation, you

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:20.170
already have
this incorporated.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:25.380
[pause] The more you make, the more you get
taxed.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.250
That's progressive taxation.

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:30.940
And if your level
of income decreases, you pay lesser not amount,

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.750
but
also percentage of taxes.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.930
So you wouldn't have to
change much.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:35.930
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Okay.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:38.180
So we already have supposedly
progressive taxes here.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.180
Why doesn't it work for us?

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.990
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: The problem is, somebody comes up
--

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.990
okay.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.300
Let's have a little situation.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:51.300
[paper flipping] The economy's
growing and your taxes -- your tax rate -- this

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.300
is the
budget.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:58.120
Your tax revenues are rising and your
expenditures are decreasing.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:03.540
And if you let that be on
some sort of an autopilot, the budget will

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.020
go itself
into surplus during good years.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.520
But, of course, this is
extremely tempting because what does a budget

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.250
surplus mean?

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:13.440
Is
it already 10:00 o'clock?

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.450
Because this is going to be a
very -- 10:00 o'clock in the evening.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.450
Just a joke.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.580
This is going to be perverse.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:25.080
Imagine you're running an
economy where you gather -- collect more taxes

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.870
than you
give in expenditures.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:28.870
What is the temptation?

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:31.490
The
temptation of course is if you're right wing,

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:35.191
decrease
taxes immediately, kick the automatic tendency

00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:38.900
of an
economy to stabilize itself, kick it in the

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.930
-- in the --
where do you kick people here in America?

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.330
Kick it in
the right knee.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:50.180
[chuckles] And the tendency of a left-wing
politician is to increase expenditures immediately.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.800
So
just letting that, you know, resisting the

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.500
temptation
like when Odyssey was going in the island

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:03.480
of the sirens, bind
the hands, close the ears, which is, by the

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.480
way, what
Fed is doing.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.740
Fed is not supposed to -- or central
banks are not supposed to care for political

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:08.740
cycle.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.270
Whether there's elections or not, we don't
care.

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:13.910
We are
just listening to keeping the monetary supply

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.640
-- I mean
keeping the inflation stable.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.150
Low and stable.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.770
So
Finland did this.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.720
They had more tax revenue than they
gave out.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.490
This is why they were able to decrease their
taxes.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:36.230
Yet, having a level of taxation is huge, close
to 50 percent of GDPs being taxed.

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.470
So that is, of
course, that is a political decision of a

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:42.590
nation: Do
you want to be America with low taxes or Finland

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.360
with
high taxes and high expenditures?

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.420
That's fine, only
don't cheat.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.940
So this is democratic.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.250
I think this is
absolutely democratic.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.040
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: We're out of time, so thank
you very much.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.450
Let's thank him very much.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:01.730
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: Thank you.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.010
Thank you very much.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:08.560
&gt;&gt;TOMAS: So again I apologize for coming late.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.710
It was my secretary wrote instead of the 72
number on

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:18.310
the 93, she wrote seventy-second street in
the

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.110
intersection with the nine.

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:24.910
So I was up there -- so I
really apologize.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:29.040
