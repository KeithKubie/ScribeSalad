00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.750
Hello.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.650
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.290
And this is your update about
all the awesomeness going on

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.580
at Google in the last week that
developers care about, but may

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.670
have missed.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.620
First let's talk about the
coolest video I saw this week,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.600
the Google Data Center
360 degree tour.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.710
The tech in these data
centers is amazing.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.340
And this video gives
you a full cinematic VR

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.930
experienced by Sandeep,
a developer advocate

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.690
on the Google Cloud platform.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.210
And just for fun, watch
the video using Cardboard,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.580
and try to spot the Google
security guard in every shot.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.480
It's like a highly
secure game of Where's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.560
Waldo with a backdrop of
the coolest scaled computer

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.570
architecture ever.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.040
The Node.js runtime on Google
App Engine is going beta.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.750
Combining Node.js and App
Engine gives you a great way

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.980
to build web apps
and mobile backends

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.770
with JavaScript that also need
to operate at Google Scale.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.400
Check out the post
to get started.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.120
The Google Code Jam is back.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.420
Now, this year is the
13th annual algorithmic,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.220
global coding competition.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.090
If you like programming,
winning, and competing

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.470
for the $15,000
grand prize, make

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.870
sure to sign up before
the online qualification

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.400
round on April 8.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.890
The Game Developers Conference
happened a couple weeks ago,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710
and we hosted our
annual Developer Day

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.330
where we announced new
platform and ads tools

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.220
for developers of all sizes.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.410
This post rounds them up,
including one of my favorites,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.420
Search Trial Run Ads.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.510
Now when users search
for your games on Google,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.720
they can get an
ad with a Try Now

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.980
button that allows them
to play your game right

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.550
there for up to 10 minutes and
then download the game in full

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.500
if they choose.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.400
It's a great way
to get users who

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.670
are likely to stay engaged
with your game after install.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.730
Now, since it's tax season
for those in the US,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.580
I thought I'd also
share this article found

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.370
on opensource.com.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.020
Turns out Senator Daniel
Squadron and Senator Ruth

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.690
Hassell-Thompson
have put forth a bill

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.650
in New York that will provide a
tax credit for 20% of expenses

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.830
associated with the
development of open source

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.840
and free software up to $200.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.360
Now, let's hope this passes
in New York so all you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.660
New York open source developers
can upgrade your gear.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.934
And perhaps other states
will catch on too.

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.850
If you've been watching
this show for a while,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.300
or saw my chat with Josh
Gordon a couple months back,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300
you know that we're all really
excited about machine learning.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.680
Last week at GCP Next 2016,
we announced the alpha release

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.300
of Cloud Machine Learning.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.080
It's a framework for building
and training custom models

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.540
to be used in
intelligent applications.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.670
It allows you to build
large-scale machine learning

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180
models on your data
using TensorFlow.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210
In addition to the deep
learning capabilities

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.120
and the power of Cloud
Translate API, Cloud Vision API,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.960
and Cloud Speech API,
we provide easy to adopt

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.710
samples for common tasks like
regression and classification.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.094
Check out the post for all
the links to get started.

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:51.760
And those are your
updates for the week.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.180
Click the links
in the description

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.430
below, like this video, and
don't forget to subscribe.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.550
After all, you don't want
to be the developer who

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.530
misses the coolest new platform
updates across all of Google,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.230
right?

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.370
Of course you don't, which is
why I'll see you next week.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.720
