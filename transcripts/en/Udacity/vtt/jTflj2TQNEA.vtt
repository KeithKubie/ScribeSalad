00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.410
For example, here is a brief description of a family called the pipe and

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.970
filter family, which you should now be familiar with.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.360
There's a type of component, not a component but a type of component,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.100
called the filter type. Another type of component called the pipe type. And

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.200
we might then use. This, this additional vocabulary in defining a system. And

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.360
you notice that in the declaration of the system, there's a type given to it.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.509
In this case, it's the PipeAndFiltersFamily. And

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.570
we're now going to define specific components that correspond to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.450
the types we've defined in the family description. So filter 1 is a, a type,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.210
filter type and likewise is filter 2 and then connector is of the pipe type.
