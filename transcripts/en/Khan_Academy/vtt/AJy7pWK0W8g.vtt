00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Instructor] In this
video we're going to

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.900
talk about an idea that's crucial

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.270
to the proper functioning of an economy

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.170
under a market-based system.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.340
And that's the idea of property rights,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.320
and it's just the idea
that everyone agrees on

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.560
who owns what and what can they do

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.720
with that property?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.520
And for many of us who live in a part

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.660
of the world with strong property rights,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.420
we take all of that for granted.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.130
We know who owns that house

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.230
and what they have the
right to do with that house

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.000
and if they were to sell that house,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.810
how that would occur,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.230
but in some parts of the world

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.530
or in some parts of history,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.980
that wasn't so clear.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.570
Someone might say they own the house,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.940
but then another person
might live in that house

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.640
and they say well I've been
living here for 10 years,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.820
it's my house now, deal with it.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.470
Or they might go hire some
thugs to say hey owner

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.050
sell me the house for
less than the market value

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.020
otherwise we're going
to hurt you in some way

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.770
and so in some ways they're infringing

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.710
on those property rights

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.310
or the government might
just come in and say

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.090
we're gonna take that property
from you because we want it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.610
and in those situations property
rights would be weakened,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.680
and what we're going to do

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.970
is a little bit of a thought experiment

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.720
to see why it's so crucial

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.490
for the proper functioning
of a market economy.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.400
And so let's stick with the house analogy.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.646
So let's say that we have some blue houses

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:16.250
in our economy that look like that.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.650
Let's say it's owned by
this person right over here.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's say we have some pink houses

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.670
that look like that.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.260
Let's say it's owned by
that person right over there

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.500
and let's say that we
have some orange houses

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.120
that look something like that.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.070
They have some kind of arch on the top

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.480
and let's say it's owned
by something like this,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.520
and let's say these
people are all interested

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.440
in selling their house.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320
Maybe they're downsizing
or they're retiring

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.830
or they're moving someplace else.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.520
And so there's a market
of potential buyers.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.030
So let me draw the buyers right over here

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.530
and so there might be some people

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.390
and if we have properly
functioning property rights,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.350
there might be some people

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.370
who are really interested
in the blue house

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.950
and so whoever is willing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.240
to pay the most for that
blue house will get it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.130
and so let's say that this person

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.740
is willing to pay I
would say one dollar sign

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.070
for the house and so the ownership

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.030
of the house will go to that person.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.510
Same thing for the pink houses.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.930
Maybe this person right over here

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.450
is the person who really
likes the pink houses.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.630
They pay a different price,
maybe a little bit more.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630
I'll do two dollar
signs to represent that,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.170
and then they will get title to the house

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.210
and maybe a ton of people
are really interested

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.620
in these arched houses

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.380
and maybe they bid for it
and the bidding keeps going

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.280
higher and higher and higher

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.540
and this person wins at the end

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.540
and they have to pay up a lot

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.540
for that orange house
that they get title for,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.010
and let's just assume
that for whatever reason,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.040
that they're all about
the same cost to bill.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.460
Well what would happen
in this market then?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.350
Well home builders or
even people in other types

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.500
of houses will say wow,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.010
I can get a lot more for the orange house.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.830
The market is giving us a price signal.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.060
So this right over here,
this is a price signal.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.020
In fact, they're all price signals,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.100
and when you take 'em together,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.050
you're saying, hey, I get more

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.630
for an orange house than a blue house

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.460
and so maybe if they all
cost the same to build

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.250
we'll start producing more
of these orange houses.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.680
So builders will produce
more of these orange houses

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.390
and maybe some people might
remodel their blue houses

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.930
to have these orange arches on 'em,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.490
and so you could imagine that might happen

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.350
from the price signal

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.210
because it's clear that that's
where users preferences are.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.480
That's where the demand is,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.570
but now let's imagine a
slightly more dystopian world

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.210
and this actually is what
much of human history was

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.590
and even some significant
parts of the world today

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.770
where there aren't clear property rights.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.510
When this person says that
they have this house for sale,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.580
these people are like
is it really your house?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.050
And then this person comes
along and says no it's my house

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.480
and I have this proof that
my grandfather owned it

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.190
and he never sold it to your grandfather

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.490
and then this person
says I have a lot of guns

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.340
and I don't care what y'all say

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.030
and what paperwork you have,
but I'm taking the house.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.610
Well how much would this
person be willing to pay

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.750
this person right over
here in that circumstance?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.970
And so this person is much less likely

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.500
to get these three dollar signs

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.460
This person said hey, this is
kind of a risky investment.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.030
I don't really know if I
take title from this person

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.390
whether it's still my house.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.090
So they're not willing to
give three dollar signs,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.070
they're only willing
to give one dollar sign

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.180
or maybe no dollar signs.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.970
Maybe this house doesn't even sell.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.240
Well then the price
signals have broken down,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.530
and so then in this
market people will tell me

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.540
maybe we'll build more of
the arched orange houses

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.510
because that's what the market demands

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.930
and so you can quickly see

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.390
that when property rights break down,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.740
the market system breaks down

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.990
'cause the market system
is all about people using

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.710
price to figure out how

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.070
much they're willing to pay for things

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.320
but that assumes that
when you get something

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.380
that it's really yours,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.590
that it's not going to be disputed

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.060
and the person you're buying
from really has ownership

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.530
and this break down would often

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.370
be characterized as a market failure.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.290
Now you could say okay there's other types

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.090
of systems that we've talked
about in other videos.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.860
We talk about command economies

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.843
and in the extreme in a command economy,

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:05.280
you have no private ownership of things

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.400
and so you might say
maybe that is a solution

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.450
to this property rights problem,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.880
but command economies have

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.080
significant problems of their own.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.820
In fact, very few of them or
really none of them in history

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.690
have proven to really work

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.900
because they have a
major incentive problem

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.435
because if you're just being told

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.830
what to build by the government,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.970
you're told how to build
it by the government,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.220
you're told who that gets
it by the government.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.290
There's very little incentive

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.400
to try to innovate, to try to build more,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.110
to invest, or whatever else,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.980
and we talk about that in other videos.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.350
So I will let you go there.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.260
This is just an
introduction to think about

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.830
this idea of property rights

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.000
and ask your parents or talk
around or if you are a parent,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.650
look at the world of how
much infrastructure we have

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.200
in a society like the United States

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.800
or in much of the world today

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.913
to enforce property rights.
