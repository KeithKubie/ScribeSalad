1
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.340
You were like,
no,
no.
Well I'm going to do this.
In fact,

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:09.420
you probably didn't even work in the middle of it.
Were you even thinking,
Dang,

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:12.690
this is going long.
Were you ever thinking that it was until afterwards,

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.490
like Dang,
that was a long,
yeah.
That's awesome.
That's a good symptom.
Good.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm happy about that.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.390
Camera one is about to start rolling.
Gotcha.
Where it is.

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.040
I don't feel like wearing headphones today.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.320
Do you want the diva?
No,
no,
no.
It's all good.
No,
no,
no.
Like I don't feel like,

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.290
I just feel like you're getting her like Dang,

10
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:39.180
no time for even putting on the headphones.
Just so fucking task,
uh,
oriented,

11
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.760
saturated and unsaturated.
Ah,

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.310
at these books,
they're all different.
Totally different.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.850
There's no book like this,
by the way.
I liked that book already.

14
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.570
Like remember they get the book,
Mind Games,
I always talk about it's,

15
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.620
it's similar.
This is probably like more,

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.780
it might be significant,
but um,
I can give him,

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.440
it was a lot like that.
I liked it.

18
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.590
You're going to clap this thing out because I'm ready to rock and roll.

19
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.230
If you're regular?
No.
You're hitting rock and roll.

20
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.363
Do I look smaller?

21
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.120
Yeah.
Did you,
are you just cutting weight right now?
I'm not putting,

22
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.770
I just thought I'd been doing Jujitsu.

23
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:26.840
Not as much lifting and then the little pitch,

24
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.040
I was thinking about this today while I was squatting fucking heavy,
sir.

25
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.150
You don't swap do you?
I do.
Oh,
you do?
I do.
Like front.
It's like,

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.410
but you don't have fucking,
you don't have a squat rack at your house.
No.

27
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.190
So I use like kettlebell stuff in that kind of,
no,

28
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:47.560
I don't do that.
Don't give a fuck man squat back squat overhead squat.
No,

29
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.410
you're not in there just fucking getting fucking crazy.
What?
Squats none anymore.

30
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.300
But you used to buy all the truth.
Paul used to fucking know,

31
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.430
even though after football when I was into lifting,
even with Jujitsu,

32
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.250
but oh yeah.
Fucking Bra.
How deep?
Not as deep as go now.

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.480
Okay.
It's called,
what do you call it?
Parallel.
Parallel squat.
Yeah.

34
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.520
That's the official standard for football is okay.
Oh,
all right,
bro.

35
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.340
Keep not good enough.
I'm good enough.
Okay.
No,
no,
no.
Okay.
That's the standard.

36
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.810
So this is,
this is where it is.
This is why I left one of those things.

37
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.871
You're like,

38
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:26.500
would you have to explain that I hate because you're rolling your eyes and your

39
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.480
eyes,
you know.
Well,
at least you know the difference.
I do know the difference,

40
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.560
the difference between going fucking all the way down.
Yeah.
And going parallel.

41
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.490
Yeah.
So there's a big difference.
Huge difference.
Big Difference.
Agree.

42
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.080
Hundreds of pounds potentially,
you know,
maybe,
maybe 10,
a hundred,

43
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.580
150 pounds depending even that,
there's a huge,
huge caveat to huge.

44
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:49.450
Can't get to the point that it's beyond a caveat.
This is,

45
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.010
it's whatever you're used to.
So here and do this,

46
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.270
do this and you can do this applies to bench squat,
whatever.
So you know how,
um,

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.120
like right now let's say like a leg routine is like a kettlebell routine.

48
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.610
And then I'll,
do you know how you rack the two kettlebells?
Yeah.

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.620
And you do squats,
front squats all the way down.
Yeah.
So I got pretty,

50
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.760
I'm pretty used to that now to go all the way down as far as he can

51
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.910
and I'm pretty flexible by the way in that way.

52
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.700
If I were to start going just to parallel right now,

53
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.630
it would be harder because whenever you get used to and try that with bench.

54
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.160
So when I used to bench all the way down in touch.
Cool.
And then you know,

55
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:31.210
I got pretty strong in bench.
Then I see guys,
they're like,
you shouldn't touch,

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.930
you should be like an inch.
And some guys were even mind like two,
three inches.

57
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.800
So I was like,
Oh fuck,
that's easier.
I go all the way down and get the stretch.

58
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.410
What?
That's easier.
They're like,
you're going to let up pounds.
Yeah,

59
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.180
sometimes.
Sure.
But not all the time.
I'll still even,

60
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.380
even if even if you're doing no bounce,
you're still getting a little mounds,

61
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.200
right?
I mean like yeah,
your pins are getting like a little chicken.

62
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.310
Get back after you pens.
Yeah,
sometimes.
Sure.
But that's not the point.

63
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.920
The point is I'd still,
I'd go try it.
I was like,
fuck.
It's way easier.

64
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.160
I can do more.
I do my same weight in its way or you're right,
you're right.

65
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.993
Because

66
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.610
I am used to doing deep squats for so long that when I try like the box squats

67
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.700
or whatever,
but it definitely feels,
it feels harder.
It's harder.
Yeah,
for sure.

68
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.060
You're correct.
And I stopped doing squats.

69
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.730
I'm admin out of slight bit of laziness.
Right?
Cause when,

70
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.440
and this was like when I was like,
this is old,

71
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.490
like when I was a blue belt and I stopped kind of doing like a bunch of legs.

72
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.730
You rationalize it.
Yeah.
So basically but,
but successfully.

73
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:34.270
So when I stopped it and you know you're my leg and I remember Sarah,

74
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.390
he's always telling me this like when we'd be laying down,
you know,

75
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.170
you lay down on the bed or whatever,
you skip leg day.
No,

76
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.720
no she'd say the opposite.
She's like,

77
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.410
look how big your legs are right now cause you hot.
Like I have skinny knees,

78
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.030
you know,
skinny ankles,
you know like so you don't know.

79
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:55.800
You think maybe get a wasting.
But one my,

80
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.170
one of my shorts kind of fall and you see the muscle part,
you know,

81
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.190
it's surprisingly big.
What do you mean?
Like if you're laying down like this,

82
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.780
oh I see what you're saying.
Your short fall down,
fall up,
up.

83
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.430
Technically we'll soul say whatever.
Yeah,
so they fall in reveal.

84
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.300
So that's what she say she be,
look how big your legs or something like cool.

85
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.040
I'm like,
yeah,
they're huge.

86
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.250
But I didn't say that but so later on when I stopped kind of doing like heavy

87
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.780
squats all the time and I was doing Jujitsu,
I could do way more like the leg,

88
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.620
like Moo,

89
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.510
like triangle chokes were way easier and strangely like even going for armbars

90
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:38.200
and transitioning from the bottom and stuff became like a lot more easy.

91
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.370
Hey look,
I understand as time goes on you get better at these things.

92
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.240
Could have been that,
but it seemed a lot easier.

93
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.860
So it's like this is all I'm going to,
you know,
do it.
Yeah.
Big Time.

94
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.900
But thing is,
it's always worked for me.
Yeah,
whatever bro.
All right.

95
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.100
Still

96
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 1>kept doing curls though.
So Kevin,</v>

97
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.280
see obviously you'll get they got the guns to prove that one.

98
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.540
Isn't that funny though.
How like skipping leg days,

99
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.350
this fun kind of fun thing to like why don't they say that about skipping arms

100
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.290
today?
Cause everyone no one skips army.
No,
but that's what I mean like day hurts.

101
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.320
I like it is hard.
Yeah I guess so.
Well I was thinking that,

102
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.120
that's why I was thinking about this today cause I was squatting.

103
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:24.150
I was like I wonder if,

104
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.320
cause I was thinking to myself like you never talk about squatting.
Yeah.

105
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.100
And I'm thinking myself,
I wonder if echo even squats.
Yeah.

106
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.340
Devens cause you've got skinny knees.
Yeah he's giddy ankles.

107
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.200
<v 0>See but see what I mean now you're like all laughing.
Like why is that funny?</v>

108
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:46.340
I have skinny wrists too.
I think it's funny that you said you had skidded me.

109
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.180
Know what that means.
First step skinny me damn boat.

110
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.170
Stand up.
I'll tell us fucking shot.

111
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.170
Uh
Yeah I'll see you about that today.

112
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:05.490
Cause anyway cause you know,
cause

113
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.260
<v 1>you know squats like I was getting taxed today like I was,</v>

114
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.060
I was getting beat down by squats Monday morning.
It's hot in my garage.

115
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.820
The weights are heavy.
I was trying up Italy.

116
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.290
If you ever see me get out the little two and a halfs and put them on like I'm

117
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.400
just trying to push it a little bit.

118
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.630
I did that today and I will do that and I was getting beat down and I was

119
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:32.490
thinking I'm getting beat down.
Does that wait was,
I was like this is like proof,

120
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.430
right?
Like it takes a,

121
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:38.060
takes a certain level of fortitude if you're going to keep going.
I'm,

122
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.650
I'm being straight up w the one workout,

123
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.390
there's one work they got all the hardcore,
the,
the big metcons and all those.

124
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.040
None of those are anything to me compared to like heavy squat day where you're

125
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:54.330
going,
this is the thing.
High Rep heavy squats.
Yeah.
Like 20 rep squats.

126
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:58.440
I'm sure you've heard of this workout.
20 rep squats.
It's,
and you're doing,

127
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.380
we use it,
wait,
that you can do 10 times and you do it 20 times.

128
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.390
No know you'll try to,

129
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.530
well you do it and it's a nightmare.

130
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.600
It almost,
I'm not kidding,
it almost makes me cry.

131
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.810
It almost makes a tear form up in my non shooting.

132
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.380
And so as I was doing that today,
I was like,
yeah,

133
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.720
well I'm not going to tear up in my,
you know,
my shooting guy.
No,

134
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.920
you got stuff to do.
So,

135
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.130
so I was thinking as I was going through this pain,
I was like,
think of myself,

136
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.400
I wonder if echo actually does this.
Cause this is super hardcore.

137
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.980
I'm honored by the way.
And no,
we shouldn't be,

138
00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:41.250
because I was actually questioning,
I wasn't like damn all,
I wasn't like,

139
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.970
Echo does this too.
I was kind of like an echo muscle,
not on the grid.

140
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:49.350
So it's all good.
Yeah.
And,
and then the fact is you did squat.

141
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.430
If you're squatting heavyweights,
like you worry.
That's,
that's,
yeah.
Yeah.

142
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.980
And I know that I know the pain situation.
Sure.
And,

143
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.660
<v 0>uh,
you did give up on them.
Yes.
Oh and I'm in.
Yeah,
I mean technically,</v>

144
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:04.980
I mean squat and they,
come on,
let's face it,
that's a macho thing to be like,
oh,

145
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:05.820
you don't squat.

146
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.220
<v 1>I'm not even that strong.
That's,
that's one of the,</v>

147
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.630
that's one of the jacked up things in and it just like,

148
00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:12.830
I'm not like one of these guys,

149
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.900
like I see the guys that are winning crossfit right now.

150
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.990
It's guys are freaking destroyers.
Dude,

151
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.190
those guys are just snatching insane amount of weights.
I mean like,

152
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.270
yeah,
yeah,
I can't do that.
You can't compare it.

153
00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:30.200
That's like saying fucking my mile time sucks still these college fucking track

154
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:32.160
athletes,
they're my,
you know,
it's like you're,

155
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.550
you're like saying you're a sucks compared to the best guys,
you know,

156
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.160
kind of thing.
So that's true.
But it does still does suck.

157
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.240
Cause like I lift weights.
Yeah.
I don't run,
I think you're strong.
Well,

158
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.600
well let's go into the numbers.
Yeah.
But I'm not,
I'm not saying,
oh,
you know,
hey,

159
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.950
I'm,
I'm trying to run.
If I was trying to run a four minute mile,

160
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.860
then I'd be saying,
Dang,
these guys are so much better than me,
but I'm not.

161
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.750
So I'm not saying that.
Oh,
but you're trying to train these,

162
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.890
trying to be like a little bit stronger.
Can you normal,
what do you,

163
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.370
what do you walk around at?
You wait,
uh,
two 30.

164
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.730
<v 0>Okay.
So two 30 squat.</v>

165
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:08.731
Let's save for a set of 10 if you're getting two 30 if you can get four or five

166
00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:15.550
for 10 that's like good,
good.
I think.

167
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.923
Yeah,

168
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.670
<v 1>I'd say I'd say,
um,
if not,
they're a little below there.</v>

169
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.520
<v 0>Yeah.
That's good.
That's a good squat.
Like the king good.
Like,</v>

170
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.790
like Dang.
That's a good squat.
I'd say less than good.

171
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.230
Like I think 10 would hurt me.
Yeah.
So like you were array,
but either way,

172
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:38.820
that's good.
So if even if you were to go three wheels,
four 10,

173
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.300
that's still good.
It's good.
But it's like,
okay,
it's not impressive,

174
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.160
but it's like,
it's,
I'd say that's fine.

175
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.760
That's a big difference between four or five and three 15 though.
Yeah.

176
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.610
That's a big difference.
Yeah.
Like,

177
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.710
like three 15 I'm here all the way down though.
I think that,

178
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:01.830
I mean sure,
you're used to it.
Good.
Good for you.
Congratulations on the home.

179
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.870
But like when I,

180
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.560
I was like two 42 40 and I was doing four wheels,

181
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:14.760
four 12 that was my first step.
That's all legit.
Yeah.

182
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.073
But it wasn't,
all right.

183
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.780
<v 1>All the way down is two parallel.
But you know,
like I said,
I don't know,</v>

184
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.680
I was always like,
oh yeah,
I was parallel.
But it's really hard to tell.

185
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.480
You know what I mean?
Well,
I'm not trying to say you were cheating,
but yeah,

186
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.840
that's true.
But in my,
in my set number,

187
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.690
rep number five was guy didn't get it.
Rep number seven was a little bit off.

188
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.000
Yeah.
Yeah.

189
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.070
<v 0>Maybe.
But in my eye,</v>

190
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.540
if anyone's going to get the correct formance me because in football they,

191
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.680
they care about that stuff.

192
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.760
You know when you test and you tee I think like twice a year,
fall and spring,

193
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.480
you test your all your wage to do 25 how many reps did you do that for?
Bench.

194
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.150
Yeah.
That's like the big combine.
Yeah.
So when I was playing football,

195
00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:52.960
when a weed,

196
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.580
one 80 I did 17 that's awesome.

197
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.030
Yes.
I was one ed show.
Yeah,
it was.
It was the best one.
You played football.

198
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.270
You you're only one 80 yes.
Oh,
the wide receivers.
Your heaviest.
Well,

199
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:08.440
I started getting a little bit heavier.
Yeah.
Oh,
one 90 maybe.
It was my heavier,

200
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.910
wicked fast day.
I was like on,

201
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.340
I ran for aid.
The same level athlete.
You guys are the same.

202
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.510
He was heavier than me.

203
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.850
You guys are the same level like athletically.
Yeah.
More or less.

204
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.830
He beat me in the 200 meter.

205
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.860
I beat him in the 100 meter dash even though even though he was heavier than

206
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.370
you.
Oh yeah.
That's weird.
That's reversed,
right?
To what the instinct would be.

207
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.120
Yeah.
Maybe the intuitive thought would be if you're heavier,

208
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.890
you beat him on the hundred and he beats you on the 200 yeah.

209
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.040
What was your 40 times four,
four,

210
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:45.820
seven consistently like more than one kind of timer.

211
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.170
Uh,
electronics.
I don't know about electronic.
Yeah.
Well

212
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.890
that's life man.
Keep in mind,
this is in the nineties so,
Hey,
what are you,

213
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:56.724
what are you going to go?

214
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.210
I did two 25 33 times after football day on those bigger though.

215
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.310
That's awesome.
Yeah,
I thought it was pretty solid.
Yeah.
I don't,

216
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:09.880
I haven't had benched in solar.
Came in until you seriously right now.

217
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.120
Like I remember Alan benched in a long time.
Yeah,
I'm with you.

218
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.200
And I benched just to see how we'd feel and it's weird.

219
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:19.270
I feel like all stiff and like Kinda kinda awkward.
Really.
Yeah.

220
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.300
And I could probably do 25 probably 15 times.

221
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.170
Mainly right now 15 times.
Yeah.

222
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.440
Cause with dumbbells I can do my first set with one fifteens pound dumbbells and

223
00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:37.930
I can do 1212 pretty easy like that.
Like if I were to like go all out,

224
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:40.750
I could probably get like maybe 16 of those,

225
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.550
maybe even more with one 15 on an incline to,
by the way,

226
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.980
I don't do flat anymore until like afterwards,
you know,

227
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.760
and flat is strong decline.
No.

228
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.060
Remember decline used to be like you go ahead.
Yeah,

229
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:58.300
you can go heavier because it's less range of motion and yeah,
but no,

230
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:03.100
I've never known.
Never got into that.
That's a weird exercise.
Decline bench.

231
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.960
Yeah.
But yeah,
I think um,
yeah,
but the squat thing,

232
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.310
why is that funny though?
I'm not saying just to you.
I think it's funny too,

233
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:13.930
you know when it's like,
oh they're good.
Skipped leg.

234
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.140
Like you ever seen a guy with big legs and he can squat and he can clean and

235
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.050
this guy's legit.
Like you kind of have this like Dang,
this guy's legit.

236
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:23.080
But then he's like week on top.
Wow.
How come no one teases that guy?

237
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.520
Cause he got strong laggers.
Yeah,
I know Dave.
No that's true.
Because on,

238
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.300
I mean let's face it.
That looks kind of funny too.
Yeah.
But they don't,

239
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.800
they don't teach that.
But are you sensitive about this?
Not enough sensing like,

240
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.720
well you laughed pretty hard earlier.
I was for laughing at the whole situation.

241
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.950
Going back to you said you had skinny that did stand up right now.

242
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.700
Stand up right now.
That did kind of cracked me up.

243
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.310
Yeah.
See how you see how your knees are a we'll say about here.

244
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.600
Oh Damn.
Like I'm skinny,
skinny ankles.

245
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.320
That's how you know what the genetic things should you when we wrote like look

246
00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:12.990
at your fucking receiving,
see how your and your,

247
00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:15.210
I would say yours are thicker than the average person,

248
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.200
but they're not as thick as deans all.
Yeah,

249
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.810
like grandma and I didn't know like I have pretty big muscles.
I understand.

250
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:24.970
<v 1>Oh,</v>

251
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.560
so mine's a little bit bigger than the others in that I thought they would be.

252
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.750
You know what's funny though,
I have,

253
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.230
I have noticed this and if you would have had to hypnotize me,

254
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.650
bring me like back into,
uh,

255
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.800
into the recesses of my mind and if you would've drilled down into the recesses

256
00:15:43.471 --> 00:15:45.810
of my mind under hypnotism.
Yeah.

257
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.730
Hitting those hip under hypnosis you would have found and you would've said,

258
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.910
what is an interesting characteristics characteristic of echos ankles when you

259
00:15:58.231 --> 00:16:00.880
ankle lock them.
I'd been like,
Oh yeah,
you're going to break.

260
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.810
He's got little skinny ankles.
And when I just looked at him,
I was like,
oh,

261
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:05.850
that's right.
I remember that because when I don't,

262
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:08.640
I don't go for your feet a lot,
but I remember when I have gone for them,

263
00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:09.720
I've been like,
oh yeah,
this shit.

264
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.860
You ain't got much going on here.
Yeah.
I,
yeah,

265
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:21.300
the resistance and I felt bad,
feel bad or not bad,

266
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:24.360
but for myself,
you know?
Yeah.
Like Dean,

267
00:16:24.361 --> 00:16:27.030
I'm like trying to do a fucking straight foot lock on him,
and he was like,
Whoa,

268
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.660
dude.
And I'm like,
freaking,
why can't I do like that,
bro?

269
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.790
Dean is a fucking mutant.
