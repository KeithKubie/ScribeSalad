00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.240
 Let's be honest, many of us sit indoors .. throughout the day. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.729
 Either to work or to enjoy watching the latest television series, we simply go out 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.089
 Much. But what happens if we stop going abroad together? 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:19.190
 149600000 km of sunlight is removed from the sun, and launched through the solar system 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.280
 During our air cover, if the timing is correct, it will come down directly on your skin. Feeling 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.470
 Well, right? These sunrays are a series of amazing interactions, which help 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.390
 To maintain your life: "Vitamin sunlight" Vitamin D. 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.940
 Interestingly, some of the cholesterol you consume modifies and stores in your skin 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.510
 When these supernova rays collide with your skin, they change it 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.309
 Cholesterol. New molecules travel through the blood stream to the liver, and there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.519
 It changes again, and then into the kidneys, where it activates biologically. 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.350
 Activated vitamin D works to absorb calcium from your food, eventually leading to bone building 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.440
 And strengthen it. Somehow, your skin eats the sun and the sun is developing your bones! Probably 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 We are not very different from the plant. Without Vitine D, your body will not only suffer 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 Of the lack of minerals in your bones, and leads to diseases such as osteoporosis but 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.469
 You will also see a decrease in immune function. And more, there is evidence that suggests vitamin 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.219
 D. Helps prevent cancer, heart disease and depression. Which probably explains why people are in 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.539
 The colder areas with the lack of daylight light often suffer from "winter blue" 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.520
 But not just the sun's rays and vitamin D, which make the difference. Many studies have shown 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.430
 That your presence in nature has psychological and physical effects on your body. While using 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.229
 Advanced brain imaging techniques show that the brain in nature has higher activity in associated brain regions 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 Stability, compassion and love. On the other hand, it has shown that the man-made environment is produced 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.859
 Energy in brain regions associated with fear and anxiety. 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.320
 On top of all this, if you are often inside you are likely to be sitting. I admit you 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.799
 I was laid back, watching YouTube for hours. Which may seem harmless, but studies 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.310
 Showed that there was a significant health impact associated with sitting time such as height in type II 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 Of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And two other things, a study consisting of more than 200,000 people found 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.569
 A strong relationship between mortality and long sitting time - in other words 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.360
 The more you sit, the more likely you are to die early. The most frightening part is that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.510
 Be regardless of your physical activity. So stand up, go outside and live a little bit 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.730
