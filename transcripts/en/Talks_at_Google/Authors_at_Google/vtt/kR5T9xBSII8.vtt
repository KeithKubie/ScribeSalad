[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.050
JEREMY: So welcome everyone.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.160
Thanks for joining us today
for this very exciting Talks

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.690
at Google with Kevin Kwan.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.980
So-- woo, yeah.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.400
My name is Jeremy, and I
lead the Asian Google network

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.130
here at our Los Angeles office.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.890
We promote the professional
development and community

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.009
involvement of our Googlers
and also bring you great events

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.150
like this.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.994
So if you'd like to continue
seeing these events,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.410
please reach out
to me afterwards.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.910
We're always looking
for volunteers

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.260
to help out with this.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.100
Just to tell you a
little bit about Kevin.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
Born in Singapore, Kevin Kwan
moved to the United States

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.110
when he was 11.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.120
After graduating with degrees
from the University of Houston

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
and Parsons School of
Design, Kevin worked for Andy

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.910
Warhol's "Interview Magazine,"
"Martha Stewart Living,"

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.540
and M&amp; magaz--

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.050
company, the legendary
graphic design firm

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.120
headed by Tibor Kalman.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.980
In 1999, Kevin establish his
own creative consulting firm

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.470
where he became a highly
sought after producer

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.350
of visual projects for
clients such as the New York

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.280
Times, the Museum of Modern
Art, TED.com, and Oprah Winfrey.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
In 2013, Doubleday published
Kevin's first novel,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.510
"Crazy Rich Asians,"
which became

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.700
an international
bestseller and has been

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.850
translated into 13 languages.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.510
Its sequel, "China
Rich Girlfriend,"

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.690
also rose to the top of the best
seller list around the world

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.340
in 2015.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.840
And last week, the final
book in the trilogy,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.190
"Rich People Problems,"
debuted on the New York Times

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190
best seller list at number 12.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.930
Earlier this year,
Warner Brothers

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.730
announced they had greenlit
"Crazy Rich Asians"

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.310
and the movie is
now in production.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.580
Last month SCX
entertainment announce

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.510
that it had acquired rights
to a new scripted drama series

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.970
to be written by Kevin.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.350
Now please join me in
welcoming Kevin Kwan.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.791
KEVIN KWAN: See if this Coke
will slide off or be nice.

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.290
Thanks so much for
being here today.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.123
I really appreciate
your taking the time out

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:36.810
during your lunch to come
hear me say a few things.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.650
It's really a treat to
be here at Google Venice.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.650
Two years ago I had the honor of
speaking at Google headquarters

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
in Mountain View and my mother
happened to be in the Bay Area

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.660
at the time visiting a friend.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.120
So I thought, why don't
I invite her along

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.860
to come check out Google?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.360
Right?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.610
My mom was at the
time, 76 years old.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.540
And she had just been recently
been given her first iPad ever.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.450
And her favorite thing
to do was go onto Google

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.390
and look up all the extremely
rare and deadly types of cancer

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.070
she thought she would get.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.170
So she was excited
to come to Google.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.320
And before I gave
my talk at Google,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.170
we were given a
tour of Google HQ.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.690
Lots of different departments
and divisions and really cool

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.820
stuff that she
couldn't understand.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.480
And my mom is usually a very
talkative, social person,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.700
but she was pretty quiet
through the whole tour.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.970
And I just thought she
was bored out of her mind.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.050
Then we were taken to
the cafeteria for lunch--

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.880
like the main
cafeteria, you know,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.740
where apparently
Larry and Sergey

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.470
have a open house every Friday.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.870
And my mom's face lit up.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.780
I could see she was
impressed by the food,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.060
the amazing selections.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.520
And then when she found
out that food was free

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.580
her eyes went huge.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.100
And you know, I think she went
to the Indian food station

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.830
a couple of times and shoved
some naan into her handbag

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.140
maybe.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.520
So after lunch I gave my talk.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.410
And then there was
a book signing.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.390
And as I sat at the
desk signing books

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.090
for this long line of
people, I could see my mom

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.600
going up and down the
line talking to people.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.790
And I was thinking,
what on earth

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.050
could she possibly be doing?

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.095
This is dangerous.

00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:17.970
You know what I mean?

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.595
Like, is she trying to get some
secret Google code or something

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:21.120
like that?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.790
Or find out more about cancer?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.850
And then as the line
shortened, I could hear her.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.350
And she was saying, to
everyone, excuse me,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.290
could you find my
son a job here?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.720
Are you guys hiring?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.010
Is there something he can do?

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.120
My son is unemployed.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.450
He needs a job.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.200
So after we left
Google finally, she

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.460
said to me in the car, ai-yah,
I wish you could get a job here.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.100
You'd be set.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.520
You'd have health insurance.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.310
You could use the
gym-- the amazing gym.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.630
You can swim.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.820
They have amazing curry.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.980
And I will finally,
finally be proud of you.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.450
So I think you guys--

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.144
some of you here can relate.

00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:06.560
So some of you might know that
my first novel, "Crazy Rich

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.780
Asians," is being made into
a movie by Warner Brothers.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.180
There's been a great deal
of talk and excitement

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
because this is the first
romantic comedy ever

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.660
in Hollywood history to
have an Asian male lead,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.350
an Asian heroine, and--

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.450
thank you.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.420
It's also the first Hollywood
produced studio movie

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.500
in 26 years to feature
an all Asian cast.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.660
And actually only
the second movie

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.370
to do that in all of
Hollywood's history.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.962
So it's pretty incredible
what's happening.

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:41.420
You know, the movie is being
produced by Nina Jacobson, who

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.710
did the Hunger Games movies
which made eight gazillion

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.330
dollars I think.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.430
And John Chu is
directing and he's

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.980
the amazing director of
movies like the Step Up movies

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.080
and, you know, after
"Crazy Rich Asians"

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.800
he's going to do Lin-Manuel
Miranda's "In the Heights."

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.000
he's the super hot director that
brings such an amazing vision

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.044
to the film.

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:03.210
So naturally from the moment
the film was announced,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.180
there was so much excitement
about who is going to be cast.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.520
We found our two
leading ladies early on.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.320
Constance Woo was the
star fresh off the boat,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.350
and is going to play
the American born

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.900
Chinese heroine, Rachel Chu.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.320
And Michelle Yeoh, the legendary
Bond girl who everyone also

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.630
knows as, you know, from
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.540
Dragon," she is going
to be Eleanor Young who

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.780
is the dragon mother-in-law
from hell that

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.660
wants to make Rachel's
life miserable, basically.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.980
So finding all the
actresses-- because it

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.120
was a huge cast and all these
beautiful actresses playing

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.090
roles like Astrid, and
Araminta, and Peik Lin.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.184
That was easy.

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:42.600
There were so many amazing
actresses from all across Asia,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.850
from the US, from
England, and we sort of

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.660
have a dream team assembled.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.320
Gemma Chan, the star of Humans.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.680
Awkwafina, who's going to be
in the new "Ocean's Eight."

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.640
Sonoya Mizuno, who really
stole the show in "Ex Machina"

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.930
and "La-la Land."

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.790
So that was amazing.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.550
But when it came
to casting the men,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.460
especially finding our
leading man, Nicholas Young,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.030
we had an unbelievably
challenging time.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.220
There were some wonderful
character actors

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.630
of Asian descent.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.330
But we suddenly realized that
there are very few actors

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
between the ages of
25 and 35 out there

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.420
who can really fulfill that
romantic leading man role.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.770
You know, who can be the
next Asian Ryan Gosling.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.080
And finding one who could
do a flawless British accent

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.710
was even tougher.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.710
So it surprised all
of us that there

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.210
was such a small
pool of people that

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.280
were available and could do it.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.980
But it really shouldn't
have surprised us.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.490
John Chu and I really quickly
realized that it's really

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.470
a matter of culture.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.210
The both of us
grew up in families

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.450
that immigrated from Asia,
so we knew the issues well.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.520
The simple fact is
that Asian men--

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.530
not just in the US,
but around the world--

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.900
are raised from a
really early age

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.350
to focus on excelling in
the professional realm.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.960
So to go to the best
schools and work at the most

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.210
prestigious companies.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.820
So if you're a good looking,
smart, ambitious young Asian

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.400
guy between 25 and
35, you're most

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.100
likely going to be
a doctor, a lawyer,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.390
or working at Goldman Sachs,
or working here at Google,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.387
don't you think?

00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:18.970
I mean, I can see
probably some of you

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.690
out here that could
have auditioned.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.880
And why didn't you, right?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.450
So that was very
interesting to discover.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.799
And there is little to no
support for Asian boys growing

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:40.280
up to ever become actors,
writists, dancers, you know--

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.840
all of that.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840
And in fact, I think
telling your Asian parents

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.423
you want to go into
acting is probably

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:49.350
worse than telling them that
you got your teacher pregnant--

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.570
your gym teacher, you know.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.270
So this goes back to
my mom and her quest

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.490
for me to work at
someplace like Google.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.850
Yes, there's a part of her
that's so proud of me that

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.540
I've written a book that's--

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.810
she sees on book
shelves at Barnes Noble.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.310
Or like gets angry at them when
they don't have it in stock.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.380
But I truly believe she would
be even happier if I called her

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.520
up and told her tomorrow, hey,
I'm going to go to law school.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.830
That's just the
plain fact of it.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.520
So for me, leading a creative
life for the past two decades--

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.130
going to journalism school,
going to art school,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.350
making experimental films
for weird dance companies

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.390
in New York.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.960
All that has been a
complete act of rebellion.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.884
Quiet rebellion, but a
rebellion nonetheless.

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:35.300
And when we found our leading
man for "Crazy Rich Asians,"

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.870
Henry Golding, who is half
Malaysian and half British

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.440
and who has grown up in Malaysia
and now lives in Singapore,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.780
I realized we had
so much in common

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.624
because he was also a
rebel in his own way.

00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:49.790
He never went to university.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.310
He dropped out of
school at age 15

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.360
and went and apprenticed
at a hair salon.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.440
That was the fun, cool,
creative thing to do.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.160
And he actually became a
leading hairdresser in London,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.990
and just last week cut my
hair on the beach in Malaysia.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.070
So it's really surreal to get
your hair cut by the leading

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.520
man that you've
created in a book,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.070
and now he's cutting your hair.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.660
But it was a great haircut.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.320
Anyway, at age 23,
he left London and he

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.630
was so unbelievably
handsome, everyone

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.963
kept saying you should be an
actor, you should an actor.

00:10:22.963 --> 00:10:24.730
So he moved to Asia
to pursue that.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.230
And the rest is history.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.050
And then as I began
meeting all the other cast

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.000
members, all of the actors--

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.980
Ronnie Chang, who is so
amazing in the Daily Show,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.120
Remi Hii who is from Marco Polo,
Chris Pang, just to name a few.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.600
I realize we all
shared similar stories

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.072
of this sort of quiet rebellion
in one way or another.

00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:47.780
So I just got back,
as I said, from being

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.670
on the set of "Crazy
Rich Asians" in Malaysia

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.100
and at first I wasn't
planning to go.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.860
I mean, there was so much
happening with my book being

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.240
launched, everything like that.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.760
And I didn't want my presence
to really distract the cast

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.830
and distract John.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.160
But one by one, the actors
started contacting me.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.840
And I would get
texts from Henry,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.950
like why aren't you here?

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.260
Like, you have to be here
to see the production.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.210
And Chris Pang, who is the star
of Netflix series Marco Polo,

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.280
he said, get your ass on a plane
right now and come to Malaysia.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.250
Something very special is
happening here right now.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.690
So I did.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.410
I went to KL two weeks
ago, and arriving

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.550
on the set of the film--

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.120
which was this historic
mansion they found on top of KL

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.880
that they are using to
be Tyersall Park, which

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.740
is the mansion for my books--

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.290
it was one of the most surreal
experiences of my life.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.180
You know, to sort
of see the sets,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.810
see these settings
I only wrote about,

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.190
and to meet these characters
that were only in my mind,

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.560
be real and living people.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.920
It was really amazing
and kind of surreal.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.150
But the most wonderful thing I
don't think I'll ever forgot,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.210
was just kind of the
excitement and the look

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.330
of exhilaration in the
eyes of all these actors.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.820
And I realized-- I mean, I
realized that for most of these

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.070
actors that's assembled here,
the ones especially that

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.420
didn't grow up in Asia, this was
a life changing moment for them

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.690
because for the first time,
these actors and actresses from

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.326
the US, from Canada,
from Australia,

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:20.450
from all around the world--

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.950
they were getting
to play roles that

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.170
weren't based on stereotypes.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.220
They weren't playing supporting
roles in white men's movies.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.370
They weren't Asian mafia
gangsters, or Vietnamese call

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.440
girls, or that
computer geek that

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.810
can hack through the
firewall in three seconds.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.310
Even if they had
the smallest parts,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.768
they all felt like they were
being treated like leading men

00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:43.280
or women.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.889
They each had trailers.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.930
That had dedicated assistants
and makeup artists.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.925
And they, for the first time
ever, they all felt like stars.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.430
Interestingly enough, I
also met some of the actors

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.679
in the film that
came from Asia--

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.720
you know, the ones from
Singapore, Malaysia, Hong

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.520
Kong, China.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.620
And for them, they were
excited to be in the film,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.930
but it wasn't that
big a deal for them.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.280
This was another movie.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.430
A great movie and part
of, but another movie.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.187
And one night after
the shoot at wrap,

00:13:12.187 --> 00:13:14.270
a whole group of actors
from all around the world,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.970
we sat around having drinks.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.850
And all the actors began
to share their experiences

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.950
of growing up where they were,
whether it was Melbourne,

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.800
Australia or in the middle
of the country in the US,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.890
and how they had
all come to acting.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.146
One Asian-American actor
talked about how incredible

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.520
it was for him to
be in this film

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.750
because for once he wasn't the
token Asian guy, and the only

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.592
Asian guy in the whole
cast of white people.

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:44.300
And he could finally
play a role where he

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.510
was an attractive, desired man.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.370
And that was huge for him.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.370
And it was amazing just to
watch the reaction of the Asians

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.020
based in Asia, You the actors.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.810
Because for them,
it was a revelation.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.600
These people-- actors like
Pierre Png of Singapore--

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.430
he's the Brad Pitt
of Singapore--

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.385
or Carmen Soo, who is like the
Jennifer Aniston of Malaysia--

00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:06.900
you know, Malaysia's Darling--

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.360
they've only acted in
films with other Asians.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.980
And they're huge stars
in their own country.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.500
So for them, they really had
no concept of the challenges

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.570
Asians in other
countries face trying

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.251
to break into the creative arts.

00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:23.750
And a few of them didn't even
know about the whole Hollywood

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.674
whitewashing controversy at all.

00:14:26.674 --> 00:14:28.840
So they were absolutely
floored to discover all this

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.290
and to learn that the movie
has become kind of symbolic

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.240
of a whole other movement.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.360
So I have to confess, I was like
one of those Singapore actors

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.550
not too long ago myself.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.320
When I wrote my first
novel, I was simply

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.650
trying to write a funny book
that my friends could enjoy.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.192
I never imagined it would ever
be published, first of all.

00:14:50.192 --> 00:14:51.900
We have my amazing
agent in the audience,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.483
Alexandra Machinist
to thank for that.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.920
I never imagined it would
make any sort of impact.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.950
And it didn't really
even hit me until I

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.540
was touring for the
first book in Toronto

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.750
and I met a journalist
who was interviewing me,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.120
and he told me that he
had first found the book

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.630
and was very skeptical of it.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.300
"Crazy Rich Asians,"
what is this?

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.100
Is this going to be another
book that offends Asians?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.870
But he decided to read it.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.040
And he told me he read the book
cover to cover in one night

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.110
and when he was finished,
he started crying.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.110
And he said, I didn't cry
because of your story.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.870
I cried because, for the
first time in my life,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.060
I felt that I had read a
book where I could truly

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.120
identify with the characters.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.270
I was reading about a guy
that seemed kind of like me,

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.990
who's empowered, who's creative,
who's confident and smart,

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.210
and who doesn't live his
whole life being wrapped up

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.319
in the issue of being Asian.

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:50.860
So I found a really
interesting quote

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.280
from the playwright,
David Henry Hwang.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.770
And he was talking about
why the top movie stars

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.920
who are of Asian descent who
make it big in Hollywood,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.460
they're all native born Asians--

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.370
you know, Jet Li, Jackie
Chan, Chow Yun Fat.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.520
And he says, why is it that
the most bankable Asians that

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.880
have emerged from this tend
to be foreign born Asians

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.050
as opposed to
American born Asians?

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.550
I think Asians who
grew up in Asia

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.770
aren't wrestling with
identity questions

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.440
as Asians who grew
up in America.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.730
Since they grew up
not in the minority,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.650
they had a sense of themselves
that wasn't compromised.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.190
And that observation for me
was sort of an aha moment.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.452
I mean, I moved from
Singapore when I was 11

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.910
and I had grown up
in a world where

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.890
I was part of the ruling class.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.530
So I never realized
how much help that was,

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.730
having that beginning
in Asia that helped me

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.170
when I moved to the US.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.210
And I think, really, I
would have never dared

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.180
write a book called "Crazy Rich
Asians" if I'd grown up here.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.630
So I really hope that as
more movies, TV shows, books,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.270
creative content,
whatever, gets dispersed

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.830
into the world featuring
diverse international casts--

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.349
not just Asians,
but of all races--

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.160
acting alongside Western actors
on an equal playing field,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.569
new generations
of kids will feel

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.020
empowered to make creative
choices with their lives.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.960
You know, to rebel, to
become artists, or writers,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.940
or dancers, or go to
film school, or art

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.790
school, or acting
school, and to be

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.890
able to make their moms proud.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.660
Even if, like me, they
can't get a job at Google.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.160
Thank you.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.720
JEREMY: Thanks again for
coming to join us today.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.630
Thank you all in the room here.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:49.090
And we all want to say hi
to our live stream, where

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.969
AGN is in 10 different offices
across the states here.

00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:52.802
KEVIN KWAN: Oh, god.

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:54.970
JEREMY: No worries.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.510
I'll get you the
numbers afterwards

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.870
for how many live stream
participants we had.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.560
We also have an
online forum where

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.940
people submitted questions.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.180
So we have 15 questions
here, 41 votes.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.120
So I'm going to ask is
in order of popularity.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.620
But definitely we
want to open it up

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.920
to the audience for any
questions that you all have.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.570
We have this very exciting cash
box in the back of the room.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.520
We'll start throwing
that around.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.690
Don't be afraid of it.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.860
It's foamy.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.430
It's soft.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.660
It's like a pillow.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.330
So embrace it.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.310
Don't avoid it.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.220
So Sage will start tossing
that around in a little bit.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.670
But to kick us off, I'll go
ahead and ask a question here.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.611
This is from Kelly Bailey
in our New York office.

00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:42.110
Hi, Kelly.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.985
KEVIN KWAN: New York!

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.480
JEREMY: What do you
attribute your book's

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.260
widespread popularity
amongst American audiences,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.690
both Asian and non Asian?

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.240
Were there any conscious
things you considered

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.910
to appeal to a wider
audience while writing,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.880
or was this just a
happy coincidence?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.782
P.S., love your
books, smiley face.

00:19:05.782 --> 00:19:06.740
I hope I captured that.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.735
KEVIN KWAN: I really didn't have
any specific audience in mind

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:11.360
when I first wrote
"Crazy Rich Asians."

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.970
It was really-- I was writing it
for my friends because I would

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.390
always--

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.790
I would come back from Asia
with all these crazy stories

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.800
about people like that, and they
would be like, write it down.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.050
Write it down, make it a book.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.690
And so I really began it as
a collection of short stories

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.490
that I would circulate
to friends of mine

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.980
in New York who
instantly happened

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.010
to be a lot of Europeans and--

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.730
a lot more white people
than Asians, I have to say.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.660
So it never was meant for
an Asian audience, per se.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.530
And I just think that what
I found, going to book clubs

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.560
and really meeting fans
from all over the US

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.660
who tend to
predominantly be white--

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.750
you know, I think that's really
80% of my core audience--

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.700
everyone just wants
fresh new stories.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.420
Everyone wants to be transported
to a new place, a new world

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.770
to discover something new,
and to get lost in a story.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.030
And this connected.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.140
This was a new story.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.340
It wasn't just the same
old boy meets girl--

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.220
not to condemn or in
any way through a shade

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.387
at Nicholas Sparks,
because everyone--

00:20:12.387 --> 00:20:14.720
all his characters are beautiful
blonde people that live

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.822
in North Carolina by the beach.

00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:19.954
People were ready
for something new.

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:21.120
And that's what they wanted.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.300
And I think
Asian-Americans actually

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.120
were the second wave that came.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.580
Because at first I think
there was a lot of hesitance.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.560
What is this book?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.410
There was suspicion,
like, is this

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.950
going to portray
us in a bad way?

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:38.060
But as the word got out, I think
I was embraced by that audience

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.260
too.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.490
So I'm really thankful for that.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.310
And in Asia, it was
a hit from day one.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.980
They were ready for it
because they see this world

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.970
every single day.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.520
They see the obnoxious
20-year-old couples

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.910
in Rolls Royces, things like
that, and they were like, wow,

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.000
this is fun.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.460
We get this immediately.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.420
So it's had this lovely
sort of ripple effect.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.410
JEREMY: Awesome.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.260
Cool.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.559
Anyone in the audience?

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.100
Should we throw the
foam ball around?

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.250
Who's our brave first
question in the audience?

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:12.880
Yay.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.764
All right, up front.

00:21:15.764 --> 00:21:17.689
AUDIENCE: Ready to
catch the cash box?

00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:18.980
KEVIN KWAN: Catch the cash box.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.830
You can't ask a question
till you catch the box.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.440
AUDIENCE: OK, so I've--

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.130
huge fan.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.587
I've already read the book.

00:21:26.587 --> 00:21:27.420
Id love to ask you--

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.060
KEVIN KWAN: The new one.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.700
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.336
Of course, preordered it.

00:21:31.336 --> 00:21:32.960
I'd love to ask your
questions on that,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.510
but I realize that might
spoil it for everyone.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.860
So one question I have is,
it's definitely clear that--

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.770
or maybe I'm assuming-- but in
the "Crazy Rich Asians" book,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.660
it seems like a
lot of the stories

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.487
are inspired from
real experiences.

00:21:47.487 --> 00:21:49.070
And then when you
talk about your mom,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.790
we were both joking that
sounds a lot like Mrs. Bing.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.770
So I'm curious to know, like,
obviously this is fiction.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.320
But can you elude more
on the aspects that

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.050
might be more closer to
reality, or things that you

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.000
might see more directly?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.090
KEVIN KWAN: Almost everything
in my books I've seen

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.730
or in some way
experienced in my life.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.930
Like, I can't-- I have
no imagination, really.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.660
I'm just-- serious, I'm a
social observer, basically.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.790
And I've seen these things
and I'm changing enough

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.260
to disguise people and not
get sued, or get killed--

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.260
you know what I mean.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.240
But, yeah, I couldn't
make this stuff up.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.570
Plastic surgery for a fish?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.320
I could not make that stuff up.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.560
So a lot of it-- and the
characters, a lot of them

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.670
are inspired by real people.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.754
So they're amalgams of
different real people.

00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:39.170
AUDIENCE: Who are
you in the book?

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.503
KEVIN KWAN: I'm not in the book.

00:22:40.503 --> 00:22:43.310
I'm just the boring guy
that's at the parties,

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.950
being very awkward, watching
all these fabulous people

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.720
do their thing.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.960
AUDIENCE: So you've known
someone who has been--

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.020
received a ton of food, a
ton of wine, and then in,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.870
"China Rich Girlfriend," Rachel
gets like basically ransacked

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.310
into doing a procedure to
try and see if she's pregnant

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.340
or she's ovulating.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.870
Did that happen in your life?

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.110
KEVIN KWAN: Oh, yeah.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.984
That really happened.

00:23:03.984 --> 00:23:06.980
Someone I know got
ambushed into having

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.310
to submit to very
invasive medical tests,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.080
because the family
wanted to know, like,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.696
is this a viable
woman for our family?

00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:16.800
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.300
KEVIN KWAN: I mean,
it's outrageous.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.850
It's kind of
offensive, actually.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.080
But I turned it into
a joke in the movie.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.220
Yeah.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.920
Funny.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.200
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, like, so much

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.360
of the first book, even
the whole series, talks

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.450
about these families want to be
secret and hiding their wealth,

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.050
right?

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.830
So how do you think the Asians
are in Singapore and Malaysia,

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.190
react to the rich
kids of Instagram,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.130
like Dorothy Wang who is
flaunting her wealth--

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.687
like Asian wealth in public?

00:23:45.687 --> 00:23:47.270
Like, do you feel
like that-- which is

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.692
such a contrast to your book.

00:23:48.692 --> 00:23:50.900
KEVIN KWAN: I think there
are so many different types

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.360
of wealthy people in Asia now.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.540
And there are the sort of
Dorothy Wang equivalents, who

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.740
are loving this and love it.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.900
And they interact as much
on social media themselves.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.640
But then there's also
another, you know--

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.030
the older money tends to
really kind of look down

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.900
on the new money.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.550
And so, of course, for
them, they're like OK,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.360
you want to go do this?

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.170
OK, get kidnapped.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.350
That's fine.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.390
Fine by me.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.690
A lot of the secret--
secrecy is really protective

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.130
because, you know,
these families

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.040
have known the repercussions
of wealth for generations.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.797
So it's not being
secret for the sake

00:24:21.797 --> 00:24:23.630
of being secretive,
it's secretive because--

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.300
in their past, like,
shit has happened.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.130
Family members have been
kidnapped or extorted

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.620
and all these
things have happened

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.270
to really force
families to really

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.710
be much more kind of private.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.630
AUDIENCE: We can keep going.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.350
JEREMY: How about we
toss it back to our folks

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.420
over in New York City?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.990
Gloria asks our
next question here.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.750
What inspired you
to become a writer?

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.690
And what challenges did
you face on your journey?

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.595
And how did you overcome them?

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:58.870
KEVIN KWAN: Oh, wow,
how long does she have?

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.380
JEREMY: She got four votes,
so it's pretty high up there.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.900
KEVIN KWAN: OK, cool.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.050
You know, I always--

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.540
from high school
and on to college,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.719
I studied creative writing.

00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:09.010
I always wanted to be a writer.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.468
I felt that that
was the first time

00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:12.450
I could really express
myself creatively

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.490
in any meaningful way.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.390
So I went to school.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.880
I got my first degree in
journalism and creative writing

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.960
and I graduated.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.396
And I couldn't make
a living, basically.

00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:22.770
So I did what
everyone else does.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.600
I went back to school.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.760
I went to art school, where it's
even harder to make a living.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.090
But, you know, I had this
idea that I'm a great writer.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.520
I'm a great communicator.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.680
And if I can learn all
these amazing multimedia

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.730
skills like web design and video
design and interactive design,

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.580
and I can bridge those two, I'll
be like this bad ass content

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.560
creator on all ends.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.440
And that never
happened, of course.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.120
So I spent 15 years sort of--

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.050
I fell into the consulting world
where I worked for companies

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.770
like TED.com.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.980
I helped to launch
their website reboot.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.440
And I would produce these
massive coffee table

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.197
books for Oprah Winfrey, and for
famous architects, and actors,

00:26:03.197 --> 00:26:04.030
and stuff like that.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.610
So I just kind of
fell into a world

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.750
where I could make money,
literally, and support myself

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.690
in New York, which
was not cheap.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.740
And then in 2010, my dad died.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.960
And that was a big wake
up call, because I always

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.624
knew I wanted to write
a book, sort of inspired

00:26:21.624 --> 00:26:22.290
by my childhood.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.750
And I always thought, I'll
wait till I'm retired.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.850
I'll do it when I'm 65.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.970
And losing my dad,
and also talking

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.970
with him about my childhood
and we spent a lot of time

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.280
together in his final
months, it kind of

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.837
refreshed all that for me.

00:26:36.837 --> 00:26:37.920
And I said, you know what?

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.040
This is the time to do it.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.706
Like, I'm not going
to wait till I'm 65.

00:26:40.706 --> 00:26:42.697
I might not live till I'm 65.

00:26:42.697 --> 00:26:45.030
So I'm going to do it now and
just make it fun, and just

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.140
write it for my friends--

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.860
or for myself, just to
remember these stories.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.080
And that's kind
of what happened.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.660
And then Alexandra
got my manuscript.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.640
I think you were told
to throw it away, right?

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.380
Or to reject it.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.950
She was told to reject it.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.100
And she didn't reject it.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.240
And here we are now.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.640
Yeah.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.630
JEREMY: Magic happened.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.650
KEVIN KWAN: Magic happened.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.230
JEREMY: All right, who
has got the cash box?

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.360
KEVIN KWAN: You need to
throw it back over there.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.150
Right behind you.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.950
AUDIENCE: I kind
of, like you, also

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.310
always wanted to write
a book, but ended up

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.949
studying computer science.

00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:26.490
I actually grew up
in Singapore and--

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.100
KEVIN KWAN: I can tell.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.470
AUDIENCE: --came to
the US for college.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.700
But I also took creative
writing classes in college.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.430
And what they taught to us
was to write what you know.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.577
But what I knew always seemed
so foreign from what everybody

00:27:38.577 --> 00:27:39.660
else in class was writing.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.576
And I was like, there's
no way anybody's going

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:43.620
to be able to relate to this.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.152
And--

00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:46.110
KEVIN KWAN: That's exactly
what I thought, too.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.030
That's why I thought
it was unpublishable.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.410
But I sort of went for it.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.810
Sorry to interrupt
your question.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.230
No, that's inspiring to me,
because when I read your book,

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.590
I was like, this is what I know.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.590
And I'm-- maybe not particularly
that world, but it's Singapore.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.290
And it's what I grew up
in, and I've always--

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.622
I was-- I've been
trying to write things

00:28:05.622 --> 00:28:07.080
set in America,
because that's what

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.140
everybody seems to want to read
and to know how to read here.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.207
But I think your
book has given me

00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:14.040
that insight that maybe
it's possible for me

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.915
to write what I know.

00:28:14.915 --> 00:28:17.986
So maybe it's more of a comment
than a question, so, thank you.

00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:19.610
KEVIN KWAN: I think
it's very possible.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.420
And I think
publishers out there--

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.060
not just publishers, but
people in film, people in TV--

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.280
they're looking for
fresh ideas that

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.390
aren't just the same stories set
in the same places, especially

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.380
now.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.885
So I would encourage
you to just go for it.

00:28:33.885 --> 00:28:36.510
AUDIENCE: Is this something you
knew before you started writing

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.340
or is this what you've
learned in your experience?

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:38.890
KEVIN KWAN: That's what I--

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.070
I mean, that's what
I've learned, really,

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.377
just in my experiences for
the last five, six years.

00:28:44.377 --> 00:28:45.210
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.500
Well, thank you.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.710
KEVIN KWAN: I think there's
a question back there,

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:48.720
the guy in the fedora.

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:52.310
JEREMY: Yeah, good catch.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.935
AUDIENCE: Hello

00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:53.590
KEVIN KWAN: Hi.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.700
Very nervous, sorry, I rarely
talk in front of people.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.060
But I just wanted to say
that it's really inspiring

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.950
and I'm really grateful to have
you here and experience you

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.210
coming to Google and
giving pretty much

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.690
your life story in short.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.770
And I-- it's funny
enough, because my wife,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.350
she's a Asian-American
writer-- or is aspiring--

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.650
and she's pushing out
a novel now, hopefully.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.781
And she read your book--

00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:30.357
I'm sorry, "Rich People
Problems," "Crazy Rich Asians."

00:29:30.357 --> 00:29:32.690
And she said, about "Crazy
Rich Asians," the same thing,

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:37.880
that she cried because it
inspired her because she's,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.330
as an Asian-American
and not a native Asian,

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.000
that she has to deal
with that problem.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.730
And she struggles
with her image a lot.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.090
And watching her go through that
process of writing and saying,

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.360
I can't do this, and she's
already like 300 pages in.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.070
She's like, I don't
know what else to do,

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.986
or what else to write.

00:29:55.986 --> 00:29:56.915
It's-- she struggles.

00:29:56.915 --> 00:29:58.040
KEVIN KWAN: She's doing it.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.840
KEVIN KWAN: I can tell
that she's really doing it.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.360
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.193
And I tell her this.

00:30:01.193 --> 00:30:05.620
And I said look, Kevin did it.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.930
And it's funny because, I
say look, he's doing it.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.200
And that's all you have to say
to yourself that you can do it

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.550
as well.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.590
And she said-- she told me to--

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.480
she texted me
saying, oh, my god,

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.992
you need to tell him,
and ask his agent,

00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:22.200
that if she could read my
writing and all this stuff.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.080
But I just wanted to say--

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.280
AUDIENCE: It's cool.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you Alexandra.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.286
But I just wanted to say,
from the bottom my heart--

00:30:28.286 --> 00:30:31.940
because it inspired me too.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.600
Because I actually know John
M Chu as well, because I've

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.920
worked with the LXD, and he
has produced that film series,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.180
because I'm a aspiring
dancer as well.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.844
So, small world, but I just
want to say thank you very much.

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:47.760
KEVIN KWAN: Thank you.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.593
And I just want to--

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.060
tell your wife, you
know, one page at a time.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.510
And every day I had self-doubt.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.300
And everyday I was thinking,
why the hell am I doing this?

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.890
But some thing made me just
keep going until I was done.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.570
So good luck to her.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.280
Thanks.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.530
There's a question back there.

00:31:13.417 --> 00:31:14.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, Kevin.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:14.994
KEVIN KWAN: Hi.

00:31:14.994 --> 00:31:16.660
AUDIENCE: I'm so happy
to be here today.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.394
I'm actually from
The New York office.

00:31:18.394 --> 00:31:19.060
KEVIN KWAN: Yay.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, really
glad to be in town.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.240
I had a question for you, and
maybe this is a little deeper

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.120
beyond the movie.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.850
But I wanted to ask you how
you would address the identity

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.590
crisis between first and
second generation Asians today?

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.040
So I'm kind of a border first
generation, second generation

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.330
Asian.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.250
I came here when I
was around 2 and 1/2

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.760
and grew up in a very rural
part of South Carolina.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.200
And now I'm living in the city.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.810
And I feel like a lot of
the issues in your book,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.065
I can relate to, but at
the same time I can't--

00:31:52.065 --> 00:31:57.400
I can relate to in a sense where
my removed family on WeChat

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.205
are posting about a
lot of these things

00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:00.330
that they're going through.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.340
But that I'm living
in a countryside,

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.100
right, growing up and playing
basketball or riding a scooter.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.220
So how do you address people who
are in this interstitial place

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.820
then?

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.970
How do you bridge that gap?

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.750
KEVIN KWAN: I wish I
had the answer for you

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.390
because I'm trying to
figure it out myself.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.480
And I think for me,
the creative process

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.810
has been really healing
and really enlightening.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.340
As I wrote, I was beginning
to understand my family more,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.909
and situations the
characters would go through

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:33.450
are a lot of situations
I go through.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.970
The struggle between
family commitment

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.400
and your own
personal fulfillment,

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.000
that I think is one of the core
issues of the intergenerational

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.370
struggles within the
Asian communities--

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.950
not just in the US,
but in Asia, too.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.070
I think that's a big thing
that's really happening.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.332
And we're all
muddling through it.

00:32:53.332 --> 00:32:55.290
And I think you see the
characters in my books,

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.850
too, might have a
billion dollars,

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.160
might be beautiful like
Astrid, but they're still

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.590
dealing with their
mothers and their fathers,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.700
and the repercussions
of their actions.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.840
So my formula was
to just be creative.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.920
And to just really tried to
find voice to my expression,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.800
and that for me has been really
healing and very enlightening.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.230
So I hope you find yours

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.396
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.447
AUDIENCE: Hey, Kevin.

00:33:35.447 --> 00:33:36.780
Been meaning to read your books.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.840
Haven't yet, but I will now
that I've-- you know, you came.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.810
Anyway, I realize this is
probably beyond your expertise

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.790
but since you study
human nature and stuff

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.040
I thought I'd ask you anyway.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.800
I have a one-year-old boy
and another girl on the way.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.950
I was trying to figure out,
I'm to be raising them here

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:53.790
in California.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.340
They're going to be
an ethnic minority.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.800
I think Asians are 12% of
the state or something, still

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.680
pretty minorityish.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.920
Do you feel like it's,
overall, more productive

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.750
for children to have their
ethnic identity emphasized

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.489
and be like, this is who you
are, your identity, blah, blah?

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.909
Or more deemphasized,
like, you know,

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.620
just play the cards you're
dealt. Don't worry about it.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.500
Just do your best, et cetera?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.610
KEVIN KWAN: Wow.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.480
I don't feel I can really answer
that with any true expertise.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.110
I think, first of all, it's
great that you're here in LA,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.750
because I think we see so
much more diversity here

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.480
than almost anywhere
else in the nation.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.562
You're not in South
Carolina in a rural town.

00:34:35.562 --> 00:34:37.020
I grew up in a town
where I-- there

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.020
were really three other Asians.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.800
But I didn't have the sort of
identity issues that they had.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.179
I realize that now.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:46.650
And I realize now
why they hated me

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.370
because I would interact
so freely with everyone,

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.909
whereas they really felt
siloed in this Asian world.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.300
I think you have to find a
balance where you can raise

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.290
them to be proud of their
identity, and the history,

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.380
and the amazing legacy
of where they come from.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.420
I don't know if you're
ethnic Chinese or Korean?

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.710
AUDIENCE: I am, but my
wife's Filipino, so--

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.320
ish.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.000
KEVIN KWAN: I mean,
two amazing cultures.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.180
So I think if you can balance
that with also integrating them

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.130
into this world, but
also showing them

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.610
how great their ancestry was.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.470
If you can travel with them back
to Asia or to the Philippines--

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.380
I mean, I think Filipinos
are just so cool--

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.430
one of the coolest
cultures in the world.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.669
I think that will really help
them bridge the two worlds.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:38.460
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:38.970
Thanks.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.761
KEVIN KWAN: Thanks.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.249
JEREMY: Oh, that was close.

00:35:45.249 --> 00:35:46.040
Good throw, though.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.480
AUDIENCE: So I ask this question
on Dory, but no one voted it,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.930
so I'll just ask
anyway, on my own.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.190
Yeah, I read all three books.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.770
And I feel like they're
really well tied together.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.450
So I'm just curious,
did you have

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.000
a kind of a vision for a
trilogy when you first started?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.890
Or did you just write
and go along with it

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.960
and refer back to the
first book when trying

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.250
to tie everything together?

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.060
KEVIN KWAN: I
really had a vision.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.143
I really wanted to write--

00:36:12.143 --> 00:36:14.150
one, I knew the story
I wanted to tell.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.750
And I knew would take like
1800 pages to tell it.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.360
And I knew that that
would never get published.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.880
And so, I thought trilogy
was the way to go with that.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.490
And I'm lucky I actually
got to write three books

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.140
and really tell the full story.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.752
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:33.752 --> 00:36:35.210
JEREMY: Going off
of that question,

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.280
I just want to ask this
one from the online forum.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.390
Lauren from New York
asks if you can tell us

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.090
about some crazy rich
Asian experiences

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.500
that you've had like
personally in your own life.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.140
I know you said that you're
not in the books themselves,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.580
but how about, like, anything
that maybe didn't make it

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.230
into the book, that didn't
make it into these three books?

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.770
KEVIN KWAN: There's so much.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.395
Where to begin?

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.730
I'm totally stumped
at the moment

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.870
because, you know-- let's see.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.340
I've been to crazy weddings,
for example, that were

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.210
even crazier than the books--

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.480
than what I describe
in the books.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.329
So that's one of them.

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:20.370
Keep telling the stories.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:28.640
Weddings involving three palaces
in Europe, in one wedding,

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.360
things like that.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.479
And amazing ice
sculptures and little kids

00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:34.770
getting their tongues stuck
licking the ice sculptures,

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.350
and, you know.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.195
It's just a very interesting
and varied world.

00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:40.070
And it's more about--

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.860
I remember characters,
more, and meeting

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.500
these strange,
interesting characters.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:51.150
When I was in Shanghai
there was this person

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.850
that wanted to meet me
because he had read my books.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.750
And so it was sort of
very covertly set up.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.810
And he took me to
his private club.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.300
And he's one of
the seven members

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.260
of this very private club
that only has seven members,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.360
because it's so exclusive.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.260
But it was this vast estate
in the middle of Shanghai--

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.230
this amazing huge mansion
with gardens and sculptures

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.900
and water features and
private chefs, just

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.950
to entertain seven
people and their guests.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.730
So it's mind blowing,
what's happening out there

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.490
that I've been lucky.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.862
Or unlucky to have witnessed.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.180
JEREMY: Will go ahead and go
for another Dory question here

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.440
and then we'll wrap up
in just a little bit.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.860
So if there are any last
questions in the audience,

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.630
definitely tee that up.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:50.780
Grace in Mountain View asks,
career tracks in liberal arts

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.720
are generally not very
popular or strongly enforced

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.120
in the Asian culture.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.760
What kinds of
obstacles and pressures

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.680
did you face as an Asian writer?

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.160
And what did you
learn in the process?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.090
KEVIN KWAN: You know I
was really lucky because I

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.810
had parents that
were actually very

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.090
open to my doing crazy things.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.540
As much as my mom wanted me
to be a lawyer or a doctor

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.050
or to work at Google,
she didn't mind

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.720
that I went off and did this
strange thing that she couldn't

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.240
even explain to people, like,
what is a creative consultant?

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.020
You know, I can't even
explain it most of the times.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:37.770
But I think that the struggle
really was all internal.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.980
It's a struggle of self-doubt.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.130
And as soon as I
began to write it,

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:47.900
you begin to see inroads as to
how you can make this happen.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.340
So for me, I very quickly
was able to find an agent who

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.720
wanted to rep the book.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.570
So I didn't have a struggle
that I think a lot of authors

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.280
go through for years
and years and years.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.738
I have friends who have been
writing their novels for seven

00:40:00.738 --> 00:40:03.470
years, or have
submitted their novels

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:09.890
to like 30 agents or publishers
who don't have the same luck.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.050
And I don't know
what the answer is.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.730
It's a tough, tough business.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:17.000
I think any creative endeavor
is a tough, tough business.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.010
And you just have to want it bad
enough, and to be persistent,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.420
I think.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.114
Did I answer the question?

00:40:26.114 --> 00:40:27.010
JEREMY: I think so.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.459
Persistency is key.

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.250
That's where I got.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.770
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.590
JEREMY: All right.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.460
Any last cash box questions?

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.412
KEVIN KWAN: I think
there's one more from--

00:40:39.412 --> 00:40:41.120
AUDIENCE: So, so much--
did I turn it on?

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.619
Yeah.

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:45.050
So, so much of the
book is wonderful food,

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.275
amazing fashion,
beautiful watches, gowns!

00:40:48.275 --> 00:40:50.570
Like, where did you
get all that from?

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.830
Is it from-- obviously
you said real people,

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.690
but did you consult
with fashion designers?

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.652
Like, I would love about
that whole process.

00:40:57.652 --> 00:40:58.610
KEVIN KWAN: Not really.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.560
I mean, it's like I said,
it's all direct observation,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.310
number one.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.260
But as I began to
create the characters,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.930
you sort of begin to imagine
how they will dress, basically.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.940
And in the first
book I was really

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.030
trying to satirize this
culture of materialism,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.299
and money, and people
being label whores,

00:41:17.299 --> 00:41:19.340
because whenever I went
to Asia I would see that.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.530
I would have people always
ask me, what are you wearing?

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.363
Who made your shoes?

00:41:22.363 --> 00:41:23.480
Let's look at your watch.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.810
Like, they're so obsessed
with labels, and everything

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.690
that you are wearing,
because people really

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.370
identify with brands there.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.007
And it really signifies, and
it's so important to them.

00:41:34.007 --> 00:41:35.840
And so I wanted to kind
of make fun of that.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.048
And I asked my editor, I
was like, what do you think?

00:41:38.048 --> 00:41:40.910
And she was like, I love it, and
the fans are going to love it.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.760
And she was right, because more
and more-- in the second book,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.389
I put in less brands
because I thought,

00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:47.930
I'm really getting
to the story and I

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.346
don't have to describe what
everything Ashford is wearing,

00:41:50.346 --> 00:41:51.407
in every scene.

00:41:51.407 --> 00:41:53.240
And then the notes came
back from my editor.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.760
Please describe everything
she's wearing in every scene,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.250
like, head to toe--

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.270
and the guys, too.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.620
Like, the fans want to know.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.690
The readers love this.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.280
And so that's what I've done.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.410
Yeah.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.020
Interesting story for
you from the movie--

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.860
John Chu is so dedicated to
getting every detail right,

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.940
but there was a moment
in the script where

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.810
a character gives another
character a watch as a present.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:24.260
And so he said to me,
like, would this person

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.480
get this watch,
this certain brand?

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.880
And I was like, absolutely not.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.047
And he's like, so what would
he-- what would he get?

00:42:33.047 --> 00:42:34.796
I was like, well, you
know, this character

00:42:34.796 --> 00:42:36.800
would be given probably
an amazing collectible

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.820
vintage Rolex Paul Newman
Daytona Panda, you know.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.300
And so we found one.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.960
Like we sort of went,
connect the dots,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.980
and an amazing very
generous crazy rich Asian

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:56.960
lent us his $500,000 Paul
Newman Panda Daytona.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.040
And it was flown around
the world on set,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.660
with bodyguards,
in a special box

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.490
for a scene that lasted
literally, I would say,

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.360
quarter of a second.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:12.860
Yeah.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.101
But that's how much we wanted
to get every detail right.

00:43:17.101 --> 00:43:18.850
JEREMY: Is that the
watch you have on now?

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:19.474
KEVIN KWAN: No.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.670
I wish.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.295
But it's funny, the actors were
like, it was your watch, right?

00:43:25.295 --> 00:43:27.020
I was like, no.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.650
Not even close.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.400
JEREMY: All right.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.090
Well, I want to thank Kevin
Kwan for joining us today

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.120
here at Google.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.430
And thank you.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.397
Let's go ahead and give
him round of applause.

00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:37.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:44.700
KEVIN KWAN: Thanks so much for
spending your lunch time today.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.460
Appreciate it.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.937
JEREMY: All right.

00:43:48.937 --> 00:43:50.270
We'll stick around a little bit.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.640
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.516
If anyone has books--

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:53.015
JEREMY: Some of you
have books, so--

00:43:53.015 --> 00:43:55.110
KEVIN KWAN: --or anything
to sign, I'm here.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.810
Cool.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.960
[APPLAUSE]
