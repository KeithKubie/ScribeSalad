00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.470
The Sun is the most important star in our
galaxy, and at some point, it’s going to

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.819
die.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.710
When that happens, it’ll turn into a red
giant, getting so big it’ll swallow Mars,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.330
Mercury, and quite possibly vaporize our own
planet.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.340
Don’t panic yet, we’ve got a billion years
to prepare before the big red comes.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.269
Stars have a life cycle just like us: they
are born, they live, and then they die.During

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.670
their lives, stars need to have a strong core,
one that can fuse hydrogen into helium to

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.469
make nuclear fusion.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.579
Stars will work their cores for billions of
years.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.399
But eventually, they’ll run out of hydrogen
for their fusion process.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.539
When that happens, the star can't hold up
against gravity and its core will start to

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.539
collapse.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.289
The core will get smaller and denser, while
its outer shell expands and cools, giving

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.539
a distinctive red hue.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.233
The combination of “cooling” and “expanding”
is where the name red giant comes from.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:00.650
Red giants are YUGE, reaching sizes of 100
million to 1 billion kilometers in diameter,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.199
or 62 million to 621 million miles.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.990
That’s nearly 1,000 times the size of the
sun.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.290
So when our sun turns into a red giant, life
as we know it will cease to exist.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.950
But there is an upside to this.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.530
When stars morph into red giants, they change
their habitable zone.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.690
The habitable zone is a region with the right
conditions for life.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.369
So as the Sun gets larger and redder, it’s
warmth will extend to the outer reaches of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.259
our solar system.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:45.810
Making it possible for life to begin on a
whole new planet.
