00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 . 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.430
 In this presentation I want to introduce you to the idea 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.680
 Multidimensional equations 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.720
 Multidimensional equations 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 The word may seem fake, but all 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 Meaning is a phrase containing a set of variables or constants 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390
 Which are raised to non-zero forces 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.510
 Perhaps this also seems complicated 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.330
 So let me explain to you an example 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.420
 If you want to give you x ^ 2 + 1, these are 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.260
 Multilevel equation 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
 In fact these are considered to be multi-border because they contain two sides 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.159
 A pluralistic term is more general 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.350
 Its content that you have several limits. Multiple word 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.300
 Means many 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.490
 These are multiple borders 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.440
 If you want to say 4x ^ 3 - 2x ^ 2 + 7 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.200
 This is a trilateral border 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.970
 I have three borders here 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.330
 Let me give you a precise meaning of what it is 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.140
 Boundary is what is not 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 For example, if I have x ^ -1 / 2 + 1 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.660
 This is not a polynomial 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.720
 This does not mean you will never see it when 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
 It deals with algebra or mathematics 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.840
 But we will not call this polynomial because it contains 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.610
 AS Sallab and Ksari 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 Or if you want to give you the expression y × square root 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.630
 For y - y ^ 2 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.070
 Again, this is not a polynomial, because it contains 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 The square root, which basically raises a number 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.030
 For strength 1/2 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.680
 If all the bases exist on the variables you must 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 Be nonzero 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.500
 Again, neither of these is considered multi-boundary 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.130
 Now, when we deal with multiplexers, you will 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.380
 We get some terms 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.660
 They are probably familiar to you or maybe not so familiar, so 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.750
 I will explain it to you now 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.210
 The first term is a polynomial degree 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.070
 Multilevel degree 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.889
 That is our highest rating 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.720
 In the polynomial 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.150
 For example, a polynomial is so 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.910
 Multilevel Class III 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.450
 Why? 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.510
 There is no need to continue writing it 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.910
 Why is it considered a multilevel class III? 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.020
 Because the highest SS is in it 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.720
 The phrase x ^ 3 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.150
 From here we got a multi-border third-class 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.100
 This is a multi-border second-order 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.600
 This is a second-order phrase 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.750
 Now there is a set of other terms, or words, that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190
 Need to know about the polynomials, which are fixed words 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.160
 As opposed to changing, I think you already know 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.120
 There are changing phrases here 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.520
 This is fixed 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.860
 That's fixed 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.390
 And then there is a last part until we explain 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.670
 The properties of a polynomial is to understand transboundary coefficients 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.570
 Let me write a five-level polynomial here 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.990
 Maybe I'll type it unconventional 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.400
 Here 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 I will not put it in the usual order 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.520
 Let's assume that it is x ^ 2 - 5x + 7x ^ 5 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.150
 - 5 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.840
 Again, this is a multi-level V-limit 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.710
 Why? 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.110
 Because the highest IS on the variable here is 5 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.580
 Here 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.910
 This tells us it's a multi-level V-limit 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.870
 Maybe you're saying, well, why do we care for that? 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380
 At least, for me, I care 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590
 To the point of polynomial because when the numbers grow 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.560
 The higher pitch is what controls 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.610
 On other phrases, they grow faster, or 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.160
 Less quickly, depending on whether they are 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.240
 The signal is positive or negative in front of it 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.790
 But he will control everything else 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.470
 It gives you the meaning of speed 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.269
 Full gateway growth in case 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.339
 If they contain a negative coefficient 

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.300
 Now I have used the word coefficient 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.850
 what does that mean? 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.730
 Factor 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.900
 I used it before, when 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.500
 I dealt with linear equations 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.720
 Transactions are constants 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 Multiplied by changing expressions 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.360
 For example, the coefficient of this phrase 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.090
 Here is -5 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.140
 You have to remember that we have -5, so consider 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.890
 5-Entire Transaction 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.570
 The coefficient of this expression is 7 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.870
 There is no coefficient here; it's a constant phrase for 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.940
 5 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.170
 Then the coefficient x ^ 2 is 1 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.350
 The coefficient is 1 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.160
 It is not apparent 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.090
 You assume it is 1 × x ^ 2 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.180
 Now, the last thing I want to introduce to you is 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.190
 The idea of ​​a typical form of a polynomial 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.190
 The typical form of polynomial 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.710
 Now, none of this will help you solve the polynomial 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.690
 But when we talk about the solution of the polynomials 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.520
 Maybe I use some of these terms, or that your teacher 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.890
 Some of these terms may be used 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.070
 So it's good to know what we're talking about 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.640
 The typical form of polynomial is only 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.770
 Put the phrases in order of rank 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.800
 This is not the typical form 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.510
 If you want to put this polynomial in the typical form 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.990
 I will put this phrase first. If you type 7x ^ 5 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.810
 Then what is the next smallest score? 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.260
 Well, we have the phrase x ^ 2 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.680
 We do not have the phrase x ^ 4 or 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 x ^ 3 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.510
 So be + 1 - well, I do not have to 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.230
 Type 1-- + x ^ 2 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.000
 Then I have this phrase, -5x 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.170
 Then the last phrase I have is -5 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.430
 This is the typical form of polynomial where it exists 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.470
 In descending order of grades 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.280
 Now let's move on to solve a set of operations using polynomials 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.510
 This toolkit will be very useful later 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.730
 In algebra, or in the fields of mathematics 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.180
 Let us simplify a set of polynomials 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.500
 We have been exposed to this in previous presentations 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.980
 But I think it will give you a better meaning, in particular 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.970
 When we have phrases at higher degrees 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.290
 So let's assume I want to get -2x ^ 2 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.000
 + 4x - 12 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.030
 I will combine it to 7x + x ^ 2 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.410
 Now the important thing to remember when you simplify 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.430
 These polynomials are you will collect phrases 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.830
 Which have the same variable degree 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.870
 I will solve another example quickly as I have several 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.750
 Variables exist in one case 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.620
 But anyway, I have these brackets here, but they are 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.170
 Actually do not do anything 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.220
 If I have a quote put here, I will have to 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.940
 Distribute the negative signal, but it does not exist now 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.270
 If I can type this as -2x ^ 2 + 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.970
 4x - 12 + 7x + x ^ 2 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.870
 Now let's simplify it 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.440
 Let us combine phrases of the same degree 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.000
 When I say the same degree, it must be 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.120
 It has the same variable as well 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.990
 But in this example, we only have the variable x 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.360
 So let's do the collection process 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.090
 Let's see, I have the phrase x ^ 2 these, and I have the phrase x ^ 2 those 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.020
 So I can bring them together 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.130
 I have -2x ^ 2 - let me write them down 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.640
 First, -2x ^ 2 + x ^ 2 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.560
 Then let me extract x, 4x and 7x 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.490
 This is 4x + 7x 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.560
 Then finally, I have this hard 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.650
 Here, IE-12 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.710
 If I have -2 of something, I added 1 of the 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.210
 The same thing, what do I get? 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.750
 -2 + 1 = -1x ^ 2 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.420
 I can only type -x ^ 2 

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.320
 But I wanted to make it clear to you that I am collecting 

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.560
 -2 to 1 here 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.070
 Then I have 4x + 7x = 11x 

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.820
 Then finally I have a hard, -12 

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.390
 I end up with three borders 

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.370
 Multilevel Class II 

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.740
 The coefficient is here, ie the coefficient of the upper term 

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.990
 In the typical format - it is already typical - 

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.320
 Is -1 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.760
 The coefficient here is 11 

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.280
 The hard is -12 

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.870
 Let us take another example of these examples 

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.060
 I think you understand the general idea 

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.840
 Now let me have a complex example 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:09:00.450
 Let's assume that I have 2a ^ 2b - 3ab ^ 2 + 5a ^ 2 

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:09.880
 b ^ 2 - 2a ^ 2 b ^ 2 + 4a ^ 2 b 

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.110
 - 5b ^ 2 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.290
 So here I have a negative sign, I have several variables 

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.990
 But let's solve it step by step 

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.220
 If the first thing we will do is 

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.610
 Distribution of negative signal 

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.470
 If this first part we can write it as follows 2a ^ 2 b - 

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.760
 3ab ^ 2 + 5a ^ 2 b ^ 2 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.180
 Then we distribute the negative signal, or multiply 

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.760
 All these limits are B-1 because we have 

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.040
 Negative signal abroad 

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.150
 If -2a ^ 2 b ^ 2 - 4a ^ 2 b 

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.300
 And negative × negative = positive 5b ^ 2 

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.690
 Now we will combine similar phrases, if I have 

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.050
 The phrase 2a ^ 2 b ^ 2 

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.880
 Are there any phrases containing a ^ 2 

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.950
 b ^ 2? 

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.680
 Sorry, a ^ 2 b 

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.750
 I have to be careful here 

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.860
 Well, this is not ab ^ 2, no, a ^ 2 b ^ 2 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.360
 Oh! 

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.580
 I have here a ^ 2 b 

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.860
 Let me write this down 

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.240
 I have 2a ^ 2 b - 4a ^ 2 b 

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.660
 These are the two terms 

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.940
 Let me move to orange 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.280
 If I have here ab ^ 2 

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.480
 Now do I have other ab ^ 2 statements? 

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.630
 Terms ab ^ 2 Other 

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.550
 No, there are no other ab ^ 2 terms, so I will write it 

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.740
 -3ab ^ 2 

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.580
 Then let's see, I have the words a ^ 2 b ^ 2 here 

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.520
 Do I have any other one? 

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.390
 Well, yes sure, the following phrase is 

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.280
 The phrase a ^ 2 b ^ 2, so let me 

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.500
 Write it down 

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.810
 + 5a ^ 2 b ^ 2 - 2a ^ 2 

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.630
 b ^ 2, right? 

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.860
 I wrote them 

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.120
 Then finally I have the last b ^ 2 phrase 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.770
 + 5b ^ 2 

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.390
 Now I can gather them 

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.800
 If the first set here is painted violet, two elements of 

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.230
 Something - 4 of this thing = -2 of 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.770
 That thing 

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.130
 This equals -2a ^ 2 b 

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.450
 And then this phrase, will not be combined with 

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.020
 Anything, 3ab ^ 2 

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.170
 So we can combine these two phrases, if I have 5 elements of 

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.870
 Something - 2 of this, I will have 3 elements 

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.200
 Of this thing 

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.880
 + 3a ^ 2 b ^ 2 

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.470
 Then finally I have that last phrase, which is + 5b ^ 2 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.000
 We're done 

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.170
 We have simplified this polynomial 

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.990
 Here, by putting it in typical form, you can think of it 

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.050
 In different ways 

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.230
 The way you think best is 

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.290
 University degree of the term 

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.290
 Maybe we can put these first, but this 

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.460
 It's up to you 

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.030
 This is 3a ^ 2 b ^ 2 

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.360
 Then you can choose whether you want to put phrases 

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.680
 a ^ 2 b or ab ^ 2 first. 2a ^ 2 b 

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.400
 And then we have -3ab ^ 2 

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.320
 Then b ^ 2 here 

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.180
 + 5b ^ 2 

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.440
 We're done 

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.480
 We have simplified this polynomial 

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.210
 What I want now is to solve a bunch of examples 

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.860
 Create multiple borders 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.610
 In fact, the idea is to give you an idea 

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.880
 Because of the importance of polynomials, short representations 

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.570
 We will use it all the time, not just in algebra 

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.460
 But later in calculus, and in everything 

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.470
 So they are good things to see 

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.710
 But what I want to do in these four examples is to represent 

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.360
 Space each of these shapes using a polynomial 

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.690
 I will try to coordinate the colors as much as possible 

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.520
 So here, what is the space? 

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.420
 Well, the blue part here, its area 

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.315
 Is x × y 

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:14.080
 x x y 

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.360
 Then what is the space here? 

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.670
 Will be x x z 

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.130
 If + x × z 

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.930
 But we have two of them! 

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.370
 We have one area x x z, and then we have 

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.900
 The last area is x × z 

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.710
 I can collect xx z here 

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.390
 Or I can type, + 2 × (x × z) 

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.350
 Here's our multi-border space 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.210
 The shape is here 

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.470
 Now let's find the space of the next figure 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.460
 What is the space here? 

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.870
 Well, I have a × b 

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.430
 ab 

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.140
 This seems to be also a × b, if + ab 

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.390
 This seems to be also ab, if + ab 

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.450
 + ab 

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.090
 I think it has been painted 

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.460
 oddly 

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.560
 Well, I will direct this c 

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.740
 Perhaps it is meant that this c 

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.230
 Because that is the information we need 

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.860
 Maybe they're telling us that this is the norm, ie 

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.240
 These, c 

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.850
 Because that will help us 

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.580
 But if we assume that this is also ab, it is 

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.890
 I will assume it for this show 

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.380
 Then we have another ab 

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.610
 We have this a 

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.770
 a × c 

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.550
 This is the space of this shape 

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.580
 It is clear that we can combine these four borders 

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.780
 This is 4ab and then we have + ac 

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.400
 This assumption was made and had a typo, where 

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.310
 That c has been given to us as a show 

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.240
 This box is here 

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.210
 We do not know if it's square, and that's only if it's a and c 

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.600
 Equal 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.180
 Now let's move on to this 

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.190
 How do we find the space of this pink shape? 

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.010
 Well, we can take the entire rectangle, so that 

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.730
 Be 2xy, and then subtract space 

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.240
 These boxes 

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.060
 If each square is x x, x ^ 2 

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.810
 We have two of these boxes, then 

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.190
 The space will be - 2x ^ 2 

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.050
 Then finally, let's move on to this 

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.430
 This seems to be a dividing line 

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.250
 If the space of this point, of this space, is 

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.130
 a × b, which is equal to ab 

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:43.680
 Then the space here looks like ab too 

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.320
 If + ab 

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.950
 The space here is ab too 

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.170
 If the total area is 3ab 

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.700
 Anyway, I hope this offer has been explained to us 

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.950
 Boundaries 

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.270
 .
