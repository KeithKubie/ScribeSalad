00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.590
Velocity, the third v, is about the speed at which the data

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.900
arrives, ready to be processed. We need to be able to accept

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.410
and store that data, even when it's coming in at a rate

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.880
of terabytes per day. If we can't store it as it arrives,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.481
we'll end up discarding some of it, and that's what we want

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.921
to avoid. Think about an ecommerce website. If we knew what products

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.053
you've looked at in the past, we can recommend similar products the

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:25.540
next time you visit our site. If you've had spent five minutes

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.040
looking at a particular item, we could maybe send you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.680
an email informing you the product is on sale. If

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.412
we know that you typically browse our site using a

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.470
first generation iPad, we could suggest the latest model. This is

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.090
a huge difference to what we could do before, when

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.240
we only stored the records of the actual purchases. If we

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.370
can store and process all of our web server logs,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
along with the purchase data that's in our traditional data warehouse.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.930
We could give the customer a much better

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.360
shopping experience. Which would directly translate into bigger profits.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.380
Yet another example is a movie site like Netflix.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.310
Based on what they know about your viewing habits,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.480
they can recommend movies to you. As you can

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.730
see here, because of what Ian's rated highly before,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.220
this movie is recommend to him. And they can

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.030
even predict what rating he would give this movie.
