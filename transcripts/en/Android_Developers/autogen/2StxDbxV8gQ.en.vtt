a couple things that I learned while

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
a couple things that I learned while
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.640
a couple things that I learned while
developing for Android specifically for

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
developing for Android specifically for
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.499
developing for Android specifically for
games while I was trying to make the

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
games while I was trying to make the
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.890
games while I was trying to make the
framerate higher I had to actually try

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900
framerate higher I had to actually try
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.540
framerate higher I had to actually try
to reduce the amount of transparency I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
to reduce the amount of transparency I
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.490
to reduce the amount of transparency I
used in my images

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
used in my images
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.310
used in my images
I used 565 format and I made sure that

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
I used 565 format and I made sure that
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.580
I used 565 format and I made sure that
my PNG s didn't have transparent chunks

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
my PNG s didn't have transparent chunks
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.859
my PNG s didn't have transparent chunks
in them another technique we needed to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
in them another technique we needed to
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.220
in them another technique we needed to
use was we used augs for the sounds and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
use was we used augs for the sounds and
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710
use was we used augs for the sounds and
they play much more quickly than m4a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
they play much more quickly than m4a
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900
they play much more quickly than m4a
files so the game felt much more

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
files so the game felt much more
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.510
files so the game felt much more
responsive
