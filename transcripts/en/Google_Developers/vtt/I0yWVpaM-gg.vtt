00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; DAVID: ...and Mindy from Intuit, who are
going to show you how, using pretty much exactly

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.309
the same integration points, they've taken
a business critical application, Payroll,

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.599
and used the same technical capabilities that
we just demo'd on a toy app to solve a real

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.760
business problem, which is Payroll, and to
do that in a way that is well integrated with

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.960
Google Apps and part of the family of Apps.
So, Martin.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.000
&gt;&gt; MARTIN: Great, thanks, David. So you probably--many
of you may know Intuit. Maybe you don't know

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.950
that Intuit is the largest or most popular
payroll service provider in the nation. We

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.800
have about a million customers right now having
their payroll provided by Intuit. And some

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.640
of them using our online service that we're
gonna show here. The kind of customers we

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.760
serve, they're usually very small customers--five,
six, seven employees there. When you went

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.252
to a sandwich shop today to get your lunch
or you go to a coffee shop, those are the

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:57.340
kind of people who use our service, and there's
about 6 million employers in the U.S. Most

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.620
of 'em are the smaller end of the market,
less than 20 employees. So here this is the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.230
page that we were just looking at. Are we
on the demo now? We're ready for that. So

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:16.110
that we can add our app. There we go. So Mindy's
adding the application just like David showed,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.000
but this is ours, of course. We have the same
set of clicks, the terms of service. We agree

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.180
and continue. The next step is data access.
We have the calendar access 'cause we're gonna

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.002
put some stuff about your payroll--when your
paydays are in particular in the employees

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:36.800
calendar and the employers calendar. That's
some user provisioning. And then we enable

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.440
the app. So that's all quite quick and straightforward.
There is the setting up of the payroll, which

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.060
takes a little bit longer. You have to put
in all the employees. We're not gonna demo

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.600
that today, so we're gonna switch over to
another company now where we've already set

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.650
up the payroll stuff and show you how the
payroll works inside of Google Apps. So here

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.060
it typically starts where you get an email
from us reminding you that it's time to do

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.600
your payroll. We'll go to the universal nav
up there on the top and click on Intuit Online

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.780
Payroll. And in our case, we've chosen to
have you reenter your same credentials for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.530
your Google Apps. Just there's some confidential
data in Payroll, as you can imagine. We just

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.250
want to make sure that's all safe and the
right person looking at it. And here we go.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.670
So this is the to-do list. We will show you,
typically, what you would do with your taxes

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.650
and your forms. In this case, there's not
a lot to do other than--oh, look at that.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.660
Somebody--Mindy wants a raise. What's that,
Mindy? So we're just gonna go straight to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.590
Payday and skip that giving her a raise business.
But we will put in some hours for Mindy so

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:48.680
that she gets paid for this week, and then
create the paychecks. Up they come. And that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.340
it. Paychecks are calculated. You can see
that the numbers are all right, that a small

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.670
business would typically approve them at that
point. And there's a few more steps. They

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.780
can print them out if they want to. They can
also send email to the employees to let them

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.490
know their payroll's available. So that's
it. Payroll's done. We really focus on that,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.950
making it simple to do Payroll, and with the
integration with Google Apps, it's simple

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.069
to use the same credentials that you already
use. In this case, we're also gonna have Mindy

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.349
show that she just got paid and how she can
see her pay stub. Mindy?

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.319
&gt;&gt; MINDY: Yes. So I am buying a new car, a
Jetta TDI, and Volkswagen, in order to approve

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.980
my auto loan, needs a copy of my latest pay
stub as proof of employment, so let me show

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.490
you how easy it is to get my pay stub through
Google Apps. I'm gonna log into my calendar.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:51.220
Hmm. Wanted to make this experience feel real.
&gt;&gt; MARTIN: If anyone would like to make guesses

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.230
about what that CAPTCHA says. She might be
accepting...

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.760
&gt;&gt; MINDY: So that was so easy. I get to my
calendar, and you can see I have a little

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.110
paycheck icon on my last payday. So I can
click on this to view my pay stub. In the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.099
past, I would have had to track it down on
my own records or bug my employer to get my

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.249
pay stub. But now because of the integration
between Google Apps and Intuit's employee

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:26.000
website, I can actually just log in directly
to my calendar and get right to my pay stub.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.169
I can print it right from here. And I'm done.
It's that easy.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.539
&gt;&gt; MARTIN: So we're really excited to be part
of this Marketplace. The same kind of businesses

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.020
that use Google Apps are the ones that use
our payroll solution, and we're just looking

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.179
forward to adding more to what we've already
started here today. David.

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:51.240
&gt;&gt; DAVID: Thank you.
So what you just saw is Intuit using some

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.330
very simple points of integration to the Marketplace,
building their payroll application into the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.770
Google Apps family, so it feels just like
part of the family. Good luck with that loan.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:10.309
I hope they help you get your car. So... I'd
like to bring up our next demo now. So I'm

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.939
going to be introducing Scott from Atlassian
who flew in earlier today from the other side

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.009
of the world, and Scott's gonna show us the
demo of integration that uses a lot of different

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.229
points of integration, a lot of the different
extension points, to show how their entire

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.379
suite of development tools can be connected
with lots of different points of connection

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.889
with Google's suite of communication and collaboration
tools. Scott.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:40.580
&gt;&gt; SCOTT: Thanks, David. My name's Scott Farquhar,
and I'm really excited to be here to demonstrate

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.080
the integration we've built. Atlassian sells
software development tools to 17,000 companies

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.199
worldwide, and we've built kick-ass integration
between Google Apps and our online hosted

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.659
development suite, JIRA Studio. Today you're
gonna see the best integrated product in the

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:02.069
Google Marketplace. Let's consider our software
development team. Say that I'm a project manager--and

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.020
I'll switch to the demo now. Say I'm a project
manager. I spend all my day in email, and

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.779
what I really want is the information about
my projects delivered to me directly in email.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.369
You can see on the left-hand side of the screen
here, we've got a list of issues that are

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.599
assigned to me. Now this list of issues comes
directly from JIRA studio and uses the gadget

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.939
technology to embed it inside Gmail. With
one click, I can get more information about

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:33.729
this issue and interact with it directly.
We can see on this particular issue the technical

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.460
lead on the project can't start development
because we're missing the design specification.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.740
Now because our company is standardized on
Google Docs for all our information, it's

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.869
simple to simply click through to search for
and attach the design specification to this

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:55.460
issue. We think that this integration is gonna
save a whole heap of time for companies that

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.800
use Google Docs as well as JIRA Studio. Let's
instead take a different member of the software

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.879
project. Let's take the software development
lead. Now, while the development lead starts

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:10.469
their day in Gmail, they quickly want to dive
into Studio to get some work done. Now using

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:15.189
the universal navigation bar described earlier,
we can click through and, using the open ID

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:21.039
integration, not have to re-log in. Now many
of you will be familiar with JIRA, the number

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:26.449
one issue tracking system. JIRA combines the
power of-- well, Studio combines the power

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:33.930
of JIRA with Wiki, Source Code, Code Review,
and Continuous Integration in one online hosted

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:40.620
development suite. Now you can see here with
the dashboard for JIRA Studio, it's an iGoogle-like

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.899
dashboard. And we've used the same technology
that Google uses, the same open social technology,

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:50.860
in our products, and that means that we can
take Google boards and Google gadgets and

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.689
embed them directly inside this dashboard,
as you can see with the Google Translate gadget

00:07:55.689 --> 00:08:00.819
that we have. Of course, you can also take
Studio gadgets and display them inside Google

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:06.879
applications such as iGoogle or Gmail, like
you saw previously. Now the power of Studio

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:11.610
is that we've got all these development applications
in one suite, and on the left-hand side, you

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.740
can see the list of recent activity across
the entire development tools. Let's quickly

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:22.429
jump through to the issue that we saw earlier.
Now because I'm the technical lead, I want

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:26.279
to take this design specification and ensure
that it's complete before I send it to my

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:32.150
developers to begin work. Now with a simple
click, I can quickly review this document

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.940
without leaving Studio, without having to
re-authenticate or log in. I can review this

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.370
document, and if I need to make any changes,
with one click I'll be sent straight to Google

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.990
Docs where I can make those changes, and they'll
be reflected in real time. We think again

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.100
this is going to save a whole heap of time.
So just to recap what we've shown you, we've

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.620
shown you putting gadgets from Gmail-- sorry,
gadgets from Google inside Studio and gadgets

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.930
from Studio inside Gmail. And we've shown
you that the real power of the integration

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:05.220
for Google Docs. But the thing I'm most excited
about is the Studio activity bar. The Studio

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.300
activity bar is at the bottom of every page
in Studio. And on the left-hand side gives

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.630
you fingertip access to all the applications
in Studio and all the applications in Google

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:21.440
Apps. And on the right-hand side, we've integrated
Google Talk. So Google Talk allows me to instantly

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.880
collaborate with my colleagues and let them
know what's--you know, what they need to do

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.270
next. So in this particular case, this feature's
ready to work--ready to begin work. So I'm

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.750
gonna send it to Dan the developer and, using
our permalink feature, I can instantly send

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.520
him the page that we're working on. Now of
course this saves us a whole heap of time

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.700
of jumping back and forth between applications
and searching for the people in our team.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.610
So here we've sent information to Dan, and
then we have to set up a meeting to discuss

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.260
with him later. Now we think this integration
of Chat between your colleagues is incredibly

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.470
powerful. But we didn't to stop there. We
thought, well, what can we do to take advantage

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.320
of this integration between JIRA Studio...
