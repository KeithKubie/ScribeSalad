00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Your body is amazing. Did you know that the bronchial tubes in your lungs are in a row 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.689
 2400km, which is a quarter of the length of the Great Wall of China? 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.009
 Or that nails on your dominant hand grow a little faster? Do you hear my voice? 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.680
 Thank you for the three bones in your ear, which are so small that they fit on one penny. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
 Without them, you wouldn't hear or be able to balance 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.509
 Including the smallest bone in your body: stirrup. The longest and strongest bone is the femur 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.758
 stronger than steel and four times stronger than concrete. You have only 206 bones in adulthood 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.549
 But as a child you had 300 of them 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 But they weren't lost, they just grew together. Your lungs are able to breathe in 13 liters of air every minute 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.959
 a total of 8000-9000 liters per day. Exhale now. Whatever you try, there's always a liter of air left in your lungs 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.689
 Likewise, your stomach is never completely empty 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 It always contains 50 ml of hydrochloric acid. Upside down, esophagus 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.649
 prevents partially digested food in the stomach 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.228
 fall back into your mouth because it is made up of muscles that contract with a wavy movement known as peristaltic 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:11.729
 Which provides unidirectional flow and prevents anything from traveling in the opposite direction. Unless, of course, you vomit 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.949
 The brain's hypothalamus maintains an optimal body temperature of 37 Â° C and works with the skin 

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.700
 sweat glands and vessels to keep that temperature. 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.080
 When it is hot outside, the blood vessels expand to help release more heat, and sweat glands sweat, so evaporating your skin 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
 When it is cold outside, the blood vessels contract and the blood flow 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.329
 it is more important for vital organs. Some say the liver has the hardest work in the whole body 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 They have to perform more than 300 activities every day. When we think about their importance, 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.769
 No wonder that the largest internal organ in your body is the only one capable of complete regeneration 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 This jackpot filters everything we eat and drink 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.279
 including alcohol and drugs, converts glucose into glycogen into a supply 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.529
 It produces bile that helps with digestion 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 and even stores iron in the form of ferritin. Your lungs and kidneys work together to maintain and control the optimal blood pH of 7.4 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.559
 If the pH is higher than 7.8 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.660
 or less than 6.8 is usually death. When the pH rises, the kidneys release excess 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.490
 bicarbonates and lungs try to maintain carbon dioxide. When the pH drops, the lungs remove CO2 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.579
 and the kidneys release more hydrogen ions. Even if you have 2 kidneys and each is not larger than a computer mouse 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.400
 you can only survive once working at 75% 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.000
 Inside, there is a network of 1-2 million nephrons, which are tiny filters able to filter 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.100
 110 to 140 liters of blood per hour. This means that all the blood in your body is filtered through the kidneys 400 times a day 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.420
 An adult has 5 liters of blood in the body, which is 7% of the total body weight 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.040
 Of course, your body is full of red blood cells 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.520
 Right now, 25 trillion wander through a staggering 100,000 kilometer net of blood vessels 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 Every second, 2 million red blood cells die through spleen filtration, but don't worry, the bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells every second as a replacement 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.000
 Your hair is the 2nd fastest growing part of your body, able to grow 15 cm per year although there are different variations 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.340
 In the population, male hair tends to grow faster than female hair. 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.020
 Like a newborn, your lungs were filled with fluid 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.360
 about 10 seconds after birth, you breathed out sharply in response to the new environment and your breathing process that keeps you alive started 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.020
