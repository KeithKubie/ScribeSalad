00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.400
Welcome back, because I
was hitting against the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.760
YouTube 10-minute limit.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.110
But all I was saying
is, we said, you know,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.260
cosine of minus a.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.500
So I drew a right triangle with
a, and then I showed you minus

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.160
a, and I said, well, all of the
lengths are going to be the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.520
same, but now the direction
of-- and we're kind of assuming

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.670
this is all on the unit circle.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.410
If you don't remember the unit
circle, maybe you'll want to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.000
rewatch the videos
we have on that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.890
But I'm just showing you that
the cosine of minus a is equal

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.140
to this side over the
hypotenuse, and this hypotenuse

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.350
is the same as this
hypotenuse, right?

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.250
So cosine of minus a is
adjacent over this hypotenuse,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.290
while cosine of a is adjacent
over this hypotenuse.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.660
But it's the same thing, so
we know that cosine of minus

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.640
a is equal to cosine of a.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.430
Actually, by definition, that
makes it a-- I don't want to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.600
confuse you too much, but that
makes cosine an even function,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.510
and I'll show you more.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.160
Actually, I should do a
whole presentation on

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.030
even and odd functions.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.490
Now, let's see what
sine of minus a is.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.030
Sine of minus a is equal
to-- so this is minus a.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.100
So it's this side, so it's the
minus length of-- let's call

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.480
this x, let's call this y,
and let's call this, well,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.030
let's leave that h, right?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.880
If that is x, this is y, this
length is y, then this length

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
right here is minus x, right?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.890
So the sine of minus
a is minus x/h.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.390
What's the sine of a?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.740
Sine of a is equal to-- this is
a-- opposite or hypotenuse,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
x over h, right?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.030
So sine of minus a is equal to
minus 1 times x over h, right?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.960
Or this is just the same thing
as-- I mean, we could multiply

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.350
both sides of this by minus
1, minus x over h, right?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.670
So sine of minus a is
equal to minus sine of a.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.700
So let me clear this out
and rewrite this identity.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.030
And as you can see, all I'm
doing is I'm just playing

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.010
around with triangles and
showing you that, you know,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.430
just using the basic SOHCAHTOA,
you can actually discover a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.590
whole set of trigonometric
identities.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.300
So let's clear that.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.100
And, you know, it is
useful to memorize.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.680
I normally don't advocate
memorizing, but it's helpful

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.890
just to do things quickly.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.940
But I'd also advocate being
able to prove it to yourself,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.150
so if you ever forget it, and
you don't have a cheat sheet

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.170
available, you can prove it,
and if you ever have to teach

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.130
it, then you'll be able to
explain the underlying

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.020
themes a little bit better.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.490
So let's clear this.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.895
Let's see if we can discover
some more trig identities.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.890
So we know that-- so let's
see, if we have sine--

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370
what's sine of a plus pi/2?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.980
a plus pi/2.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.600
Well, we could use our handy
sine of a plus b identity,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.250
which we've already proved,
so we can use it now.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.580
So that tells us that it's the
sine of a-- that equals the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:34.810
sine of a times the cosine of
pi/2 plus the sine of pi/2.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.270
And we're in
radians, of course.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.570
This could have been 90
degrees instead, if we

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.140
wanted to be in degrees.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.310
sine of pi/2 times the
cosine of a, right?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.890
Well, this equals the sine of
-- what's cosine sign of pi/2?

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.040
Or cosine of 90 degrees?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.160
Well, that's when we're on
the unit circle, we're

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.350
pointing straight up.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.450
And so the x-coordinate is 0.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.490
I could draw it out, but I
think-- you might want to draw

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.310
the unit circle and figure it
out for yourself, or if you

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.840
don't, do it on a calculator,
but you will learn

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.620
that it is 0.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620
The cosine of pi/2 is 0.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.690
Plus sine of pi/2, for the same
reason, we're pointing straight

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.470
up on the unit circle, so the
y-coordinate, or the sine

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.710
coordinate, is 1, right on the
unit-- is essentially at the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.400
point 0, 1 on the unit circle.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.300
So sine of pi/2 is 1, and
then times cosine of a.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.820
So sine of a times 0 is 0.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.250
1 times cosine of a
is just cosine of a.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.010
So we have a new,
useful trig identity.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.100
Sine a plus pi/2 is
equal to cosine of a.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.240
Fascinating!

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.880
So really, this is just telling
us that cosine of a is the same

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.100
thing as sine of a shifted.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.030
So if we were to think of this
graphically, if we were to

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.070
think of, you know, if we were
to draw the graph, if you shift

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.150
the sine graph to the left by
pi/2, you get the cosine graph.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.960
And if you haven't learned
about shifting yet,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.670
don't worry about that.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.930
Or you might want to actually
graph the two, and I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.860
think you'll get a sense
of what I'm saying.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.900
So let's do-- I don't know.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.550
And another way to rewrite this
exact same thing is the sine of

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:36.090
a is equal to the cosine
of a minus pi/2, right?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.640
Let's say I said that b
is a plus pi/2, right?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.570
Let's say I said that b is
equal to a plus pi/2, then we

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.770
can say that this is b, and
then this would b minus pi/2.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.770
I'm just switching
around variables.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.520
I'm doing this in a much more
loosey-goosey fashion than I

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.840
normally do a lot of videos,
but I want to show you that a

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.560
lot of this trigonometry can
just be-- you know, it's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.960
just kind of discovery.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.490
What's sine of a minus b?

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.400
Well, that looks like a
new one, doesn't it?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.930
Well, let's try to
figure it out.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:26.080
Well, that equals sine of a
cosine of minus b plus sine

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.940
of minus b times the
cosine of a, right?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.850
Well, what do we know about
the cosine of minus b?

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.970
Before I cleared the screen,
we just figured out that the

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.660
cosine of minus b, since it's
an even function, is the same

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.410
thing as the cosine of b.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.810
So we can rewrite that
as that equals the

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.900
sine of a cosine of b.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.600
And then what's the
sine of minus b?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.380
Well, that's the same thing
as the minus sine of b.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.120
That's what we just proved,
that the sine of minus

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.070
b, that this is equal
to minus sine of b.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.340
You could draw the triangle and
the unit circle, if you don't

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.060
believe me, but we
just did that.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.860
So we can say that that
is equal to minus sine

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.270
of b cosine of a.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.010
Interesting!

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.580
I encourage you do the
same thing with the

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.120
cosine of a minus b.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.650
These are all just, you know,
we're using one or two or three

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.480
trig identities together and
trying to come up

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.290
with new things.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.250
And I think at this point,
we've literally gone over

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.260
everything, that almost every
trig identity you've seen in

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.100
your book, you should be
able to get there somehow,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.270
just by keep on playing.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.990
And obviously, all of these
identities, you can invert the

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.130
sines and the cosines and the
tangents, and you can get

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.840
identities for secant and
cotangent and cosecant

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.750
and keep playing around.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.620
And I encourage you to do so.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.120
And do it graphically.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.860
Draw the triangles.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.490
It's also interesting to
sometimes actually draw the

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.420
graph on the x-y plane of, say,
you know, cosine of x plus

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.680
pi/2, or sine of x plus
pi/2, or sine of x.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.410
And I think in the future, I'll
do a video where I really

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.930
do explore all of that.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.370
Well, I hope I haven't
thoroughly confused you.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.170
I wanted to just kind of show
you that a lot of trig-- it

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.990
all comes from SOHCAHTOA and
playing around with SOHCAHTOA

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.390
and triangles, and you can
pretty much get-- you can

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.740
pretty much solve for
everything you learn

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.240
in trigonometry.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.510
And if you don't have
SOHCAHTOA, at least the unit

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.795
circle definition, which is
actually better, because

00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:30.580
it's more extensive.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.230
But anyway, that's all for now.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.732
See you soon.
