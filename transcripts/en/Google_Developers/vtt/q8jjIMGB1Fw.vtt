&gt;&gt;Greg: Welcome, I'm Greg D'Alesandre, Product
Manager of Google Wave, and this is the talk

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.650
on, next slide, Google Wave and the Enterprise
Environment. I'll be talking today with Alan

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.440
Green, one of the tech Leads of Google Wave
and Kris Muller of Salesforce.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.210
Next slide.
So today what we want to talk a little bit

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.820
about and this is a question that has come
up frequently, are how can businesses use

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.100
Google Wave? So what we really wanted to do
was talk a little bit at a high level of a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.410
number of use cases and then really dive down
onto a specific use case. The specific use

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.940
case we want to dive down into is actually
one that is a little more developer oriented

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.760
because it is Google IO, and we wanted to
show how the extensions could be used together

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.460
to form a process around Wave. One thing I
will note is that there is a bit.ly link at

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.760
the bottom of this slide. This is the live
wave for this session. You can ask questions

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.760
on there, this is the end of IO, you know
all of this stuff, but that's the bit.ly link

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.830
part.
All right, let's go.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.630
OK, um, without going into a lot of detail
on what exactly Google Wave is, if you want

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.820
to know we have a lot of videos online that
sort of thing, but basically Wave is equal

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.520
parts conversation and document. It has a
simple sharing model; it allows you to reply

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.900
anywhere, does live editing, and has custom
extensions. When we first launched, ah, launched,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.900
when we first introduced it last year at Google
IO there was, we showed a very broad vision

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.700
for it, and today we want to really drill
down on what people can do with it. All right.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.009
This is a quote from Mehrdad, who is, we've
worked with on a project As One, there's a

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.390
project within Deloitte, spread across the
world, um, multiple teams that they used Wave

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.189
to do all their coordination of the designs
for the project. There's a case study online

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.250
if you're interested in reading, that goes
into a lot of detail on how they used it.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.130
But he really felt like it helped them get
things done faster, and because of less travel,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.729
cheaper.
OK. Why Google Wave in an enterprise?

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.420
At its core Google Wave is about collaboration.
And when I say collaboration a lot of people

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.890
talk about collaboration, it's a word that's
thrown around a lot. And they often mean it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.420
as somebody writes something, and then somebody
else responds to what's written or comments

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.480
on what's written. When we say collaboration,
we really are aiming for people to be able

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.989
to create things together, not just someone
creates something and somebody else can comment

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.930
on it. Now most collaboration happens in small
groups. Turns out, if you're really trying

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.050
to create something together, it's very difficult
to do that with hundreds, or thousands or

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.610
millions of people. A lot of these things
end up happening in smaller groups. And it's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.530
also where a lot of the current tools are
just not as well suited. They don't really

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.930
give you the control and the flexibility that
you need to be able to work together in that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.120
sort of manner. Enterprises are, of course,
full of small groups. At their heart they

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.670
are a very large group, but they are typically
full of lots and lots of small teams trying

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.300
to get there together. Excuse me. Every enterprise
is different, and so one of the things we

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.599
want to talk about today is how you can use
extensions to start with the basics of Google

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.599
Wave but really expand it to allow you to
tailor your experience for your enterprise.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.879
OK, so what have businesses been doing with
Google Wave? Any number of things um campaign

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.580
coordination for marketing campaigns, creative
writing, um writing code, release management,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.590
project management, month end summaries, um.
Next slide. All of these things are what we

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.050
consider people working together in semi-formal
processes. The reason I say semi-formal processes

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.050
is because there are processes where everything
is 100% automated, its very heavily defined,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.650
everyone knows exactly what needs to happen,
and it happens the same way every single time.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.180
But, and this is something I suspect you guys
are all very, often painfully aware of, is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.180
that within IT a lot of these things you have
some definition to the process, sometimes

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.609
50%, sometimes 60%, sometimes 80%, but it
doesn't, but there often are these situations

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.300
where someone needs to jump in and either
fix something that has gone wrong, or there's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.550
just a part of a process that's, and somebody
has to go off and do this thing and come back

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.159
and say that its done. Um, so one of the things
that Google Wave does really well, and that

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:35.339
we've found over the course of the last year
that people had found that it did well, is

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:41.379
bringing together the sort of structured aspects
of these processes, as well as the unstructured,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.900
sort of loose, somebody's just got to do something
because all... everything's-gone-crazy-kind

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.069
of stuff. So bringing these together in one
place, so rather than having a process in

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:57.039
one place that's very formalized and steps
go through, and you know, at one step in the

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:04.039
process you see something's gone haywire and
you send emails out, you send IMs out, you

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.830
have conversations in person, etc., etc. Instead
you keep all this information in one place,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.919
so if you ever end up doing postmortems, you
can do a postmortem and find out what actually

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.089
happened during that process by looking at
all the information you gathered in one place.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:22.479
So today we're going to dive in a little bit
more on one of these semi-structured processes.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.469
And the specific one we're gonna be talking
about is release management. Release management

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:34.469
is something that most engineering organizations
are very accustomed to. For small organizations

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.800
it tends to be very unstructured and for large
organizations, very structured. But all of

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.309
it ends up having to do, you know, some build
breaks and somebody needs to fix it, and you

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:50.819
need to understand what's going on there.
So the example we're going to be talking through

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.969
today is a fictional company that we'd like
to refer to as Acme Wave and for those federation

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.460
folks out there you will recognize the name.
It's a fictional 200-person company that has

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.599
a half-time release manager that is taking
care of their whole release process. AcmePro

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.069
is the name of this, this ah, this product.
It has a Web site, backend, client, and database.

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.749
So one thing I should note is, we're going
to be going through this example process,

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:24.050
this release management process, but we're
trying to use this to illustrate an example,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.050
we're not trying to use it as a way to dictate
this is the way to do release management.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.469
We're trying to show how these sort of semi-structured
processes can work. And the same things that

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.710
we're talking about here can just as easily
be applied to all sorts of other processes.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.089
In fact I was talking to somebody last night,
who might be in the room, about using the

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.249
same types of processes for helping people
learn a language, which is a similar sort

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:53.399
of semi-structured process. So as you're watching
what we're talking about, think about how

00:06:53.399 --> 00:07:00.399
it might actually apply to the kinds of processes,
not just your release processes, that you

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.679
work on.
OK, so step 0; um just using Google Wave.

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:10.209
Um, so this is kind of a necessary first step.
One of the things, let's switch over to Wave,

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:15.699
so one of the things that Wave allows you
to do, and I imagine that most of you have

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:21.259
seen it before, flick through, yes, perfect.
So this is an example of what a release wave

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:27.139
can look like. It has each of the components
on it, it has to dos for people on the list,

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.349
it has some conversations in the middle of
things that need to get done and questions

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:38.349
that people had. So this is, so on it Andrew
is commenting on one of the issues going on.

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.959
Alan can see in real time what's happening
as Andrew is commenting. Andrew is our helper

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:47.959
in our audience; it's like a Where's Waldo
kind of thing if you can find him. So what

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:54.379
its doing is it's bringing together the ability
to comment on this specific to do item of

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:59.169
test staging, and have a real conversation
around it. Not the kind of thing where you

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:03.429
have a document that says someone needs to
test staging and in an email somewhere else

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:09.759
you're discussing well, how, you know, has
the test occurred? You know, what are we supposed

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:16.729
to do, etc., etc.? OK. So this is just starting
to use Wave, bringing some structure together

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:22.759
with some kind of less structured informal
conversation. So now, the next thing we're

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:29.050
going to show you is what we refer to as step
1. And step 1 is augment existing communications.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.050
So its going to be using a robot, and if you
go back to the Wave, we're going to add a

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:40.360
little robot that we wrote called, and when
I say we I mean Alan -- I'm a product manager

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.040
so sometimes I say we incorrectly -- wrote
called Mr. Release. And as Alan adds Mr. Release

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.190
to the Wave, one of the things that you can
see is that immediately it highlighted all

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.290
the to do items; the things that were done
it crossed out; it automatically linked any

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.500
of the individual issues. So you notice we
didn't change anything about what we were

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.600
doing in the process, but this robot just
picked up the things that are important to

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.259
us, such as tracking who has what, and the
specific issues so that we have links to them,

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:15.680
it picked up specific items, highlighted them
for us, so that we now, can have a better

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.680
understanding of how it works. And with that,
I think maybe I'll turn it over to Alan, who

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:40.470
as I said wrote Mr. Release, and he can tell
you more about how it works.

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:50.959
&gt;&gt;Alan: Right, so we've got a Robot on the
Wave. Who here has written a Robot? [Quietly]

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.029
who am I talking to? [Louder] OK so some people,
excellent. Robots are simply web applications.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:52.279
And Wave is sitting there looking at every
wave and as it changes, if there is a robot

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.519
on the wave, it'll make an HTTP request out
to the robot. The robot decides what to do;

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.480
it can interact with its own database, in
this case it's looking up a list of regular

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.360
expressions, looking for the words done and
to do, and applies annotations to that. It

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.230
packs all of the changes it needs to make
to the Wave back into the response, sends

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:07.860
that back to Wave, and Wave then applies it.
And this is happening, I dunno, within a few

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.899
hundred milliseconds here, it feels very natural.
It works quite well.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:16.899
Um, so the next thing we can do, could you
maybe flip back?

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:23.579
&gt;&gt;Greg: You got it:

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:30.579
&gt;&gt;Alan: Lets go up to the release roster.
[Pause] So this is a list of all of the releases

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:36.879
that we have, and we've tied it together into
a single wave. Its quite, if you've used wave

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:42.379
before to manage a whole list of stuff, it's
very easy to make these lists of things. Um,

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:46.449
this list is manually put together, and we
link down to each of the release waves from

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:51.680
here. Um, it's easy to maintain, but it looks
a bit ugly, and the list kind of gets a bit

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.019
out of control. There's opportunities for
people to put random comments in there, which

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:59.670
doesn't help if you're trying to look through
the list. So we can tidy that up by using

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.920
our gadget. If we go to the more modern version,
Oh no.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:06.870
&gt;&gt;Greg: Oh hold on just a second. We're about
to go to a more modern version. There we go.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:18.250
&gt;&gt;Alan: So what we've got here is a gadget,
which has all the same information, but it

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.470
structures that information nicely. There's
a drop-down list with all the participants

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.519
on the wave so it's easy to, you know, choose
somebody. And basically it's all the same

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:34.050
information but packed up into one nice little
bit on the screen. And you can have conversations

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.660
about it still, and you've got all that same
wave activity that lets you run these ad hoc

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.740
processes. Could you maybe flip over to the
next slide Greg?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.550
&gt;&gt;Greg: You got it.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:50.550
&gt;&gt;Alan: Right so, gadgets. Who's written gadgets
at all? And gadgets for Wave? [Laughs] Excellent.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:03.050
So gadgets we use open social gadgets in Wave.
But the way to think about them is that they're

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:09.999
a package with XML to define the gadget, JavaScript
to tell the gadget what to do and see assists

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.680
to tell it how to look. And brings it together
and at the moment we just stick it in a rectangle

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.560
on the Wave there. The interesting thing about
Wave gadgets is that they can store their

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.019
state in the Wave. So that everybody looking
at the Wave sees exactly the same view of

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:31.019
the gadget because they're looking at exactly
the same data. Um, Oh Greg could you, yeah.

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:36.519
So the data is stored as key valued pairs
and we've got a little representation of that

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:43.519
there. But basically standard Google gadgets.
Great, thanks. Um, could you explain this

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.410
slide because it's all high level and processy.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:52.519
&gt;&gt;Greg: Sure. Um, OK, so if you've ever dealt
with the release process, what you probably

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:57.060
know is that you have, you have on one side
people like the release manager who deals

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.550
with the process itself, and then you have
people on the flip side who own the individual

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:05.550
components. So you have somebody who owns
the client. And you really need to bring both

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.990
of those things together in an individual
build to say this is how you build this specific

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.579
component, let's say the client, in this specific
group release, and how's that going? So when

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:22.720
you're building a client for release 1.18,
how's that build going? This is something

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.449
that you can do very easily in Wave, you can
have waves interlinked with each other as

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:31.490
we've just shown you, but what you really
want to do if you want to have one of these

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:37.509
waves per component per release, if you go
to the next slide, is you have a really large

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:42.350
number of waves. Because what you're trying
to do is you're trying to work with this matrix,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:49.309
and while it's very useful to be able to have
one wave per, and have individuals be able

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:53.569
to only, you know, so the client person doesn't
have to see what's going on with the backend

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:58.610
build. He just needs to deal with his own
build. It's a lot of information to manage.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:03.569
So what we'll show you is that you can use
robots to help start to manage this information.

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:09.980
And this is something that is just available
with Version 2 Robot API to allow robots to

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:16.980
really manage multiple waves and the information
in those waves. Alan will talk to you a little

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:47.930
bit more about that.

00:14:48.249 --> 00:14:55.249
&gt;&gt;Alan: Great. [Pause]. So you click through
to the ultramodern release.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:05.870
&gt;&gt;Greg: Oooh, the ultramodern one. All right.
It's taking a little bit to set up our windows

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:18.350
&gt;&gt;Alan: Great, so this is pretty much the
same gadget except now we've also got Mr.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:27.290
Release on the wave and Mr. Release can see
what's happening in
the gadget because Mr. Release can see the

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.680
wave and all the waves' state is stored inside
the gadget. So Greg's going to click on the

00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:59.309
Make Wave button, and that's going to make
a new release wave and then a new build wave

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:09.589
for every component that's going to be in
the release. So there's five new waves with

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:17.629
just one click. And the thing is, they're
exactly the right wave. So, maybe click through

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:25.509
the release. So the release, the person managing
the release, they just want to know the high

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:43.129
level view. And here they can see, um here's
the release, all the components and their

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:56.290
particular status right now, the conversations
that have happened about it. If you could

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.689
click down into a component please? [Pause]
So somebody's trying to actually build this

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:08.689
particular component and get it out the door.
This is how a little teamworking there can

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:26.279
coordinate it so we've just made this one,
it's fresh but you know, in a typical component

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:33.279
build but not everything always goes right.
And the big issues and things and cherry pick

00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:43.679
changes in a big list here. But they can then
communicate this status back outside of their

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:47.350
little team, using yet another gadget here.
Maybe click through to Built there? Yeah.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:54.350
And then it's reflected the status back up
to the release wave. So the engineer working

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:17.010
on this particular component only worries
about their stuff, and the release manager

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:27.740
doesn't need to keep walking around to their
desk going, "Is it done yet? Is it done yet?"

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.260
Because they'll see when it's done. Right.
[Laughter]

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.380
Some people in the front row think that's
a great idea because they've had to walk around

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.090
to our desks too many times.
Ah, maybe flip back to the slides please?

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.340
&gt;&gt;Greg: you got it.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.870
&gt;&gt;Alan: Um, so what's going on here now is
very similar to what was going on before.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.870
The robots put the gadgets into the waves,
now it's looking at all of the waves. When

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.120
a change is made to one of the waves its able
to push that back out to all of the other

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.010
waves and it can still interact with its local
database. It's pretty much the same but using

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.960
this feature that lets it speaks to waves
without first being spoken to. Um, so that's

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.210
kind of all being inside Wave so far. But
because a Robot is just another web app, you

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:49.640
can also pull in data from other places within
your organization. So we've got a corporate

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.750
server down here on the bottom of this diagram.
The example we're going to use is a test server

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:58.020
for our client build, and it's just going
to sit there testing away, and when the tests

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.539
are finished and all is well, it's going to
reflect that back into the build wave. Could

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:03.470
you maybe show our mock up of the test? [Pause]

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.049
&gt;&gt;Greg: Sure. I know, all this window moving
around. All right.

00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:04.669
&gt;&gt;Alan: Right. So you've just got you know,
a teeny little web app sitting on a server

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:06.049
out there. Greg is going to pretend to be
the test server and say that this is tested

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:09.000
now and it's able, the web app then makes
a call back out to, sorry, the test status

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.250
web app makes a call out to the robot to say
that this test is done now, and the robot

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.330
is then able to push that information back
into the wave. So I think we've got a diagram

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.399
for that but it looks exactly like you'd expect.
Great, so that's, Robots working on your waves,

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.760
gadgets working on your waves, then working
together pulling in data from other places

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.320
within your organization but. Click to the
next slide. We can do even better than that,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.840
we can pull information in from all kinds
of third party applications running inside

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.510
your corporate firewall and outside your corporate
firewall. And so today we've invited along

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.500
Kris Muller from Salesforce to come, product
manager at Salesforce, to come talk to us

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:18.039
about the Salesforce chatter integration with
Wave.

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:18.890
[Clapping]

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:25.890
&gt;&gt;Kris: Thanks guys. My name is Kris and this
is Kevin and today we're going to be demoing

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:33.470
collaboration in the enterprise. And just
before we came into this session I was hanging

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.230
out with these two guys, and they shared their
secret sign for iWave. It's this. Pretty big

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:43.580
secret right? [Laughs]. Well I think we should
all have an exercise in group collaboration,

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.100
and maybe everybody raise their iWave signs
up in the air, and just give these guys some

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.539
props on a really cool product.

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:52.779
[Audience clapping]

00:19:52.779 --> 00:19:58.409
&gt;&gt;Kris: Right on. Thank you. So for those
of you that aren't familiar with Salesforce,

00:19:58.409 --> 00:20:03.960
we deliver cloud-based applications that help
businesses manage their sales efforts, their

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.600
customer support initiatives. In fact you
can build your own custom application on our

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.929
force.com platform. Today we're gonna be highlighting
our sales application, and we're logged in

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:18.960
as Jake Borland, he's the top sales rep at
a company called Serious Computers. Across

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.610
the top of the screen there, you'll notice
a series of features that really help Jake

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.110
connect with the people in his company, to
stay on top of his customers, to manage his

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.720
deals. And as a sales rep, the first thing
Jake wants to do when he first gets to the

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.269
office is keep in touch with the metrics that
matter most. What the size of his top open

00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:43.970
deals are. How he's tracking against his quota.
What the health of his pipeline looks like.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:49.390
These dashboards provide him instant visibility
into what he cares most about. And they, like

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.919
the rest of the home page, are completely
customizable. In fact Jake also has his punch

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:59.309
lists of to dos, and he gets a sense of his
meetings in that calendar component. So all

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:04.590
of these tools help make Jake much more productive,
anywhere and from any device certainly. But

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.700
as we glance back up to the top and just to
the left of Jake's name, in Salesforce we're

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.600
seeing something new. Every user now has a
persona, and this is called Chatter. This

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.980
is our new collaborative technology and it's
built into all of the applications that we

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.460
already deliver. And we think it's really
the future of enterprise business applications.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.390
Now we didn't build a brand new UI or our
own paradigm. It's meant to look a lot like

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:37.880
Facebook and really to work a lot like Facebook.
So Jake can go ahead and connect with fellow

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.110
employees to really get his job done. In fact
if you notice off to the right, Jake gets

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.929
a sense of all of his peers that are following
him. And beneath that, in turn, he sees all

00:21:48.929 --> 00:21:54.220
of those colleagues that he's following. But
it's more than just people -- data now comes

00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:01.220
to life. The data in the application is chattering.
Jake can now follow his customers, his opportunities,

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:08.929
business documents as well, like this product
road map or say marketing collateral. Jake

00:22:08.929 --> 00:22:15.159
can also provide status updates, so he can
ask his followers' questions, or he can let

00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:19.260
them know what he's up to like he's really
excited to be at Google IO.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.490
So let's see how Jake uses Chatter. Just like
when you log in to your home page of Buzz

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:31.490
or Facebook, or Twitter, you see a real-time
news feed, and you get to decide what you

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.970
want to follow. Well now you can do the same
at work. You're able to connect with people,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.909
with documents and you start to get a sense
that your colleagues are sharing best practices;

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:48.909
they're asking for referrals. In fact you
notice updates from documents like sales presentations.

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:54.630
The data itself is chattering. We notice that
a case has actually been escalated. Everything

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:59.289
is happening live. Third party systems, they
chatter as well. So we're getting an update

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:04.809
from Oracle Financials that a customer hasn't
paid their invoice. Now Jake sees something

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:09.260
interesting, if we scroll down a little bit
we notice that his sales engineer Nicole Moore

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.720
has actually pushed an opportunity out till
the end of June. And Jake naturally wants

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.929
to investigate why, so he drills in and for
those of you that aren't a regular Salesforce

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:23.190
users, what we're looking at now is an opportunity
record; this is where a sales reps spend the

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.529
majority of their time. They want to track
things like, how big the deal is, when they

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:33.340
anticipate it to close, who they are competing
against. But every record now in Salesforce

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:40.340
actually has a Chatter stream. And it's this
activity feed that helps people collaborate.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.070
So Jake can connect with people and with documents.
Ah, here we're getting some real time visibility

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:53.269
into why Nicole has actually pushed this particular
deal out. Everything is happening in real

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:58.230
time. That's really core to Chatter. And it's
important to businesses these days as well.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:03.580
I mean think about your experience on Amazon
when you buy a book. You expect it to transact

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.279
in real time. But quite frankly a lot of businesses
aren't yet working in real time. There's a

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:14.010
lot of delay in the process. You have to check
in a day or two to figure out the actual status.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:19.559
But with this system, everything is happening
immediately. So Jake's able to make the determination

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:23.659
that, OK well it looks like we're behind in
the deal because there's a gap in the product

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:28.899
that we're positioning. So what would he normally
have to do? We'd have to loop his entire team

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:32.730
in. They'd probably send a flurry of emails
back and forth before they'd finally get an

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:38.600
answer from a Product Manager about the new
feature that's gonna be released. Well I'm

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.840
happy to say that now there's a brand new
way. Jake's able to initiate a Wave. It's

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.260
a workspace that's embedded directly within
Salesforce. [Pause]

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:57.260
So as Jake creates this wave, a post is actually
going out to chatter to alert others, and

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.029
automatically you'll notice, that all of the
team members on this particular sales deal

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:08.720
have been added to the wave as well. And one
of them of course, is the sales engineer Nicole

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.220
Moore.
So Kevin, let's actually log in as Nicole

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:18.220
and get a sense of what she sees. So her experience
when she expands her chatter feed is that

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:25.029
she now sees an update. Jake has created this
wave, and she's able to drill directly in

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:31.269
and start participating. Why don't we go ahead
and split the screens here. We'll keep Nicole

00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:36.059
on the left hand side, and we'll add Jake
onto the right hand side, and they're able

00:25:36.059 --> 00:25:41.380
to now have an actual conversation. So Jake
might ask the question, "Well when will the

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.539
new feature be ready?" And the sales engineers
are typically the brains of the operation,

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:52.240
so she has the bright idea to loop in the
outsourced developer that's working on it.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.269
The outsourced developer, his name's Andrew
lets say. OK. So Jake thinks that's a great

00:25:58.269 --> 00:26:03.080
idea, and he adds that external individual,
right? This isn't somebody that's within his

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.850
business. He adds Andrew to the wave, a brand
new participant. And you all know how Wave

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:14.769
works, so Andrew's gonna get an email notification,
he's going to access his Wave client, he's

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:19.950
gonna use the playback feature to catch up
on what's happened. And maybe he uses Alan's

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.159
fancy Release gadget to automatically notify
the team of the status build, or maybe he

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:28.260
just keys in that it'll be ready in a few
days.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.950
[Audience applause]

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:36.950
This is pretty amazing right? The team's actually
gotten a live result, they've even looped

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.960
in another party, and they haven't left the
app or the context of what they're working

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:49.000
on. You can just imagine how much more businesses
are going to be able to get done. And what's

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.799
more, Jake's actually able to post an update
back into the chatter feed. So only Salesforce

00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:01.220
users, not the outsourced developers, only
Salesforce users are able to authenticate

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.980
in, here we're using some O off to go ahead
and post that update.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:12.580
So all of this security, the reliability and
availability, that as enterprises you require,

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:18.429
are available in this particular scenario.
So Jake goes ahead and broadcasts out to all

00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:22.320
the opportunity followers; that's a greater
audience than just the team members who are

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.600
working on this sales cycle. He broadcasts
out that this new build will be ready in a

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.100
day or two. So let's go ahead and go back
to the opportunity and show you what that

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:39.190
looks like. The fact that there was collaboration,
that an event occurred, that there was some

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:45.409
workflow triggered, or that a process completes,
that updates the chatter feed. So that makes

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:51.919
the team, the department, the people in the
company that care, really smart. They're made

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:58.070
aware of what happens in real time. We think
this is game changing, and so we've just launched

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:03.769
our brand new toolkit. It's Force.com for
Google Wave. We hope you guys all build really

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:09.389
exciting things. It's freely available at
developer.force.com. We think at Salesforce

00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:14.110
that Chatter is the future of our company
and in general, collaboration really is the

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:19.370
future of the enterprise. And with that, I
turn it back to you guys for some Q&amp;A maybe?

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.620
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah. Thank you.

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:23.509
&gt;&gt;Kris: All right.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:26.230
[Audience applause]

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:32.450
&gt;&gt;Greg: So what we've tried to show you today
was an example of how you can use Wave in

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:39.279
an enterprise environment or even in a small
business environment to try to do closer collaboration

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:44.639
within your groups. And there were 5 steps
to it. Step 0: starting to use wave to help

00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:48.620
bring together structured and unstructured
processes. Step 1: augment communications

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:55.090
using those robots. Step 2: add gadgets, which
allow for structured visualizations of the

00:28:55.090 --> 00:29:02.090
information. Step 3: use robots to then manage
the variety of waves you'll need in your process.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.860
Step 4: start pulling in information from
your corporate systems, and then Step 5: integrate

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.940
with some external systems such as Salesforce
that we demonstrated. So again, as I said,

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.730
this was just supposed to be an example to
illustrate how it can be done. While we love

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:23.159
Mr. Release, and in fact Mr. Release is on
Open Source, so you'll be able to get the

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:27.480
source code, we'll add the link on the live
wave for it. So if you want to check it out,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.700
or build your own variation on it, please
do, feel free. But what we're really interested

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.169
in is helping to, you guys to understand what
you could be doing with Wave, and with that

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:34.509
we'll go into some Q&amp;A, and it looked like
there was a number of questions already to

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:36.090
answer some questions you guys might have.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.350
[Silence]

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.429
All right, so are there any questions from
the audience? Yes.

00:29:40.429 --> 00:29:47.429
&gt;&gt;Person from audience: [European accent].
Yes hello. Actually I have a question regarding

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:57.460
how Salesforce integrated waves. My first
question is, can you search all of the wave

00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:07.389
which has been open for each lead that you
created on Salesforce?

00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:15.669
&gt;&gt;Kris: At this point with this toolkit that
we've created and this example application

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:22.700
that we've shown, that isn't something that
we've done, but it's certainly something that

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:31.529
you'd be able to figure out using that toolkit.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:40.860
&gt;&gt;Person from audience: OK. Because actually
the issue I can see so far, with Google Wave

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:49.750
you have all the wave in a single place. In
your application, all the waves are spread

00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:57.909
out on your application, so what I fear is
that you've got some important information

00:30:58.159 --> 00:31:05.159
that you can cross reference, and then you
need a search engine running to do so.

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:33.669
&gt;&gt;Greg: So one thing about embedded waves
is all of those waves that you are a participant

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:42.809
on will also show up in your inbox. So all
of the waves across, that you're on a variety

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:54.210
of pages in Salesforce, will still all show
up in your inbox together so if you don't

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.259
want to go back to those places to communicate,
you can communicate with them together in

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:03.110
your inbox.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:09.600
&gt;&gt;Person from audience: Ah, makes sense. Thanks

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.179
&gt;&gt;Greg: Alright. Are there some questions
from the floor or should we do [pause]

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:17.879
&gt;&gt;Alan: One from the moderator

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:18.779
[Pause]

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:25.779
&gt;&gt;Alan: [reading]. So will Wave be released
to install on a local server within the enterprise,

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:41.549
not just as a federated server as it is now,
but in its entirety.

00:32:47.769 --> 00:32:54.769
&gt;&gt;Greg: Ah yes. Um, so we are, as you probably
saw from the announcement, we are open sourcing

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:06.450
more and more of the code all the time. In
terms of when it's going to be totally finished,

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:13.450
we don't have a predicted date yet, but already,
and this is actually a good opportunity for

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:27.019
me to mention, that there are a number of
people demoing out in the developers sandbox

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:36.419
area, and some of them are working on their
own Wave servers. So if you want the whole

00:33:42.139 --> 00:33:49.139
Wave experience as it looks today with the
client and with the Wave server that you can

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:08.620
run behind your own firewall, we're still
working towards that goal but we don't have

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.850
a specific date for when that will happen
yet.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.800
&gt;&gt;Alan: Do you want to get Dan out?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.840
[Inaudible question from audience]

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:32.840
&gt;&gt;Greg: Right, so we just, we did just open
source our editor, approximately 100,000 lines

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:40.500
of code, which is one of the largest portions
of our client, so we wanted to make that available

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:51.860
so people can start to work with that as well.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.410
[Pause]

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.160
Do you have a question?

00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:02.160
&gt;&gt;Person 2 in audience: I just saw the um,
for the robots the effectiveness of having

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.840
a web app that can talk directly to the robot
which can then initiate or make changes in

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:24.040
waves. I have a little bit of experience in
the gadgets, but not the robots, so with
the simple post that can initiate, is that

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:04.740
basically the way that you would, like the
standard by which you would update or notify

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:13.520
a robot. And then there was actually, where
it looked like the robot was actually sending

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:23.810
a post to a wave, and I guess I wasn't, I
didn't know that it worked like that, I just

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.940
needed some clarification about that.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:49.940
&gt;&gt;Alan: Right, Yeah I did skirt over some
detail there. Um, so the wave does send a

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:07.210
post out to your robot but it's a JSON request,
a JSON-RPC request. We have a client library,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:27.410
which you run inside your robot which interprets
that request and then delivers it to your

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:38.310
application by calling in on document changed
method, or an on participant added method,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:47.950
so its of the highest semantic level. And
likewise you can manipulate the wavelet as

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:10.660
objects, and then the library packs all that
back up into a JSON packet to send back to

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.760
the robot.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:27.590
&gt;&gt;Person 2 in audience: Oh Ok. Thanks a lot.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.320
&gt;&gt;Greg: We'll take another question from the
moderator.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:38.320
&gt;&gt;Alan: Ok. [Reading] Is there a Google Wave
app for android phones? I can't view the waves

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:53.210
on my 'droid. It keeps complaining about the
browser.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:05.680
&gt;&gt;Greg: Ah yeah, so currently there actually
is an android compatible version of the Wave

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:13.580
client. But it's still quite slow. This is
one of the areas while we're out of preview

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:24.010
and now into labs, one of the things we need
to do before we actually launch is to have

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:38.780
a mobile client. If you are using android
with Froyo, performance is much better. But

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:52.930
it's still, you still might feel it's a little
slow. One of the things we've been talking

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:03.720
about over the course of the last two days
are the new API's that we're providing, they

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:10.010
would allow someone to access, to essentially
build an android client. And I believe there's

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.650
some folks out in the developers' sandbox
who are looking towards doing that. So right

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:21.650
now, there's not a fully,full-featured and
fast android client or iPhone client. But

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:30.180
we're working towards that. The one thing
if you want to try to wanna try to use it

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:40.660
with your android phone, when you go to Wave,
you're gonna get a splash screen telling you

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:59.260
that Wave is not compatible with your browser.
There's a thing that allows you to click through

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:15.890
on that, and just continue to try to use

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:38.030
it anyway, we just felt like we probably should
warn people about these things, so it's mostly

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:48.420
a warning you can click through if you want
to give it a try.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.650
[Pause]

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:00.330
Questions from the floor?

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:07.330
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 1: Can you [inaudible]
browser and use an android [inaudible]

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.570
&gt;&gt;Greg: I'm sorry. The question?

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:16.060
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 1: [inaudible] browser
in android would make a difference?

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:23.060
&gt;&gt;Greg: So the question is, are there any
other Android browsers that would make a difference

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:33.400
in this. Um, you know to be honest, I don't
think we've tested all the android browsers,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:48.540
so um, it could. That's' something we really
should test actually. Yeah we haven't tested

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:59.200
through all of them. All right, so the next
question: Is Google, is Wave going to be a

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:12.840
part of Google Apps? The answer is yes. Actually
no, the answer is, it already is as of yesterday.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:35.960
So if you are trying to use, if you would
like to use Google Wave in your domain, you

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:52.420
can get Google Apps. It's available for Standard,
Premier and Education, so if you have, if

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:28.990
you already have a domain you can just go
into your control panel and turn it on. And

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:37.860
if you want to try using it for your domain
you can sign up for Google Apps and try using

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.530
it that way. Question.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:46.830
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: [Heavy European
accent] Yes. Sorry. Can you pre-field a wave

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:53.730
from an API? Can you pre-field a wave from
an API? For instance, instead of creating

00:44:53.730 --> 00:45:00.730
a blank wave, I would like to create a Pre-Field
wave image and then like, as I see in Salesforce

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.760
add people on it, you know directly create
something on the spot about a specific topic.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.060
Is it possible?

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:18.060
&gt;&gt;Alan: Yes. In fact that's what we were showing
with the release wave and the component build

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:26.480
waves. There wasn't actually a lot of content
in there, but the robot inserts a gadget and

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:35.430
a title and a little bit of text and puts
that in there, and you can see the source

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.480
code and there'll be a link in the live wave.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:47.030
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: But it is, what
you've shown is text within Wave. My question

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:52.480
is from, I will say, any kind of source that
shares RSS feed, can you for instance use

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:58.500
this RSS feed in order to create a wave?

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:05.500
&gt;&gt;Alan: Oh. Can you use an RSS Feed?

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:14.960
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: For example any
kind of source, an external source from Google

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:28.860
Wave could be integrated within a new blank
wave from an API, is it possible?

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:41.980
&gt;&gt;Alan: Yes. Yes. So what you need to do is,
the robot web app needs to make a call back

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.660
into Wave to say, "Create this wave, add this
content and then add these participants."

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:08.850
So exactly what calls you would make depends
on exactly what you're thinking of doing.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:36.790
That's kind of what the um, when we we're
updating the component status from the test

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:45.470
status application, that's what it was doing
although it wasn't actually creating a Wave.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:54.380
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: OK. And adding participants
to the wave like I've seen on Salesforce,

00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:03.050
so you have, to know, each users who has already
a Google Wave account right, because in Salesforce

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:11.040
I guess not everyone has a Google Wave account.
So how you can you manage this case?

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.510
&gt;&gt;Greg: I'm sorry sir, the question was? Can
you repeat the question?

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:24.510
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: In Salesforce, I
don't think that all users in Salesforce have

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:32.740
Google wave accounts. And then you want to
create a wave with those people. How can you

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.150
manage the situation.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:43.150
&gt;&gt;Kris: So Quentin here has an answer. He
is the one who built the toolkit Sales Force.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.640
&gt;&gt;Quentin: [inaudible]

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.020
&gt;&gt; Kris: Can you use a mic too?

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:56.890
&gt;&gt;Greg: Do we have a, we could repeat what
Quentin says.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:02.430
&gt;&gt; Kris: Maybe at the back of the isle there

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:09.430
&gt;&gt;Greg: Either that or you can cozy up, and
you can talk into my mic.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:21.330
&gt;&gt; Quentin: Can you hear that? So in Salesforce,
it's pretty easy to create custom fields.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:34.380
So all of the users that you saw that were
added to the wave, we had a custom field that

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:44.730
had a Google wave address. So by default it
will only add people onto the wave that have

00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.540
wave addresses.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:06.540
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 2: So they are automatically
created when we are added on a wave? And we

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.480
don't have an account for instance?

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:18.480
&gt;&gt; Quentin: So in the example here, a system
administrator or maybe even the user themselves,

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:27.820
would go and update their user profile. One
of
the fields they can add is first name, last

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:43.150
name, wave address, so on and so forth. So
the toolkit will go and look and see, can

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:53.280
I up add this participant to the wave, i.e.,
do they have a wave address? If they do, add

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:07.470
them in automatically. And then through the
active robot API will actually do an add participant,

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:14.550
which is the API method call that will add
that user using the wave address.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:26.720
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 2: Ok. And can you
create accounts on the spot, if it is necessary?

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:52.280
&gt;&gt;Greg: So this is something, that if you
are using Google apps, specifically. Google

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:59.400
Apps does come with, I believe with Premier,
there is an API that allows you to create

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:06.960
accounts on the fly. So you could do that
if you had a Google Apps domain with wave

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.960
enabled. The other thing that we should just
mention is, for those waves that are embedded,

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:20.110
if you don't happen to have a Google wave
account, you can still see it. Essentially

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:27.110
anyone can see the wave if they can get access
to that page, but you can't interact with

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:42.330
it unless you have an account. So you can
embed it there, everyone who's on that specific

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:06.500
record can see the wave. Then you could use
Google Apps API's to generate a new user to

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:18.120
associate it with the current user in your
domain. If that all makes sense.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:23.700
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 2: Make sense. Thanks.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.870
&gt;&gt; Greg: Absolutely, thanks. Ah, next question
from the moderator.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:32.630
&gt;&gt; Alan: How integrated will Wave be with
the current product set, and vice versa?

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:38.790
&gt;&gt;Greg: I'm assuming the current product set
is the current Google Apps product set. This

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:45.790
is something that we are working on constantly
to bring together more of the products between

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:54.630
Wave, and the other products in Google Apps.
I don't have unfortunately any specific timelines,

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:05.200
as too when any of these things will be done.
But we certainly are talking to all the other

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:12.050
teams within Google Apps, to bring some of
these things together more closely. Um, one

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:19.050
there already is, is if you use Google spreadsheets,
there is an extension that you can use to

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:38.810
embed a Google spreadsheet into a wave. So
that's sort of one type of integration. The

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.170
Google spreadsheet.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.170
[Inaudible Background comment]

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:51.280
&gt;&gt; Greg: Ah. Soon there will be an extension
to integrate Google spreadsheets into Wave.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:58.280
So that's one type. The other type of integration
to do is to allow you to export data from

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:08.610
a wave into something else such as Google
Docs, or something like that. So those are

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:24.550
some of the types of things we are working
on. Other questions? In the audience. Yes.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:37.660
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 3: What approaches
did you use in Sales Force to change the culture

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:45.300
to adopt Google Wave?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:51.550
&gt;&gt; Greg: Just to repeat the question, what
approaches did you use in Sales Force to change

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:54.510
the culture to adopt Google Wave?

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:57.470
&gt;&gt; Kris: Well this was an example application,
so it's not to say that the employees of Salesforce

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.820
are making use of this yet. I think that it
will definitely enrich everybody's collaborative

00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.970
capabilities. If I were to throw out some
suggestions on how you could entice them to

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:00.910
do it? I think one would be just to put it
in front of them, right? Have a certain pilot

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.330
group that starts professing how it's changed
their lives. That would be really helpful.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:05.250
That's one of the tactics we've taken with
chatter. So we've rolled it out to 500 beta

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:06.650
customers, and sometimes it started with just
small pilot groups, and it's gone sort of

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:08.110
viral within the enterprise from there. So
I would recommend that as a first step.

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:15.110
&gt;&gt;Greg: And this is something that we, with
all of the business we've talked to, the way

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.080
they really get started is pretty much precisely
that. Choose a small project, have the people

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.740
on that project get started on it. Because
then you learn a lot about sort of how your

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.710
organization works. What are the cultural
norms and etiquette in your organization that

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:32.560
have already formed, and then build on top
of those, rather than try to jam a solution

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:32.810
in and change everybody immediately. [Pause]
Ah, next question.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:32.870
&gt;&gt;Alan: Will wave get an export function that
will export a wave to document in Google Doc's.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:32.990
&gt;&gt; Greg: It is certainly something we are
thinking about and looking at. Although, again,

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.090
we don't have any specific dates.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.130
&gt;&gt;Quentin: One quick additional comment that
I think will be helpful for folks. One thing

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:37.360
we shipped was the ability so that robots
don't have to be on Google App engine anymore.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.220
And so we're rolling that out right now, and
that's going to be another thing for tailoring

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:38.620
in the enterprise.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.870
&gt;&gt; Greg: I'm sorry, say again?

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.120
&gt;&gt; Quentin: Tailoring in the enterprise.

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.370
&gt;&gt; Greg: Yes exactly, yes, question.

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:47.830
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 4: Security monologues,
starting from 0, if I wanted to have a product

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:54.830
and add four developers under the [inaudible]
at the start, and then as it matured, then

00:56:55.190 --> 00:57:02.190
I'd introduce it to people in the marketplace.
How do I keep everybody from seeing it? Do

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.180
I need a Google apps account? [inaudible]

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.250
&gt;&gt; Greg: So if I understand the question,
with the security model behind it, in terms

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:16.060
of, how can you sort of start something small
and then bring more and more people in as

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.240
the project is developing or as the design
is developing, or something of that sort?

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.220
So the way Google wave works right now, for
people who aren't as familiar with it, is

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:30.220
the list of participants at the top of the
wave, are the complete set of people who have

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.020
access to that wave. Now earlier when I mentioned
that you would be able to see an embedded

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.010
wave. That was specifically if you'd actually
added Public to that wave as a way to be able

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:45.520
to say everybody has access to the wave. So
we want to be, and this is one of these things

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.230
that we want to be excessively clear on, that
the only people who have access to that wave

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.690
are the people in the participant bar at the
top. Now there are groups up there, which

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:51.070
are additional people. And then there's groups,
and then there's public which means basically

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:51.390
that anyone can have access to it. So that's
the first step.

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.830
There's also are two types of access permissions
we have to Wave. One is Full Access. Which

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:59.980
means the person can do anything on the wave,
they can edit any of the blips, as we refer

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:06.380
to them, can delete blips, that sort of thing.
Then there is Read Only, which means the person

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.480
can see the wave, but they can't make any
changes to it. This is the kind of permission

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.730
model you would use to roll it out. Initially
you would have a small set of people who'd

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:17.680
be working together. You might add in a group,
so that they could see what was going on with

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.540
that wave, as read only. Meaning all of the
group can see the wave, but they can't change

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:19.790
the wave, they can't edit it, they can't do
anything to it, they can just see it. And

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:20.010
then sort of grow from there.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.090
[Inaudible question from audience]

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:20.140
&gt;&gt; Greg: Were you talking about building an
extension? No, ok.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:20.260
&gt;&gt; Greg: [laughs] Thanks Stef. Next question.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.330
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 5: So yesterday at
the Go session they were talking about being

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.520
how you will be able write robots with Go
now. Does that mean that you're going to have

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:20.730
Go available in App Engine, or is that when
you're write your robots on an external box?

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.960
&gt;&gt; Greg: So that is writing Go code, not in
App Engine, so it's on an external system.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:21.180
This is part of robots being available everywhere.
[Pause] Additional questions? Go for the moderator

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.380
again?

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:21.390
&gt;&gt; Alan: Any plans for a wave android app?

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:21.760
&gt;&gt; Greg: I think I answered that, but the
answer is, the direction we are taking with

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.320
that is specifically building a web based
version of our app for Android, that will

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.330
work with Android, not necessarily a native
Android app. So we are working on that, and

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:23.580
that's our plan. Next question. Ah yes.

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:25.810
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 6: We were talking
about using Wave with the enterprise. So what

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:30.390
kind of features for, like options for the
webmaster of the company to moderate the wave

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:34.400
in order to not let the user delete the wave
or something like that?

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.760
&gt;&gt; Greg: So one question was, if we are using
wave in the enterprise, what are some of the

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.010
feature we are planning to put into wave,
to really allow admins to get better control

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:36.190
over what their users are doing in the enterprise?
That sort of thing. So in the mid-term I would

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.200
say, one of the main things we really want
to allow administrators to do, is have robots

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.090
that are active on all the waves in the domain.
So this is something that we are looking at

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.550
doing, although again, we don't have a specific
timeline for it. The reason for that is, it

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.280
means that the administrator can write robots
to do whatever they feel like. So for instance,

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:45.730
if you were a company that was being sued,
and you had to keep some of the content that's

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.980
in waves. You could have a robot that basically
just makes sure that even if all the other

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.010
participants are removed from the wave, that
wave is never actually deleted. The way it

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:46.040
works right now is that if you remove everyone
from a wave, that wave is removed from our

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.070
servers within 60 days. But you could have
a robot to essentially say, you know that

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:46.100
sticks around permanently. We have talked
to people who are interested in making sure

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:46.120
that specific confidential information wasn't
put into waves, and you could have a robot

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:46.150
that would look for regular expressions, matching
specific patterns of confidential information,

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.170
and reverting any of those changes people
have tried to make in the wave. So our basic

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.000
approach is, we want to empower admins by
letting them use robots to do this sort of

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.250
thing. That being said, we are also building
some additional things that are going to be

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.280
absolutely necessary in the enterprise, such
as admins being able to get access to all

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.470
of the, all of the waves in their domain,
you know, for instance if people leave the

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.720
domain and you need access to clean up their
old data, those sorts of things. So we're

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:50.870
looking to build those kind of things right
now.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.240
&gt;&gt;Alan: Will there be a set of tools or presentation
materials available to tech savvy users inside

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:51.530
a business for the purpose of converting co-workers
and bosses to Wave.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.870
&gt;&gt;Greg: David Ellsdat of Chicago, Illinois,
that's a great question. Um, no I seriously,

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:52.270
we, absolutely. This is one of those things
were doing more of, to try to help people,

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.630
arm people with the tools they need to talk
to other people within their organization

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.130
about Wave and help educate them on Wave.
The case study about Deloitte that I mentioned

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:54.890
earlier is just one of these things to help
people understand in more detail. But we are

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:55.140
starting to put together more materials to
allow people to essentially sell Wave internally.

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:55.200
This is something we talked about yesterday
maybe a little bit, which is; because Wave

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.740
is a very flexible platform and product, and
protocol, what it means is that every organization

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.600
is going to use it slightly differently, so
rather than us making a lot of materials to

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.410
explain to everyone what Wave's doing, while
we're gonna do some of that, we really want

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.590
to empower the individual administrators or
the people who are sort of bringing Wave into

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.750
their organization to explain how to use their
processes. And so, some of the things that

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:05.330
we're looking at building are ways that you
can have, when you install an extension, to

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:06.030
be able to install, to save searches with
that extension, so you can help to tailor

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:06.640
the persons's client that's installing it,
installing that extension to help sort of

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.400
show them the things that would be interesting
to them. So we're really trying to build tools

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:08.650
to allow admins and sort of people bringing
it in to the organization to explain it to

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:08.900
their organization directly.
And same searches did ship excellent, that's

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.360
what I like to hear. Next question.

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:10.610
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 7: Hi. Um, at a certain
class of Enterprise App you have to start

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:10.780
thinking about things like globalization,
disability law, accommodating screen readers

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.880
and other things that are not mouse, or otherwise
oriented. Are you going to start building

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.050
out editors that allow apps to comply with
some of those things. If you're selling into

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.210
governments and they say is it accessible
to disabled people?

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.500
&gt;&gt;Greg: So this is something we're already
looking into. And one of the things that's

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:11.750
actually really interesting about it, is Wave
because of the extension of framework you

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:11.780
have in Wave, it actually has the potential
to do a lot of really interesting things,

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:11.810
such as if somebody was talking about using
Wave robots to automatically highlight words

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:11.830
and then speak them, as they, to help people
kind of, ah low vision users to read through

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:11.870
a wave. So there's extensions that can be
built but just at the core of the product,

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:11.900
we do need to do more work in the accessibility
realm. And we are working on that.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.940
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 8: OK. Just for the
other people in the room, for just another

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:11.970
example of an integration between an enterprise
app and Wave. We're from Oracle and we've

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:12.000
built a similar integration into the Salesforce,
so Kudos to the Salesforce people, but come

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:12.030
by and take a look at that as well. 'Coz we
also think that Wave here is a very exciting

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.070
prospect for the future of applications. Thank
You.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:12.080
&gt;&gt;Greg: And I'll definitely second that. Over
at the developers' sandbox there's a lot of

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:12.110
really interesting things that people have
built, from project management applications,

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.130
to time management applications, integrations
with Oracle, SAP, and Salesforce. So, there's

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:12.160
a lot of really interesting things over there
if you're thinking about using Wave in your

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:12.190
business, to ah, to sort of check that out.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:12.200
&gt;&gt;Alan: Next question. Will Google develop
a feature that helps enterprise employees

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.230
to receive and send Google Apps mail from
Google Wave directly?

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.250
&gt;&gt;Greg: Ah yes, the email question, as we're
gonna refer to it probably forever. Um, so

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:12.280
we're looking at a variety of different ways
to integrate Wave and email. I think, we're

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:12.310
looking at some things of integrating wave
and Gmail to see what that could look like.

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:12.340
But also just Wave and email directly. Right
now you can get a notification from, um, from

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:12.380
wave to say that there's a new wave for you.
Fairly soon you'll be able to add just email

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:12.410
users to a wave, and then they'll be able
to get an email based on that wave. Um, so

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:12.450
we're sort of rolling out some of these things,
but again, we tend to roll them out as experiments

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:12.490
to see what works and what doesn't work. Because
it's, the interaction between Wave and email

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.520
is kind of a tricky little beast, and so we're
trying to make sure it's as smooth as possible.

00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:12.560
[Pause] [Laughs] Alan, please ask the question.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:12.570
&gt;&gt;Alan: Really? Is it that hard to get Wave
to work on the iPad?

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:12.600
&gt;&gt;Greg: Answer is yes apparently [laughs].
So we know why Wave doesn't work on the iPad,

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:12.630
we haven't fixed why Wave doesn't work on
the iPad. It turns out it is trickier than

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.660
you might imagine. We actually had tried it
on the emulator at one point, and it seemed

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:12.690
fine and it works on the iPhone, but it doesn't
work on the iPad, which made us very sad.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:12.730
But it is something we're working on. [Pause]
Question.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:12.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Should I grab this next one?

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.760
&gt;&gt;Alan: Sure. When [pause]

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:12.770
&gt;&gt;Greg: Just add a Will

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.780
&gt;&gt;Alan: Ok, when will Google Wave federation
port be open on Wave.google.com instead of

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:12.810
Sandbox? Dan.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:12.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: yes, so at this particular point we
don't have a timeframe for it. We are working

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:12.840
to do it as soon as we can. But the approach
we're taking here is there's more model changes

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.880
that we need to make to the wave model and
then we'll be able to open that port and that

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.920
why we're open sourcing the model. And so
this is part of that hundred thousand lines

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:12.950
that we're finishing on the open source that
Greg mentioned earlier. That's the base situation

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:12.980
there.

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:12.980
&gt;&gt;Greg: So the next one, ah, a question.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:13.000
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: [French accent]
Yes, sorry. I would like to know if it was

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.030
possible to parse the text within a wave and
then to send it somewheres.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:13.060
&gt;&gt;Greg: So I think the question is, is it
possible to parse text?

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:13.080
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: yeah

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.090
&gt;&gt;Greg: using wave robot and then send it
somewhere else?

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.110
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: Yeah right.

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:13.120
&gt;&gt;Greg: Depending on what you mean by parsed
text, absolutely. So one of the things that

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:13.160
Alan's robot that you saw did was it, well
actually both of them, so the chatter integration

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:13.190
did this as well, where they said at chatter,
then typed something then sent it into the

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:13.220
chatter feed. I think that was a great example
of that.

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: Is it possible to
imagine some kind of Add Sense system within

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.270
a wave?

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.280
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Greg: I think it's possible to imagine
it. Um, it's ah, right now we're not heavily

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:13.310
focused on kind of modernization in terms
of trying to figure out how to incorporate

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:13.340
something like Add Sense into Wave. But we
certainly have thought about lots of ideas

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:13.370
in that area.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:13.370
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: And is it possible
to call external API within widget, which

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.400
is designed for a Wave application?

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:13.420
&gt;&gt;Alan: So the question is, is it possible
to call the

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.440
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 9: Different API, for
instance other Google API or external API

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:13.460
from other application and to

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:13.470
&gt;&gt;Alan: Oh, from a gadget?

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.480
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 9: Yeah, yeah.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.500
&gt;&gt;Alan: Yes, gadgets can make calls out to
other severs. If you go around to the Sandbox,

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:13.530
it was Travel With Me, and Hostel With Me
around the Sandbox. Those guys do a really

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:13.560
great job of grabbing information from all
different sources so you can see exactly where

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:13.590
you're going and what it looks like.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:13.600
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 9: and display it
on a wave?

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.620
&gt;&gt;Alan: It's displayed right in the wave of
the gadget. It looks great.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:13.650
&gt;&gt; Male audience member 9: Thanks

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:13.660
&gt;&gt;Greg: I guess we'll do one more question
from here, and there's one more question in

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:13.690
the audience, we'll take that and then we'll
wrap up. Yep.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:13.710
&gt;&gt;Alan: Has the wave team made public a list
of organizational use cases with links to

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.740
white paper studies and other material discussing
wave collaboration in the work place?

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:13.770
&gt;&gt;Greg: Ah actually yes. So if you go to Wave.google.com/
I believe it's /about.html. Somewhere thereabouts,

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:13.800
you'll be able to, we actually do have a list
of examples of how people are using wave,

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:13.830
as well as the web paper that we talked about
with Deloitte. One of the things we do a lot

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:13.870
of times is when we find out and hear about
really good use cases we write up a blog post,

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:13.910
[cough] excuse me, about them and post them
to our blog. And so one of the things that

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:13.950
does is it links out both to our blog posts
where people have talked about organizations

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.980
using wave, as well as link to other organization
blog posts that they've made talking about

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.010
using Wave.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.010
[inaudible question from audience]

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:14.020
&gt;&gt;Greg: That's a great point. So the good
team in VMware have offered to write a case

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:14.060
study in their usage of Wave as they built
the project that they worked on that we announced

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.090
yesterday. So that's something that we'll
definitely look into to putting up there as

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.120
well. Unless there's any other last questions,
thank you so much for coming today. A couple

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.150
of last pitches I wanna make are: please stay
in your seats and hear about the new Google

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:14.180
Wave Media APIs, which is the next session
in this room. If you're interested please

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.210
stick around for that. Check out the Sandbox,
there's a lot of really interesting and cool

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.250
stuff going on there. And try out Wave in
your organization. Thanks.

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:14.270
[Applause]
