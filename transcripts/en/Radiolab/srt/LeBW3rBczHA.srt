00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,950
Listening to radio lab radio

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,800
from W N y.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,200
S. A. N. P. Hello. I'm Jad. I'm
Robert. This is radio lab, the podcast.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,700
So today, uh, slightly off beat, uh,

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,310
exploration of acoustic warfare.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,730
And we're going to do it by looking at
the, a famous, do you know this story?

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,890
Aye. I know what we're doing.
Should I, you remind me,

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,400
I've heard the phrase walls of Jericho
and I know nothing else about it.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,020
It's most famous as a song, Josh,

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,850
the battle of Jericho. Jericho, Jericho.

11
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:43,000
Joshua fought the battle of Jericho and
the walls came tumbling down. Pneumonia.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,560
Nudity.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,350
No idea. You don't know
that? No. Before my time.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,220
It's a, it's a, it's a negro spiritual
to black and said Pac American spiritual.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,623
And it's like,

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,050
anyway, so tell us the story so we
can get started. Well, as you know,

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,420
the Hebrew people crossed the Red Sea and
then wandered around in the desert for

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,020
awhile. We'll just say I knew that 40
years, 40 years. And now we're up to,

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,210
we're almost into the promised land,

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,050
but there is this city called
Jericho who is inside Jericho. Well,

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,930
the Jared Cohen's really the Jericho
and they don't know much about them

22
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,380
actually. Why aren't they friendly?
Are they against God? No, they're just,

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,980
they just, I think they have all these
40,000 people showed up at the, hey,

24
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,420
who are these people? I get the value.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,970
So they were just looking after
their property, I suppose.

26
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,080
Or maybe they just didn't like what they
saw. Okay. Now Jericho, you're reading.

27
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,220
Now I'm reading from the Bible.

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,790
Now Jericho was tightly shut
because of the sons of Israel.

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,730
So I guess constant gotta take
Jericho. Maybe that was it.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm a little fuzzy here on the cause
of the thing. It had to be done,

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,390
had to be done. However,
now quoting the Bible,

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,190
Jericho was tightly shut
because it had a wall. Yeah.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,000
So read the part about how
they knocked down the wall.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,530
Here's the formula from the mouth of
God, and you shall march around the city,

35
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:06,150
all the men of war, circling the city
once and you shall do so for six days.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,620
And on the seventh day you shall march
around the city seven times and seven

37
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,410
priests shall carry seven
trumpets of rams horns.

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,390
It's a show far actually is a Ram's Horn
and the priest shall blow the trumpets

39
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,050
and it shall be the wall of the city
will fall flat down and they do this with

40
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,040
seven trumpets. He say yes.
All right, so here we go.

41
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,310
The question we have then for this
podcast is what would it really take?

42
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,800
Josh got the battle of Jericho to do this.

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,150
I'm talking without God only CUNY
physics through your headphones,

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,770
independent, left and right. Volume
control should be fairly comfortable.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,820
Is it just in principle possible
for sound to blow down a wall?

46
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,700
That's their question. We actually
called up a guy who's thought about this.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,350
I'm an acoustical consultant.

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,380
David Loveman is his name
and an acoustical and if you
think about the nature of

49
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,320
sound, it's a fluctuating
pressure. Explain the wind sound,

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,610
hits an object like the waves actually
push the object but also pull at it many

51
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,800
times per second in theoretically.

52
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,100
He says if he can get enough of
those pushes and pulls on the wall,

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,990
eventually it will begin to crumble.

54
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,310
So the first question he asked nationally
is what kind of wall are we dealing

55
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,640
with?

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,030
Oh,

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,800
well looking at the construction of
Brian's age walls in the Middle East,

58
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,120
uh, there were mud brick walls. Uh,

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,980
how the question then was how
much sound would be necessary?

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,940
What volume to topple a wall like that?
Yeah. And he came up with a number.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,670
This is a technical number
for the strength of the sound.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,820
You'd need to produce 177 DV.

63
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,040
177 decibels. Yes. That would
knock down the wall. Yes.

64
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,920
How, how many decibels? Just for scale
is my voice right now roughly? Oh,

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,300
your voice is probably
about 60 or 65 decibels.

66
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,640
Oh, so already a third of the way
there. Just talking. Well, no,

67
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,110
Jerry go body. Here's where
the issue start. Turns out,

68
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,930
he says it sound doesn't add up the
way that you would think a shoe.

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,000
And there's the rub. Assume that
your voice level was 60 decibels.

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,110
In order to get the 70 disheveled,

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,370
you would have to produce
10 times as much power.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,750
Just didn't make much sense to us
until we ended up doing what he did in

73
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:34,390
recruiting some experience show far
blowers from a heading towards there are

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
from synagogues. Yes. We went up to all
souls. A unit. What does it all souls.

75
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,480
UNITARIAN church. Many times a month.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,710
That church actually is hosting to a
synagogue. Oh my God, I hear them. Crap.

77
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,100
Did you hear that? Like animals dying.

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,563
[inaudible]

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,720
alright, so shofars were the horns
that apparently knocked down the wall.

80
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,860
So we wanted to measure how loud they
could be and we were lucky enough to find

81
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:11,210
this guy Panter Daniel Pincus,
who got together about 10 people.

82
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,340
Everybody with their rams horns. Okay.

83
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,310
A Yemenite show far. The Daniels
was not quite a Ram's horn.

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,090
Probably from either an animal called
a kudu, perhaps from an antelope.

85
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,990
I'm not exactly sure. It's quite big.
Quite big. It's about [inaudible]

86
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,980
two

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,320
[inaudible] fee plus a few inches. Wow.
In that somewhat corkscrew shape. Um,

88
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,510
so any case he got us started and eh,

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,020
we asked them to blow his show far as
loud as he could and we were going to

90
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,550
measure the decibel level

91
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,943
[inaudible]

92
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,840
just up to 96 but now I'm
not satisfied. All right,

93
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,850
so that was our baseline. 96
decibels for one show far player.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,810
But interestingly when we doubled it
had to show far players listen to what

95
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:03,644
happened.

96
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,480
We only got up to 98 just shy
of 99 and when we doubled that,

97
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,670
went from two to four show far players

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,350
[inaudible]

99
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,560
we only bumped it up three more
decibels. Think we got a hundred a month.

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,793
Wow.

101
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,680
Turns out, and this is
actually a rule of thumb.

102
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,890
Anytime you want to bump up your
overall volume by three decibels,

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
you've got to double

104
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,420
[inaudible]

105
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,830
the amount of shofar players. So if
you want to go from 101 DV to 104,

106
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,470
that means going from four
show far players to eight.

107
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,750
Do you want to go from 104 to 107?

108
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,750
That means eight shofar players become 16.

109
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,370
And if you want to go from there
all the way up to our target 177 DB,

110
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,950
well then you're going to
have to double yourself a lot.

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,540
But here's the question. How many
Indian, how many shofars would you need?

112
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,650
I'll make the roles of jerk and down.

113
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,330
The number I calculate it is 407,380

114
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,730
and it might take a while.

115
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,730
Well wait a second. Seven is what
the Bible says. And you just said

116
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,400
(400) 700-0380

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,650
yes. And that would be a minimum number.

118
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,170
That's five rose bowls
full of trumpet players.

119
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,050
But of course if it was a
miracle, all bets are off.

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,980
But what if you could get that number of
people together? Could you still do it?

121
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,390
Can you knock down the
wall? Well, with the,

122
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,400
with the puny physic went into David,
we still have a problem. Unfortunately,

123
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:44,780
the problem I had was getting a very
large number of men show close to the wall

124
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,430
that we could produce the necessary
pressure. And as I added men,

125
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,890
I'd have to put them
further and further back.

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,030
Imagine he says you've got all these
hornblower's hundreds of thousands at this

127
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:59,000
wall. You've got to organize
them, put them in rows,

128
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,350
and that creates a little bit of a
situation. Oh yes. Well, the, uh, the, uh,

129
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,890
people in the front row would,
uh, have their heads blown off

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,960
by the lash of the people behind
them. That's a sort of problem.

131
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,390
If you're a musician, I think if you'd
like, we could do an experiment. Uh,

132
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,910
do you volunteer? No,

133
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
she thinks about

134
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,000
[inaudible].

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,181
Okay.

136
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:31,020
But what if you could put the people
in the front row and helmets to protect

137
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:35,220
them then continuously we have
another problem. That's right.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,810
The sound according to the,

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,450
has to be focused in as to actually sort
of point at one spot on the wall when

140
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:44,850
you put that many people
together in front of a wall.

141
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,520
Some of them are gonna be
way behind the ones in front.

142
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,990
We're going to lose focus and there's
the problem. But then we found woody.

143
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,260
Yeah. My formal name is Norris.

144
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,240
I go by woody.

145
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,060
We called woody because, well,
he's an inventor, president,

146
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:04,710
chairman and CEO of a brand new company
called parametric sound corporation and

147
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,130
he may be able to help us with our
focus problem because he's invented a

148
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,720
technology that can beam sound
in a direct line like a laser,

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,710
which I'm going to demonstrate for your
friend here. Let's check some of these,

150
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,950
some of these things up. That's
reporter Kirk Conan. Okay.

151
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,350
First I'm going to play you
this guy to demonstrate.

152
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:24,450
He pulls out his a sound bemer.

153
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,340
It's like a mini satellite
dish, but kind of in a square

154
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,773
stand over there.

155
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,810
He and Kirk get on opposite sides of
the room very far apart and then what?

156
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:39,450
He shoots a concentrated beam of sound
in this case, the sound of rushing water,

157
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,470
right? It hurts head.
No. If I showed it at you

158
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,170
towards the night just aiming at my chest,

159
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,870
almost a hundred percent gone. [inaudible]

160
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,050
wow. Magic.

161
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,710
Does your invention allow us to take the
sound and put it into a beam such that

162
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,430
it will hit a spot on the
wall of Jericho? Absolutely.

163
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,880
With a caveat. The caveat.

164
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,170
There is no known loudspeaker on the
planet that can put out 170 decibels.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,833
Really,

166
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,220
my company makes some of the
loudest speakers on the planet.

167
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,350
They're known quite popularly around the
world as an El Rad long range acoustic

168
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:38,041
device.

169
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:43,041
They're sold to the military
police departments and the
loudest unit the company

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,760
sells, which can be over
$100,000 for one unit,

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
puts out about 155 decibels. That's not
enough to knock down our wall though.

172
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,660
No, not at all. There's another
issue. This'll be caveat number two.

173
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,390
When you get about 150 565 decibels,

174
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,430
you get close to causing cavitation
in the air where the air turns into a

175
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,024
plasma.

176
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,340
What do you mean with sound won't
travel through the air only for a few

177
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,780
millimeters. We weren't able to, 1000%
confirmed this, but according to woody,

178
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,270
even if we were able to make
the necessary amount of noise,

179
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:27,250
we would not be able to get that
noise to the wall. The sound just go

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,380
mayor.

181
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,210
We are just, I, there's a,

182
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,940
there's a Anglo Saxon where
they would go right there,

183
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,290
but we're talking about the Hebrews.

184
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,580
But we are that thing and I
don't know what to do. Well,

185
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:47,260
I had an alternate theory that
could make Fi's story plausible.

186
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,010
Ah,

187
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,010
what I've imagined is that the attackers
would try to undermine wall by digging

188
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:56,150
underneath it and the uh,

189
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,260
defenders figuring that the
attackers would do that,

190
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,110
which sends spies out to find out where
the digging is so they can use counter

191
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:08,970
measures such as boiling oil.
Right. But we then the wait, no,

192
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,860
wait, wait, wait, let him finish
this. I'm enjoying this. Okay.

193
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,770
But then the attackers would say,

194
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,500
they'll probably send out spies
to find out where we're digging.

195
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,570
So let's issue orders, uh,

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,340
that nobody is to know where we are
digging and we won't tell those blabber

197
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:28,000
mouth Israelites because it's sure
to be picked up by one of the spies.

198
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,870
And next thing you know, we'll have
warning oral on our head. In the meantime,

199
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,050
the diggers, in order to keep
the wall from falling in on them,

200
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:39,670
they would prop it up with timbers. Then
when the digging was about complete,

201
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,380
they would pull out the whatever was
the equivalent of a Zippo lighter in the

202
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:49,381
bronze age and a light the timbers and
then run like heck as the fire burns

203
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,290
through,

204
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,290
eventually that part of the wall would
fall straight down and the weight is the

205
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:58,510
Hornblower cut into the equation.
Oh, well in the meantime,

206
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,420
the spies report back. We can't
figure out where those Israelites,

207
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,490
they're digging. So, uh, the king
of Jericho probably says, well,

208
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,670
we'll have to use the old hole
in the shield trick to find out.

209
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,320
And so they take their bronze age shields
with a hole in the middle and they

210
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:15,250
placed him on the ground.

211
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,350
Tackers say the defenders will probably
use the old hole in the shield trick.

212
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,790
We know that. So we'll have to use
acoustic warfare, make noise to, uh,

213
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,090
prevent them from being able
to hear where the digging is.

214
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,070
So let's send out a bunch of priests
with shofars and to make noise.

215
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,630
And so as I there to keep
the shield listening,

216
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Jericho ins from overhearing the digging
Hebrews and the fluids are just the way

217
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,030
to mask the digging Hebrews is located.

218
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,700
Boom. Rod. Hi Robert. Krulwich. Bye.
