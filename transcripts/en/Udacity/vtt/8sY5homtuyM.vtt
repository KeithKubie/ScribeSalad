00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.719
All the cells in your body are filled with proteins performing

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.480
all kinds of functions that make up the basis for your traits.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, but where does the protein originally come from?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.270
&gt;&gt; Right, so we've finally come to the, the whole point of this,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.310
right? It comes from the genetic instructions

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.500
inside the cells of your body inside

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.410
the nucleus. You have two copies of your genome, one from mom and one

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.950
from dad, six billion letters of information

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.570
It sounds like a lot of information.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.060
How does it get turned into something else though?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.160
&gt;&gt; Well this is when it's time for us to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
think about our genome book again, not like just a book,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.740
but a book of recipes. You've got lots of recipes to

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.600
make up who you are. We don't need all of them

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.280
right now, we just want to focus on blood type. So I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.240
may have the blood type recipe for type A and you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.060
have the blood type recipe for type B. Maybe a better

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.610
way of doing this is to actually go ahead and you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.380
know, get a, get a real recipe out here.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.570
&gt;&gt; We'll, we'll be pretty udacious about this and I want to give you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.610
this example of a recipe that Lauren,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.610
this was a, a recipe from your grandmother.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.130
&gt;&gt; Let's start simple with the recipe we

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.450
see here. What food is this most likely going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480
to make? Now, I'm going to read out the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.580
recipe really quick. Our measurements are very American centric.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.150
So we're not using the scientific metric system

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.850
here. But we're going to take our first 6 ingredients,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.650
and mix them well. A cup of butter, 4 eggs, a cup of milk. 2 cups of

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.270
sugar, 2 and half cups of flour. A

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.400
teaspoon of baking powder. And we're going to mix it

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.420
all together. And as one of our later

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.345
ingredients, we're going to have 1 tube of blue icing.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:33.110
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.720
We'll pour this into a pan and bake at 375

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.360
degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes, then we'll remove it from

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.800
the pan, cool, and then we can add our icing.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.080
So tell me, what food is this likely a recipe for?
