some would not but there are also a lot
 

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.200
some would not but there are also a lot
of other pieces of information or I

of other pieces of information or I
 

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.230
of other pieces of information or I
think of them as data on this page that

different for many different reasons and
 

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.280
different for many different reasons and
one of them is that the library of

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:53.290
one of them is that the library of
 

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.660
one of them is that the library of
congress is limited to how they can

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:56.670
congress is limited to how they can
 

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.560
congress is limited to how they can
organize the data they can't do it

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.570

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.180
organize the data they can't do it
spatially they can't recreate these

put up online is essentially useless to
most people who go to the website

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.030
most people who go to the website
 

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.660
most people who go to the website
because they don't know what it means so

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:12.670
because they don't know what it means so
 

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.730
because they don't know what it means so
i think if you go to the next slide so

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:14.740
i think if you go to the next slide so
 

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.920
i think if you go to the next slide so
so this is an image on that Vanderbilt

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:16.930
so this is an image on that Vanderbilt
 

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.520
so this is an image on that Vanderbilt
took in Chicago in 1941 it's you know

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:20.530
took in Chicago in 1941 it's you know
 

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.040
took in Chicago in 1941 it's you know
it's this man that he that he saw on the

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.050
it's this man that he that he saw on the
 

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.620
it's this man that he that he saw on the
street and so we were at the library of

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.630
street and so we were at the library of
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.910
street and so we were at the library of
congress two weeks ago and we actually

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:26.920
congress two weeks ago and we actually
 

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.460
congress two weeks ago and we actually
went and saw this this image on them so

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.470
went and saw this this image on them so
 

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.480
went and saw this this image on them so
you can see that there's a lot of

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:30.490
you can see that there's a lot of
 

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.520
you can see that there's a lot of
information about this about this

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:32.530
information about this about this

photograph and and I'm going to sort of
 

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.240
photograph and and I'm going to sort of
go through what that information is and

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.250
go through what that information is and
 

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.580
go through what that information is and
then how we can redisplay that in a way

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:38.590
then how we can redisplay that in a way
 

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.200
then how we can redisplay that in a way
that's useful to people rather than just

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.210
that's useful to people rather than just

a number that doesn't mean anything so
 

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.520
a number that doesn't mean anything so
you see this number here called so it

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:44.530
you see this number here called so it
 

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.450
you see this number here called so it
says other number F 323 does that mean

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:48.460
says other number F 323 does that mean

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.960
any want anything to anyone after three
to three now it's it's fairly useless um

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:53.970
to three now it's it's fairly useless um
 

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.880
to three now it's it's fairly useless um
because because you don't actually know

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:56.890
because because you don't actually know
 

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.680
because because you don't actually know
what that number means and the only way

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:58.690
what that number means and the only way
 

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.970
what that number means and the only way
to know what that means is to either go

00:23:59.970 --> 00:23:59.980
to know what that means is to either go
 

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.480
to know what that means is to either go
to the live

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:00.490
to the live
 

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.280
to the live
Congress and I think if you go to the

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.290
Congress and I think if you go to the
 

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.600
Congress and I think if you go to the
next slide and that number tells me

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:06.610
next slide and that number tells me
 

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.840
next slide and that number tells me
where that where that print is in the

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:09.850
where that where that print is in the
 

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.280
where that where that print is in the
library of congress so i can go to the

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.290
library of congress so i can go to the
 

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.630
library of congress so i can go to the
drawer f and look at 323 and that stands

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640
drawer f and look at 323 and that stands
 

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.960
drawer f and look at 323 and that stands
for individual men middle-aged in the

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:18.970
for individual men middle-aged in the
 

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.530
for individual men middle-aged in the
midwest and it's different than in group

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:22.540
midwest and it's different than in group
 

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.350
midwest and it's different than in group
men middle-aged or individual men old

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360
men middle-aged or individual men old
 

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.930
men middle-aged or individual men old
age and I don't know where the cutoff is

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:27.940
age and I don't know where the cutoff is
 

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.000
age and I don't know where the cutoff is
I know some people would really like to

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.010
I know some people would really like to
 

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.680
I know some people would really like to
argue when you become older when you're

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:31.690
argue when you become older when you're
 

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.440
argue when you become older when you're
middle-aged but Vanderbilt when he made

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:34.450
middle-aged but Vanderbilt when he made
 

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.150
middle-aged but Vanderbilt when he made
this he made some distinction and this

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:36.160
this he made some distinction and this
 

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.790
this he made some distinction and this
guy is a strictly middle-aged and so

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:38.800
guy is a strictly middle-aged and so
 

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.130
guy is a strictly middle-aged and so
that number tells me not only where I

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:41.140
that number tells me not only where I
 

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.200
that number tells me not only where I
can find it but also what it was

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.210
can find it but also what it was
 

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.970
can find it but also what it was
categorized by the original system and

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:44.980
categorized by the original system and
 

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.230
categorized by the original system and
to a lot of scholars it's really

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240
to a lot of scholars it's really
 

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.820
to a lot of scholars it's really
fascinating like why are their

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:47.830
fascinating like why are their
 

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.910
fascinating like why are their
individual men that are categorizes

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:50.920
individual men that are categorizes
 

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.280
individual men that are categorizes
differently as group men why are there

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:53.290
differently as group men why are there
 

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.919
differently as group men why are there
middle-aged young and old why are they

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:55.929
middle-aged young and old why are they
 

00:24:55.929 --> 00:24:59.250
middle-aged young and old why are they
are why is there a break out for what's

00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.260
are why is there a break out for what's
 

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.770
are why is there a break out for what's
a good example like railroad workers but

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:01.780
a good example like railroad workers but
 

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.960
a good example like railroad workers but
there's not a break out for grain

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:03.970
there's not a break out for grain
 

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.090
there's not a break out for grain
workers you know the the system is so

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:06.100
workers you know the the system is so
 

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.650
workers you know the the system is so
strange and arbitrary it's actually

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:07.660
strange and arbitrary it's actually
 

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.660
strange and arbitrary it's actually
really fascinating um but you don't get

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:09.670
really fascinating um but you don't get
 

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.780
really fascinating um but you don't get
that from the website i can now match it

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:12.790
that from the website i can now match it
 

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.090
that from the website i can now match it
up and show it to people and on the new

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.100
up and show it to people and on the new
 

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.470
up and show it to people and on the new
website you'll be able to actually look

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480
website you'll be able to actually look
 

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.970
website you'll be able to actually look
at it that way but in the current

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:17.980
at it that way but in the current
 

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.710
at it that way but in the current
manifestation the data is there but it's

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720
manifestation the data is there but it's
 

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.500
manifestation the data is there but it's
not presented in a form that most people

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:22.510
not presented in a form that most people
 

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.150
not presented in a form that most people
can use and so there's actually there's

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.160
can use and so there's actually there's
 

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.520
can use and so there's actually there's
more information on the there on the

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:26.530
more information on the there on the
 

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.450
more information on the there on the
number here there's this something

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:27.460
number here there's this something
 

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.080
number here there's this something
called lot 1 073 that probably doesn't

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.090
called lot 1 073 that probably doesn't
 

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.510
called lot 1 073 that probably doesn't
mean anything to anyone else but what it

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520
mean anything to anyone else but what it
 

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.190
mean anything to anyone else but what it
means is that in that drawer do you have

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200
means is that in that drawer do you have
 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.860
means is that in that drawer do you have
a picture of the doors at the next no

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:37.870
a picture of the doors at the next no
 

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.830
a picture of the doors at the next no
okay um so we showed you that drawer

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840
okay um so we showed you that drawer
 

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.540
okay um so we showed you that drawer
that had all of these little micro film

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:42.550
that had all of these little micro film
 

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.860
that had all of these little micro film
things and that actually tells me what

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:43.870
things and that actually tells me what
 

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.520
things and that actually tells me what
microfilm this lot what this photograph

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:47.530
microfilm this lot what this photograph
 

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.230
microfilm this lot what this photograph
is in so you can put the microfilm in

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240
is in so you can put the microfilm in
 

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.930
is in so you can put the microfilm in
and go through and we unfortunately

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:51.940
and go through and we unfortunately
 

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.150
and go through and we unfortunately
chose an extremely long lot so we had to

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:54.160
chose an extremely long lot so we had to
 

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.890
chose an extremely long lot so we had to
sit there for 20 minutes looking for it

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:55.900
sit there for 20 minutes looking for it
 

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.169
sit there for 20 minutes looking for it
but it was in this lot of pictures from

00:25:58.169 --> 00:25:58.179
but it was in this lot of pictures from
 

00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:00.930
but it was in this lot of pictures from
chicago and again you know you wouldn't

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:00.940
chicago and again you know you wouldn't
 

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.760
chicago and again you know you wouldn't
really know what this number means or be

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:02.770
really know what this number means or be
 

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.620
really know what this number means or be
able to you can't search by lots on the

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:04.630
able to you can't search by lots on the
 

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.560
able to you can't search by lots on the
Library of Congress either but what this

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:07.570
Library of Congress either but what this
 

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.030
Library of Congress either but what this
lot is is it's all of the photographs

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.040
lot is is it's all of the photographs
 

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.030
lot is is it's all of the photographs
that VaShawn took in Chicago but

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:12.040
that VaShawn took in Chicago but
 

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.530
that VaShawn took in Chicago but
interestingly enough he went there twice

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:13.540
interestingly enough he went there twice
 

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.250
interestingly enough he went there twice
he went

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:14.260
he went
 

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.630
he went
the summer of forty-one in the summer of

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640
the summer of forty-one in the summer of
 

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.370
the summer of forty-one in the summer of
40 well he may have done other times but

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:17.380
40 well he may have done other times but
 

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.630
40 well he may have done other times but
I know he went those two times and

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640
I know he went those two times and
 

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.090
I know he went those two times and
they're all strung together just like at

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.100
they're all strung together just like at
 

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.680
they're all strung together just like at
random and so it's really fascinating to

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:22.690
random and so it's really fascinating to
 

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.360
random and so it's really fascinating to
me that Vanderbilt thought it was

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:24.370
me that Vanderbilt thought it was
 

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.090
me that Vanderbilt thought it was
interesting to put vashon Chicago photos

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:27.100
interesting to put vashon Chicago photos
 

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.770
interesting to put vashon Chicago photos
together but he didn't think of the

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:28.780
together but he didn't think of the
 

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.600
together but he didn't think of the
photographs as as a trip he didn't think

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.610
photographs as as a trip he didn't think
 

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.070
photographs as as a trip he didn't think
of it as maybe through the eyes of the

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080
of it as maybe through the eyes of the
 

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.570
of it as maybe through the eyes of the
photographer they're not in any order

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:33.580
photographer they're not in any order
 

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.030
photographer they're not in any order
there are two pictures of the same guy

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.040
there are two pictures of the same guy
 

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.680
there are two pictures of the same guy
basically on the strain street corner

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:37.690
basically on the strain street corner
 

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.940
basically on the strain street corner
that are on totally different ends of

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:38.950
that are on totally different ends of
 

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.710
that are on totally different ends of
the lot so it's just really interesting

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720
the lot so it's just really interesting
 

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.780
the lot so it's just really interesting
when you start to decode all of the

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:42.790
when you start to decode all of the
 

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.460
when you start to decode all of the
information that's on here and then be

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:44.470
information that's on here and then be
 

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.530
information that's on here and then be
able to redisplay it to someone

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:46.540
able to redisplay it to someone
 

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.060
able to redisplay it to someone
instantly on their computer so you don't

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.070
instantly on their computer so you don't
 

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.620
instantly on their computer so you don't
have to go in to the library of congress

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:49.630
have to go in to the library of congress
 

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.720
have to go in to the library of congress
and put in the microfilm and actually

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:51.730
and put in the microfilm and actually
 

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.000
and put in the microfilm and actually
figure out where this thing is so this

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.010
figure out where this thing is so this
 

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.560
figure out where this thing is so this
is the sort of information that we're

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:55.570
is the sort of information that we're
 

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.350
is the sort of information that we're
able to pull off of this thing here so

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360
able to pull off of this thing here so
 

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.470
able to pull off of this thing here so
the other number the the catalog number

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480
the other number the the catalog number
 

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.740
the other number the the catalog number
where the print is in the file the file

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:04.750
where the print is in the file the file
 

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.610
where the print is in the file the file
the file drawer classification system

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:08.620
the file drawer classification system
 

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.180
the file drawer classification system
and then the lot number and so those are

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:12.190
and then the lot number and so those are
 

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.400
and then the lot number and so those are
very interesting and then the the number

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:14.410
very interesting and then the the number
 

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.870
very interesting and then the the number
that is actually even more fascinating

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880
that is actually even more fascinating
 

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.880
that is actually even more fascinating
the one that ken was alluding to that he

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:17.890
the one that ken was alluding to that he
 

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.100
the one that ken was alluding to that he
thinks is very cool is this you can see

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.110
thinks is very cool is this you can see
 

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.690
thinks is very cool is this you can see
there's a library of congress number so

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.700
there's a library of congress number so
 

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.500
there's a library of congress number so
i don't know if i can read it it's to

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:25.510
i don't know if i can read it it's to
 

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.420
i don't know if i can read it it's to
have it here well it's a long string of

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:27.430
have it here well it's a long string of
 

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.550
have it here well it's a long string of
numbers that tells that is how the lover

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:29.560
numbers that tells that is how the lover
 

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.060
numbers that tells that is how the lover
of congress um de marks there there's

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.070
of congress um de marks there there's
 

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.380
of congress um de marks there there's
their negatives so it's 0 1 6 165

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:37.390
their negatives so it's 0 1 6 165
 

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.300
their negatives so it's 0 1 6 165
something like that and then there's a

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:39.310
something like that and then there's a
 

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.970
something like that and then there's a
dash m4 and so I thought that was just a

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:41.980
dash m4 and so I thought that was just a
 

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.130
dash m4 and so I thought that was just a
useless number again my whole talk is

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.140
useless number again my whole talk is
 

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.300
useless number again my whole talk is
about use those numbers that aren't

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:45.310
about use those numbers that aren't
 

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.540
about use those numbers that aren't
useless and so m4 is really interesting

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:48.550
useless and so m4 is really interesting
 

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.010
useless and so m4 is really interesting
because what that's what that means is

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.020
because what that's what that means is
 

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.600
because what that's what that means is
that somewhere in the back where they

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:51.610
that somewhere in the back where they
 

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.450
that somewhere in the back where they
have the actual so almost a lot of the

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:54.460
have the actual so almost a lot of the
 

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.000
have the actual so almost a lot of the
film was done on 35 millimeter rolls of

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.010
film was done on 35 millimeter rolls of
 

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.940
film was done on 35 millimeter rolls of
film and then cut up into five or six

00:27:59.940 --> 00:27:59.950
film and then cut up into five or six
 

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.430
film and then cut up into five or six
frames and put in the back and I guess

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440
frames and put in the back and I guess
 

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.810
frames and put in the back and I guess
that was the easiest way to sort of

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:03.820
that was the easiest way to sort of
 

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.700
that was the easiest way to sort of
develop them is on these strips of five

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:05.710
develop them is on these strips of five
 

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.320
develop them is on these strips of five
or six film I don't know anything about

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.330
or six film I don't know anything about
 

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:16.539
or six film I don't know anything about
film so so I've just been told this um

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:16.549
 
 

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:24.289
 
yes um um so anyway so but what the m4

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299
yes um um so anyway so but what the m4
 

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:26.450
yes um um so anyway so but what the m4
means is that actually it tells me that

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460
means is that actually it tells me that
 

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.729
means is that actually it tells me that
it's the fourth frame on one of these

00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:28.739
it's the fourth frame on one of these
 

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:32.599
it's the fourth frame on one of these
strips of film and if I look at a holdup

00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:32.609
strips of film and if I look at a holdup
 

00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:34.399
strips of film and if I look at a holdup
and if I look at the the same number

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:34.409
and if I look at the the same number
 

00:28:34.409 --> 00:28:36.379
and if I look at the the same number
dash and 3 i'll get the one that was

00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:36.389
dash and 3 i'll get the one that was
 

00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:38.509
dash and 3 i'll get the one that was
taken right before that and so it's very

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519
taken right before that and so it's very
 

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:39.950
taken right before that and so it's very
interesting that i can put back these

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960
interesting that i can put back these
 

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.310
interesting that i can put back these
photos back together in and the the data

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320
photos back together in and the the data
 

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.769
photos back together in and the the data
is all there it's just not in any in any

00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779
is all there it's just not in any in any
 

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:47.419
is all there it's just not in any in any
way that anyone going to the website

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:47.429
way that anyone going to the website
 

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:49.909
way that anyone going to the website
would know to do this and so here we

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919
would know to do this and so here we
 

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:53.089
would know to do this and so here we
actually have each row is something i

00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:53.099
actually have each row is something i
 

00:28:53.099 --> 00:28:54.469
actually have each row is something i
was able to put back together using

00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:54.479
was able to put back together using
 

00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:56.899
was able to put back together using
these m numbers so it's m 1 m 2 and 3 m

00:28:56.899 --> 00:28:56.909
these m numbers so it's m 1 m 2 and 3 m
 

00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:59.210
these m numbers so it's m 1 m 2 and 3 m
1 m 2 and 3 and 4 and so those are the

00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220
1 m 2 and 3 and 4 and so those are the
 

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.129
1 m 2 and 3 and 4 and so those are the
strips that I know we're taken in this

00:29:01.129 --> 00:29:01.139
strips that I know we're taken in this
 

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.950
strips that I know we're taken in this
order and then you can actually see that

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960
order and then you can actually see that
 

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960
order and then you can actually see that
we put them in we've been able to once

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:05.970
we put them in we've been able to once
 

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.599
we put them in we've been able to once
they're in a strip I can actually see if

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:08.609
they're in a strip I can actually see if
 

00:29:08.609 --> 00:29:10.580
they're in a strip I can actually see if
it will stop moving that all three of

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:10.590
it will stop moving that all three of
 

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.019
it will stop moving that all three of
the ones at the top I know that they're

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:12.029
the ones at the top I know that they're
 

00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:14.119
the ones at the top I know that they're
in Wisconsin in Kenosha Wisconsin and

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:14.129
in Wisconsin in Kenosha Wisconsin and
 

00:29:14.129 --> 00:29:15.830
in Wisconsin in Kenosha Wisconsin and
they were taken by that Sean in the same

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840
they were taken by that Sean in the same
 

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.589
they were taken by that Sean in the same
month and so we were able to put them

00:29:18.589 --> 00:29:18.599
month and so we were able to put them
 

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:20.509
month and so we were able to put them
back together almost in the way that

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519
back together almost in the way that
 

00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:21.979
back together almost in the way that
they would be on a roll which is very

00:29:21.979 --> 00:29:21.989
they would be on a roll which is very
 

00:29:21.989 --> 00:29:23.299
they would be on a roll which is very
cool because we can start to actually

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:23.309
cool because we can start to actually
 

00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:25.339
cool because we can start to actually
construct his whole trip again instead

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:25.349
construct his whole trip again instead
 

00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:27.409
construct his whole trip again instead
of these random photos that that aren't

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419
of these random photos that that aren't
 

00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:31.279
of these random photos that that aren't
near anything and well and the other

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:31.289
near anything and well and the other
 

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:32.839
near anything and well and the other
thing is that some of these photos I

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:32.849
thing is that some of these photos I
 

00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:34.609
thing is that some of these photos I
don't remember exactly which ones but

00:29:34.609 --> 00:29:34.619
don't remember exactly which ones but
 

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:36.739
don't remember exactly which ones but
for instance the middle row you can see

00:29:36.739 --> 00:29:36.749
for instance the middle row you can see
 

00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:38.119
for instance the middle row you can see
there's a cheese market all the way on

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:38.129
there's a cheese market all the way on
 

00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:40.339
there's a cheese market all the way on
the left and there's no information if

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:40.349
the left and there's no information if
 

00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:41.749
the left and there's no information if
you go to the website the Library of

you go to the website the Library of
 

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:43.399
you go to the website the Library of
Congress there's no information about

Congress there's no information about
 

00:29:43.409 --> 00:29:44.930
Congress there's no information about
this photograph it just says it's part

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940
this photograph it just says it's part
 

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.149
this photograph it just says it's part
of the FSA owi don't know who took it

00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159
of the FSA owi don't know who took it
 

00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:49.399
of the FSA owi don't know who took it
don't know when don't aware but the the

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:49.409
don't know when don't aware but the the
 

00:29:49.409 --> 00:29:51.710
don't know when don't aware but the the
rest of the roll it's a or some of the

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:56.149
other ones on the roll it says it's
vashon in 41 in Kenosha and so unless

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159
vashon in 41 in Kenosha and so unless
 

00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:58.879
vashon in 41 in Kenosha and so unless
you know you know Miriam post Wolcott

00:29:58.879 --> 00:29:58.889
you know you know Miriam post Wolcott
 

00:29:58.889 --> 00:30:01.849
you know you know Miriam post Wolcott
stole that Sean's camera and you know

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:01.859
stole that Sean's camera and you know
 

00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:03.919
stole that Sean's camera and you know
used his film this is probably vashon

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:03.929
used his film this is probably vashon
 

00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:05.419
used his film this is probably vashon
right before they're in it's a cheese

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:05.429
right before they're in it's a cheese
 

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:07.009
right before they're in it's a cheese
shop so I'm actually pretty certain of

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:07.019
shop so I'm actually pretty certain of
 

00:30:07.019 --> 00:30:08.930
shop so I'm actually pretty certain of
this and so we can begin to fill in a

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940
this and so we can begin to fill in a
 

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.089
this and so we can begin to fill in a
lot of the data that's missing on that's

00:30:11.089 --> 00:30:11.099
lot of the data that's missing on that's
 

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:13.009
lot of the data that's missing on that's
really fascinating and and on the fourth

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:13.019
really fascinating and and on the fourth
 

00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.560
really fascinating and and on the fourth
the fourth row here what's even more

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.570
the fourth row here what's even more
 

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.359
the fourth row here what's even more
interesting is that you can see that we

00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:17.369
interesting is that you can see that we
 

00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:19.849
interesting is that you can see that we
we have these cheese shops so this is

00:30:19.849 --> 00:30:19.859
we have these cheese shops so this is
 

00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:22.310
we have these cheese shops so this is
him still in Wisconsin but then at the

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320
him still in Wisconsin but then at the
 

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.399
him still in Wisconsin but then at the
end of the row the there's a guy sitting

00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:25.409
end of the row the there's a guy sitting
 

00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:26.240
end of the row the there's a guy sitting
on the street

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.250
on the street
 

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.040
on the street
one of them is has no information but

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.050
one of them is has no information but
 

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.540
one of them is has no information but
the other one it says it's Beth Shawn in

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:29.550
the other one it says it's Beth Shawn in
 

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.550
the other one it says it's Beth Shawn in
Chicago at 41 and so it's really

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:31.560
Chicago at 41 and so it's really
 

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.410
Chicago at 41 and so it's really
fascinating is that we know that this is

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:33.420
fascinating is that we know that this is
 

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.540
fascinating is that we know that this is
the first thing he took a photo of when

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:35.550
the first thing he took a photo of when
 

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.280
the first thing he took a photo of when
he was in Chicago because this was the

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.290
he was in Chicago because this was the
 

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.470
he was in Chicago because this was the
role that was left over on his way in

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480
role that was left over on his way in
 

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.380
role that was left over on his way in
from Wisconsin and so before you had a

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:42.390
from Wisconsin and so before you had a
 

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.510
from Wisconsin and so before you had a
lot and you had 100 photos he took him

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520
lot and you had 100 photos he took him
 

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.550
lot and you had 100 photos he took him
out no idea when he took them was this

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:46.560
out no idea when he took them was this
 

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.260
out no idea when he took them was this
the last thing he saw was as the first

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.270
the last thing he saw was as the first
 

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.940
the last thing he saw was as the first
thing and now we actually know like this

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:49.950
thing and now we actually know like this
 

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.980
thing and now we actually know like this
guy on the side of the street is the

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:51.990
guy on the side of the street is the
 

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.480
guy on the side of the street is the
very first thing he saw when he got

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:53.490
very first thing he saw when he got
 

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.460
very first thing he saw when he got
there and so another historian but I've

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:55.470
there and so another historian but I've
 

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.050
there and so another historian but I've
been told that this is interesting so so

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.060
been told that this is interesting so so
 

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:05.450
been told that this is interesting so so
yeah so so that's pretty cool and then

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460
yeah so so that's pretty cool and then
 

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.890
yeah so so that's pretty cool and then
we started to put these back together

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:06.900
we started to put these back together
 

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.170
we started to put these back together
and then and then when we can put the

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.180
and then and then when we can put the
 

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.900
and then and then when we can put the
put the actual strips back together so

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:11.910
put the actual strips back together so
 

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.600
put the actual strips back together so
we can go to the next slide so so so

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:14.610
we can go to the next slide so so so
 

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.220
we can go to the next slide so so so
sort of zooming out from one photo two

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:16.230
sort of zooming out from one photo two
 

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.160
sort of zooming out from one photo two
strips two rolls another thing that we

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.170
strips two rolls another thing that we
 

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.080
strips two rolls another thing that we
can do is once I have all of the data I

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.090
can do is once I have all of the data I
 

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.930
can do is once I have all of the data I
can i can map it and try to figure out

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940
can i can map it and try to figure out
 

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.660
can i can map it and try to figure out
visually and spatially over time where

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:26.670
visually and spatially over time where
 

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:30.110
visually and spatially over time where
all of these photographers work because

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120
all of these photographers work because
 

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.970
all of these photographers work because
i think is Lauren was alluding to a lot

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980
i think is Lauren was alluding to a lot
 

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.190
i think is Lauren was alluding to a lot
of people think of this is a archive of

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200
of people think of this is a archive of
 

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.080
of people think of this is a archive of
the rural South and there are a lot of

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.090
the rural South and there are a lot of
 

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.120
the rural South and there are a lot of
rural southern photos but they're

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.130
rural southern photos but they're
 

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.240
rural southern photos but they're
actually photos all over the country and

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.250
actually photos all over the country and
 

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.130
actually photos all over the country and
you know in cities in Chicago and in

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140
you know in cities in Chicago and in
 

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.040
you know in cities in Chicago and in
Maine in in the West and so I was able

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.050
Maine in in the West and so I was able
 

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.770
Maine in in the West and so I was able
to actually sort of highlight as the

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:48.780
to actually sort of highlight as the
 

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.260
to actually sort of highlight as the
years go by how the density of

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:51.270
years go by how the density of
 

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.880
years go by how the density of
photographs so you can see County sort

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:52.890
photographs so you can see County sort
 

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.850
photographs so you can see County sort
of light up as Lauren goes through here

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860
of light up as Lauren goes through here
 

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:01.040
of light up as Lauren goes through here
so you can just go to through 245 and so

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.050
so you can just go to through 245 and so
 

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.000
so you can just go to through 245 and so
you can start to see see you can see

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.010
you can start to see see you can see
 

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.940
you can start to see see you can see
that as we move into the war years they

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:07.950
that as we move into the war years they
 

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.680
that as we move into the war years they
that the archive becomes even less

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:09.690
that the archive becomes even less
 

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.810
that the archive becomes even less
southern and less rural and more about

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820
southern and less rural and more about
 

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.170
southern and less rural and more about
the industrial north and the West and

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:14.180
the industrial north and the West and
 

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.880
the industrial north and the West and
see my state of Maine lights out that's

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:16.890
see my state of Maine lights out that's
 

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.900
see my state of Maine lights out that's
kind of cool and you can see so this

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:20.910
kind of cool and you can see so this
 

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.160
kind of cool and you can see so this
maps very neat because you can actually

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.170
maps very neat because you can actually
 

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.050
maps very neat because you can actually
see I think we decided with Rothstein

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.060
see I think we decided with Rothstein
 

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.690
see I think we decided with Rothstein
right you can actually see I don't know

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700
right you can actually see I don't know
 

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.040
right you can actually see I don't know
if you can see this resolutions are well

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.050
if you can see this resolutions are well
 

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.140
if you can see this resolutions are well
but there's a streak of counties that go

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.150
but there's a streak of counties that go
 

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.840
but there's a streak of counties that go
across yeah exactly and those are

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:32.850
across yeah exactly and those are
 

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.030
across yeah exactly and those are
actually all of him taking this trip

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.040
actually all of him taking this trip
 

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.450
actually all of him taking this trip
across the west

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:36.460
across the west
 

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.550
across the west
and so we've been working with best Sean

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:38.560
and so we've been working with best Sean
 

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.960
and so we've been working with best Sean
but hopefully we can dig into that

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:39.970
but hopefully we can dig into that
 

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.700
but hopefully we can dig into that
archive to and put those strips back

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:41.710
archive to and put those strips back
 

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.620
archive to and put those strips back
together and actually get his whole trip

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:43.630
together and actually get his whole trip
 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.880
together and actually get his whole trip
and see like well what did you see at

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:44.890
and see like well what did you see at
 

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.080
and see like well what did you see at
the beginning what you see in the middle

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.090
the beginning what you see in the middle
 

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.790
the beginning what you see in the middle
would you see in the end and actually

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:47.800
would you see in the end and actually
 

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.760
would you see in the end and actually
gives some temporal peace to these

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:50.770
gives some temporal peace to these
 

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.990
gives some temporal peace to these
photographs that are always looked at

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000
photographs that are always looked at
 

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.180
photographs that are always looked at
sort of in all these different ways but

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.190
sort of in all these different ways but
 

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.590
sort of in all these different ways but
haven't been able to be looked at

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600
haven't been able to be looked at
 

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.370
haven't been able to be looked at
spatially and buy time so if you can go

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:02.380
spatially and buy time so if you can go
 

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.300
spatially and buy time so if you can go
to the next one so well yeah so I'll

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:06.310
to the next one so well yeah so I'll
 

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.350
to the next one so well yeah so I'll
show this first and then i'll show you

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360
show this first and then i'll show you
 

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.940
show this first and then i'll show you
sort of a prototype of the website

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:08.950
sort of a prototype of the website
 

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.740
sort of a prototype of the website
that's going to let you actually do all

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:10.750
that's going to let you actually do all
 

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.330
that's going to let you actually do all
of this stuff that i can do locally on

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:12.340
of this stuff that i can do locally on
 

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.940
of this stuff that i can do locally on
my computer you know at your own desks

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:14.950
my computer you know at your own desks
 

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.400
my computer you know at your own desks
or direct students to or classrooms to

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.410
or direct students to or classrooms to
 

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.810
or direct students to or classrooms to
so they can play around with the photos

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:18.820
so they can play around with the photos
 

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.850
so they can play around with the photos
and figure out you know just give me a

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:20.860
and figure out you know just give me a
 

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.850
and figure out you know just give me a
density map of where where Mary and post

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:23.860
density map of where where Mary and post
 

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.850
density map of where where Mary and post
wawa was in July of 43 and you can light

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:26.860
wawa was in July of 43 and you can light
 

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.440
wawa was in July of 43 and you can light
up those counties and click on the

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:28.450
up those counties and click on the
 

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.320
up those counties and click on the
counties and see where she was so the

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:31.330
counties and see where she was so the
 

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.930
counties and see where she was so the
last thing is we're trying to like dive

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:33.940
last thing is we're trying to like dive
 

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.580
last thing is we're trying to like dive
in and get as much information out of

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:35.590
in and get as much information out of
 

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.060
in and get as much information out of
this as we can so this is that Sean and

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:39.070
this as we can so this is that Sean and
 

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.430
this as we can so this is that Sean and
41 so I don't have the exact days but

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440
41 so I don't have the exact days but
 

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.590
41 so I don't have the exact days but
it's a summer of forty-one and so

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600
it's a summer of forty-one and so
 

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.270
it's a summer of forty-one and so
there's a dot on the map of everywhere

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:48.280
there's a dot on the map of everywhere
 

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.310
there's a dot on the map of everywhere
that we know he was because as I said he

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320
that we know he was because as I said he

labeled some photographs where he was
but not very not very consistently and

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:55.660
but not very not very consistently and
 

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.330
but not very not very consistently and
and the dates are sort of well it's a

and the dates are sort of well it's a
 

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.980
and the dates are sort of well it's a
month in a year and it's not like I was

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:58.990
month in a year and it's not like I was
 

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.760
month in a year and it's not like I was
here on at tea-time on the 14th so you

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:02.770
here on at tea-time on the 14th so you
 

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.140
here on at tea-time on the 14th so you
don't know exactly when he was somewhere

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:04.150
don't know exactly when he was somewhere
 

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.730
don't know exactly when he was somewhere
but this these are all of the places you

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:05.740
but this these are all of the places you
 

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.740
but this these are all of the places you
was on that summer he started in DC and

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:07.750
was on that summer he started in DC and
 

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.170
was on that summer he started in DC and
then ended up back in TC and so we

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:10.180
then ended up back in TC and so we
 

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.710
then ended up back in TC and so we
started going into this set of images

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720
started going into this set of images
 

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.750
started going into this set of images
and tried to try to reconstruct it when

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760
and tried to try to reconstruct it when
 

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.220
and tried to try to reconstruct it when
we'd eventually like to do this with all

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:17.230
we'd eventually like to do this with all
 

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.510
we'd eventually like to do this with all
of them but this is sort of our side

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520
of them but this is sort of our side
 

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.210
of them but this is sort of our side
project at the moment so if you click to

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:21.220
project at the moment so if you click to
 

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.780
project at the moment so if you click to
the next slide so the first thing is I

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:24.790
the next slide so the first thing is I
 

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.210
the next slide so the first thing is I
really just needed a baseline to figure

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.220
really just needed a baseline to figure
 

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.030
really just needed a baseline to figure
out exactly we're a baseline to say well

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040
out exactly we're a baseline to say well
 

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.530
out exactly we're a baseline to say well
let's just give it some ordering and

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:31.540
let's just give it some ordering and
 

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.850
let's just give it some ordering and
then I can tweak it and so there's this

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:32.860
then I can tweak it and so there's this
 

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.400
then I can tweak it and so there's this
problem in computer science called the

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:35.410
problem in computer science called the
 

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:37.710
problem in computer science called the
Traveling Salesman problem so it's you

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720
Traveling Salesman problem so it's you
 

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.630
Traveling Salesman problem so it's you
have a bunch of cities and you need to

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:39.640
have a bunch of cities and you need to
 

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.820
have a bunch of cities and you need to
visit them all and what's the shortest

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:41.830
visit them all and what's the shortest
 

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.680
visit them all and what's the shortest
distance on that you can do that in

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:43.690
distance on that you can do that in
 

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.870
distance on that you can do that in
because given new information I'm just

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:45.880
because given new information I'm just
 

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.130
because given new information I'm just
going to assume that he went to the

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.140
going to assume that he went to the
 

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.050
going to assume that he went to the
cities in the best order possible and if

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:49.060
cities in the best order possible and if
 

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.409
cities in the best order possible and if
you think

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:49.419
you think
 

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:51.419
you think
roston going across the country he

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:51.429
roston going across the country he
 

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.710
roston going across the country he
probably didn't like jump back and forth

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720
probably didn't like jump back and forth
 

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.720
probably didn't like jump back and forth
you probably took a smooth path across

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:54.730
you probably took a smooth path across
 

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.150
you probably took a smooth path across
the country and so this is actually sort

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160
the country and so this is actually sort
 

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.799
the country and so this is actually sort
of a really interesting computational

00:34:58.799 --> 00:34:58.809
of a really interesting computational
 

00:34:58.809 --> 00:35:01.410
of a really interesting computational
problem because there are more paths

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:01.420
problem because there are more paths
 

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.870
problem because there are more paths
between these 20 cities then there are

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880
between these 20 cities then there are
 

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.809
between these 20 cities then there are
second since the Big Bang so it's just

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:06.819
second since the Big Bang so it's just
 

00:35:06.819 --> 00:35:08.220
second since the Big Bang so it's just
huge it's like a hundred million

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:08.230
huge it's like a hundred million
 

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.950
huge it's like a hundred million
trillion has and so there's some real

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960
trillion has and so there's some real
 

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.720
trillion has and so there's some real
computational work that needs to be done

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:12.730
computational work that needs to be done
 

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.020
computational work that needs to be done
to calculate this so our problem is is a

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.030
to calculate this so our problem is is a
 

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.789
to calculate this so our problem is is a
little different it's just that we know

00:35:17.789 --> 00:35:17.799
little different it's just that we know
 

00:35:17.799 --> 00:35:20.309
little different it's just that we know
a starting point in an ending point and

00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:20.319
a starting point in an ending point and
 

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:21.480
a starting point in an ending point and
I need to figure out how to go in

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:21.490
I need to figure out how to go in
 

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.220
I need to figure out how to go in
between them so I had to I had to do

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:23.230
between them so I had to I had to do
 

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.900
between them so I had to I had to do
some computational stuff under the hood

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:24.910
some computational stuff under the hood
 

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.049
some computational stuff under the hood
to get this variant of the problem so if

00:35:28.049 --> 00:35:28.059
to get this variant of the problem so if
 

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:31.200
to get this variant of the problem so if
you go to the next slide but then as

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.210
you go to the next slide but then as
 

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.670
you go to the next slide but then as
you're all sort of thinking or

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680
you're all sort of thinking or
 

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.230
you're all sort of thinking or
whispering well that's not going to be

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240
whispering well that's not going to be
 

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.480
whispering well that's not going to be
exactly how people travel they sort of

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:36.490
exactly how people travel they sort of
 

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.069
exactly how people travel they sort of
there they're going and we were reading

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079
there they're going and we were reading
 

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.799
there they're going and we were reading
bastions letters and he laments to his

00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:40.809
bastions letters and he laments to his
 

00:35:40.809 --> 00:35:44.400
bastions letters and he laments to his
wife my god I can't find any cows you

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.410
wife my god I can't find any cows you
 

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:45.599
wife my god I can't find any cows you
know they want me to take pictures of

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:45.609
know they want me to take pictures of
 

00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:48.210
know they want me to take pictures of
cows and I can't find any cows and so he

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:48.220
cows and I can't find any cows and so he
 

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.190
cows and I can't find any cows and so he
probably wasn't taking the most direct

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200
probably wasn't taking the most direct
 

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.799
probably wasn't taking the most direct
route to find these cows he's probably

00:35:52.799 --> 00:35:52.809
route to find these cows he's probably
 

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:55.530
route to find these cows he's probably
driving around in circles and so we we

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:55.540
driving around in circles and so we we
 

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.079
driving around in circles and so we we
tried to the best of our ability to fill

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:58.089
tried to the best of our ability to fill
 

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:00.120
tried to the best of our ability to fill
in the blanks when we could and so here

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.130
in the blanks when we could and so here
 

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.589
in the blanks when we could and so here
you have the very beginning of his trip

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599
you have the very beginning of his trip
 

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.359
you have the very beginning of his trip
and I know that these were all all at

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:03.369
and I know that these were all all at
 

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:04.740
and I know that these were all all at
the beginning because they were all in

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:04.750
the beginning because they were all in
 

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.170
the beginning because they were all in
June or what I knew that they were all

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:07.180
June or what I knew that they were all
 

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.780
June or what I knew that they were all
in the same month so he's in like Erie

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:09.790
in the same month so he's in like Erie
 

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.599
in the same month so he's in like Erie
Pennsylvania and then Pittsburgh and

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:12.609
Pennsylvania and then Pittsburgh and
 

00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:14.250
Pennsylvania and then Pittsburgh and
then Columbus and then somewhere else in

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.260
then Columbus and then somewhere else in
 

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.410
then Columbus and then somewhere else in
Ohio but then once we started looking at

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:16.420
Ohio but then once we started looking at
 

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.700
Ohio but then once we started looking at
his letters so if you go to the next

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:17.710
his letters so if you go to the next
 

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.520
his letters so if you go to the next
slide I actually know because I we have

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:20.530
slide I actually know because I we have
 

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.099
slide I actually know because I we have
the postmark date of his letters so we

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:23.109
the postmark date of his letters so we
 

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:27.359
the postmark date of his letters so we
just couldn't that say that he was in

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:27.369
just couldn't that say that he was in
 

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:31.260
just couldn't that say that he was in
Pittsburgh in on jun 13 and then here on

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:31.270
Pittsburgh in on jun 13 and then here on
 

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.430
Pittsburgh in on jun 13 and then here on
the next slide so these are his

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440
the next slide so these are his
 

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.589
the next slide so these are his
transcripts of his letters that on june

00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599
transcripts of his letters that on june
 

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:35.970
transcripts of his letters that on june
seventeenth he was in erie pennsylvania

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:35.980
seventeenth he was in erie pennsylvania
 

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.579
seventeenth he was in erie pennsylvania
so he didn't actually take this shortest

00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:38.589
so he didn't actually take this shortest
 

00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:40.260
so he didn't actually take this shortest
route he went from pittsburgh up to erie

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:40.270
route he went from pittsburgh up to erie
 

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.510
route he went from pittsburgh up to erie
and then over to ohio and so we start

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520
and then over to ohio and so we start
 

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.299
and then over to ohio and so we start
editing our map a little bit and we can

00:36:45.299 --> 00:36:45.309
editing our map a little bit and we can
 

00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:49.230
editing our map a little bit and we can
keep doing this um so as I said we can

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240
keep doing this um so as I said we can
 

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.059
keep doing this um so as I said we can
also use where these frames fit together

00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:51.069
also use where these frames fit together
 

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:53.309
also use where these frames fit together
so the shortest path would be to first

00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319
so the shortest path would be to first
 

00:36:53.319 --> 00:36:55.530
so the shortest path would be to first
go to Chicago and then up to Wisconsin

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:55.540
go to Chicago and then up to Wisconsin
 

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.260
go to Chicago and then up to Wisconsin
but so go to the next slide but we know

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.270
but so go to the next slide but we know
 

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.180
but so go to the next slide but we know
that that's not the case because

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:00.190
that that's not the case because
 

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.060
that that's not the case because
remember I

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:01.070
remember I
 

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.820
remember I
saw him go from Wisconsin to Chicago so

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:03.830
saw him go from Wisconsin to Chicago so
 

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.380
saw him go from Wisconsin to Chicago so
we can edit the map a little bit more

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:05.390
we can edit the map a little bit more
 

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.390
we can edit the map a little bit more
and he went up to Madison and took route

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400
and he went up to Madison and took route
 

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.960
and he went up to Madison and took route
41 down into chicago and then we started

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:10.970
41 down into chicago and then we started
 

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.550
41 down into chicago and then we started
doing this with all of the letters and

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560
doing this with all of the letters and
 

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.020
doing this with all of the letters and
so this is sort of the resulting path

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.030
so this is sort of the resulting path
 

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.700
so this is sort of the resulting path
that we have this seems the most likely

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:15.710
that we have this seems the most likely
 

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.290
that we have this seems the most likely
using the letters and then when we don't

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:17.300
using the letters and then when we don't
 

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.400
using the letters and then when we don't
know the letters just saying well you

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:18.410
know the letters just saying well you
 

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.040
know the letters just saying well you
probably took the shortest path and then

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.050
probably took the shortest path and then
 

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.020
probably took the shortest path and then
you can click through and so we just

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.030
you can click through and so we just
 

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:26.160
you can click through and so we just
have the rest of his summer through and

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.170
have the rest of his summer through and
 

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.050
have the rest of his summer through and
then so then we have his whole path and

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.060
then so then we have his whole path and
 

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.430
then so then we have his whole path and
then we can start to put the photographs

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440
then we can start to put the photographs
 

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.590
then we can start to put the photographs
back into order and then where we can

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:32.600
back into order and then where we can
 

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.300
back into order and then where we can
put them into strips and strips into

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:34.310
put them into strips and strips into
 

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.640
put them into strips and strips into
rolls and rolls into trips and so while

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:36.650
rolls and rolls into trips and so while
 

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.630
rolls and rolls into trips and so while
it's not going to be a hundred percent

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640
it's not going to be a hundred percent
 

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.310
it's not going to be a hundred percent
accurate it's going to be ninety-five

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:39.320
accurate it's going to be ninety-five
 

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.720
accurate it's going to be ninety-five
percent accurate and we can start to see

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:40.730
percent accurate and we can start to see
 

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.370
percent accurate and we can start to see
the photographs through the eyes of the

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:42.380
the photographs through the eyes of the
 

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.470
the photographs through the eyes of the
photographer which is not the way the

photographer which is not the way the
 

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.090
photographer which is not the way the
archive is set up now it's sort of set

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.100
archive is set up now it's sort of set
 

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.670
archive is set up now it's sort of set
up in this thematic way or this you know

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680
up in this thematic way or this you know

afternoon as Kenosha Wisconsin and so
it's just a different way to think about

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:55.730

on interactive maps
 

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.500
on interactive maps
you can see this is a the map is sort of

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:15.510
you can see this is a the map is sort of
 

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.660
you can see this is a the map is sort of
shaded based upon how many photographs

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:17.670
shaded based upon how many photographs
 

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.550
shaded based upon how many photographs
were taken in that state and then if you

go to the county level which is a little
more interesting and it takes a second

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:25.590
more interesting and it takes a second
 

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.960
more interesting and it takes a second
to load and so will actually see that

is sort of this is how we're starting to
 

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.000
is sort of this is how we're starting to
think of the archive but at least now we

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.010
think of the archive but at least now we
 

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.500
think of the archive but at least now we
have sort of a spatial way of thinking

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:54.510
have sort of a spatial way of thinking
 

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.270
have sort of a spatial way of thinking
about this thing entering the archive in

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280
about this thing entering the archive in
 

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.420
about this thing entering the archive in
a way that you didn't used to and what

00:39:59.420 --> 00:39:59.430
a way that you didn't used to and what
 

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.190
a way that you didn't used to and what
we think about this as some sort of a

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200
we think about this as some sort of a
 

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.780
we think about this as some sort of a
public humanities perspective it's very

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:02.790
public humanities perspective it's very
 

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.280
public humanities perspective it's very
cool is that when you interact with

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:04.290
cool is that when you interact with
 

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.840
cool is that when you interact with
people you interact with them locally

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:05.850
people you interact with them locally
 

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.610
people you interact with them locally
and in communities and people think

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:07.620
and in communities and people think
 

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.350
and in communities and people think
about people are interested in seeing

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:09.360
about people are interested in seeing
 

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.520

then I'm the lot number this is the

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:43.470
then I'm the lot number this is the
 

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.540
then I'm the lot number this is the
other thing is that weren't actually

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:44.550
other thing is that weren't actually
 

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.790
other thing is that weren't actually
sort of building in naturally all of

sort of building in naturally all of
these organizational systems like the

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:48.330
these organizational systems like the
 

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.230
these organizational systems like the
lot numbers and the catalog number so i

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240
lot numbers and the catalog number so i
 

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.270
lot numbers and the catalog number so i

little micro film film thing that
 

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.510
little micro film film thing that
jiggles and makes noise and now you can

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520
jiggles and makes noise and now you can
 

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.920
jiggles and makes noise and now you can
just look at it all on the computer

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:06.930
just look at it all on the computer
 

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.380
just look at it all on the computer
quickly and so that's um that's him

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:09.390
quickly and so that's um that's him
 

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.200
quickly and so that's um that's him
right there and so while we're still

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:12.210
right there and so while we're still
 

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.580
right there and so while we're still
building this out as I said right now it

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:13.590
building this out as I said right now it
 

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.780
building this out as I said right now it
just links back to the library of

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:14.790
just links back to the library of
 

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.360
just links back to the library of
congress but it's letting you see all of

new ones of the photo
graphic collection in a way that you

00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:22.059
graphic collection in a way that you
 

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:23.609
graphic collection in a way that you
can't interact with it on the LSC

00:41:23.609 --> 00:41:23.619
can't interact with it on the LSC
 

00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:27.120
can't interact with it on the LSC
website so just going back to the slide

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.130
website so just going back to the slide
 

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:32.099
website so just going back to the slide
show briefly and so some other things

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:32.109
show briefly and so some other things
 

00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:34.049
show briefly and so some other things
because on a statistician and I like fun

00:41:34.049 --> 00:41:34.059
because on a statistician and I like fun
 

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:37.739
because on a statistician and I like fun
fun graphics can I think if you do a

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:37.749
fun graphics can I think if you do a
 

00:41:37.749 --> 00:41:41.160
fun graphics can I think if you do a
view and then do slideshow it'll get

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:41.170
view and then do slideshow it'll get
 

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:49.140
view and then do slideshow it'll get
bigger exactly there you go um so some

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.150
bigger exactly there you go um so some
 

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.019
bigger exactly there you go um so some
visualizations we can do with this so to

00:41:51.019 --> 00:41:51.029
visualizations we can do with this so to
 

00:41:51.029 --> 00:41:53.279
visualizations we can do with this so to
what I've been describing now is taking

00:41:53.279 --> 00:41:53.289
what I've been describing now is taking
 

00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:55.640
what I've been describing now is taking
the collection and reorganizing its data

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:55.650
the collection and reorganizing its data
 

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.839
the collection and reorganizing its data
but other things we can do is we can

00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:57.849
but other things we can do is we can
 

00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:59.609
but other things we can do is we can
actually pair it with other did it's not

00:41:59.609 --> 00:41:59.619
actually pair it with other did it's not
 

00:41:59.619 --> 00:42:01.849
actually pair it with other did it's not
even in this collection so one thing is

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859
even in this collection so one thing is
 

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:04.559
even in this collection so one thing is
here I can take all of the photographs

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:04.569
here I can take all of the photographs
 

00:42:04.569 --> 00:42:06.660
here I can take all of the photographs
where people took all of the locations

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:06.670
where people took all of the locations
 

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.880
where people took all of the locations
where people took photographs and pair

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:08.890
where people took photographs and pair
 

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.759
where people took photographs and pair
it with historical census data and so

00:42:11.759 --> 00:42:11.769
it with historical census data and so
 

00:42:11.769 --> 00:42:13.680
it with historical census data and so
here I have all of the photograph that

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:13.690
here I have all of the photograph that
 

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.959
here I have all of the photograph that
photographers sort of laid out with

00:42:15.959 --> 00:42:15.969
photographers sort of laid out with
 

00:42:15.969 --> 00:42:18.269
photographers sort of laid out with
Walker Evans not surprisingly all the

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:18.279
Walker Evans not surprisingly all the
 

00:42:18.279 --> 00:42:20.160
Walker Evans not surprisingly all the
way at the left as the one who had the

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.170
way at the left as the one who had the
 

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.199
way at the left as the one who had the
least urban photographs if he was always

00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:22.209
least urban photographs if he was always
 

00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:24.390
least urban photographs if he was always
in these like desolate das police

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400
in these like desolate das police
 

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.670
in these like desolate das police
southern places and then on the other

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680
southern places and then on the other
 

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.640
southern places and then on the other
side side i have like Arthur Siegel and

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:29.650
side side i have like Arthur Siegel and
 

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:33.180
side side i have like Arthur Siegel and
I can't read them Stacy who else is on

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:33.190
I can't read them Stacy who else is on
 

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:41.939
I can't read them Stacy who else is on
there Siegel Lieberman okay right so so

00:42:41.939 --> 00:42:41.949
there Siegel Lieberman okay right so so
 

00:42:41.949 --> 00:42:43.439
there Siegel Lieberman okay right so so
we can start to sort of play around and

00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:43.449
we can start to sort of play around and
 

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:44.759
we can start to sort of play around and
a lot of this is just fun for right now

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:44.769
a lot of this is just fun for right now
 

00:42:44.769 --> 00:42:46.469
a lot of this is just fun for right now
but but we do think that once people can

00:42:46.469 --> 00:42:46.479
but but we do think that once people can
 

00:42:46.479 --> 00:42:47.910
but but we do think that once people can
interact with these sorts of graphics

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920
interact with these sorts of graphics
 

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.249
interact with these sorts of graphics
dynamically that they'll at least at

00:42:50.249 --> 00:42:50.259
dynamically that they'll at least at
 

00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:51.269
dynamically that they'll at least at
least two people who aren't even

00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:51.279
least two people who aren't even
 

00:42:51.279 --> 00:42:52.529
least two people who aren't even
familiar with this collection can

00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:52.539
familiar with this collection can
 

00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:54.689
familiar with this collection can
instantly think of Oh what do what do I

00:42:54.689 --> 00:42:54.699
instantly think of Oh what do what do I
 

00:42:54.699 --> 00:42:56.279
instantly think of Oh what do what do I
think of the sort of counties or the

00:42:56.279 --> 00:42:56.289
think of the sort of counties or the
 

00:42:56.289 --> 00:42:58.170
think of the sort of counties or the
sort of photos that Walker Evans takes

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:58.180
sort of photos that Walker Evans takes
 

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.269
sort of photos that Walker Evans takes
as opposed to you know Marion post

00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:00.279
as opposed to you know Marion post
 

00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:02.309
as opposed to you know Marion post
Wolcott so and then the other thing that

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319
Wolcott so and then the other thing that
 

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.439
Wolcott so and then the other thing that
we read about about sean is that he

00:43:04.439 --> 00:43:04.449
we read about about sean is that he
 

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:06.449
we read about about sean is that he
really likes to go from he likes to look

00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:06.459
really likes to go from he likes to look
 

00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:08.009
really likes to go from he likes to look
for cows and he likes to be right

00:43:08.009 --> 00:43:08.019
for cows and he likes to be right
 

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:10.140
for cows and he likes to be right
downtown cities and so we thought I'd be

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.150
downtown cities and so we thought I'd be
 

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.789
downtown cities and so we thought I'd be
cool since we had already charted his

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:11.799
cool since we had already charted his
 

00:43:11.799 --> 00:43:14.699
cool since we had already charted his
his journey to take all of the the

00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:14.709
his journey to take all of the the
 

00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:17.999
his journey to take all of the the
county this is from the 1930s census the

00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:18.009
county this is from the 1930s census the
 

00:43:18.009 --> 00:43:20.219
county this is from the 1930s census the
density of the counties and so you can

00:43:20.219 --> 00:43:20.229
density of the counties and so you can
 

00:43:20.229 --> 00:43:22.140
density of the counties and so you can
see that light lighter is sort of urban

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:22.150
see that light lighter is sort of urban
 

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.799
see that light lighter is sort of urban
counties and then darker is a darker is

00:43:25.799 --> 00:43:25.809
counties and then darker is a darker is
 

00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:27.660
counties and then darker is a darker is
more urban and then the lighter is more

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:27.670
more urban and then the lighter is more
 

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.130
more urban and then the lighter is more
rule it is and so you can see he's going

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:29.140
rule it is and so you can see he's going
 

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.200
rule it is and so you can see he's going
from like Chicago now

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.210
from like Chicago now
 

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.280
from like Chicago now
Detroit and then he's going into the

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:33.290
Detroit and then he's going into the
 

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.900
Detroit and then he's going into the
middle of nowhere you know looking for

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:34.910
middle of nowhere you know looking for
 

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.960
middle of nowhere you know looking for
cows and things and so that's sort of an

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:37.970
cows and things and so that's sort of an
 

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.280
cows and things and so that's sort of an
interesting way of seeing his journey

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:39.290
interesting way of seeing his journey
 

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.470
interesting way of seeing his journey
that you wouldn't you wouldn't see just

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480
that you wouldn't you wouldn't see just
 

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.270
that you wouldn't you wouldn't see just
looking at sort of all the photographs

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280
looking at sort of all the photographs
 

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.550
looking at sort of all the photographs
at once and then you click on through we

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:45.560
at once and then you click on through we
 

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.920
at once and then you click on through we
also took so the captions that they

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:47.930
also took so the captions that they
 

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.410
also took so the captions that they
wrote they always wrote like a little

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:50.420
wrote they always wrote like a little
 

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.940
wrote they always wrote like a little
caption about some of their photographs

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:51.950
caption about some of their photographs
 

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.130
caption about some of their photographs
like this is a picture of a farmer on

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:54.140
like this is a picture of a farmer on
 

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.070
like this is a picture of a farmer on
his horse or something and so I took all

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:57.080
his horse or something and so I took all
 

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.360
his horse or something and so I took all
of them and built these little word

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:58.370
of them and built these little word
 

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.400
of them and built these little word
clouds and so the bigger words were used

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:00.410
clouds and so the bigger words were used
 

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:01.660
clouds and so the bigger words were used

wonderful success with it so we'd like

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:09.250
wonderful success with it so we'd like
 

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.780
wonderful success with it so we'd like
to build off that as well and so this

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:12.790
to build off that as well and so this
 

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.430

great and maybe states can speak a
little bit to that um we also think that

00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:06.369
little bit to that um we also think that
 

00:49:06.369 --> 00:49:08.809

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440
this point let maybe Stacy and can talk
 

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.910
this point let maybe Stacy and can talk
about ok so I'm a bad guy and so I've

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920
about ok so I'm a bad guy and so I've
 

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.460
about ok so I'm a bad guy and so I've
been thinking about three things so I've

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:26.470
been thinking about three things so I've
 

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:30.630
been thinking about three things so I've
been thinking about geocoding and right

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640
been thinking about geocoding and right
 

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.950
been thinking about geocoding and right
now I've been thinking about three

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960
now I've been thinking about three
 

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.050
now I've been thinking about three
things geocoding the collection itself

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:34.060
things geocoding the collection itself
 

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.050
things geocoding the collection itself
so taking the information about where

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:37.060
so taking the information about where
 

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.660
so taking the information about where
each of the photos was taken and turning

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:39.670
each of the photos was taken and turning
 

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.050
each of the photos was taken and turning
that basically into just a lap long

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:42.060
that basically into just a lap long
 

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.830
that basically into just a lap long
Taylor condemned report with and using

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:45.840
Taylor condemned report with and using
 

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.260
Taylor condemned report with and using
the ways that he wants to to use it the

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:48.270
the ways that he wants to to use it the
 

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.610
the ways that he wants to to use it the
other two things I'm thinking about is

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:49.620
other two things I'm thinking about is
 

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.260
other two things I'm thinking about is
the demographic data how do we get

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:51.270
the demographic data how do we get
 

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.500
the demographic data how do we get
demographic data from 1930 1940 put it

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:54.510
demographic data from 1930 1940 put it
 

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.960
demographic data from 1930 1940 put it
into a format that you can look at sort

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:56.970
into a format that you can look at sort
 

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.150
into a format that you can look at sort
of the way I think of it is looking at

00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160
of the way I think of it is looking at
 

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.670
of the way I think of it is looking at
the demography of the collection against

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680
the demography of the collection against
 

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.220
the demography of the collection against
the demography of the actual human

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:04.230
the demography of the actual human
 

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.850
the demography of the actual human
population of being photographed and so

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:07.860
population of being photographed and so
 

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.950
population of being photographed and so
we've been pulling down data the data

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960
we've been pulling down data the data
 

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.140
we've been pulling down data the data
that Taylor is using I think is from the

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.150
that Taylor is using I think is from the
 

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.870
that Taylor is using I think is from the
national historic GIS project which is a

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880
national historic GIS project which is a
 

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.720
national historic GIS project which is a
project that has digitally mapped in in

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:17.730
project that has digitally mapped in in
 

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.990
project that has digitally mapped in in
a GIS friendly way all of the census

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000
a GIS friendly way all of the census
 

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.710
a GIS friendly way all of the census
data at the county level back to 1790 so

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720
data at the county level back to 1790 so
 

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.290
data at the county level back to 1790 so
we're using that as as demographic data

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300
we're using that as as demographic data
 

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.880
we're using that as as demographic data
and then I've also been thinking about

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:28.890
and then I've also been thinking about
 

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.850
and then I've also been thinking about
base map data we can throw it on top of

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:31.860
base map data we can throw it on top of
 

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.330
base map data we can throw it on top of
Google Maps and Google Maps or an

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:35.340
Google Maps and Google Maps or an
 

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.550

open-source version of Google Maps like
 

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.040
open-source version of Google Maps like
Open Street Map will probably be one of

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.050
Open Street Map will probably be one of
 

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.140
Open Street Map will probably be one of
the available base maps but we also want

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.150
the available base maps but we also want
 

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.990
the available base maps but we also want
to put it in too it's only temporal

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000
to put it in too it's only temporal
 

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.570
to put it in too it's only temporal
context and so I was really excited

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:47.580
context and so I was really excited
 

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.330
context and so I was really excited

paradigm shift so now we have not been

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:24.510
paradigm shift so now we have not been
 

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.890
paradigm shift so now we have not been
able to scan and use materials based on

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900
able to scan and use materials based on

able to scan and use materials based on
our fear of

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440
our fear of
 

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.559
our fear of
whether or not it falls within fair use

00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:31.569
whether or not it falls within fair use
 

00:53:31.569 --> 00:53:34.470
whether or not it falls within fair use
or not post 1923 and that's kind of

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480
or not post 1923 and that's kind of
 

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.569
or not post 1923 and that's kind of
important for this project and and so

00:53:36.569 --> 00:53:36.579
important for this project and and so
 

00:53:36.579 --> 00:53:39.120
important for this project and and so
now I find that because our use is

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.130
now I find that because our use is
 

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.670
now I find that because our use is
transformational it falls under fair use

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680
transformational it falls under fair use
 

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.420
transformational it falls under fair use
I can take our collection of several

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:45.430
I can take our collection of several
 

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:48.180
I can take our collection of several
thousand roadmaps in the United States

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:48.190
thousand roadmaps in the United States
 

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.890
thousand roadmaps in the United States
and I can scan them and I can build a

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:49.900
and I can scan them and I can build a
 

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.400
and I can scan them and I can build a
base map like google but google maps for

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:53.410
base map like google but google maps for
 

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:57.000
base map like google but google maps for
1930 and 1940 and that is what will

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.010
1930 and 1940 and that is what will
 

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:00.030
1930 and 1940 and that is what will
probably end up using for for the main

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040
probably end up using for for the main
 

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.670
probably end up using for for the main

be covered under fair use because those

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:04.569
be covered under fair use because those
 

00:54:04.569 --> 00:54:07.349
be covered under fair use because those
maps were originally used to well they

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359
maps were originally used to well they
 

00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:09.450
maps were originally used to well they
were originally created probably more

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:09.460
were originally created probably more
 

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.220

system that has been changed so

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:18.010
system that has been changed so
 

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.950

I've been thinking about up to this

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:26.500
I've been thinking about up to this
 

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.490
I've been thinking about up to this
point is geo coding and and here's my

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:29.500
point is geo coding and and here's my
 

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.500
point is geo coding and and here's my
problem we've got a hundred and seventy

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.510
problem we've got a hundred and seventy
 

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.410
problem we've got a hundred and seventy
thousand images we've got 107 of the miz

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:34.420
thousand images we've got 107 of the miz
 

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.410
thousand images we've got 107 of the miz
records because they're the records in a

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:37.420
records because they're the records in a
 

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.730
records because they're the records in a
database Taylor and I are on the same

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:38.740
database Taylor and I are on the same
 

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.510
database Taylor and I are on the same
page here so we've got 170 thousand

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520
page here so we've got 170 thousand
 

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.030
page here so we've got 170 thousand
records of those hundred and seventy

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040
records of those hundred and seventy
 

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:50.040
records of those hundred and seventy
thousand records 90,000 have a location

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.050
thousand records 90,000 have a location
 

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:53.670
thousand records 90,000 have a location
associated with them and then of those

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680
associated with them and then of those
 

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.530
associated with them and then of those
locations that are associated with those

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:55.540
locations that are associated with those
 

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.780
locations that are associated with those
ninety thousand records that have

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:57.790
ninety thousand records that have
 

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.089
ninety thousand records that have
location there are four thousand unique

00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:00.099
location there are four thousand unique
 

00:55:00.099 --> 00:55:02.730
location there are four thousand unique
locations and so that's one way you know

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:02.740
locations and so that's one way you know
 

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.710
locations and so that's one way you know
you can bring it down and make it more

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720
you can bring it down and make it more
 

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.780
you can bring it down and make it more
manageable and so I had to find a way

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:06.790
manageable and so I had to find a way
 

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:09.270
manageable and so I had to find a way

to geocode those addresses and those
 

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.760
to geocode those addresses and those
locations the other problem is that some

locations the other problem is that some
 

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.370

of those locations don't well they exist

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380
of those locations don't well they exist
 

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.589
of those locations don't well they exist
but they have different names now and so

00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599
but they have different names now and so
 

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:36.680
but they have different names now and so
how do you geocode locations that have

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:36.690
how do you geocode locations that have
 

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.359
how do you geocode locations that have
different names how do you go back in

00:55:38.359 --> 00:55:38.369
different names how do you go back in
 

00:55:38.369 --> 00:55:41.180
different names how do you go back in
time and find these these counties or

these populated places and place names
that no are no longer named what they

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:47.700
that no are no longer named what they
 

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.599
that no are no longer named what they
were in the past and so the answer for

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:50.609
were in the past and so the answer for
 

00:55:50.609 --> 00:55:54.470
were in the past and so the answer for
us for me was geonames organ and this is

engines was how many geocodes could we

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:03.370
engines was how many geocodes could we

because experimenting and geocoding is

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:06.730
because experimenting and geocoding is

just wanted to limit it to North America

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920
just wanted to limit it to North America
 

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.790

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:29.710
north america and then i had to put my
 

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.890

username in there so they could count my

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:31.900
username in there so they could count my
 

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.890

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:34.900
quota and tell it how I wanted the date
 

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.830
quota and tell it how I wanted the date
of that pretty simple but I had to do

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:37.840
of that pretty simple but I had to do
 

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.540
of that pretty simple but I had to do
this four thousand times so I didn't

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:39.550
this four thousand times so I didn't
 

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:40.980

four thousand record problem so what I
 

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.280
four thousand record problem so what I
stumbled upon hockley and I

records are really problematic because

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640
records are really problematic because
 

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.840
records are really problematic because
they are it's a strange database format

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:05.850
they are it's a strange database format
 

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:09.380

really fantastically important things in
 

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:01.560
really fantastically important things in
it it's got the longitude and the

what I was after it just a little bit

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720
what I was after it just a little bit
 

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.840

about how urls work and things like that
 

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:18.630
about how urls work and things like that
so a little bit of a code would parse

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640
so a little bit of a code would parse
 

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.150
so a little bit of a code would parse
through that big terrible string and

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160
through that big terrible string and
 

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.910
through that big terrible string and
pull out the longitude and the latitude

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920
pull out the longitude and the latitude
 

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.230
pull out the longitude and the latitude
for me and allow me to give those

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240
for me and allow me to give those
 

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.760
for me and allow me to give those
longitudes and latitudes to all the

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:29.770
longitudes and latitudes to all the
 

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:31.110
longitudes and latitudes to all the
place names and then what I could do

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:31.120
place names and then what I could do
 

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.000
place names and then what I could do
since I standardize all my place names i

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.010
since I standardize all my place names i
 

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:34.920
since I standardize all my place names i
just join that back to the main database

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:34.930
just join that back to the main database
 

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.370
just join that back to the main database
and it joins however many times it needs

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:38.380
and it joins however many times it needs
 

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.590

to took the main database and what that

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:40.600
to took the main database and what that

to took the main database and what that
then allows us to do is take a photo

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:42.460
then allows us to do is take a photo
 

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.900
then allows us to do is take a photo

very briefly the next step is to go to

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:03.970
very briefly the next step is to go to
 

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.290
very briefly the next step is to go to
the National Historic GIS and figure out

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:07.300
the National Historic GIS and figure out
 

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.800
the National Historic GIS and figure out
how to take this base data the census

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:10.810
how to take this base data the census
 

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.620
how to take this base data the census
data and put it in to a visual format

that is intuitive for people who want to
browse the photography and also look at

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:18.270
browse the photography and also look at
 

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:21.750
browse the photography and also look at

your geocoding collections it's really

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280
your geocoding collections it's really
 

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.350
your geocoding collections it's really
not that difficult if you have

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:40.360
not that difficult if you have
 

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.700
not that difficult if you have
geographic information and lots of the

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:42.710
geographic information and lots of the
 

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:44.860
geographic information and lots of the
collections have G information of that

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:44.870

really so but the more that we can show

really so but the more that we can show

meetings and things like that and one of
 

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.609
meetings and things like that and one of
the ways to do that is to sell this not

the ways to do that is to sell this not
 

01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:19.170
the ways to do that is to sell this not

people have this sort of reflex reaction
 

01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:26.130
people have this sort of reflex reaction
against that of oh well I'm humanists

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:26.140
against that of oh well I'm humanists
 

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.690

I'm not digital humans that's not what I

do that what you saw today sure we

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:30.670
do that what you saw today sure we
 

01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:31.740
do that what you saw today sure we
couldn't have done these things without

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:31.750
couldn't have done these things without
 

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.660
couldn't have done these things without
technology but what was that the core of

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:33.670
technology but what was that the core of
 

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.390
technology but what was that the core of
it was discovered that that's what we

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400
it was discovered that that's what we
 

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.670
it was discovered that that's what we
were enabling here wasn't too you know

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680
were enabling here wasn't too you know
 

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.470
were enabling here wasn't too you know
enabling the code that the Taylor wrote

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480
enabling the code that the Taylor wrote
 

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.970
enabling the code that the Taylor wrote
or the geocoding that you did or the

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:41.980
or the geocoding that you did or the
 

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.030
or the geocoding that you did or the
scholarship you it was what was most

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:45.040
scholarship you it was what was most
 

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.289
scholarship you it was what was most
important to discovery and I think

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:46.299
important to discovery and I think
 

01:05:46.299 --> 01:05:48.180
important to discovery and I think
that's the message we have to sell as we

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.190
that's the message we have to sell as we
 

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.740
that's the message we have to sell as we
want to try to promote this kind of work

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:49.750
want to try to promote this kind of work
 

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:53.010
want to try to promote this kind of work
and then the one other thing was it's

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:53.020
and then the one other thing was it's
 

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.420
and then the one other thing was it's
been interesting cuz I don't think we're

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:54.430
been interesting cuz I don't think we're
 

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.819
been interesting cuz I don't think we're
at Yale at a very different point than

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:56.829
at Yale at a very different point than
 

01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:59.240
at Yale at a very different point than
you guys are at Columbia in terms of

01:05:59.240 --> 01:05:59.250
you guys are at Columbia in terms of
 

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.710
you guys are at Columbia in terms of
where we are providing staff and

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720
where we are providing staff and
 

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.170
where we are providing staff and
resources to do this kind of work I

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:04.180
resources to do this kind of work I
 

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.329
resources to do this kind of work I
think we're both you know we there have

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:06.339
think we're both you know we there have
 

01:06:06.339 --> 01:06:08.819
think we're both you know we there have
been some some work done in this but

01:06:08.819 --> 01:06:08.829
been some some work done in this but
 

01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:09.809
been some some work done in this but
we're now we're thing about how we can

01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:09.819
we're now we're thing about how we can
 

01:06:09.819 --> 01:06:14.660
we're now we're thing about how we can
formalize it and go forward with it and

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:14.670
formalize it and go forward with it and
 

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.890
formalize it and go forward with it and
so we're asking ourselves the same

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:16.900
so we're asking ourselves the same
 

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.059
so we're asking ourselves the same
questions if we're going to have a

01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:18.069
questions if we're going to have a
 

01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:19.589
questions if we're going to have a
center in the library that is going to

01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599
center in the library that is going to
 

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:21.059
center in the library that is going to
enable this kind of work what kind of

01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:21.069
enable this kind of work what kind of
 

01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:22.559
enable this kind of work what kind of
skill sets do we need represent it there

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:22.569
skill sets do we need represent it there
 

01:06:22.569 --> 01:06:24.990
skill sets do we need represent it there
and I've always assumed that yet we need

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000

of the first big splashes in in the
 

01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:29.609
of the first big splashes in in the
humanities and that you know we know

01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:29.619
humanities and that you know we know
 

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:30.599
humanities and that you know we know
we're going to need some programmers

01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:30.609
we're going to need some programmers
 

01:06:30.609 --> 01:06:32.819
we're going to need some programmers
because they're the ones who have to do

01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:32.829
because they're the ones who have to do
 

01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:36.390
because they're the ones who have to do
this but I think there's almost every

have sat down in coffee shops with
 

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.390
have sat down in coffee shops with
countless professors

everything is somewhere yeah remember

and that matters and you've got to have

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:54.500
and that matters and you've got to have

that I mean most libraries probably have
 

01:06:56.150 --> 01:07:00.130
that I mean most libraries probably have
a GIS specialist but its key and the

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:00.140
a GIS specialist but its key and the
 

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.260
a GIS specialist but its key and the
other thing though is most libraries

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:02.270
other thing though is most libraries
 

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:07.660
other thing though is most libraries
also have data specialists but Taylor

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:07.670
also have data specialists but Taylor
 

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:09.760
also have data specialists but Taylor
skill set is also one that can really

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:09.770
skill set is also one that can really
 

01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:11.430

thought necessarily about being

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440
thought necessarily about being
 

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.569
thought necessarily about being
absolutely necessary but I think it is

01:07:13.569 --> 01:07:13.579
absolutely necessary but I think it is
 

01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:15.760
absolutely necessary but I think it is
absolutely necessary and that's somebody

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:15.770
absolutely necessary and that's somebody
 

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.470
absolutely necessary and that's somebody
who has just a very strong data and

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480
who has just a very strong data and
 

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.710
who has just a very strong data and
stats background because none of this

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720
stats background because none of this
 

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.329
stats background because none of this
could have been made possible without

01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:22.339
could have been made possible without
 

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:25.960
could have been made possible without
that expertise either and that's another

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:25.970
that expertise either and that's another
 

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.039
that expertise either and that's another
area that I think is interesting that

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:27.049
area that I think is interesting that
 

01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:29.349
area that I think is interesting that
those of you who work in humanities

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359
those of you who work in humanities
 

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:31.240
those of you who work in humanities
libraries reach out to your

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:31.250
libraries reach out to your
 

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.339
libraries reach out to your
statisticians as well because we sort of

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:33.349
statisticians as well because we sort of
 

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.720
statisticians as well because we sort of
think of statisticians as social

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:34.730
think of statisticians as social
 

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.279
think of statisticians as social
scientists and that sort of thing and I

01:07:36.279 --> 01:07:36.289
scientists and that sort of thing and I
 

01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:37.690
scientists and that sort of thing and I
don't know that's necessarily the case

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:37.700
don't know that's necessarily the case
 

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.849
don't know that's necessarily the case
the social sciences have just been the

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:39.859
the social sciences have just been the
 

01:07:39.859 --> 01:07:41.829
the social sciences have just been the
ones that have given statisticians these

01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839
ones that have given statisticians these
 

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:43.750
ones that have given statisticians these
cool messy data sets that they like to

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760
cool messy data sets that they like to
 

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.579
cool messy data sets that they like to
work with in really interesting problems

01:07:45.579 --> 01:07:45.589
work with in really interesting problems
 

01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:47.260
work with in really interesting problems
to solve and I think we can do the same

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:47.270
to solve and I think we can do the same
 

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:51.490
to solve and I think we can do the same
thing in the humanities as well so I

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:51.500
thing in the humanities as well so I
 

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.589
thing in the humanities as well so I
think that's alright most about

01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599
think that's alright most about
 

01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:57.269
think that's alright most about
perspective so we have a little time to

01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279
perspective so we have a little time to
 

01:07:57.279 --> 01:08:01.850
perspective so we have a little time to
share with you comments reactions

are a lot of shooting scripts I always

01:09:18.599 --> 01:09:18.609
are a lot of shooting scripts I always
 

01:09:18.609 --> 01:09:19.950
are a lot of shooting scripts I always
thought there were these shooting

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960
thought there were these shooting
 

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.650
thought there were these shooting
scripts it turns out when we went down

few shooting scripts there were dinners

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400
few shooting scripts there were dinners
 

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.250
few shooting scripts there were dinners
at Strykers house and there were

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:32.260
at Strykers house and there were
 

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.810
at Strykers house and there were
conversations but there are very few

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:33.820
conversations but there are very few
 

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.790
conversations but there are very few
students who so we should get the

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:35.800
students who so we should get the
 

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.080
students who so we should get the
shooting scripts and they should be up

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:37.090
shooting scripts and they should be up
 

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.790
shooting scripts and they should be up
there and we can see that there are a

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:38.800
there and we can see that there are a
 

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.560
there and we can see that there are a
few shooting script so yes there's all

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:40.570
few shooting script so yes there's all
 

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.360

amount growing continually of
scholarship and that should be linked as

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:49.630
scholarship and that should be linked as
 

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.210

well we're thinking of a publication

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:51.220
well we're thinking of a publication
 

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.860
well we're thinking of a publication
we're just at the beginning yes yes yes

we're just at the beginning yes yes yes
 

01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:58.900
we're just at the beginning yes yes yes
this is all very interesting the

01:09:58.900 --> 01:09:58.910
this is all very interesting the

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:15.910
archive 30s and 40s and I would like to
suggest that once you've made enough

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920
suggest that once you've made enough
 

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.490
suggest that once you've made enough
headway you ought to think of expanding

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:18.500
headway you ought to think of expanding
 

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.669
headway you ought to think of expanding
your project to include the rest of the

01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679
your project to include the rest of the
 

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:25.020
your project to include the rest of the
visual culture from those two decades

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:25.030
visual culture from those two decades
 

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:30.180
visual culture from those two decades
paintings films and correlate the images

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:30.190
paintings films and correlate the images
 

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.250
paintings films and correlate the images
well it's a wonderful idea I mean the

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:33.260
well it's a wonderful idea I mean the
 

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.280
well it's a wonderful idea I mean the
music for instance where there's

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:35.290
music for instance where there's
 

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:38.620
music for instance where there's
brilliant folk yeah that all of that

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:38.630
brilliant folk yeah that all of that
 

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.890
brilliant folk yeah that all of that
could be connected the film archives

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:41.900
could be connected the film archives
 

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.270
could be connected the film archives
which are also at the library of

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280
which are also at the library of
 

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.910
which are also at the library of
congress could be can I you know I agree

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920
congress could be can I you know I agree
 

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.919
congress could be can I you know I agree
with you it would be fabulous so the way

01:10:47.919 --> 01:10:47.929
with you it would be fabulous so the way
 

01:10:47.929 --> 01:10:50.919
with you it would be fabulous so the way
I expressed that is that we need to have

01:10:50.919 --> 01:10:50.929
I expressed that is that we need to have
 

01:10:50.929 --> 01:10:53.650
I expressed that is that we need to have
the historical timelines historical

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:53.660
the historical timelines historical
 

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.640
the historical timelines historical
events but they would it for me include

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:56.650
events but they would it for me include
 

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:58.810
events but they would it for me include
production of cultural production as

01:10:58.810 --> 01:10:58.820
production of cultural production as
 

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.140
production of cultural production as
well and what are thousands rifles yeah

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.150
well and what are thousands rifles yeah
 

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.330
well and what are thousands rifles yeah
but we also have other things to do I

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:06.340
but we also have other things to do I
 

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.709
but we also have other things to do I
think it's worth noting that when we

01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719
think it's worth noting that when we
 

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:10.540
think it's worth noting that when we
were at the grant we intentionally made

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:10.550
were at the grant we intentionally made
 

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:12.280
were at the grant we intentionally made
everything open source with the idea

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:12.290
everything open source with the idea
 

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.540
everything open source with the idea
that someone could come along with a

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:13.550
that someone could come along with a
 

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:17.050
that someone could come along with a
different set of information WPA any

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:17.060
different set of information WPA any
 

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.870
different set of information WPA any
slew of these items and could take any

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880
slew of these items and could take any
 

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.419
slew of these items and could take any
of our code any of it and you can pull

01:11:22.419 --> 01:11:22.429
of our code any of it and you can pull
 

01:11:22.429 --> 01:11:24.430
of our code any of it and you can pull
it off and do whatever you want with it

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440
it off and do whatever you want with it
 

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.750
it off and do whatever you want with it
I think that's important

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760
 
 

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.760
 
so yeah I think what's really nice about

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:34.770
so yeah I think what's really nice about
 

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:38.850
so yeah I think what's really nice about
it Toni doing so there are all the

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:38.860
it Toni doing so there are all the
 

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:41.100
it Toni doing so there are all the
things words and so like like Laura was

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.110
things words and so like like Laura was
 

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.720
things words and so like like Laura was
mentioning these other photo archives I

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:42.730
mentioning these other photo archives I
 

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:46.200
mentioning these other photo archives I
would love but they're never sort of

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:46.210
would love but they're never sort of
 

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:48.990
would love but they're never sort of
privately owned and privately collected

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000
privately owned and privately collected
 

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.430
privately owned and privately collected
and so they're not in the public domain

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440
and so they're not in the public domain
 

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.070
and so they're not in the public domain
and so we can't really do the same thing

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080
and so we can't really do the same thing
 

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.630
and so we can't really do the same thing
unfortunately with it and you'd have to

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640
unfortunately with it and you'd have to
 

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.510
unfortunately with it and you'd have to
go you have to go back into the 1910s or

01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520
go you have to go back into the 1910s or
 

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.800
go you have to go back into the 1910s or
something because you just run into

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:58.810
something because you just run into
 

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.439
something because you just run into
copyright issues and we tried to think

01:12:01.439 --> 01:12:01.449
copyright issues and we tried to think
 

01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:03.180
copyright issues and we tried to think
of this not only as a project but as a

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:03.190
of this not only as a project but as a
 

01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:05.790
of this not only as a project but as a
platform so we're working on a project

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800
platform so we're working on a project
 

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.260
platform so we're working on a project
but what will come out of it is a

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:07.270
but what will come out of it is a
 

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:09.300
but what will come out of it is a
platform that other people can take and

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:09.310
platform that other people can take and
 

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:13.170
platform that other people can take and
do whatever they want with um yeah I

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:13.180
do whatever they want with um yeah I
 

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.970
do whatever they want with um yeah I
just wanted to sort of follow up about

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:14.980
just wanted to sort of follow up about
 

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.229
just wanted to sort of follow up about
the mapping sure I mean that was

01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239
the mapping sure I mean that was
 

01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:19.729
the mapping sure I mean that was
fascinating were working on a project of

01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739
fascinating were working on a project of
 

01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:22.140
fascinating were working on a project of
Brooklyn photographs of Brooklyn and

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:22.150
Brooklyn photographs of Brooklyn and
 

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:24.510
Brooklyn photographs of Brooklyn and
when we talk about like the mapping and

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520
when we talk about like the mapping and
 

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.830
when we talk about like the mapping and
the geo-locating it always sound like

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840
the geo-locating it always sound like
 

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.380
the geo-locating it always sound like
like this enormous project that would be

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:28.390
like this enormous project that would be
 

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:29.640
like this enormous project that would be
something separate that we couldn't

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:29.650
something separate that we couldn't
 

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:31.530
something separate that we couldn't
possibly undertake and you made it look

along the way that you have two things

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:40.570
along the way that you have two things
 

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:42.240
along the way that you have two things
that you clean up it's simple but it

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:42.250
that you clean up it's simple but it
 

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.790
that you clean up it's simple but it
takes a while because you do have to

01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800
takes a while because you do have to
 

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.110
takes a while because you do have to
clean up the data and things like that

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120
clean up the data and things like that
 

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.620

very hesitant to sort of formally

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:20.790
very hesitant to sort of formally
 

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:22.310

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.770

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:34.280
security measures and all that sort of
thing and so I think where we are right

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:34.290
thing and so I think where we are right
 

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:35.650

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.040
communication with them where
hurley knows us and you know all the

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:39.050
hurley knows us and you know all the
 

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:40.870
hurley knows us and you know all the
curators there are no us and so always

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880
curators there are no us and so always
 

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.130
curators there are no us and so always
in communication with them but not

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:42.140
in communication with them but not
 

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.750
in communication with them but not
really a formal partnership just because

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760
really a formal partnership just because
 

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.690
really a formal partnership just because
it's so it's so politically charged to

01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:46.700
it's so it's so politically charged to
 

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.400
it's so it's so politically charged to
do anything like that with the Elysee

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:48.410

that would that would have to be way

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:50.030
that would that would have to be way
 

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:56.530
that would that would have to be way
down the line yeah yeah yeah I think
