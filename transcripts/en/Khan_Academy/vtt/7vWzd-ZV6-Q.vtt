00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.770
- Let's see if we can compare
the fraction 5/3 to 10/7

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.510
or which-- if we can figure out which one

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.950
of these fractions is larger.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.170
And you might notice both of
these are larger than a whole.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.310
A whole would be 3/3, this is 5/3.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.790
And a whole here would
be 7/7, this is 10/7.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.550
So which of these is going to be larger?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.650
And to help us with
that, I'm going to plot

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.170
each of these on a number line

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.770
and I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.590
and try to do the same
before I work it out.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.590
Alright, so I have a number line, here.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.450
We have zero, one, two and, first,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.190
I divide the number line into thirds.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.730
You see right over here, this is 1/3,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.730
this is 2/3, the thirds
are being marked off

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.370
in blue right over here.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.030
You see that each from
the space from zero to one

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.910
is split into three equal
sections, one, two, three.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.130
And then the space from one to two

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.130
is split into three equal
sections, one, two, and three,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.430
you see that right over here.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.320
So I'm marking off all of the--

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.640
I'm marking off all of the thirds.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.090
So this is 1/3, this is
2/3, this is 3/3, which is,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060
of course, the same thing as one.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.180
This is 4/3, and then this right over here

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.820
is going to be 5/3.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.720
And if we were to go over here,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.380
two would be the same thing as 6/3.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.590
But what we care about
is 5/3, so that's that.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.690
Right over there, I don't
want to fill it in so much.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.690
So 5/3 is that right over there.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.730
Now let's think about sevenths.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.850
Now to do sevenths I have
to split the part of the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.110
number line between zero and one

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.170
or between each whole number
into seven equal spaces.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.870
So you see that here.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.150
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.470
You have seven equal sections.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.470
So this is 1/7, this is
2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.370
this is 7/7, I could write that down,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
this is, one is the same thing as 7/7,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.370
8/7, 9/7, 10/7 right over here.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.530
This, right over here is ten over seven.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.150
So we see that both 10/7 and 5/3

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.390
are between one and two, but which one

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.970
of these is actually larger?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.690
Well we see 5/3 is further to the right

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.010
on the number line than 10/7.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.830
I'm gonna make this a
little bit easier to see.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.530
So 10/7 and that is right over there.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.530
So 5/3 is to the right of 10/7,
so 5/3 is greater than 10/7.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.710
So how do we write the symbol?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.270
Well we always want to open
it up to the larger number.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.790
5/3 is the larger number
so we want the larger side

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.150
or the opening on the larger number.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.840
Or the smaller side, or the point,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.180
pointing to the smaller number.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.810
So we have 5/3 is greater than 10/7.
