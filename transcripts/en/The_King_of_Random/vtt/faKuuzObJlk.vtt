00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
In today's video,

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.280
we're going to see what happens
if we take 100 pounds of dry ice,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.580
and pour it all into a hot tub at once.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.700
[Music]

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.740
Recently, we tried pouring
dry ice into boiling water,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.920
and we got a really cool effect,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.560
and we thought we
should scale that up.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.250
So now, instead
of a pot of water,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.780
we're going to use
a full running hot tub.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.740
We're going to pour
some dry ice into it.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.240
But like so much more.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.900
This is almost
my body weight in dry ice.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.820
One thing we do want to try,

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:37.030
we discovered we got
a much cooler reaction

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.291
if some of our dry ice
was really smashed up

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.040
and sort of powderized.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.000
So we're going to break a bunch
of this dry ice up,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.040
and we're going to keep a bunch
of large size lumps,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.960
and then I think we're going
to need a hot tub.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.720
So I'm just going to go
ahead and put some in a bag,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.060
so I can smash it with a hammer!

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:06.680
[Music]

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.680
Rubber gloves may not have
been the best choice.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:28.420
[Music]

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.300
We've got 100 pounds
of crushed up dry ice.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.140
I think at this point,
we need a hot tub.

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:34.742
We should be in a hot tub.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:35.899
Hey internet.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.860
Guess what?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.691
For the next two weeks,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.500
we're having a sweet sale
on t-shirts, both this one,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.960
and the "Look Mom,
No hands" for only $19.99.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.760
What are you doing?

00:01:45.764 --> 00:01:46.922
Selling T-shirts.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.480
I have to go.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.700
Click the link
in the description below.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.640
Guys, we are going
to take our mics off now,

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:57.844
so the sound will get
a little bit different.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:01:59.520
We-- Our mics aren't waterproof,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.720
and we don't want
to ruin our equipment.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:03.300
So we're just going to be using
the mic attached to the camera.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.880
Okay, we've got
100 pounds of dry ice.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.192
We've divided it up
into three buckets.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.131
Cali's going to take one.

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.020
I'm going to take one,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.000
and my friend Keith here
is going to help as well.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.832
Keith will be pouring
dry ice in.

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.450
We should be pouring
a hundred-pound--

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.014
Probably a little
more than a hundred pounds,

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.088
because they're not super
accurate when they're weighing

00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:17.900
at the grocery stores.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.250
It's probably more
like 11/10, 1/15,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.122
something like that.

00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:23.240
But all off this dry ice
are gonna get poured in at once.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.400
I'm hoping for a giant cloud.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.080
Are you?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.080
Yes.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.840
Okay.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.115
I mean, we're going
to just then be in the cloud,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.540
and hopefully, not asphyxiate,
but it's fine.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.650
I can hold my breath.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.520
All right, who's counting?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.060
Ready?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.920
3, 2,1.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.700
That's so amazing.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.520
Oh no.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.760
Oh, that broke.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.920
Oh no! Oh, it's burning my feet.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.980
Don't stand on it.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.479
No, it's burning
my feet you guys.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.880
Oh, it's like moving
around in there.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.380
Yeah.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:23.540
[Music]

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.200
No, no, no.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.580
It's like boiling
out everywhere.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.240
Oh, my foot.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.860
What?

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.480
Guys, this is insane.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.480
Should we pour in some
liquid nitrogen while we're at it?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.520
Oh yeah.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.240
This is like the bubble feature
without the bubbles.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.200
Dry ice, it hurts.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.464
This was only up
to my thighs before.

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:02.040
I'm soaked from the waist down.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.780
It's like floating up
and then sinking again.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.940
I got one.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.280
Pass it.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.680
I threw it on the ground.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.840
I just want everyone to know

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.732
that I forgot to bring
a second pair of pants.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm driving home like this.

00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:25.742
Carbon dioxide is cool,

00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:27.342
but since we're
pouring stuff in,

00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:29.600
we're gonna pour in some liquid
nitrogen along with it.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.400
I don't like it.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.300
I don't want it.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.140
I don't wanna.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.220
Too bad.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.360
That cooled the water
down significantly.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.340
It is no longer a hot tub.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.820
I'm going to regret this.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.020
You cannot breathe in there.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.700
Oh no.

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:01.940
Not with that attitude.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.720
Oh, hey!
I found a camera.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.822
It was over here.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.280
That's gonna be a fun video.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.180
I'm just gonna throw
it back down in there.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:17.957
Yep.

00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:19.192
Let it do it's thing.

00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:23.140
Time to vote, who wins
the wet t-shirt contest?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.756
Mine's wetter, I win.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.000
I found the GoPro again.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.320
Let's get this shot.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.940
Where are you?

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:36.150
It's like a submarine.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.760
It's like at a Star Wars.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.560
Oh, yeah.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.340
R2D2 and it's Mom.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.480
Yeah, R2D2 and it's Mom.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.220
If you've ever opened up
like a really big bottle,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.360
or a really fizzy 2 liter soda,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.260
and just like put your nose
right over the bottle

00:05:58.262 --> 00:05:59.050
and breathe in.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.922
Don't breathe.

00:05:59.922 --> 00:06:00.722
Just--

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:02.540
It's smells like
kind of like that,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.060
but like times a thousand.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.560
This is no longer a hot tub.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.160
It says it's down 96,
that's 8 degrees cooler.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.212
I think it's actually
colder than that.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.720
In case anyone wondering,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.140
this will also be
my audition reel

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:17.672
for the Little Mermaid.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.180
[Music]

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.363
Okay, I don't recommend this,

00:06:26.363 --> 00:06:29.180
but holding it under the water
makes it easier to hold.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.920
That's amazing.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960
This is actually
interesting how quickly,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.140
we've now gone through almost
all that dry ice.

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:45.572
We've kind of been tossing it
into this corner over here,

00:06:45.952 --> 00:06:49.662
and this handful represents
about 90% of what's left.

00:06:49.662 --> 00:06:52.002
You can actually
hear the bubbles.

00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:54.752
Including the GoPro,
which is not dry ice.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.840
The shocking part is yes,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.520
the water temperature
has lowered significantly,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.520
but it's still pretty warm,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.050
and we dumped 100 pounds
of dry ice and liquid nitrogen

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.468
in here with us.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.900
So, not bad.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.960
Oh wait, there's...

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.060
Look at these
little tiny survivors.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.120
The ones floating on the hood?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.620
Yeah.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.300
Oh hey!

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:18.382
Another GoPro.

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:45.460
[Music]

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.880
It's carbonated!

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.220
A little bit,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.800
and as it's gross,
there's people sit in this.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.340
So we put dry ice in our gloves.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.080
With some water.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:08.340
[Music]

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.780
It's really cool.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:09:34.680
[Music]

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.392
Guys, this has been awesome.

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:38.012
Are there any other experiments

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:40.050
that you want to see
us do with dry ice,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.280
or a hot tub?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240
Guys, that's it for today,
but the fun doesn't end here.

We've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:47.898
That box at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:09:47.898 --> 00:09:48.883
You should go check that out.

00:09:48.883 --> 00:09:50.128
The other box
is going to show you

00:09:50.128 --> 00:09:51.839
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.673
This bomb in the middle
will subscribe to our channel,

00:09:53.673 --> 00:09:55.071
that way, you'll never miss
out on the fun.

00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:56.153
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:57.306
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:58.160
Talk to you then.
