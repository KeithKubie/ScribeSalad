&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Well, good afternoon.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.250
Thank you for joining us here in Mountain
View and elsewhere on the VCs and, and for

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.180
the audience who will eventually see on, on
YouTube as well.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.879
Very pleased to have Lewis Lapham with us
today.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.730
Let me share a couple of thoughts as we get
into this conversation.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.170
Personally, as a, as a, as a technologist
for some 30 years now, I've long been fascinated

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.170
not only by the technological, the impact
of the technological change on media, but

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.840
also by our own inclination to believe that
our times are entirely unique.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.690
And of course to some degree our times are
unique.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.720
But that's not only the case.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.960
Often there are common themes across time
that are fascinating and often extremely informative.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.489
In reading Future, the magazine that you have
in front of you this weekend, I was amused

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.809
for instance by Plato's conveyance of, of
Socrates' view that the invention of writing

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.159
was not a great potion for remembering, that
the marketers of the day were saying it was,

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.720
but a tool that would introduce forgetfulness
into the souls of those who learn it; a tool

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.860
that would provide students with the appearance
of wisdom, but not with its reality.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.640
Or how, for instance, the Swiss scientist,
Konrad Gessner, raised the alarm about the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.900
effects of information overload and its confusing
and harmful effects on the mind.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.850
The interesting thing was that was in 1565
and his warnings refer to the flood of information

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.340
unleashed by the printing press, common themes.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.220
Today we grapple with how the internet has
disrupted the business models of print publications,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.810
but forget for instance that the period of
great near-monopolistic success of newspapers

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.579
was really limited to a 40-year period and
triggered largely by the introduction of television

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.579
and the subsequent winnowing of three to four
newspaper towns down to one.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.450
It's for those reasons that, that I find the
editorial model of Lapham's Quarterly to be

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.310
so fascinating.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.450
Because it looks at a single issue, a single
theme, a single subject, and exposes how that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.970
subject was considered across time.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.140
So if you read this issue of, of, about the
future, you will read Plato, you'll read Roy,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.739
Ray Kurzweil, you'd read Gandhi, you read
Philip K. Dick.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.430
So let's talk to Lewis Lapham.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.060
It's not an overstatement to call the gentleman
at my right here a legend in American literature

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.880
and journalism.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.460
His leadership of Harper's Magazine for nearly
30 years and guided it through its richest

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.959
period of analysis of our politics and our
culture.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.840
Beyond his editorial leadership, I think it's
important to note that Lewis is a profoundly

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.910
talented writer and anyone who simply reads
the introduction to this issue will see that

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.150
quite clearly, and a keen observer of our
life, our times, and the ideas that evolve

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.780
within that.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.940
As Bill Moyers put it, "Lewis Lapham speaks
the truth to power and wealth in each issue

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.239
of America's oldest political journal in the
essays he writes, in the articles he publishes,

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.290
he opens the veins on issues like class, power
and politics."

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.980
So thank you very much, Lewis, for joining
us today.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.662
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Thank you, Richard.

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:39.662
[applause]

00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:40.662
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Thank you for that handsome
introduction.

00:03:40.662 --> 00:03:44.629
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Well, I only speak the
truth, Lewis.

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.739
So why don't we start actually, given Lapham's
Quarterly.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.510
What was your inspiration for starting it
in the first place?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.680
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well I started out in life
wanting to become an historian and I went

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.470
to graduate school for one year at Cambridge
University in England after I graduated from

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.209
Yale and found out very quickly that I was
not cut out to be a scholar.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.730
I didn't have the patience for footnotes.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:22.389
I had a passion for history and I would listen
to stories about everything and anything.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.619
Talleyrand's mistresses, Kaiser Wilhelm's
uniforms, giant ants standing watch over the

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:36.979
treasure of Peru, the Carthaginian wars, but
I, I was not a true scholar, so I became a

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:37.990
journalist.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.259
And I came to San Francisco, where I was born
and raised in San Francisco, and, and nearby

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:53.080
here in Menlo Park, and the, went to work
as a newspaper reporter in 1957 for the San

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.979
Francisco Examiner and then gradually went
to the New York Herald Tribune, went from

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:07.169
the newspaper to the magazine, the Saturday
Evening Post and Life, and then to Harper's

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:15.389
Magazine in the 70s and so I'm old enough
to have seen a number of severe changes.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:23.830
I mean when I first came to New York in 1960,
there were seven newspapers in the city.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:34.520
And the Life and the Saturday Evening Post
were the major media of the 60s.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.789
But by the end of the 60s they'd been supplanted
by television and so I was there both for

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.449
the collapse of the Saturday Evening Post
and the collapse of Life magazine.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.849
And now you see the kind of what and then
there's the introduction into the New York

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:06.460
Times in the 1970s of the op-ed page, so that
what in the 1950s would have been a 5,000

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:14.520
word article by say the Secretary of War or
an aspiring president of the United States

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.929
to be published in Harper's Magazine or the
Atlantic by the end of the 1970s that had

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:31.449
become a 750-word op-ed page piece in the
Times or in the Wall Street Journal.

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:38.229
And then of course you, you, you get the,
the arrival of the internet in the 1980s and

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:48.539
you see the recasting not only of the newspapers,
but also of network television so that the

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:58.669
forms are continually evolving and I'm again
old enough to have seen a number of those

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:09.619
changes and so I'm not either horrified or
surprised by the move to the internet.

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:17.139
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: And so what led you recently
to, to creating Lapham's Quarterly?

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.379
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, I'd, I'd been the editor
of Harper's Magazine for 30 years and I found

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:35.559
that journalism can only take you so far,
and that good long form journalism is, is

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:37.349
hard to come by.

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:43.119
There are people that can do it well and they
are rare and precious talents, but there are

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:51.119
not that many of them, and I also noticed
that a lot of journalism was beginning to

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:58.159
repeat itself and also in the 80s it became
much more politicized.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:05.619
You were either for us or against us, you
were either writing for a neo-conservative

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:13.349
journal or for a liberal journal and they
weren't really talking to each other.

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:20.860
When I first became the editor of Harper's
Magazine in the 70s, I could manage to put

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.610
somebody like Irving Kristol and Michael Harrington
in the same issue.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:36.370
I then believed in something called the marketplace
of ideas, but during the 1980s with the election

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:46.800
of Reagan, the, and what were then known as
the culture wars, journalism became more polemical

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.449
and it, you began to see the rise of people
like Rush Limbaugh, who makes an appearance

00:08:53.449 --> 00:09:02.209
I think in the 1980, 1983 with the change
of ruling by the FCC.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:12.209
And so I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied
with journalism, at least as I under, I'm

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:17.870
talking about monthly long form journalism
with literary pretentions.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:25.829
[laughing] I'm not, I'm not talking about
news clips or, or headlines and I found that

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:31.890
I was reading, more and more I was reading
history, because I was finding in the reading

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:46.310
of history a, a, a substance, a form of narrative
that I could and less opinion.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:54.970
In other words, so much of journalism was
turning into talking head opinion and it was

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:02.689
a ques, and I was more interested in what
do we know as opposed to what do we think?

00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:11.190
And I was finding the answers to that kind
of question in, in works of history.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:19.779
And I also was getting older and when you
are the editor of Harper's Magazine, what

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:26.970
you would do is you would take 15 manuscripts
home at night and hope to God you could turn

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:33.250
at least one or two of them into something
worth reading.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:45.060
And I didn't want to spend my time reading
so many badly-written manuscripts and I figured,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:56.459
here, I wanted to re-read the Thucydides or
Gibbon or Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac and

00:10:56.459 --> 00:11:08.019
get back to the works that had survived the
wreckage of time and the winnowing of bad

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:17.319
translation by reason of the force of expression
and the, and the power of imagination, so.

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:23.040
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: So with regard to this
issue, which people have before them right

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.470
now on the future, were there specific messages
that you had in mind as you assembled that?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.470
Did you know-

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.470
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: No.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.470
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: when you went into it?

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.279
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, I, I just knew that
it was a, I, this quarterly has been going

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:41.439
on for about, it's been going on for four
years, this is the last of volume 4.

00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:45.470
And what we do is we take a topic that's more
or less in the news.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:53.259
In other words, in the spring we, we did one
on work, 'cause the question of unemployment

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:57.550
was in the headlines.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:06.160
Last summer we did one on food, because food
is a page one story in many different ways,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.940
in terms of the world's natural resources,
in terms of environment, in terms of rising

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.170
population as well as in terms of the aesthetics
of, of fine dining.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:25.129
And we've, we've done issues on medicine and
on money and on war.

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:34.210
And so I, I try to find a subject that is,
has some purchase in the current conversation,

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:41.089
and at the moment, at least in the United
States, there is a good deal of concern about

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:42.089
the future.

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:51.120
It is not what it used to be, and so this
is an approach to the idea of the future over

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.769
time as it, as existed.

00:12:53.769 --> 00:13:08.290
I mean you can actually look at the future,
you can think of the future as America's first

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.920
and best natural resource.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:22.839
I mean it's, the future is what moves the
merchandise in or you know I will happy birthday

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:27.999
at every point of sale, I will be a new man
or a new woman.

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:34.139
And so that when you're buying the car or
where you're buying the eyebrow pencil, you're

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:36.120
in a way, buying the future.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.890
I mean it's the, it's the, it's the advertising
business.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:47.589
And much of our consumer society is founded
on the advertising.

00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:53.040
So there's that kind of future and then there's
also the dark and apocalyptic future, which

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:06.420
is the one that is used by sometimes the state
at other times by the church to keep the population

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.420
in line.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:13.339
In other words, it was the great source of
power for the Vatican or for the Christian

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:30.050
church through most of its 2000 years, the
fear, the fear, the fear of hell, you know.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:44.129
And it's also what keeps the money coming
to our military defense complex.

00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:55.920
The fear of Russians or the fear of Al-Qaeda
or terrorists behind every bush, and so on,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:07.220
is what, you know, bids up the prices of the
weapons industries and we have now the market

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:17.459
in fear essentially was what was the was the
main product being sold by the Bush administration

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:20.269
for eight, eight years.

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:28.199
And we now have something like 840,000 people
working for the National Security Agency,

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:37.639
and they are the landest, the largest landholder
in Virginia by far, although most of the facilities

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.040
are underground.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:47.420
[laughing] But the, so yeah, I mean the either
the hope of the future or the fear of the

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:56.540
future are what drives both the America's
politics and its economy.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.499
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: I'd like to, let's, let's
go a little bit deeper on that.

00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:06.069
I was, I won't quote the whole thing because
you just touched on it here, but, but clearly

00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:13.050
post 9/11 as, as you point out, we've, we've,
we've seen the loss of our utopian romance,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:18.500
our, our sense of the positive future, which
is important because it's our perception of

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.440
the future that really affects what we do
in the present in many regards.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.600
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, it's the perception
of the future that is in fact the stock market.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.720
Because when you're buying stock you're buying
the future.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.759
Ninety-seven percent of the dollars in circulation
are invested in the future.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:42.369
I mean that's, that's what you're buying.

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:44.740
I don't mean to interrupt, I just mean to
confirm your point.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.740
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Yes.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.740
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Okay.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.209
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Yes, yes and so given that
and given that we've the American psyche was

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:58.249
always about hope, was always about the, the,
the quest to the future, ambition, we could

00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:03.930
all do something better, and that has deteriorated
substantially if not nearly completely in

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.549
the last decade with the exception of maybe
pockets of innovation.

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:10.300
How do we, how do we switch that?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:16.490
Is there a, any guidance on how we move our
perception in that regard?

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.490
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, it, it, it changes.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:23.760
I mean, I mean, you're right, I mean the idea
of America is, is a brave new world and Thomas

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:33.650
Paine is talks actually says "America is the
birthday of a new world, full of life, liberty

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.060
and the pursuit of happiness."

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.370
Those are the promises.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:46.159
And that's the premise of the constitution,
it's all, the constitution is a tool with

00:17:46.159 --> 00:17:59.899
which to plow the ground of one's own invention
of one's self or acquiring of property or

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:01.730
making something of one's self.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:09.799
I mean, I mean these are the freedoms granted
by the constitution and it's in certainly

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:12.149
in the thought of Jefferson.

00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:19.700
We, but again, the future has changed shape
over, over time.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.090
I can remember when the future was rosy and,
and, and bright.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:36.080
I, I, I, [pause] I, I, I can remember the,
the Kennedy administration.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.110
I can remember the election of, of, of John
Kennedy in 1960, a brave new world, a new

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:50.120
frontier, men on their way to the moon, the
young Kennedy appeared in the guise of the

00:18:50.120 --> 00:19:00.570
young Prince Hal inheriting the kingdom from
the aged Uncle Eisenhower and again a sense

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:08.730
of youthful hope and expectation.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:18.210
And then of course you have and you have the
assassination of Kennedy and that leads to

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:33.370
some of the what follows from that or among
the things that follow are the argument about

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:45.039
the Vietnam war, the reappraisal of the American
government as a tyrannical, lying establishment.

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:54.080
You know you get, you get the on one hand
in the 60s you have you have various visions

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.150
of the futures in the 60s.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.520
You have the flower people and the and Woodstock
and the summer of love, and then on the other

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:11.870
hand you have the Chicago Convention of 1968,
the assassination not only of Jack Kennedy,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.260
but also his brother and of Martin Luther
King.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.940
You have the complete transformation of the
Beatles.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:31.010
[laughing] I was, I spent the, let me see
get the year right, yeah the fall, I'm sorry,

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.669
the early winter of 1968 in Rishikesh with
the Beatles.

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:43.100
And the Beatles had just come from the summer
of love in the states and '68 is the here

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:50.881
they are in Rishikesh talking to the Maharishi
and it's the same, at the same time as the

00:20:50.881 --> 00:20:58.570
Tet Offensive that is taking place in Vietnam
where it becomes clear that we have lost the

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.570
war.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:06.220
And then followed in that spring of '68 by
the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and, and

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:16.260
Martin Luther King and then the Chicago riots
in the summer of '68 and the you can see the

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.059
turn in, in, in the Beatles' music.

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:31.520
The music that of you know prior to '68 tends
to be have a happy, lilting, hopeful tone

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.590
and after '68 it begins, the Beatles break
up very soon after that and the music begins

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:47.110
to turn interior, and ambiguity and melancholy.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:56.640
There was a very dismal view of the future
at the end of the Nixon administration.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:04.220
Not only do you have the Vietnam War and the
violence of the civil rights movement, but

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:18.519
you also had the Watergate, you had the revelations
of America's treachery abroad under the guidance

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:22.929
of the CIA in Chile and elsewhere.

00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:29.169
And you get a period where the interest rate
by the end of the 1970s, the interest rate

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:34.480
has gone up to whatever, 18%.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:41.000
Gold is selling for even more money than it's
selling today and there's a feeling of gloom,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:52.080
which is encapsulated in Carter, who just
talking about American malaise and there's

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.970
this feeling of depression and then you have
that followed by the new morning in American

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.169
brought by Ronald Reagan from sunny California.

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:09.299
So yeah, the idea of the future is a work
in progress and it changes and it is of course

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.559
exactly what drives the stock market.

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:20.130
The stock market is simply a, it, it, about
the values of hope and fear.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:28.820
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: That's an interesting and
keen observation.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.899
I think again we tend to forget that I think
that part of what I take out of that is in

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:38.330
a sense our, our, our views of the future
have typically been more pessimistic than

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.330
optimistic.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.900
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, you know, yeah in our,
in our recent history, yes.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.900
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Yeah.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.919
I'd like to take and, and, and torque this
a bit and, and given your decades of experience

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:55.200
in media and, and your first hand witnessing
of media transformation in various instances,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:02.860
and, and certainly I have to believe your
longer term study of the evolution of media,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.960
certainly we want to talk about the internet.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.169
But before we even go there, I'd be interested
in your insights as to how journalism itself

00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:16.130
has transformed over time in approach, in
tone.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:23.290
For instance today we decry and for good reason
how much of today's mass media landscape is,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:30.590
is, is so tawdry, but forget that journalism,
though that term wasn't really used then in

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:36.990
the time of Jefferson, was not exactly a paragon
of, of, of truth, ideas and wisdom.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.280
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Far from it.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:46.820
The journalism as we know it, at least as
far as I, if I got the story straight, starts

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:53.280
with the Fugger Newsletters in the 16th century
in Augsburg, Germany.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:03.039
The Fugger Bank was the biggest and most powerful
bank in medieval Germany and it starts as

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:13.930
newsletters from agents in various parts of
the world: letters from Peru about the mines;

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.700
letters from Egypt about cotton.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.510
It's all about trade and it's all about money.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:26.539
That's the first birth of journalism.

00:25:26.539 --> 00:25:36.600
And it is today a, which is one of the reasons
why today the probably the biggest and largest

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.550
and most successful news organization in New
York is Bloomberg.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:48.201
Bloomberg is hiring foreign correspondents,
they have 2600 foreign correspondents, all

00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:51.549
of them reporting on markets.

00:25:51.549 --> 00:26:02.519
I mean if you want to know what real estate
costs 42 miles southeast of Sophia, Bloomberg

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:04.289
will tell you.

00:26:04.289 --> 00:26:12.440
And so there is and that is journalism at
its roots.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440
That's the root of it.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.950
It's also the root of the early journalism
in America.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:26.289
You have a few newspapers, you're talking
about Jefferson and Adams and the Alien and

00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:33.809
Sedition Act in the newspapers of the 1890s
and they are violently partisan.

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:41.889
Accusation, the accusations that are being
leveled by the Federalist's papers at Jefferson

00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:49.570
and by the Republican papers at Adams are
would today be considered scandalous and outrageous

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.570
beyond belief.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:57.720
I mean, I mean all of the writers would be
sent home to wash out their mouths with soap.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:05.270
[laughing] There was nothing they wouldn't
accuse each other of, and, but the, then in

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:14.950
the, in the, in the, those were newspapers
of limited circulation and with a specifically

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.940
political purpose.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.350
The major newspapers, I can't remember the
names of them, but they were for the merchants.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:30.040
They were the kinds of things, enormous broad
sheets as long as four feet across and six

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:37.630
feet long, which would be spread out on coffeehouse
tables in the ports of Boston, New York and

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.820
Charleston and again, it's all about trade.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.850
It's about which ships are arriving, which
ships are departing, what cargoes are being

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:52.640
sold, what land is being advertised and so
on.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:01.230
Then in the 1830s you begin to get the sensationalist
press, the New York Sun comes on and sells

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:08.639
for a penny, where the established merchant
press sold for five or ten cents.

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:10.010
And these are fabulous stories.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:15.610
I mean they're about scandal, they're about
murders in Five Points in the City of New

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:26.639
York, they're about, you know, it's what Henry
Luce in his memos setting up Time magazine

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:35.419
in 1920 sent a memo to the staff explaining
what Time magazine was about and what it was

00:28:35.419 --> 00:28:41.559
about according to Henry Luce was, I quote,
"sex and gru."

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:50.030
By gru he meant gruesome, you know, murder,
train wrecks, kind of along the lines of the

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.179
New York Post today.

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:59.090
So the journalism has always played to the
crowd, I mean, and it's played to a market

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.610
and it deals in sensation.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:12.880
And the people who say, well, why is the press
so filled with bad news, why can't they give

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.080
us some good news?

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:21.490
And the point, that kind of criticism misses
the point, because the good news is the advertising.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.490
[laughter]

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:30.179
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: The, the, the bad news is
the suckering the, the customers into the

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:41.750
tent so that they can then, you know, in the
first whatever, the top of the hour on the

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:49.930
news is the body bags in Brooklyn and the
terrorists in Libya and the forest fires in

00:29:49.930 --> 00:30:01.909
California, and then when you're thoroughly
frightened or then comes on the smiling advertiser.

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:07.850
Obey the law, pay your taxes, and you get
to go to the Virgin Islands on the American

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.130
Express card.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.700
And that's the good news and that's what the
press does.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:19.730
I mean the press you know hustles the bad
news in order to sell the ads.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:23.860
I mean it's, I don't know if you know the
way a newspaper is made up, but a newspaper

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:28.169
is made up, first, the first thing are the
ads.

00:30:28.169 --> 00:30:32.210
I mean you get a, this was true when I was
working for the San Francisco Examiner and

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.429
again when I was working for the New York
Herald Tribune.

00:30:35.429 --> 00:30:44.160
I mean you get the dummy comes up and all
the ad space is blocked out and the how many

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.919
ads have been sold tell you how much copy
you can put in.

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:58.090
I mean the news is, is secondary, subject
to the advertising.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:06.549
And again what a newspaper is selling, mostly
it's selling itself in its traditional form,

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:12.341
it's not selling itself as a source of information,
it's selling itself as a billboard, that's

00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:22.019
its, that's its product and that's where it
makes its money, from the advertising.

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:28.820
So again, the, it's subject to a market force
and always has been.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.820
[cough]

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.580
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: I want to make sure we
have time for questions, but there's at least

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:41.789
one more I want to get in before we do that
and it's an area that I find particularly

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:44.850
interesting in studying the evolution of media.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:50.259
It seems that with the introduction of new
media technologies, whether one is talking

00:31:50.259 --> 00:31:55.930
about the printing press, or radio, or television,
or the internet itself for that matter, there's

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:04.080
typically a longer lag before the form and
style of the media itself change, understandably.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.110
Radio news, for instance, began with announcers
reading the newspaper to their audiences before

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:14.100
they recognized that a better, a different
writing style, crisper and so on, was more

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.549
appropriate for that form and so on and so
forth.

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:25.970
As much as I appreciate long form narrative
journalism, we know from analyses of audiences

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:32.360
and reading habits and so on that people today
have far less patience and are far less inclined

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.620
to go to that full length of that 3000 word
article.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:44.289
I ask you this question because in your history
you, among your achievements have been interesting

00:32:44.289 --> 00:32:46.059
innovations in form.

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:50.830
When you returned to Harper's in the 80s,
one of your big innovations there was the

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:56.980
Harper's Index, which for those of you don't
know it was basically this crisp, bullet pointed

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.120
list of statistical observations.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:07.400
There was both knowledge and observation in
those very simple statements.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.830
So do you have any ideas or see opportunities
in the evolution of the forms we use to convey

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.299
complex ideas?

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:17.201
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Yes, I do.

00:33:17.201 --> 00:33:20.110
I see a lot of room for that.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.909
I mean I, it was the Harper's Index that,
those of you are familiar with it, but I also

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:32.370
did something called Harper's Readings, which
was like, they were short form things, excerpts

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:41.340
taken from longer passages and from obscure
places from minor journalism, journals or

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:52.019
from foreign newspapers and usually or from
court transcripts or from legal memoranda

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:53.330
of various kinds.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:34:01.980
I mean they were found objects and presented
in many of the, in much of the same way that

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.330
quite a few of the blogs are now presented
on the internet.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.770
This was before the internet actually.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:16.260
This was 1983 and the, and then we also had
a form called the Annotation, where we would

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:27.380
take a document, whether it was a hospital
bill or a writ of execution and then spread

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:39.740
it out on, on two pages and then with annotation,
draw out the meaning behind the language or

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.450
what the point was and so forth.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:51.790
And again, the form is constantly evolving
and changing.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:35:04.130
I and I think this is true not only with the,
with print, but also with what can be done

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.630
online, also what can be done with film or
documentary.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:17.580
I mean I have a great fondness for documentary
film and I, but I think it can be further

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.870
developed and become more of an art form.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:32.150
The moveable type is invented in 1450 more
or less and for the first 50-60 years, the

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:40.600
reaction from the humanists in Italy and elsewhere
in Europe is one of horror.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:48.350
It, its, as Richard said at the beginning
of this conversation that the horror expressed

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:57.420
by the established authorities has a way of
sounding the same across time.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:06.010
I mean he was, you were mentioning somebody
from 1565 and then much of that is true.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:12.030
Much of it of what was being said you know
with the new type was worthless.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:19.930
But that's also true of much of what now gets
posted on the internet.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:27.380
The, your writing for, it's a, much of it
is disposable.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:34.920
It's language that is meant to be used as
disposable, I mean, you know, it's a customer,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.240
I mean it's a consumer good, it's like Kleenex.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.480
Ok, but, but that's always been true.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:55.141
And it takes, I mean if you go back and read
the, the list of books that get, I forget

00:36:55.141 --> 00:37:00.260
what the major prizes are, the Pulitzer Prize
and so forth, if you go back and look at the

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:05.450
history of those books for fiction over the
last hundred years, you'll be appalled at

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.150
how many of them are so bad.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:13.821
The, the, but we, they weren't thought of
as bad at the time, but they're seen as, they

00:37:13.821 --> 00:37:20.500
don't survive because their, the strength
of their thought or expression is not sufficient

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:34.270
to survive the, the test of time so that we
have a different look at them from our perspective.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:41.770
But the, I'm losing my train of, but no, its,
so you have the moveable type comes in the

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:50.060
late 15th century, but it's another hundred
years before you get to Cervantes, Shakespeare

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:56.270
and Montaigne, all of whom are more or less
contemporary at the end of the 16th century,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:14.650
who have found a way to use the new tool and,
and, and bring to it art and high form of

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:25.260
expression and I assume that we will be doing
the same kind of thing with whatever language

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:32.400
evolves out of the, out of the technology
that we now have with the internet.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:40.310
I mean obviously they'll be a drive toward
compression, it, something in the direction,

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:48.611
it'll take twitlet, if you can elevate Twitter
to the, to the form of a Japanese haiku, that's

00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:55.860
the kind of thing that, that, or you'll see
it if you're familiar with the Hermann Hesse's

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:02.540
book, The Glass Bead Game, you, you will see
again, a, a, that's like writing a computer

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:16.140
program with not only philosophical ideas,
but also with musical phrase and poetic metaphor.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:29.880
I mean I would think that anybody at Google
would find an extraordinary groping toward

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.980
some of the same kind of thinking in Hesse's
book.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.590
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: I'm gonna ask for questions
if someone would like to approach the mic.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.590
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: [coughing]

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:46.360
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: I mean to that last point
while someone, while we, while we hunt for

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.100
a questioner, if not I'll jump in with one.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.710
But it's interesting that whenever there's
a new medium that allows the propagation of

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:59.700
more information, the first concern is that
that's just gonna yield more junk.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:04.010
And of course that's true, but it also seems
true that the wheat to chaff ratios over time

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.210
stay about the same.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.930
So with the internet, no question, there's
hugely more chaff, but there's also a lot

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:09.930
more wheat.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.970
It might take a little bit more time to find
it, but it's there.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:13.970
Hugh?

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:17.200
&gt;&gt;male #1/Hugh: Thank you.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:26.190
These days most major publications live in
a bifurcated state, with an online edition

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.340
and a print edition.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.870
Lapham's Quarterly maintains a website.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:40.620
I was wondering how you think of the two as
separate entities, and more generally, where,

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.400
where you see this strange bifurcation going?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:52.030
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Well, we, we, our website
is not a replication of, of, of the, the journal.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.080
It, it's its own thing.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:08.870
It's an allied endeavor in a different form
and there are things we can do on the internet

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:16.970
with juxtaposition, with, we have a one of
the departments is something called déjà

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:26.310
vu, so we will take a news story off you know
within the last month or so either a news

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:37.420
story or photograph and then match it to something
remarkably close from 300, 500, 1000 years

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:45.610
ago and we have set it up as a dissolve, so
that you have the, the first thing you see

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:53.280
is the current image or the current story
and then it dissolves into the, into the historical

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.050
record.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:06.310
We also find it is a way of using, of, of,
of getting contributions from interested readers

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:12.030
who will send further texts and, and, and
supplements.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:22.280
We're also using it as an audio source and
the not only interviews with some writers

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:32.000
and, and historians, but also a way of getting
at the sound archive.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.620
We have a, in the United States both at the
Smithsonian and the University of Michigan

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:48.360
very voluminous sound archives, so the idea
would be if in the issue itself we have a

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.260
speech by Teddy Roosevelt, on the website
you'd, you could hear it.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.270
And the, there are amazing things that can
be done with that, we haven't developed that

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:08.050
yet to the fullest possibility and there's
also the other way of I'm hoping to use it

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.690
for documentary film.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:17.530
The, I made a documentary film a couple of
years ago then it was up for a prize in Amsterdam

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:25.870
and I went to the Amsterdam International
Documentary Film Festival and I stayed in

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:34.030
Amsterdam for three or four days and I was
astonished to see how much documentary film

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:40.850
there is being made all over the world, I
mean, you know, by people in not only Saudi

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:46.940
Arabia and Mongolia, but also in Indonesia
as well as in Russia and the Balkans and so

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:55.520
on and none of this really makes it on to
American TV, because there's no market.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:05.570
The, the BBC will take maybe 50 of these films
a year for distribution in England, but our,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:13.350
at least at the moment our television, PBS,
Bravo and so on, History Channel, are not

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.630
interested in politics.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:25.280
I mean it's ok, polar bears and [laughing]
you know, disappearing ice, but they don't

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.730
want us to see the political story or the
historical story and some of this, a lot of

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:35.920
this again is not very good, but that's true
of anything.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.940
It's not only true of, I mean there's not
only a lot of junk in the newspa, on the internet,

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.740
there's a lot of junk in the bookstores.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.670
There's a lot of junk.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:53.230
I mean the world is full of junk, but, but
the, but it's also there is you know the,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:45:03.060
there's gold, too, and the, and the idea is
to, and the gold usually takes time to appreciate

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:12.780
it or to it takes engagement on the part of
the reader.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:22.810
In other words, the work of art to me is the
engagement between the, the artist and the

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:33.210
beholder and if they're, and you get a moment
in time really where the person looking at

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:41.450
the painting or the person reading the poem
or the novel or the philosophy tract, is in

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:51.350
the same space at the same, [pause] I don't
know what you call it, the same cloud maybe

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:59.520
as, as, as the person who painted the painting
or the author who wrote the book.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:18.170
And it is in that joining of human energy
that is the reason that great art survives.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.910
I mean it's, it's miraculous.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:27.220
And it can happen, I mean it can happen off
any kind of a platform.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:33.280
But each platform, I would think, would have
a different, something of a different medium.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:43.290
I can remember coming to New York in 1960
and there were, it was clearly distinct literature

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:55.870
and theater, dance, music, jazz, they were
called in those days the seven lively arts

00:46:55.870 --> 00:47:01.600
and they had different audiences, they were
different disciplines, they required different

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.520
kinds of skills.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:13.830
And they were each, they were all valued within
their own terms.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.771
By the end of the 60s you have something called
media.

00:47:17.771 --> 00:47:24.730
Media is the word that comes out of Marshall
McLuhan and Understanding Media in 1964.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:33.800
And by the end of the decade the seven lively
arts had been kind of fused into an amalgam

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:45.400
called media, which is something else, so
that [cough] again it's constantly in flux.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:52.050
I'll tell you another difficulty with media,
I mean I did a film once that was a history

00:47:52.050 --> 00:48:00.600
of American foreign policy in the, in the
20th century and I got to write it as well

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:08.310
as to walk around Hanoi and talk it, but the,
you come up against this kind of problem,

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:14.960
you come up against, I was given either, I
can't remember whether it was 73 words in

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:25.970
42 seconds or 42 words in 73 seconds in which
to explain the origin of World War II.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:34.660
And the voice over had to connect the still
footage of the Munich conference in, in, in

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:48.900
1938 with the news footage of the German Stukas
bombing Warsaw in 1939 and there you see,

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.320
that's a problem in form.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.970
I'm not saying it can't be done.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.910
I don't think it, I did it, but I don't think
I did it very well.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:03.230
But in order to do that well, you have to
evolve a kind of a language that is again

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:11.290
closer to poetry than it is, than it is to
prose and maybe that is certainly the direction

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:17.310
over the last hundred years has been towards
shorter and shorter and shorter.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:25.040
I mean if you go back and read Harper's Magazine
in 1850, everything was 10,000 words and very

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.820
small print and then so that's clearly a direction.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:37.150
Visual is another, you know, but the thing
is there's so much room to experiment and,

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:45.030
and to fool around, I mean it, it is a, I
would think an exciting prospect to try to

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:56.070
invent new forms and within the new form still
have the density and the intensity of something

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.180
worth thinking about.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.420
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Lewis, I, I, I have to
thank you.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:07.600
Your perspectives are both refreshing and
inspiring no matter how difficult some of

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.110
the times might be.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:15.570
I don't know if we have time for a, I think
we don't, as much as I would love to.

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:20.890
I also want to close with definitely go to
that go to link, get your free subscription

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.760
and if you can afford it, buy another subscription
and give it to a friend.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.760
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Yes.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.860
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Forty-nine dollars a year.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.160
It's a great buy.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.360
It's hours of entertainment and knowledge.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.650
I can't imagine a cheaper source of entertainment
and knowledge.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.430
So go buy one.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.430
Now.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.470
But again, I, it's, it's, it's been an absolute
pleasure, indeed an honor

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:42.470
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Richard, thank you.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.930
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: and I look forward to continuing
the conversation.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:45.200
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Thank you very much.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.970
&gt;&gt;Richard Gingras: Thank you.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.290
&gt;&gt;Lewis Lapham: Thanks.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.730
[applause]
