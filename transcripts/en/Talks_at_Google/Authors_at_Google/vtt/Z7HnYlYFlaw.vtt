SUNNI YUEN: Hello,
I'm Sunni Yuen.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.620
I'm a member of Google's
legal department here.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.119
And today we are hosting Helen
Wan, associate general counsel

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.780
from Time Inc. And
Helen is here to talk

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.452
about her new book called
"The Partner Track."

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:18.910
So Helen, if you could give us
a quick summary of your book

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.584
is about.

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:20.250
HELEN WAN: Sure.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.990
So "The Partner
Track" is a novel.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.800
It's decidedly fiction.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.870
It follows the journey of a
young Chinese American woman

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.940
who is climbing the corporate
ladder in corporate America.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.480
It's set at a large law
firm and it basically

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.120
talks about the ways in which
being an outsider, in all

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.419
the things that word
might mean, can impact

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:56.460
the journey of talented
young person on their way

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.830
up the corporate ladder.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.790
SUNNI YUEN: So are law
firm corporate ladders

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.040
different than corporate
corporate ladders?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.570
You've worked at
both, a law firm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.962
and also obviously at Time Inc?

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:08.670
HELEN WAN: Right.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.950
So I'm associate general
counsel at the Time Inc.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.850
division of Time Warner.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.110
And so having worked now
both as an in-house lawyer

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.020
and also as a law
firm attorney, I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.440
do think the two are quite
culturally different.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.760
Just like any corporate
culture is different.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.390
Like, for example,
you guys at Google,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.930
you must know within
the corporate community

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.960
Google is sort of
like the Disneyland

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.050
of the corporate world.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.740
The happiest place
on earth, you know.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.781
And I come here and I see
people are on scooters.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.850
So obviously every
corporate culture is unique.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.780
And I think one of the
messages of my book,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.670
what I was hoping to
convey, is that it's

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.594
so important to land there and
right away learn, figure out

00:01:57.594 --> 00:01:59.260
the corporate culture,
and then identify

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.740
your own place within
it in a way that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.860
can feel authentic and
comfortable to yourself.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.900
SUNNI YUEN: And this is
something your protagonist--

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.580
her name is Ingrid Yung, and
she's been described variously

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.220
throughout the book as
brainy but beautiful,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.110
or beautiful but brainy.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.972
HELEN WAN: Described
by some reviewers.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:22.526
SUNNI YUEN: By reviewers or
other characters in your book.

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:25.860
She's also been described
as a sour-faced fraulein,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.360
based on her name alone.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.830
HELEN WAN: Yes, by
clients in the book.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.557
SUNNI YUEN: How much of
yourself is in this protagonist?

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:36.390
HELEN WAN: I always get
asked this question.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.000
One of the first questions
I get asked at book events

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.130
is how much of the book
is autobiographical.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.770
And the answer to that is I
am an Asian American female

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.870
lawyer.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.480
My first job fresh
out of law school,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.140
as a 25-year-old
out of law school

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.690
was indeed as an M&amp;A associate
at a large corporate law firm.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.340
The firm where I happened
to work was Paul Weiss.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.410
But that's sort of where the
similarities in terms of what

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.290
happens to her career-wise stop
because unlike my protagonist,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.700
I did not stay at the law firm.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.200
I actually left after
just under two years

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.680
to go to an
entertainment law firm.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.900
And then from there I lateraled
in-house to Time Warner.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.510
So my own career path is quite
different than Ingrid's, but I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.630
tried very hard to do the
research necessary to make

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.384
that big law culture as
realistic as possible.

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.300
SUNNI YUEN: And for those
of you who might not

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.430
have had a chance to
read Helen's book yet,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.120
Ingrid Yung is the protagonist.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.540
She has quite a
resume that I think

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.170
we at Google would be
very impressed with.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.830
Played varsity soccer
three semesters

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.150
at Yale, valedictorian,
voted most likely to succeed,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.950
Phi Beta Kappa, Law Review.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.380
And she is certainly
someone who's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.750
not afraid to confront anyone
who challenges or raises

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.610
stereotypes about herself.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.050
Would you say that's something
that you feel very personal

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.434
about, the ability to
confront stereotyping?

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.100
HELEN WAN: I do.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.016
And one thing that I
tried to show in the book

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:18.320
is how when a person in
works in corporate America

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.699
they often, I think,
have one-- it's

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.330
like a split personality a bit.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.365
The person you are
at work, or feel

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.240
that you need to be at
work, and the person

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.510
that you are outside of work.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.380
And there's one
scene, I think one

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.280
that you might be
alluding to, where

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.390
Ingrid reacts to a challenging
offensive situation in a way

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.480
that she absolutely
does not allow herself

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.780
when she is in the kind
of public eye at work.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.840
SUNNI YUEN: Work life
balance, literally, right?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.250
And it's severed right here.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.354
HELEN WAN: Exactly.

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:57.520
SUNNI YUEN: Could you share
something from your book

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.750
just so we could get to
know Ingrid a little?

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.470
HELEN WAN: Sure.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.250
So we were discussing it
might be a nice way to,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.000
before we launch into
our conversation-- I

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.280
do hope it'll be an interactive
conversation-- that we could

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.650
frame it by my just reading
a couple of quick snippets

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.640
from the book.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.014
So actually let me just start
by asking how many people here

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.430
in the audience
have ever attended

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.880
a company outing, like
a firm's summer outing?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.210
OK, it's practically everyone.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.380
And I suspect that a
Google summer outing

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.080
might look quite different
than a corporate law firm

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.140
summer outing, obviously.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.920
SUNNI YUEN: White shoe law firm.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.836
HELEN WAN: Yeah, within
a white shoe law firm.

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:44.930
But all you need to
know to place this scene

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.320
is that it takes
place at the summer

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.110
outing of the fictitious law
firm of Parsons, Valentine,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.890
and Hunt.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.225
And it's taking place at
the Oak Hollow Country Club

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:55.850
in Westchester.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.300
The scene by the pool
was in full swing

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.110
by the time I got down there.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.550
No one was swimming, but a line
had already formed at the bar.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.310
Coolers packed with
ice, Perrier, Gatorade,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.110
and bottled beer were positioned
at convenient intervals

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.330
across the spotless pool deck.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.800
I did what I always did.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.884
Got a club soda
with a wedge of lime

00:06:16.884 --> 00:06:19.300
and then stretched out on a
green and white striped lounge

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.910
chair.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.150
Crossing my ankles demurely,
pasting a smile onto my face,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.987
and trying to look like I
was having a fantastic time.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.820
The sun reflected off
the glittering surface

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.760
of the pool like tiny gemstones.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.390
It felt good on my
face and shoulders

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.440
and I leaned back and closed
my eyes, relaxing a little.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.450
Before long I heard
two loud splashes

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.300
and some high-pitched giggles.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.769
I opened my eyes.

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.810
It was the same group of
chatty summer associates

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.314
I had seen on the bus.

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:46.980
Two of the guys had
already cannonballed

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.470
into the deep end of the pool
while a third, Steinberg, was

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.300
making a beeline
for the open bar.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.040
I put my sunglasses
back on so I could

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.430
watch a little more carefully.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.020
I was curious and more
than a little nostalgic.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.140
There had been 95 of
us in my entering class

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.710
when we'd first started
out, and over a third of us

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.790
had been women.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.110
But now, eight years later,
in corporate it was just me,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.329
Murph, Hunter, and
Tyler left standing.

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:15.120
I was still friends
with a lot of the women

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.890
who had left the
firm over the years,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.080
and I knew that they
all rooted for me.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.640
Every Christmas I received
an enthusiastic chorus

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.630
of messages.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.717
Keep up the good fight.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:25.300
Looking forward to
toasting the firm's

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.220
first female corporate partner.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.990
These messages
typically came scrawled

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.906
on the back of a
holiday photo card

00:07:31.906 --> 00:07:34.280
featuring some impossibly cute
two-year-old in a reindeer

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.040
costume.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.740
As I watched this latest
crop of summer associates

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.540
shrieking and splashing
each other in the pool,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.460
I thought about how much I
missed that easy camaraderie.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.740
That freedom you felt when
you were nowhere near up

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.840
for partner.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.160
The blissful safety in numbers.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.880
It was so much harder to blend
in when there was only one

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.629
of you.

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.170
The one called
Steinberg was back now

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.310
with a large tropical
drink served in a hollowed

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.505
out pineapple.

00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:02.170
Hey, he yelled to
one of the girls.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.460
Why aren't you in the pool yet?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.870
This particular girl-- the
prettiest girl in the group--

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.160
was a tall willowy blonde with
high cheekbones, fair skin,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.570
and a faint spray of freckles
across the bridge of her nose.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.500
Her hair was swept back
into an unfussy French twist

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.360
and secured with a single,
tiny, tortoiseshell pin.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.450
She was wearing a
chic black cover up

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.900
and the white spaghetti
straps of a swimsuit top

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.940
were visibly knotted
together behind her neck.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.539
I knew her name,
Cameron Alexander,

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.169
because Murph and Hunter had
pointed her out many times

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.890
in the summer
associate directory.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.980
Also known among the male
attorneys as the menu.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.820
Cameron had been to Exeter
and was a double Harvard,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.710
both college and law school.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.510
And, according to her firm
bio, did some modeling

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.130
in her spare time.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.210
Runway, not catalog.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.440
Rumor had it she was
also dating a client,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.090
the manager of an exclusive
hedge fund that we represented.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.160
Come on, Cameron, said
the one called Steinberg.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.370
You said you'd be going in.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.670
I don't see anyone stopping
you from swimming, Jason,

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.310
Cameron Alexander said with
an expert task of her head.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.544
Why does it always have to be
follow the leader with you?

00:09:12.544 --> 00:09:14.460
This seemed to shut
Steinberg up for a moment,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.172
and the other men in
his group snickered.

00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:19.280
Hey Ingrid, mind if I join you?

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.050
I looked up.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.710
It was Tim Hollister, a
youngish corporate partner

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.000
from our Emerging Markets group.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.890
A glint came off his
Clark Kent glasses

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.360
where the sunlight
caught them just so.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.830
Of course not, I
said, pull up a chair.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.430
I liked Tim Hollister.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.760
He had been in the associate
class three years above me

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.676
and seemed a little
surprised to have woken up

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:41.130
one day to discover himself
occupying a huge corner office.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.180
Even after he had made
partner at the firm,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.650
Tim still managed to
seem like one of us.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.130
He was the type of guy who
rarely asked associates

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.650
to work on weekends if he
wasn't also coming in himself.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.530
Tim swung the nearest deck chair
around, parked it next to mine,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.290
and opened the bottled
water he was holding.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.050
Oh, no tropical
slushy today, Tim?

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.260
I asked, inclining my
head towards Steinberg

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.910
and the hollowed out pineapple.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.110
Tim looked over and grinned.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.130
Wow it's only 10:50.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.400
I try to wait until
at least noon.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.660
Then he looked at me and
said, because this is always

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.530
such a long day, you know?

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.400
I nodded and felt
grateful to Tim Hollister

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.690
for having said this out loud.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.400
We sat in comfortable
silence for a moment.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.090
I slid my huge Audrey
Hepburn-style sunglasses back

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.902
onto my face and studied
Tim Hollister in profile.

00:10:28.902 --> 00:10:30.980
Rumor had it that
Tim actually had

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.640
a Ph.D. In political theory
in addition to his law degree,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.540
which made him seem
rather worthy of note

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.084
to lots of women at the firm.

00:10:39.084 --> 00:10:41.250
As I was busy thinking all
this, he opened his mouth

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.460
and said to me, So
Ingrid, the buzz

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.690
is that you've impressed the
hell out of the SunCorp CEO.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.240
I nearly fell out of my chair.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.570
Tim Hollister and I did
not know each other well.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.570
The fact that this had made
its way to him was news.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.690
I'm surprised you heard about
that, Tim, but thanks, I said.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.390
Are you kidding?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.370
Tim looked genuinely
happy for me.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.640
There are no secrets around
this place, believe me.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.920
Marty Adler's been crowing
about you all week.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.846
And I just wanted to say I
think it's really well deserved.

00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:10.770
I felt my face
flush with pleasure.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.060
I tried to think of something
both witty and sincere

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.990
to say back.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.740
But Tim had already
turned away from me

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.190
and was looking toward the exit.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.270
Gavin Dunlop, another
young M&amp;A partner,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.910
was gesturing impatiently at
him, pointing at his watch

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.970
and making exaggerated swinging
motions with both arms.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.070
Tim stood.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.670
I gotta run.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.920
I have an 11 o'clock tee time.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.880
See you, and thanks.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.900
I really appreciate
what you said.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.100
Any time.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.100
Tim jogged over toward
Gavin and the two of them

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.570
headed up the grassy slope
toward the clubhouse.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.880
I took in a long, deep breath
and stretched out my arms

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.680
and legs as far as
they would reach,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.520
feeling the pleasant
pull in each muscle.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.450
The sheer joy of being young
and appreciated and good

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.060
at what you did.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.400
I draped one arm lazily above
my head and closed my eyes,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.480
luxuriating in the
warmth of the sun

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.660
and in Tim Hollister's words.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.720
I think it's really
well deserved.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.450
My eyes were still closed
when suddenly I thought,

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.050
it's really quiet.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.600
It's too quiet.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.400
A reverent hush had
fallen over the pool deck

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.720
and when I opened
my eyes I saw why.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.600
Cameron Alexander had now
peeled off her cover-up

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.390
and was sauntering toward
the shallow end of the pool

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.410
wearing only white
string bikini.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.290
She moved with an
unhurried grace,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.370
as if she were aware
of so many eyes on her

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.210
and really didn't mind.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.840
Steinberg was obediently
loping along behind her,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.360
still clasping his ridiculous
pineapple beverage.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.680
He looked like a five-year-old
on Christmas morning.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.950
For women lawyers
at a firm outing,

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.949
the swimsuit question
presents a conundrum.

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:44.490
Just what should a
young career woman

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.180
wear to what was
essentially a pool

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.460
party thrown by one's employer?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.210
On the one hand,
let's be honest.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.950
Companies value good looks and
sex appeal as much as anyone.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.106
So if you are an
attractive young woman,

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:56.730
you didn't exactly
want to be the class

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.720
prude huddled
poolside in a parka.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.500
On the other hand,
showing too much skin

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.920
wasn't a good idea either.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.710
Especially not if
you ever expected

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.785
to be taken seriously again,
and especially not the year you

00:13:07.785 --> 00:13:10.450
were up for partner.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.930
Unflustered, Cameron
Alexander stood alone

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.430
at the water's edge.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.350
She raised one perfect
pilates-toned leg

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.877
and dipped a pointed
toe into the water.

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:21.460
It's still pretty
cold, she announced,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.140
loud enough for
everyone to hear.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.140
I think I'll wait a bit.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.140
Steinberg didn't seem
disappointed to hear this,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.737
as his objective had
already been achieved.

00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:32.070
Fine with me, he said, shaking
his empty pineapple drink

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.600
at her.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.100
I'm out.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.974
Let's go get another drink.

00:13:34.974 --> 00:13:36.390
Cameron shrugged
and together they

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.860
walked to the back
of the drinks line,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.250
where they were quickly joined
by two male partners who

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.160
were suddenly very
interested in striking up

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.690
a conversation with
the summer associates.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.720
Before long, Cameron and
Steinberg's own group

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.200
of friends joined them
too, forming a large gaggle

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.750
in front of the open bar.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.860
All of the summers
were trying to schmooze

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.500
all of the partners,
but none succeeded

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.450
like Cameron Alexander.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.770
She looked almost queenly,
wearing a beneficent smile

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.279
and occasionally throwing
her head back with laughter

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:06.320
as if it were the most
natural thing in the world

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.528
to be standing around barefoot
with the corporate tax

00:14:08.528 --> 00:14:10.980
partners chatting animatedly
about the latest summer

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.040
action flick.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.720
All the while wearing
a white string bikini

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.610
and gesturing with your
mojito for emphasis.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.660
I was, if I'm being
honest, jealous.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.550
Of course I was.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.310
But not actually
of the way Cameron

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.130
looked in a white string bikini.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.890
Instead, I was jealous
of her confidence

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.820
and her utter
unselfconsciousness.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.020
What must be like,
I marveled, to go

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.170
through life so utterly unwary?

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.410
So wholly certain of
your belonging to a place

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.320
that it was never
necessary to consider

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.040
how your next move
might be perceived?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.500
Making partner at Parsons,
Valentine, and Hunt

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.260
felt like a big final exam
to which a select few held

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.700
the answer key, while the rest
of us schmucks had to study.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.470
So that is one scene that
illustrates Ingrid's frequent,

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:06.810
but not constant, views
of life in the workplace

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.840
as an outsider looking in.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.980
But just as frequently
she sometimes

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.460
experiences her corporate
career from the point

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.912
of view of an
insider looking out.

00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.370
Because she is
someone who has been

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.530
extremely successful
in her career.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.810
She has perfected the
art of passing and she

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:30.420
as blended basically seamlessly
into the corporate culture.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.750
Until something happens
in the plot of the story

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.560
where all of a sudden her
difference and her status as

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.380
not only a woman, but also a
woman of color in particular,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.170
is suddenly thrown
into sharp relief.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:50.410
So it's not a plot spoiler
to say that at one point

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.820
her company engages a
diversity consultant.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.560
So they have to engage this
outside diversity and inclusion

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.220
corporate consultant to come in.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.490
And because Ingrid is one of
the very, very few senior level

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.410
women, and also she
is a woman of color,

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:10.700
she is asked to subject
yourself to an interview

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.997
with this diversity consultant.

00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:13.330
And this is their first meeting.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.510
Now you've obviously been very
successful in your career here

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.670
and that's terrific.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.320
But could I invite
you to speculate

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.430
on why there's only one of
you who has made it this far?

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.380
That is to say, why
there aren't more women

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.240
of color up for partnership.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.650
While I tried to think
of a diplomatic response,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.350
Dr. Rossi held up an
Excel spreadsheet.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.030
I see that in your
entering class

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.180
there was another
Asian American woman,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.370
but she quit within the
first year and a half.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.530
And I'm curious to hear
your thoughts about this.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.440
Why do you feel the company
was unable to retain her?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.670
I remembered this woman,
Zhang Liu, very clearly.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.700
For the first few months after
our new associate orientation

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.060
a lot of people had had
trouble telling us apart,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.590
even though we
looked nothing alike.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.820
Zhang wore her hair
short with bangs,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.830
while mine was long and layered.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.240
Zhang also stood a
head taller than me,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.135
yet a year later we still got
each other's interoffice mail.

00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:11.859
Zhang Liu was from Beijing
and had come to the States

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.569
at the age of 18 to attend MIT.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.270
She had aced the bar exam and
every other standardized test

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.970
known to civilization,
Zhang was brilliant,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.800
but she spoke English
that was technically

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.130
correct, yet strongly accented.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.619
Her blunt cut hair
sometimes looked

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.369
like it needed
shampooing, and she

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.210
wore shapeless,
ill-fitting suits that

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.870
obscured what was actually
really decent figure.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.100
She was extremely shy and never
joined in when a group of us

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.760
went out to grab lunch
or drinks after work.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.470
And on the rare occasions when
she did accept our invitation

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.890
to come out, Zhang
would hover silently

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.514
on the outer fringes of our
group nursing single 7 Up

00:17:46.514 --> 00:17:48.680
while the rest of us tossed
back martinis and traded

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.780
dirty jokes and gossip.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.090
And when she did speak her
voice was so soft and low

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.450
it barely rose above a whisper.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.370
Once at a department
meeting I had

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.050
seen Marty Adler lose
his patience and snap,

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.820
speak up, Zhang, for God's sake.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.850
I had never Marty Adler speak
to another associate like that

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.830
either before or since,
and it had stuck with me.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.640
Another time Harold
Rubenstein had

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.270
praised Zhang for an excellent
research memo she had prepared.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.860
This was extremely
well done, Zhang,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.620
he said in front of all of us.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.190
Great job.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.350
But Zhang had blushed
and stammered something

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.430
in protest about how it had
really been a team effort

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.720
and that truly two
summer associates had

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.680
done most of the work.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.090
She just wasn't getting it.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.190
Everyone knew that on
the rare occasion when

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.530
a partner publicly
praised your work,

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.915
the only right
answer was thank you.

00:18:39.915 --> 00:18:42.660
About a year after we started,
Zhang ventured to my office

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.870
late one night.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.460
She knocked
tentatively on my door

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.110
and I looked up startled from
the stack of corporate minutes

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.650
I'd been reviewing
and marking up.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.330
Apropos of nothing,
Zhang Liu asked me

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.320
if I knew how to speak Chinese.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.166
No, I lied.

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:01.710
I knew how much courage this
must have taken on her part,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.246
and I knew just how much
it must have cost her.

00:19:04.246 --> 00:19:06.500
Yet, to my own
embarrassment, I could not

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.810
summon the courage in
myself to do the kind thing.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.310
It had only did my own first
year, my position at the firm

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.270
was not yet so
secure that I thought

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.060
that I could afford to be
associated with Zhang Liu

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.000
any more than I already was.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.640
I was terrified
she'd drag me down.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.300
I was passing and she was not.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.140
Zhang stuck it out at Parsons
Valentine a few more months,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.490
collected her bonus,
and then quit.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.380
I had no idea
where she'd landed.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.240
I sighed at Dr. Rossi.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.610
All right, look.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.020
Let's just say that
in my experience,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.380
most white guys are still a
lot more comfortable working

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.290
with other guys who look, talk,
and act more or less like them.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.010
Well what about the
various initiatives

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.950
of the diversity committee,
prodded Dr. Rossi?

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:51.670
I snorted.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.100
As far as I could tell
until the incident,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.240
the diversity committee at this
firm had been all but defunct.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.830
Their initiatives had
consisted of taking associates

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.900
to see The Lion
King on Broadway,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.030
throwing a Margarita happy
hour on Cinco de Mayo,

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.060
and serving spring
rolls and dumplings

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.580
in the corporate cafeteria
during Asian-Pacific American

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.810
Heritage Month.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.310
When we didn't need
fucking dumpling

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.350
day in the corporate cafeteria.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.280
What we needed
were decoder rings

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.992
for all the unwritten
rules of survival here.

00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:21.200
SUNNI YUEN: Thank you, Helen.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.470
That raises a lot of
interesting themes here.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.710
Just in those two passages.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.150
But your protagonist,
Ingrid Yung,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.210
who is a Type A personality,
who can play in same league

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.040
as the boys.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.500
And part of that is
using the same slang

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.250
and lingo and culture.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.224
Tell us more about
conference room bingo.

00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:47.950
HELEN WAN: Conference
room bingo is something

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:53.830
that we actually did play when I
was a young associate at an M&amp;A

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.140
large law firm where
the corporate jargon

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.170
and the corporate speak
get so ridiculous.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:07.010
Like kicking the tires or
whatever the phrase of the day.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.670
These catchphrases that
people learn in B-school

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.950
and then tote to their jobs.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.130
Or another one of my
favorites was learnings.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.110
Let's write down our
learnings from today.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.980
And low-hanging fruit, like
these kinds of phrases.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.470
And so we would write down a
bunch of these catchphrases,

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:33.610
prior to a meeting,
and we would pick

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.360
certain like phrases that paid.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.520
And if one of the ones
that you chose not

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.130
uttered during the
course of the meeting,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.580
we played for $20 stakes.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.820
SUNNI YUEN: Now
these phrases that

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.849
pay, more on this
sports metaphor side?

00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:56.890
HELEN WAN: A lot of sports
metaphors, definitely.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:57.100
Yeah.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.725
SUNNI YUEN: OK.

00:21:57.725 --> 00:22:00.600
HELEN WAN: But not all.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.170
SUNNI YUEN: So I thought
it'd be interesting to have

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:08.420
a small exercise to look at
some Google phrases that pay.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.130
HELEN WAN: Oh yeah, What are
some Google phrases that pay?

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.800
SUNNI YUEN: However,
I'm going to you

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.960
which our characters would be
the most likely to say that

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.800
phrase and why?

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.475
HELEN WAN: OK.

00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:19.100
SUNNI YUEN: OK.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.612
So the first one is
herd your black sheep.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:23.320
HELEN WAN: Wait--

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.690
SUNNI YUEN: Herd
your black sheep.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.190
HELEN WAN: Who would be the most
likely character to say that?

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.970
SUNNI YUEN: Yes.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.757
HELEN WAN: Maybe
Murph, actually.

00:22:32.757 --> 00:22:35.340
SUNNI YUEN: So tell us a little
bit more about Murph, and why,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.257
and what this phrase
means to Murph?

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:39.840
HELEN WAN: Well I'm
not even sure what

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.320
the phrase means at Google.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.973
Herd your black sheep?

00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:46.472
Okay.

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:46.920
SUNNI YUEN: Right.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.190
HELEN WAN: Does that mean
that something went wrong

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.007
for that person?

00:22:51.007 --> 00:22:53.340
SUNNI YUEN: What I've heard
is being used in the context

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.310
for is when you've got a
lot of restless contributors

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.950
with unconventional ideas who
are discontent because they can

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.050
see alternate ways
of doing things,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.280
but they haven't had
a chance to try it.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.509
Because the established way
is what everybody sticks with.

00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:09.800
HELEN WAN: I kind of love that.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.750
I'm going to use that somehow.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:17.110
But I think I could see Murph
uttering that to someone.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:22.730
A little bit about the Murph
character in the novel.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.310
Basically every single
character in the novel

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.160
is imperfect because
that's real life.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.680
None of us is perfect.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.854
And also to an author
it's just much, much, much

00:23:32.854 --> 00:23:35.020
more interesting writing
about imperfect people than

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.570
about plastic people.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:44.290
So Murph is someone
who if you look at him,

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.150
one might assume that
he just has it made.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.195
He is the golden
boy of the firm.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.910
Some very, very senior level
rainmakers at the company

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.790
have identified him
as the golden boy,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:05.120
as I said, and have taken
him under their wing.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.539
He just knows how to
play the game perfectly.

00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:10.330
He always knows how to
say the right thing.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.330
So Ingrid assumes a lot
of things about him.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.870
And he is just someone who would
know all of the catchphrases

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.890
and know how to
employ them perfectly

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.110
and insinuates himself socially
very, very well at the firm.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.860
SUNNI YUEN: Great.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.200
So another phrase that pays
from Google, moon shot.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.010
HELEN WAN: What?

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.200
SUNNI YUEN: Moon shot.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.440
HELEN WAN: Moon shocked.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.120
AUDIENCE: Shot.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.560
SUNNI YUEN: Shot.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.400
HELEN WAN: Oh, moon shot.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.090
SUNNI YUEN: Yes.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:45.673
HELEN WAN: OK.

00:24:45.673 --> 00:24:49.340
What is that context?

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.350
SUNNI YUEN: This is something
that we at Google think about.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.490
Instead of just reaching for the
stars, you reach for the moon.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.150
Big, laudable goals.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.480
HELEN WAN: OK, so that's
kind of like pie in the sky.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.160
SUNNI YUEN: Bigger
than pie in the sky.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.910
Pie in the sky is old.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.270
HELEN WAN: So kind of--

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.120
SUNNI YUEN: We're talking
about universe here.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.210
Way up.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.004
HELEN WAN: But is it
in a positive context?

00:25:12.004 --> 00:25:12.670
Like achievable.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.380
SUNNI YUEN: It's like
setting your goals.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.542
HELEN WAN: Oh, OK.

00:25:16.542 --> 00:25:18.500
SUNNI YUEN: Are you going
to make it achievable

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.506
even if it seems like
it's not achievable?

00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:21.214
HELEN WAN: I see.

00:25:21.214 --> 00:25:24.350
Well Ingrid is
someone who, I think,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.420
sets goals like
that for herself.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:33.320
And has always done that
throughout her life.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.890
Actually, one of the
additional themes

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.160
that are very
important to the book,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.250
aside from just the
theme of advancing

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.675
the careers of both
women and women

00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:52.279
and people of color in
corporate America generally,

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.820
I was also very
interested in writing

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.060
about this idea about women's
very complicated relationship

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.887
with ambition.

00:25:57.887 --> 00:26:00.220
Yes I do think that it's a
very complicated relationship

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.710
with ambition.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:07.040
And that's for a lot of societal
and cultural underpinnings.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.480
And so I guess she is someone
who sets all of these moon

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.060
shot type goals for herself.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.890
Not necessarily
because she wants to,

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.060
but because she's one
of the very few who can.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.680
And that is a theme
that I think--

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.400
SUNNI YUEN: And her moon shot is
to make partner, specifically.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.326
HELEN WAN: Yes.

00:26:26.326 --> 00:26:30.180
SUNNI YUEN: OK, and let's do
one last Google phrase to pay.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.010
I'm uncomfortably excited.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.990
Who is the character who's most
likely to say that and why?

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.365
HELEN WAN:
Uncomfortably excited.

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:45.290
Maybe Tyler, actually.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:45.915
SUNNI YUEN: OK.

00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:47.070
And tell us about Tyler.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.090
HELEN WAN: So
Tyler is-- actually

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.040
he is the other very
senior person of color who

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.720
has managed to make it
quite far in the firm.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.650
But Ingrid is his
closest confidante

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.250
and friend at the
firm because he's

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.215
someone who, unlike Murph--
he's sort of the anti-Murph.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:14.380
So he, like Ingrid,
being a woman of color,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.410
he also occupies sort
of a double outsider

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.430
status within this company.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:25.800
He is an openly gay African
American male attorney.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.990
And so he and Ingrid have
bonded over this fact.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.050
They're clearly the stars of
the glossy firm recruiting

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.770
brochure, et cetera.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.120
Always asked to be
photographed in this context.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.640
But unlike Ingrid, he is
someone who-- basically he

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.750
has one foot out the
door and he is not

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:54.710
setting that same goal of
partnership for himself.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:28:02.350
In other words, he has
already sort of checked out.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:06.192
And Ingrid is very, very
nervous about the day

00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:08.400
that he's going to leave
because then she'll be left.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.130
He really is her one
confidant and close friend

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.600
who she can go to for candid
conversations about some

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.380
of these issues.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.170
SUNNI YUEN: It seems
like Tyler's more--

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.890
in terms of being photographed
for the firm's diversity

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.880
brochures and everything, he's
a very passive participant

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.370
in those efforts.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.620
HELEN WAN: That's fair to say.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.900
SUNNI YUEN: And even
Ingrid herself actually

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.830
kind of rejects participating
as the diversity initiative

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.620
liaison initially.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.010
And it's only after she is
convinced by a senior partner

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:47.240
that it is good for her to
consider to become partner

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.250
that she actually assumed
the role reluctantly.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.210
In your opinion, and
based on your experience,

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.130
does participating
in diversity efforts

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:01.260
dampen one's ability to blend
in and relate to everybody else?

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.870
HELEN WAN: This has
been a question that

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.200
has been very frequently
raised a lot of the places

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.790
where I've spoken
about the book.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:16.710
Particularly when the question
comes from other senior level

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:23.080
women who have stayed within
their corporate careers

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.740
for a very long time.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:31.270
And it seems like people fall
into these two different fairly

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.210
divided camps.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.866
One set feels not resentful,
but that it is quite a burden.

00:29:38.866 --> 00:29:40.240
That they're always
asked to, hey

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.890
can you be a mentor
to this person?

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.870
Can you come speak
on this panel?

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.590
Can you be on this
committee please?

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.210
That their point of
view was so on top

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.150
of my normal responsibilities
of my already very demanding day

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.090
job, I have this extra
investment of time

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.980
that the company will
ask me to do just

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.490
by virtue of me
being a woman, being

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.610
a very senior woman, et cetera.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.500
And not that they
don't want to do it,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:17.090
it's just that they view it as
an added obligation that is not

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.020
necessarily recognized come
compensation time or promotion

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.544
time.

00:30:22.544 --> 00:30:26.440
But another set, and I would
say the majority actually,

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.640
don't share that view.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.600
And say, OK yes it
is another time sink.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.870
It is another added obligation
that perhaps my colleague

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.320
Bob in office next
door does not have.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.730
But they also view it as
quite a privilege too.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:44.880
And they don't have this
view of, well 25 years ago

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.650
when I was starting out I didn't
have a mentor, so why should I?

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:55.370
Most people do not have that
view anymore in the audiences

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:59.120
that I have been speaking
to over the last two months.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.890
SUNNI YUEN: What is the critical
difference between being a role

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.510
model or a figurehead
for diversity efforts

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.020
versus actively
engaging and mentoring?

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.220
What really makes
the difference?

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.270
HELEN WAN: So in
terms of numbers

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.444
and actually moving
the needle, I think.

00:31:16.444 --> 00:31:17.110
SUNNI YUEN: Yes.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.880
HELEN WAN: So it's
been interesting.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.550
There has been a lot
of conversation--

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:21.870
I'm sure this will be nothing
new to this audience--

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.060
but a lot of conversation
recently about the move

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.350
from traditional
mentoring to something

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:33.010
called sponsorship, which is a
very, very crucial difference.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.290
So basically, as
you probably know,

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:46.156
a mentor is someone who can
offer advice and be someone

00:31:46.156 --> 00:31:48.280
who can offer candid
feedback, who can take you out

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.970
to lunch once in a
while, et cetera,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.390
and talk to you
about your career.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.060
While a sponsor
is someone who is

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.960
going to be talking about
you and actually promoting

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.500
you and your career potential
to those who are in a position

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.670
to do something about it.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.314
And in the various
large companies

00:32:10.314 --> 00:32:12.980
where I've been talking about my
book and the large national law

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.521
firms and law schools where I
have been talking about my book

00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:18.760
recently, there is
tremendous conversation

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.916
about this move from
mentorship to sponsorship.

00:32:20.916 --> 00:32:22.290
Understanding that
sponsorship is

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.920
what is actually going
to move the needle.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.560
And also I'm really encouraged
by a lot of companies

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:37.150
doing very, very smart
things with their employee

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.040
professional development
training programs.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.960
Like putting budget toward
very, very smart programs

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:52.440
such as bringing in
consultants to tell you how do

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.820
you get the most of your once
a year performance review.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.850
How do you get the most
out of that conversation

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.900
so that no one can be
blindsided later down the road

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.560
if you are, let's
say, passed over?

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.680
And no one ever
gave me the feedback

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.730
that I was not seen as
aggressive enough to drive

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.660
new business.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.660
When would I have heard that?

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.060
You do hear that refrain
over and over, particularly

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.100
from female employees.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.990
And companies are
starting to do something

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.670
about it, which I
think it's great.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.503
The other thing that
they are starting to do

00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:31.290
is instead of having
formalistic-- assigning very

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:36.100
artificial-feeling mentorship
programs like, hey you,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.700
Mary, will mentor John or Sarah.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.090
That is mandated by the company.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.520
I've never really put those
programs tend to work.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.186
Because it's kind of
like dating, right?

00:33:47.186 --> 00:33:49.280
You can't assign
somebody a boyfriend.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.240
Life would be so much
easier if you could.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.120
SUNNI YUEN: That's
what [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.459
HELEN WAN: Exactly.

00:33:55.459 --> 00:33:56.750
But no, it's got to be organic.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.790
You've got to have
chemistry, and rapport,

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.310
and the two people
have to both want

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.240
to be in that
mentor-sponsor relationship.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.310
And I think that companies are
kind of getting wise to that

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.070
quickly.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.179
SUNNI YUEN: And so just
to address your point

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:15.380
in the theme of
passing or blending in.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:20.530
So Ingrid is a protagonist
who blends in, or passes in,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.290
with all the other senior
associates, who are all male.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.800
And at the time she's
also keenly aware

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.650
that how she dresses
has an impact

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.469
in establishing a
presence around men.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.527
She seems to be a fan of Audrey
Hepburn's style in particular.

00:34:36.527 --> 00:34:38.360
Right before she meets
with a senior partner

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.810
she checks her
mascara, lip gloss,

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.179
ties her Audrey Hepburn
style sheath sash.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.610
She wears stiletto
pumps when she

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.693
knows that she's meeting
with a client who's maybe

00:34:47.693 --> 00:34:50.159
a bit more old
school and expects

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:55.159
women to wear a
skirt and high heels.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:35:03.720
And what is that line between
deemphasizing your gender

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.760
in your interactions
and behavior,

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.990
yet at the same
time playing up what

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.460
some might call femininity?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.320
Or also just what
may be expected

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.940
for an older kind of
professional code of dress

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.160
for women.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.990
How to navigate that.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:28.340
HELEN WAN: Well I think Ingrid
is someone who just has thought

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:36.210
a lot about, well, what's the
cultural baggage and societal

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.910
baggage that each of us brings
into our corporate workplace?

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.780
And how can we make the
most of the attributes

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.880
that we do have
while still trying

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.030
to remain an authentic self?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.870
But she's someone
who has figured out

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.060
that, you know what,
I am going to have

00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:01.130
to play by the current
rules of this game

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:06.534
because I will get to the goal
quicker than if I try to change

00:36:06.534 --> 00:36:07.950
all the rules from
the inside out.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.520
That's just not good.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.480
So that is sort of
why she has observed,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.660
OK if I'm meeting with
that client, that client's

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.770
more old school.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.790
He is going to expect to
see that the lawyer is

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.180
wearing an actual suit.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.700
And she'll do it.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.410
Rather than someone
who is going to try to,

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.320
before she has made
partner herself,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.610
try to break the
rules in advance.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.401
SUNNI YUEN: Do you
think she would actually

00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:38.425
break the rules if she
were to become partner?

00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:39.050
HELEN WAN: Yes.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.970
I think most people
feel much freer

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.120
to break the rules
after they've already

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.505
attained C-suite status.

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.130
SUNNI YUEN: OK.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.588
Do you think you
would ever see her

00:36:47.588 --> 00:36:49.725
in her yoga pants going to work?

00:36:49.725 --> 00:36:51.100
HELEN WAN: You
may not see Ingrid

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.225
scooting through the halls.

00:36:56.665 --> 00:36:58.040
I just think that's
human nature.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.940
Once a comfort level
has been reached

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:07.170
people feel far more free
to be more of the person

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.610
that they are outside
of work, and bring

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.210
that person to the office.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.522
SUNNI YUEN: So that raises
an interesting point.

00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:14.790
What is work identity?

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.550
What is personal identity?

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:21.425
And to a certain extent
one informs the other.

00:37:21.425 --> 00:37:23.340
You can't really divorce them.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.360
Ingrid's mother has a really
compassionate and interesting

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.690
quote where she's talking on
the phone in one of the scenes

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.470
to Ingrid saying that "Cindy
and Susan are such good girls.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.220
So sweet, so nice.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.990
You could really learn
something from them.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.140
They're not like you,
always working, working.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.860
No time to meet anyone.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.060
Wasting your beautiful years."

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.820
And then Ingrid's
response to that

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.570
is, "Well Cindy
and Susan probably

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.210
were both sweeter
and nicer than I was,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.751
but you didn't make partner at
one of the most powerful firms

00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:57.640
in the country by
being sweet and nice."

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.190
Can anyone climb
the corporate ladder

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.810
and still be sweet and
nice without wasting

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.726
their beautiful years?

00:38:04.104 --> 00:38:06.020
HELEN WAN: No one has
ever asked that question

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.065
posed in quite that way before.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:17.250
Although I do get asked a lot
in a lot of audiences of women

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.880
lawyers, for example,
we talk a lot about

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.820
is it possible to become
partner or be viewed

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:32.020
as a real rainmaking partner
without coming across

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:38.050
as this very aggressive
and frankly, quote,

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.330
"unfeminine" type.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.560
I actually got
asked that question.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.990
Can one remain a feminine type
person while achieving success?

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.910
And I think the answer
is hopefully yes.

00:38:53.025 --> 00:38:57.720
Because first of all, I
think that if somebody is not

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.820
being authentic to
their own personality,

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.278
I actually don't
think that they're

00:39:01.278 --> 00:39:06.160
going to be able to pull
that off forever and achieve

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.970
and maintain a level
of corporate success.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:13.660
Because I think people can see
through the bullshit and go,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.300
if you are natural
personality is not

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.120
that sort of hard driving,
aggressive, bad cop person,

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.980
I think that's not going
to ultimately be believed.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:32.040
And so just as a matter
of personal survival,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.510
I think you do have to cultivate
a workplace presence that

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.520
is believable because it's true.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.900
SUNNI YUEN: And does work-life
balance mean different things

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.210
in that very top
corporate echelon

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.590
for ambitions men versus women?

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.900
HELEN WAN: Oh absolutely.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.230
I think it still does.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.030
But companies and firms
are getting better.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.140
For example, one other
thing that I have seen

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.700
discussed a lot at the
companies and firms

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.570
have invited me to come speak
are a lot of conversations

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:09.380
about a flex time track.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.660
A really possible
way to make partner

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.280
while still having
flexible schedules.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.190
Actually a lot of tech companies
are leading the charge here.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:24.880
Are really showing a lot of
leadership in this context.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.290
But even older
companies as well.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.410
With older, perhaps, and
more old school management,

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.550
also are coming
around to this idea.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.720
I've been speaking
at a lot of law firms

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.220
where they have
actually laid out now

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.940
for the first time written
policies, whereas before it was

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.730
all kind of nebulous and
through word of mouth.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.650
No one really knew what
the firm's real policy

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.300
was about flex time.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.290
Whether one could make partner
and still be flex time.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.450
Now some firms are actually
willing to write it down,

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.070
a policy, and
actually distribute it

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.300
to all of their lawyers and say,
there is a path to partnership

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.100
if you're flex time,
and here it is.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.425
SUNNI YUEN: So they're
starting the dialogue,

00:41:04.425 --> 00:41:06.095
they're being
transparent about it.

00:41:06.095 --> 00:41:07.449
HELEN WAN: Exactly.

00:41:07.449 --> 00:41:08.740
SUNNI YUEN: It's been codified.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.406
HELEN WAN: Yeah.

00:41:09.406 --> 00:41:11.220
Now how many women have?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.255
How many women and men
successfully do that?

00:41:13.255 --> 00:41:14.980
That's a different conversation.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.230
But at least there's a path
now that is written down

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.320
and objective criteria
that can be disseminated

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.940
so that at least
people can be talking

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.710
about the same set
of criteria at least.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.380
SUNNI YUEN: And
so just going back

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.360
to the question of
tackling stereotypes

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.220
and promoting diversity.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.920
Your book actually
tackles a perception

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.655
that Asian Americans are often
viewed as the model minority.

00:41:43.655 --> 00:41:44.280
HELEN WAN: Yes.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.070
SUNNI YUEN: There's a scene
where Ingrid loses her temper

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.969
because one of the
partners says something

00:41:48.969 --> 00:41:50.760
about Asian Americans
having done all right

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.930
because by objective
economic measure

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.130
they are right up
there with whites.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.640
And then Ingrid goes berserk.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.510
As berserk as you can.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.352
HELEN WAN: Reasonably berserk.

00:42:02.352 --> 00:42:04.935
SUNNI YUEN: That should be a new
phrase that pays, by the way.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.870
And she breaks what she
calls her own cardinal rule

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.410
of avoiding any
discussion about race.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.544
HELEN WAN: In the
workplace, yeah.

00:42:15.544 --> 00:42:16.960
SUNNI YUEN: When
is the right time

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.510
to actually have that
conversation without making

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:23.540
an issue out of it in a
way that is not productive?

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.405
HELEN WAN: Right.

00:42:24.405 --> 00:42:31.160
This is an absolutely
crucial, crucial question.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.170
I think that the answer
depends maddeningly,

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.050
as with so many
other things, it's

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:41.680
totally context and
circumstance specific.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.570
And it also depends
very, very much

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.340
on your own level and
position within that company

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.310
at that time.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:54.481
So actually, one
young woman who I

00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:55.980
met at one of these
book events, she

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.290
came up to me to ask about a
situation that had recently

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.510
happened to her.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.820
She is a young lawyer.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.980
She was at a social
event with a partner--

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.960
a very powerful partner-- who
heads the department that she

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.150
hopes to eventually
be very successful in.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.380
And he made a ching chong joke.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.520
Yes, people are
still doing this.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.360
I know.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.760
And he made a ching
chong joke about somebody

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.150
who was a business person
on the other side of a deal

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.900
that they were all working on.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:40.690
And predictably,
the other two, who

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:46.970
were mid-level associates, who
heard the joke, were horrified.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.926
But they also themselves
are subordinate

00:43:50.926 --> 00:43:52.050
to this particular partner.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.240
They are mid-level associates.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.840
And so what they did
was they turned to her

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.650
and at least wanted
to let her know

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.060
that they understood
that this was crazy.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:08.890
So they would turn to her
and go, sorry, but not

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:12.090
say something too him.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.670
And then later, after they
were out of that situation,

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.950
both separately came to
her and said, oh my God.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:18.460
WTF?

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.764
I am so sorry.

00:44:19.764 --> 00:44:22.342
SUNNI YUEN: Was that
too late, though?

00:44:22.342 --> 00:44:23.950
Because they waited reactively.

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:24.740
HELEN WAN: Right.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.366
So the moment had passed.

00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:33.740
There was no teachable moment
for that particular partner.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.570
But quite honestly,
just thinking about it

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.700
and trying to situate
myself in that situation,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.260
if I were the summer associate
I certainly would not

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:48.730
have felt comfortable lecturing
him under those circumstances.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.880
And I don't know
enough about how senior

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.430
or what the position within
the firm of those other two

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.170
more mid-level
attorneys-- I don't

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.660
know enough about
those two people

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.605
to know whether there
could've been an opportunity

00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:09.750
to raise the point or not.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.710
I do think in general
those moments tend to pass

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.380
and a lot of teachable
moments are wasted,

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.920
or they're not
taken advantage of.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.660
Which actually, it's sort of
a chicken and the egg problem,

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.260
right?

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:29.800
So the sooner we can have
more sensitized people

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:37.800
in more senior positions who are
on equal professional footing

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.900
with this particular
person, only then are you

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.101
going to have people who feel
fully comfortable saying, Bob,

00:45:45.101 --> 00:45:45.600
seriously?

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.340
And until that
day comes, I think

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.890
there will be a lot of moments
like that lost into the ether.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.395
And I also am very, very
sensitive to the fact

00:45:57.395 --> 00:45:58.770
that I don't think
that we should

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.850
have unrealistic
expectations about what

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.945
people can feel
comfortable doing.

00:46:02.945 --> 00:46:04.820
Most people are not
going to feel comfortable

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.460
challenging their boss, the
head of the department who

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.900
does their performance review.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.500
SUNNI YUEN: Or a client.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.390
HELEN WAN: Yeah, or a client.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.220
You're not going to
lecture them on race.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.090
You're just not.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:20.090
And that's why I think that
the more there are people

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.720
who are on an equal
professional footing,

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.700
I think that these kinds
of unfortunate moments

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.510
will happen with less
and less and less

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.990
frequency in the future.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.170
SUNNI YUEN: So how do you negate
the perception that sometimes

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.670
the idea is that
someone advances because

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:37.790
of a meritocracy?

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.150
They are darn good
at what they do.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.550
They deserve to be promoted.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:46.137
But then you also, because of
certain diversity initiatives,

00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.720
there might be some
kind of perception

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.580
there is a quota-based system.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:54.050
And I think in your book there's
an insinuation that Ingrid only

00:46:54.050 --> 00:47:00.010
landed her role in a massive
transaction, massive deal,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:04.230
because the vendor required
a certain representation

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.310
from a diverse associate.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.480
How do you counter that,
and do quotas work?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:20.030
HELEN WAN: Well
actually-- it comes from,

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.360
I think, people having their
hearts in the right place

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:28.190
and wanting to give more
business to, and more business

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:33.720
attribution credit to, more
people of color and women.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.300
But I think you have to be
incredibly, incredibly careful

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:40.020
about the way these
so-called vendor

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.480
requirements, or minority
vendor requirements, in RFPs

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.000
get played out.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.810
I think there's really a right
way and a wrong way to do it.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.680
I think that the ways
in which it can actually

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.770
help move the needle positively
are when it's not just, hey

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.860
yeah, yeah, yeah, can you
bring some brown people

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.295
to the beauty pageant?

00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:05.120
When we're shopping
for outside counsel.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.114
I have seen that.

00:48:09.114 --> 00:48:11.030
SUNNI YUEN: Was that
from personal experience?

00:48:13.144 --> 00:48:14.560
HELEN WAN: I have
a lot of friends

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.400
who are lawyers and who are
now partners at their law firms

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.320
who have told me that they have
seen right ways and wrong ways

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.088
to do this at firms.

00:48:26.088 --> 00:48:30.450
Where the client will
say, yeah please,

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.620
we would like to see
a female partner,

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:38.040
or we would like to see a
diverse attorney at the beauty

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.020
pageant.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.820
And then so the firm does.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.670
And the client clearly just
never follows up on it.

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.810
Never is like, you
know, I would like

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.130
to know out of those people
you brought to the beauty

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.970
pageant, who was actually
working on my matter?

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.050
How many hours did those people
actually bill on my matter?

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:02.570
And I want to know who
are the substantive deal

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:07.220
team leads working this
particular project.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.880
And of course when the
client doesn't follow up,

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.590
the message that is then
sent to the law firm

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.450
is, well they don't
really care and they're

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.150
doing this as a check box.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.600
However, I also know
of other companies

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.080
who are doing it in a
much more meaningful way.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.400
Where yes, they
have messaged it is

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.030
important to us, Client X
corporation, for you guys

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:42.160
to have a diverse team
working on this matter.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.440
And not only that, we intend to
develop personal relationships

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.410
with those attorneys
on your team who

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.064
are going to be
working on this matter.

00:49:50.064 --> 00:49:52.230
I even have heard of companies
that are doing really

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:56.310
great, very creative programs
such as seconding attorneys

00:49:56.310 --> 00:50:00.060
in-house so that the client
really does have an opportunity

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.500
to develop a personal
relationship with these kind

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.140
of up-and-coming lawyers.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:14.360
And that definitely does lead
to real progress I have seen.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.410
SUNNI YUEN: And just going
to, again, narrow a lens

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:25.800
to your character's
journey in your book,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:31.980
Ingrid gets stymied in
their partner track quest.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.460
And then at the end
when she's stymied

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.764
by institutional
obstacles, she's

00:50:37.764 --> 00:50:38.930
tried the conventional path.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.120
She's tried to beat the system
by playing along the rules

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.470
by passing, by blending.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:49.450
And then at the end of it
she comes out and just says,

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:53.372
I'm going to just pretty much
charge my own path forward.

00:50:53.372 --> 00:50:56.580
Do you think that's common
for smart, independent women

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.950
to first try the conventional
path before deciding

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.006
to make the leap into
becoming a solo entrepreneur?

00:51:03.006 --> 00:51:04.130
HELEN WAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:10.860
And I think it's particularly
common for Asian American men

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.470
and women to do that.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.560
SUNNI YUEN: Why is that?

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.130
HELEN WAN: I just think
that there are a lot of--

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:20.500
and obviously it was
very important to me

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:26.090
in writing this book-- I wrote
this book because when I landed

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.072
as a 25-year-old, first
job out of law school.

00:51:30.072 --> 00:51:32.030
Not only was it my first
job out of law school,

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.890
it was my first job period.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.300
Because I had gone straight
through from high school

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.940
to college to law school.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.960
Landed in the M&amp;A department at
this large national law firm.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.910
It's truly, not counting
things like summer internships,

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.854
actually was my
first job, crazily.

00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:47.853
If you think about that.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.030
And when I got there I realized
that all of those skill

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.580
sets that had served me so well
up until that point in my life,

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.540
namely knowing how
to be good at school,

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.164
knowing how to take
tests well, knowing

00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:05.160
how to make good grades,
just studying hard,

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.334
knowing how to do that.

00:52:06.334 --> 00:52:07.500
Were sort of out the window.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.090
They were kind of irrelevant
in the corporate game.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.817
I mean obviously hard
work, yes it is important.

00:52:13.817 --> 00:52:15.400
You have to have the
goods, after all.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.290
But everybody does
at that point.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.170
You are starting over
with a fresh slate.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:22.900
Everyone there was
a good student.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:24.890
Everyone there aced the LSAT.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:28.421
Everyone there graduated from
the same five law schools

00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:29.420
and landed in Manhattan.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:37.050
So being a good student no
longer distinguishes you.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.990
What does distinguish
you, however,

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:46.590
is being really, really fluent
in the language of the firm.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.690
Being really great at
integrating yourself

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:52.740
in the social
fabric of the firm.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.020
I soon realized that
contrary to everything

00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:02.050
that my-- at least in my own
Chinese American family--

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:05.270
contrary to what a lot
of Chinese American first

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.790
generation immigrant
kids are told, I think,

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:10.990
it is actually
far more important

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:15.510
to show up at the Fridays
at five cocktail hour

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.010
rather than spend that hour
holed up in your office

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.255
with the door closed
billing, billing, billing.

00:53:20.255 --> 00:53:22.380
Totally invisible and no
one knows you're in there.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.490
Those were the cultural
messages of hey,

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.229
how to be successful
in your first job,

00:53:33.229 --> 00:53:34.520
that I actually had to relearn.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:41.080
Because all of those things that
a lot of Asian American kids

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.090
are told, for example,
self promotion is bad.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.010
It's a bad word.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.034
Don't self-promote.

00:53:46.034 --> 00:53:46.950
You have to be humble.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:47.866
You have to be modest.

00:53:47.866 --> 00:53:49.600
You have to keep your head down.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.910
Don't stick out.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.100
Don't rock the boat.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.130
Just go along and
it's a meritocracy,

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.770
so hard work will be rewarded.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.250
And hard work matters,
but by the time

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.420
you reach the Parsons
Valentines of the world,

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.880
everyone there is
good at what they do.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.990
So you need to master
those soft skills

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.630
that they can't teach you in
business school or law school.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:18.820
I wasn't seeing any smart
contemporary stories

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:21.070
being written about
that experience

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.497
from the point of view
of a young person trying

00:54:23.497 --> 00:54:25.330
to make his or her way
in corporate America.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.352
So that's why I wrote the book.

00:54:27.352 --> 00:54:28.310
SUNNI YUEN: Great book.

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:29.980
We should check it out.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.808
We have a few minutes
open for questions,

00:54:31.808 --> 00:54:33.224
if anyone in the
audience has any.

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.493
Make sure you go to the
mic so we can capture it.

00:54:42.685 --> 00:54:44.060
AUDIENCE: Yes, I
have a question.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.440
I'm not really sure
the answer, which

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.731
is why I'm asking the question.

00:54:46.731 --> 00:54:48.680
Or how to find out
the answer to this.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.470
But would you say that is
harder to overcome adversity

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.710
in corporate America if you
come from a background of being

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.870
poor, like not
having lots of means,

00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:02.520
or coming from a class of
people that was traditionally

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.260
discriminated against,
whether or not you have means?

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:05.990
Thank you.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:07.323
HELEN WAN: Interesting question.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.910
I actually don't know
that one has a harder

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.130
road then the other.

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.510
One thing that it
was important to me

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:26.030
to do with the
characters in the story

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:33.570
is to portray that actually
everyone-- Ingrid mistakenly

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:39.230
assumes that everyone
else finds the firm

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.370
experience easier than she does.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.240
And that is a wrong--
that's not true.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.380
So without giving
anything away, there

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:59.550
is one character for whom class
politics becomes very, very

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.320
important.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:07.640
And I don't think that you can
make the statement that one

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.400
necessarily outweighs the other.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.800
But I do think that
it was important to me

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.570
to be writing about
someone who occupies

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:19.880
this sort of double
outsider status.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.000
Ingrid is not only woman,
but also a minority.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.780
And I do think that
when one occupies

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.240
that kind of double
outsider status

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.100
it certainly compounds things.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.490
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like personally the story

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.350
is only vaguely
autobiographical,

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:40.530
but how closely how closely do
the protagonist's experiences

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:44.970
at the law firm mirror
what you experienced there?

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.680
HELEN WAN: Oh, well
I definitely tried

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:52.340
to make the anecdotes
and the experiences that

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:55.030
happened to all of
the young lawyers

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:59.140
at the firm as
realistic as possible.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.040
I certainly did draw from
my own personal experiences

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.220
and the experiences
of-- I'm very

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:08.250
lucky to have a close
knit group of friends

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.930
who were very
forthcoming in sharing

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.540
their own personal real
life experiences in whatever

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.720
corporate setting they work in.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.390
Whether it's media or the
financial sector or tech.

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:25.157
They're not all
lawyers, but they do all

00:57:25.157 --> 00:57:26.240
work in corporate America.

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.230
And when we get together
and just in trusted company

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:34.250
and share stories,
it was amazing to me

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:38.240
how remarkably similar
a lot of our experiences

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.760
in corporate America
were and are.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.430
And so that was when some
of us would jokingly say,

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:45.930
someone should write
these all down.

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.230
Someone should write a book.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:53.610
And so I did start
writing them down.

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.760
So yes.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:01.200
The scenes that take place
in the book, while fiction,

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.350
I tried very hard to make
them as realistic as possible.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.684
And based on the kinds of things
that can and do still happen.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:11.610
AUDIENCE: Another question.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:14.100
So it sounds like writing
this but was something

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.660
of a calling based on your
experiences with life.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.370
But having written one book
of fiction, was it fun?

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.540
Would you do it again?

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.070
HELEN WAN: Oh yes, absolutely.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.370
Yes.

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:31.460
This has been a tremendous,
tremendous experience.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.585
I still kind of
feel like I'm having

00:58:34.585 --> 00:58:36.710
a great dream from which
I will wake up any moment.

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.880
Getting a text from a
friend being like, did

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.319
you know that your book is
reviewed in today's Wall Street

00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:45.610
Journal was kind of like, what?

00:58:48.155 --> 00:58:54.120
It has been just such a
tremendous learning experience.

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.710
I really like actually speaking
to student audiences the best.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.050
I mean, no offense to Google.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:04.330
But it's so gratifying when
you meet a young reader who

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:08.780
comes up, gets his or her
book signed, and tells you,

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.070
I wish I had been
able to read this book

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:15.880
when I was 17 at my boarding
school in Massachusetts,

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.311
because I would've
felt much less alone.

00:59:19.311 --> 00:59:20.810
That just totally
makes my whole day

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.070
and just makes me feel like wow.

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:23.570
OK.

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.630
The 12 years that I have
spent writing this book

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.530
may have been worth it,
if one person can tell me

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:36.220
that my book helped make them
feel a little less alone.

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:39.890
To a first-time novelist
there's no better compliment.

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:43.660
So yes, absolutely.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.040
I would write a book again.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.250
And I am working on book two.

00:59:49.367 --> 00:59:51.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming to chat with us.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.074
HELEN WAN: Thank you.

00:59:52.074 --> 00:59:54.580
AUDIENCE: So I though your
description of the law firm

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.400
diversity initiatives
was really funny.

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.020
And before I came here, I was
an M&amp;A associate at a big firm.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.420
And I remember those
sort of very ham-handed,

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.244
but in my opinion
well-intentioned--

01:00:06.244 --> 01:00:07.910
HELEN WAN: I think
well-intentioned too.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.284
AUDIENCE: At tempts
at diversity.

01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:11.780
Or promoting
diversity or some sort

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.030
of understanding
among colleagues.

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:16.040
So I was curious
as to your thoughts

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.360
on to what extent you can
ever do a diversity initiative

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.750
in a way that doesn't
seem like very silly

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:32.120
or doesn't end with
margaritas on Cinco de Mayo?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.330
HELEN WAN: I think that
yes, absolutely there

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:39.230
are-- as we were just came
out with the minority vendor

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.560
requirements, there
are great ways

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.160
and wrong ways to do diversity
efforts at law firms as well.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.680
Or companies, for that matter.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:57.150
And it's been interesting
that-- it is a novel,

01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:59.470
and this fictitious
firm is quite clearly

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:00.570
doing it the wrong way.

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:04.910
But only because they're doing
it not for the right reasons.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:09.220
The motivations are not genuine.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.174
But I am seeing a lot of law
firms where, as you said,

01:01:12.174 --> 01:01:13.590
it is incredibly
well-intentioned.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.500
They are doing, like a
lot of the initiatives

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.260
that I just described,
about trainings

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:30.240
on what are the tools that you
can use to actually identify

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.050
for yourself the
right mentor, sponsor.

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.720
Then how do you go and
organically cultivate

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.650
these relationships?

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.970
I've seen
culturally-specific trainings

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.580
geared at young
associates at law firms

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.910
to, for lack of a
better term, cultivate

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.450
what is your leadership style?

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.020
Cultivate an executive presence.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.010
Cultivate and develop your
personal brand/ and then make

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.260
sure you are projecting your
personal brand throughout

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.420
the company or firm.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.300
For example, if you are
young associate that

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.950
works in a satellite
office, how do you

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.500
make sure that your own
personal brand is not only

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.960
known to people who can help you
professionally at headquarters,

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.140
but throughout the rest of
the locations of the company?

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.680
I'm seeing a lot
of firms talking

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.400
about real hands-on trainings,
which obviously are far more

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.085
useful than drinks
on Cinco de Mayo.

01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:24.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.670
But those things are all sort
of facially diversity-neutral,

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:31.410
right?

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.290
Which I like.

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:37.690
It's like you, Asian
American associate,

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:40.570
have as much need for a
mentor who understands you

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:44.170
as this associate over here.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.115
Or maybe more so.

01:02:45.115 --> 01:02:46.490
You could argue
different things.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:52.780
But it isn't say Lunar Gala
dumplings sort of event.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.410
I was curious to
what extent do you

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:57.770
think even cognizing
of the concept,

01:02:57.770 --> 01:03:00.000
or discussing the
concept of diversity

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.260
puts people in a
different frame of mind?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.612
HELEN WAN: You mean to what
extent are you kind of,

01:03:07.612 --> 01:03:09.820
unfortunately, pigeonholing
when you even talk about,

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.450
hey here's a--

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:11.116
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:03:11.116 --> 01:03:13.962
When you walk into a
room and say, hey guys

01:03:13.962 --> 01:03:15.420
we're going to
celebrate diversity,

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.930
or we're going to
make sure that we

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.305
have a diverse
set of associates,

01:03:18.305 --> 01:03:20.470
that you've already
sort of separated

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:22.190
some people from others.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.840
HELEN WAN: Well
actually, I was just

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.810
talking about this
with someone who

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:30.000
works in the-- she is a
diversity and inclusion

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.420
officer at a law firm.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.220
And she said it
is for that reason

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.520
that now law firms are
incredibly, incredibly

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:42.840
careful to when they have a
culturally specific program

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.400
like that, like that
you're talking about,

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.390
the audience has to be
self-selecting, obviously.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:54.700
You can't just take the
roster of attorneys,

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.200
pick out all of the Chens
and Chos and Wongs and Wangs

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.847
and invite them
to a, hey, here's

01:04:01.847 --> 01:04:03.305
a program on to be
more aggressive.

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:10.810
One law firm actually recently
got into a bit of trouble

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:14.680
for disseminating a memo
to female-- you probably

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.770
know what I'm talking
about about-- attorneys

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:22.270
on certain tips that
were not taken kindly

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.650
by lot of the attorneys.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.220
So I think that a
lot of law firms

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.380
have done very, very
wise to the fact

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.800
that many people
may actually want

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.690
some of these culturally
specific trainings,

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:37.930
but the audience
has to self-select.

01:04:40.514 --> 01:04:41.180
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.755
Thank you.

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.050
AUDIENCE: One more question.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:45.800
Earlier when you were
answering a question

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.690
you mentioned vendors saying,
send these people to the beauty

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:51.335
pageant, and I was confused.

01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:52.460
I've never heard that term.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.900
Is that a [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.608
HELEN WAN: Sorry.

01:04:54.608 --> 01:04:56.740
That's a phrase
that pays for us.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.130
Beauty pageant is when a
client, let's say Google,

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.700
needs to hire outside
counsel for a particularly

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.180
large transaction
or other matter

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.840
and they are
interviewing law firms.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.370
And each law firm has to come
in an interview for the job,

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.260
for the gig.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.510
We call those beauty pageants.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.200
SUNNI YUEN: It's
pitching, basically.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.790
HELEN WAN: It's
a business pitch.

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:21.660
And you would be
surprised-- maybe you

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.990
wouldn't be surprised-- how
many times a senior woman

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:32.690
or a senior African American,
Latina, or Asian American

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.270
partner gets sent to
that business pitch

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.460
but yet, curiously,
doesn't work on the matter.

01:05:40.412 --> 01:05:41.340
SUNNI YUEN: All right.

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.370
Great.

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.422
So thank you, Helen,
for coming in.

01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:45.630
HELEN WAN: Thank you so much.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:48.080
I had so much fun being here.
