And the thing is all three are correct.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.740
So, 40 throws, no six, the chances of that are actually smaller than 0.1%,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.910
but that does not mean that it can't happen.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.510
So, it can happen by pure chance.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.590
Of course, you could also have the case that

00:00:14.590 --> 99:59:59.000
something is wrong with the die or somebody is cheating.
