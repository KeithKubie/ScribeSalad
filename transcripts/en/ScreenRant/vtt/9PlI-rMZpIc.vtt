00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.360
J.J. Abrams spent months putting the finishing
touches on Star Wars: The Force Awakens and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.139
didn’t lock down the final picture until
November.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.060
During post-production, he had to sort through
hours of footage in order to deliver a film

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.090
that would please the fans.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.169
As you might expect, a lot of stuff was left
on the cutting room floor.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.009
Here are 10 Star Wars The Force Awakens Scenes
You've Never Seen.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.009
SPOILER ALERT!

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.009
Stop watching now if you haven’t seen The
Force Awakens!

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.009
A Lightsaber in Space

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.269
For a while, it was rumored that the opening
shot of The Force Awakens would be the disembodied

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.129
hand of Luke Skywalker, clenching his blue
lightsaber floating through space towards

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.129
a planet.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.130
That shot was actually in the script and was
meant to be the first image following the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.540
text crawl before the opening sequence on
Jakku.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.320
The scene was cut late in the game, most likely
because the lightsaber was headed towards

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.920
Takodana, and NOT Jakku.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.480
It essentially is not related to the main
action of the first scene, so its inclusion

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.080
didn’t make a whole lot of sense anyway.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
Constable Zuvio

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.280
New character Constable Zuvio lives on the
planet Jakku and tries to keep peace and order

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280
in Niima Outpost.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.940
He was featured in some marketing materials,
and even got his own action figure.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.589
But he’s missing from the final film.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380
That’s because his one scene was cut.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.690
He was supposed to come to Rey’s aid when
Unkar Plutt’s thugs attack her to snag BB-8,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.670
“breaking up the tussle” and settling
the issue with the scavenger.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.440
Instead, it’s Finn who encounters Rey during
her fight with the thugs, setting the movie’s

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440
plot in motion.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.711
The film probably flowed better that way.

00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:20.711
Maz Kanata Uses the Force

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:21.711
Based on her dialogue from the trailers, many
fans assumed that Maz Kanata would be some

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.960
kind of Force user and help the young protagonists
tap into their potential.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.470
While she does believe in the Force, Maz is
never shown actually using it.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.580
But in a different cut of the film, she revealed
herself as a secret Jedi.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.760
When the First Order attacks her castle on
Takodana, she uses the Force to make the ceiling

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.470
collapse on a group of unsuspecting stormtroopers.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.900
The bit even got Han Solo involved, as he
had to stall the soldiers so Maz could concentrate.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.270
This would have been a fun little moment in
a film full of them.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.010
Unkar Plutt on Takodana

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.990
Fans learn that Rey and Finn steal the Millennium
Falcon from Unkar Plutt in their escape from

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.850
Jakku, and the junk dealer is none too pleased
about that.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.140
He tracks them down and finds them at Maz’s
castle and confronts Rey in an attempt to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.140
get it back.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
Chewbacca comes to defend Rey, and after Plutt
makes a joke about Chewie’s arm injury,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.580
the Wookie literally rips Plutt’s arm out
of its socket, a call back to Han’s words

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.100
of advice to C-3PO in the original film.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.409
Star Wars is no stranger to dismembered limbs,
but this was probably too graphic even for

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.760
them, and having Plutt randomly pop up in
the second act may have slowed the pacing

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760
down.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.510
Maz at the Resistance Base

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.400
It was a scene millions of fans dissected
in the second teaser: Maz Kanata handing over

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.879
Luke’s old lightsaber to Leia.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.749
But it didn’t show up in the finished film.

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.189
Abrams stated that it was cut because there
wasn’t anything for Maz to do story wise

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.530
when she arrived at the Resistance base with
the others.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.349
The script was retooled so Maz remained on
Takodana and Finn took the lightsaber with

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.730
him when the group left the planet.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.489
As great as Maz was it’s better she wasn’t
just standing around without a purpose during

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.760
the third act.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.019
Kylo Ren on the Millennium Falcon

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.659
Fans learn that villain Kylo Ren is actually
Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo and Princess

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.659
Leia.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.069
That means he probably made a few fond childhood
memories aboard the Millennium Falcon, a theory

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.279
supported by this deleted scene.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.639
When he senses his father near on Starkiller
base, Kylo finds the Falcon outside in the

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.980
snow, and boards the ship.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.879
He sits in the cockpit and says, “Han Solo.”

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.370
It’s a nice, quiet moment for the character
that would have been an interesting inclusion

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.370
in the film.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.169
But it arguably slows down the rapid fire
pace, which is most likely why it was cut.

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:13.239
General Leia’s Intro

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.299
Leia’s official first appearance in the
film is a touching reunion with Han Solo,

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.379
but she originally was going to show up much
earlier.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.000
In a cut sequence, she has a conversation
with Korr Sella, who Leia sends to the Galactic

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.370
Senate to ask for aid in the Resistance’s
fight against the First Order.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.580
The scene would have cleared up one of the
more confusing elements of the movie – the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.069
political landscape of the galaxy – and
given viewers a clearer idea of what happened

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.090
during the Starkiller base’s attack on the
Hosnian system.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.670
Like so many deleted scenes, it was likely
removed for pacing issues.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.139
Rey’s Extended Force Vision

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.469
When on Takodana, Rey is called to Luke’s
lightsaber and has a Force vision detailing

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:49.900
the past and future.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.389
Originally, it was a bit longer.

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.770
The sequence was going to include the moment
where Vader chops off Luke’s hand in The

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.459
Empire Strikes Back, and Hasbro even produced
action figures of the two characters.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.449
Even more intriguing was an explanation of
how the lightsaber ended up at Maz’s castle,

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.180
showing it get discovered and passed along
over the years.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.749
In the final film, the lightsaber question
is brushed off as one saved for another day,

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.450
so hopefully fans will get the full story.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.450
Snowspeeder Chase

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.920
The Force Awakens had plenty of action sequences,
but it could have had one more.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.419
There was a snowspeeder chase that took place
outside the Starkiller base involving Finn,

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.560
Rey, and some First Order stormtroopers.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.230
Vehicles from the chase were produced for
the Force Awakens toy line, and the sequence

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.909
even appears in the novelization.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.229
While it would have been an exciting set piece,
it’s difficult to say where it would have

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.680
fit in during the finished film.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.180
It doesn’t appear to serve the story during
the climactic third act, which would have

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.500
been the wrong way to go.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.470
We’ll take the finales we got in the theatrical
cut.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.009
Vader’s Sentiment

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.210
Supreme Leader Snoke is a mysterious figure,
but one thing we do know about him is his

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.770
understanding of galactic history.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.460
He saw the rise and fall of the Empire, and
believes it was not poor strategizing that

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.460
was their downfall.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.360
He blames Darth Vader’s love for his son,
Luke, for why the Imperials failed.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.320
Snoke and Kylo Ren talk about that fateful
moment and how it was a “momentary lapse”

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.800
for an otherwise great man.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.150
A key part of Kylo’s training is to detach
himself from his family attachments, leading

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.620
to his emotional confrontation with Han Solo.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.410
How far Snoke goes with this remains to be
seen.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.629
Those are the Force Awakens deleted scenes
we think should have made the final cut but

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.570
let us know if we missed any in the comments
below!

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.300
