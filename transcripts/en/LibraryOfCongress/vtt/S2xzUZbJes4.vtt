00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Our
guest today is Dan Chaon.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.310
&gt;&gt; Chaon: Chaon.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Dan Chaon.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.960
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.260
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, thank you, Ron.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.470
I'm really excited to be next to
one of those endangered species,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.230
the book editor, which
is incredible.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.030
I'm glad to be able to just like
touch you while you're still here.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
finding a panda in the wild.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.850
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: It is.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.450
I'm glad to me you finally

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.140
because you've been scaring
the hell out of me for years.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.830
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Thank
you, my pleasure.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're the kind of
person who says, "I always wanted

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.420
to write a serial killer
novel," yeah.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.380
Dan is the author of three
short-story collections

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.140
and three novels, including "Among
the Missing," which is a finalist

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.440
for the National Book Award.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.080 position:56%
His stories have appeared everywhere
including the best American short

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.350
stories, Pushcart Prize Anthology,
the O 'Henry Prize Anthology.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.880
He teaches Writing at Oberlin
College in Ohio and his new novel,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.760
which is fantastic and completely
unnerving is called, "Ill Will."

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.280
Some of the scariest
writers in the country think

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.200
that you are really freaky like
Peter Straub, Stephen King.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.170 position:56%
They all think you're terrifying and
you said once, "I've always thought

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.270
of myself as a kind of
ghost-story horror writer."

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.540
What draws you to those
kind of stories?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.840
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I don't know.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.880
I think I've always been interested
in scary things since I was little,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.710
and I mean I suppose there's an
element where if you're the creator

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.620
of the scary things, then the
scary things won't get you.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.220
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.190
I mean it's like the person who
makes the haunted house knows

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.420
where the ghosts are hidden.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Was something
scary in your youth that made you?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.080
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I grew up in
western Nebraska, so that's --

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, yeah.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.680
It's scary enough.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.980
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- it's scary enough.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.030 position:56%
I mean I also think if you have
some element of trauma in your life,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.740
there's kind of dialysis
that happens with scary stuff

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.050
that it sort of gets the
poison out in some ways.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
find it cathartic

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.470
to write these scary stories.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.590
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes and to read them.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: As a child,
were you drawn to scary stories?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Very much so.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.810
I used watch "Night
Gallery" with my mother.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, yeah.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.410
That was spooky stuff.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.930
We're about the same
age, I think, yeah.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.230
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There are
moments in your novels

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.810
where suddenly one the
characters realizes

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.520
that what he thought was happening
is not really what's happening,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.870
which is sort of traditional
in these kind of stories,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.200
but what you do so well for
the reader, is make us realize

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.580
that we thought was happening
is not really happening.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.880
It is amazing technique.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.980
Do you plan your novels out because
some of them like "Ill Will,"

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.710
seem so complex to me that I
wonder what kind of, you know,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.280
massive plan you must
have on the wall.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.020
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I don't plan
anything out in the first round.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: At all.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: it just happens.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.890
Dan Chaon: I just happens, and
that's how, for me, there's a kind

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.080
of excitement in discover as things
go along and as just things emerge.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.190 position:56%
So with this particular novel, I did
not have any idea who the killer was

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.490
and so I got to the end and then I
had to go back and do a draft and,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.640
you know, do a redraft and sort
of make things work together

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.430
as best I could, so, yeah.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We live in a
time between literary fiction

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.350
and genre fiction seem
really porous.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.030
People cross back and
forth all the time.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.890
You write, what we would
call, "a literary thriller."

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.300
It's kind of a tortured term.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: It is.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But do you think
about genre when you're writing?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.720
Do you think, "I'm now
writing a thriller.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.680
I am now writing a literary novel?"

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.390
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I think
of genre in that I came

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.670
out of genre-oriented childhood.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.000
The stuff that I started reading
like Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.340
Stephen King, Peter Straub.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.800
And that was my first love
and then when I got to college

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.930
and it started turning in the
stories in my creative class,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.140
they were like, "We
don't really do this."

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.150 position:56%
And so then I discovered people
like Raymond Carver and Alice Monroe

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.300
and I started to sort of
like using them as models,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.250
but I found once I started
writing professionally,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.340
I was still really attracted to
that stuff that I read as a kid

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.460
and the stuff that most
influence and I found myself sort

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.200
of going back to that
with maybe this

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.690
"literary aspect" in my as well.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.110
So I mean it feels like
it was just part of my DNA

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.410
from the beginning as a writer.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.790
Ron Charles: And a bunch of
talented people are now doing this.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.090
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
a great exciting time.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.690
It was silly to separate
that stuff out.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.230
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I think so too.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When we start
reading a mystery though,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.550 position:56%
there is a contract with the reader.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.090
You know where this is going.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.390
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes, I do.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We expect to
at least by the end of mystery

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.220
to have the mystery solved.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.520
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You cheat.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.680
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I do not
think -- I mean, look --

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.590
I mean for people that want -- I
mean we won't exactly do spoilers.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, we aren't
going to do any spoilers.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.190
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, spoilers at all?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
you do not play fair.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.790
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: You're right.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.930
Okay, in some ways, I don't play
fair but I think there are answers

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.410
for people that want a
very specific answer.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:45.170
There are answers for people
that want a supernatural answer

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.240
and it's also sort of not fair
for the reader to expect a book

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.130
that keeps telling them this is all

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.570
about the way the truth
gets distorted

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.380
and the memory makes
no sense to expect --

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
everything to be laid out --

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.760
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- everything
to be laid out at the end.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No,
it is not, not at all,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.790
which makes me think the planning
issue must be really complex

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.480
as you go back through your review.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.960
Let's talk about this new
novel specifically, "Ill Will."

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.490
It's about a psychologist
named, Dustin.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.420
You write, "His brain seemed murky
with circling and unfocused dread,"

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.540
which could describe
anyone in Washington now.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.670
Dustin is under a tremendous
amount of stress.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.970
His wife is dying.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.360
His son is spiraling
into heroin addiction.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.600
A number of young men
in the area are drowning

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.690
and his adopted brother is being
released from prison after 30 years

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.550
because of testimony
that he gave in court,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.150
which he now realizes
provably wasn't true.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.640
That's a really bad year.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.940
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why
pile so much on Dustin?

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.960
What sort of psychological vice
are you trying to create there?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.120
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: You know, it didn't
start out to be piling on Dustin.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.400
I just started out with,
you know, like okay,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.700
here's an interesting situation

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.760
and here's a second interesting
situation, but I realized

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.340
as I was going along that Dustin
was in such a cloud and in --

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.310
I feel he's sort of the
stand-in for a lot of us.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.390
I mean he's got so many blinders
on that it's going to take a lot

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.860 position:56%
of hammers and gongs to wake him up.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.600
I don't even know whether he
actually wakes up at the end.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I don't
think he wakes up, no.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.030
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, but we
did our best to wake him.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.420
I mean he's a psychologist
who's totally taken

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.720
in by one of this patients.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.020
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which is
standard psychological --

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.210
I mean he should be equipped
not to do that, right?.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.990
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: He should be.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:49.340 position:56%
He is a particular kind of
psychologist -- he's pretty new agy.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.730
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: And he
also has, I think,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.270
a tendency to believe his own --

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.920
I don't think we can use
the word, "horse pokey."

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, okay
but the patient who comes

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.650
to him eventually sort of
seduces him into becoming part

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.520
of this investigation
to solve these crimes?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.820
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.430
I heard somebody used the term,
"folie á deux," a French term

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.280 position:56%
which means a madness of two people,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.330
where two people get
together and get --

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's a great term.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.090
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, and, you know,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.150
where one person's madness
feeds the other person.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.850
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: But in another
way, I think if I'd written this

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.670
from the patient's perspective, it
would have been a romantic comedy.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh,
seducing the therapist?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.540
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, I
mean -- it's just the --

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.660
yeah, it's kind of a horror
novel from the other perspective.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.640
You write a lot about --
I can't remember the term,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.120
but sexually repressed memories
or memories of sexual abuse.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.420
There is a term.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.420
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: It's -- yes,
it's satanic ritual abuse.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.020
I'd never heard of such a thing.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.500
I had read about those cases,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.220
but I didn't realize
it was a clinical term

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.270
that eventually became
sort of debunked.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.060
I mean -- I think it's--

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This was in the 70s?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.760
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: It was in the 80s.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.890
It was in the 80s and 90s.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Cases, you
remember them where, you know,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.390
these kids would start to testify

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.240
that their daycare worker had
abused them and then, you know,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.840
all 30 kids would recall
having been abused.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.220
They were increasingly
bizarre stories.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.900
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I mean I
think it was during a period

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.720
when we were trying to come
to terms with this concept

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.420
that childhood sexual
abuse was happening.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.360
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: And I think it was
a lot easier for a lot of people

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.720
to believe that they was a shadowy
network of Satanist doing it

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.860 position:56%
as opposed to a family member, which
is what the case is most often.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.690
So this gets you into this whole
idea of how memory is distorted,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.430
how we create our own
past, how foggy that is.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.730
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This
is a fascinating issue

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.470
for a novelist who's creating
everything from scratch.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.770
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well,
it's a fascinating issue

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.180
for anybody who's trying
to sort out who they are

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.230
and where they came from, and I
think we've all had the experience

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.950
of being at the Thanksgiving
table and talking about something

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.750
that happened to us when we were
a child and having our cousin

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.920 position:56%
or our brother saying, "No, actually

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.420
that wasn't what had
happened at all."

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes or we project
ourselves into photographs.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.560
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We
couldn't have remembered.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.160
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.460 position:56%
My sister still claims she remembers
things that happened to her

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.890
when she was three and I
just don't believe her.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: But, you know, that's
not to say that things don't happen,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.720
but that we build our sense of
identity around particular memories

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.180
and we shape those memories

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.100
to confirm what we
believe about ourselves.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: We may repress
memories of bad things that happened

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.620
to us but we may also repress
memories of bad things that we did.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.090
I think that's often more
likely, where if there's something

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.640
that we did that kind of
goes against who we think

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.340
of ourselves as, you know, we
tend to forget about those things.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.650
So it may have been that you were
a horrible bully as a child --

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I think I was.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.380
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- but do you know?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.260
Ask your little sister?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So much of
this now is how we think --

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.230
how we come to think we know
what we are -- who we are and --

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.530
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
how distorted that is.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.530
You write, "Most people seem to
believe that they were the experts

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.380
of their own life story, that
they had a set of memories,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.390 position:56%
that they strung like beads and
this necklace told a sensible tale."

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.180
That's not the case of course.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:55.910
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I think we live
several hundred thousands hours

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:03.330
of time, you know, and of that how
much we remember is pretty limited

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.080
and of those memories,
the ones that we choose

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.280
when we create our biography
is even more limited.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.530
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: So what we're
doing is we're picking

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:18.240
and choosing what parts of our life
really represent our conception

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.540
of us.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
novelist reading a story --

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.310
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- it
makes some sense to us.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.910
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Most of
the time, it makes sense.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.970
&lt;&lt; Ron Charles: Yeah and
Dustin, as a psychotherapist,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.300
is all about getting beneath
those things -- those conceptions.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:41.740
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right, but Dustin has
an idea that we choose the stories

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.980
that we -- we choose the
meaning of the stories

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.380
that we tell about ourselves.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.190
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: So I think he
says early on to a patient

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:57.420
that the stories that we
tell ourselves having meaning

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.470 position:56%
because we choose to give it to them

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.820
and what meaning we choose
to give it is up to us.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That
seems naïve to me.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, it is, but he's
had success with this kind of --

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- quackery.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.810
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, it is
quackery but there seems

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.050
to be a lot of that even today.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.560
Yeah. Grief runs through the novel.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.760
It's a distorting force
in the novel.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.030
It's certainly a distorting
force in Dustin's life.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.010
It's been a terrible
force in your own life.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.310
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You could
have written a memoir.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.980
You may some day.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.280
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, I never will.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You never will.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.980
My question then is why
did you choose to write

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.030
about the horrible experience
in your own life in terms

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.000
of fiction instead of
in terms of nonfiction?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.250
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I think -- my
wife died in 2008 and afterwards,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:59.790 position:56%
you know, I had a really rough time,
and I was interested in figuring

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:06.110
out a way to write about that and
to write about the kind of feeling

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:12.570
of losing control or going
adrift without writing something

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.340
that was autobiographical, and
also writing about it in a way

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:25.420 position:56%
that allowed me to kind of let it go
a little wilder than I actually did.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.860
I mean I stayed pretty like
grounded through the whole thing,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.010
even though, in my head, I was like
kind of running around screaming

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:40.620
and killing chickens but
the novel kind of allowed me

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.120
to explore the further edges of it,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.100
and I guess that's what
I mean by dialysis.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.710
That horror can create a
certain kind of dialysis

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.630
and that exploring this stuff in a
genre context allows you to ake it

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.580
to the extremes that maybe it
feels like it sometimes as opposed

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.840
to what happens in real life.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.140
I don't think a memoir

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.100
of my experience would
really do that much.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It would
just be living it again.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.350
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah and it would
also be like he sat looking

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.040
at the window and then
the next day --

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You were
right about the memoir.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.480
I have no doubt about it,
but I can see emotionally,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.500
it wouldn't be the same at all
as writing about it in fiction.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.800
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.680
I mean I do think that finding
this particular container

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.080 position:56%
for things, which is a horror novel.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.750
It's a serial killer novel
and it's, in some ways,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.770
it feels like the right
emotional container for it even

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.320
if it's not an autobiographical
container.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In certain parts of
the book and it's hard to explain

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.580 position:56%
but you started to write in columns.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.260 position:56%
There were three columns across the
page and there are different voices.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.230
Sometimes it seems like
maybe it's the same person

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.530
with two different voices.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.410
It's really complicated and
really cool and you have to sort

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.510
of teach yourself how to read it.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.880
How did you come to that?

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I actually
started out with an exercise

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.320 position:56%
that I had my students do, which was
to write a story that was contained

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.030
in boxes and I got that idea
from a chapter of Jennifer Egan

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.610
"Visit from the Goon squad."

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.850
It's the chapter that's
written in PowerPoint.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.150
Do you remember that?

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I do very well.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.960
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: And so I had my
students doing this exercise.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.700
I loved what they were doing.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What do
you mean boxes though?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.910
I don't understand.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.820
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I just had
them make six boxes on a page

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.430
and I told them each box had
to contain one scene, so --

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- of the same -

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.110
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- of the same story.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: So I just loved what
I was getting from them out of this.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.710
I mean it seemed like there was
a really nice kind of interplay

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.340
between the scenes that
were put together on a page,

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.240
and then I was like, Oh, this
is what comics do, right?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.440
Comics have these boxes that
have an interplay between them

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.030
and sometimes it's time
and sometimes it's space,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:21.540
and sometimes it's a
different perspective

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:28.580
but I was really fascinated by the
way having something side by side

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.730
on the page could create
some kind of interplay

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:38.770
and I could replay the same
scene with some contradictions

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:43.390
or replay the scene from
slightly different perspective,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.970
and I like that.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
very fascinating.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I really found it fun.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.800
I was aware -- my editor was
like, "This is kind of difficult."

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.510
I think it's -- I mean I
don't think it's that hard.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
not the whole novel.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.110
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.410
It's not the whole novel.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.710
It's just parts of it.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
a very cool effect.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.310
Very unnerving too as you read
these and they are just sort

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.610
of sometimes slightly different.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.910
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But I can see
your editor would push back.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.510 position:56%
Also it's a layout problem for them.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.810
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Oh, my God, yes --

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- because
of the line up line --

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.410
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: The typesetting
was crazy.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's tough.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.140
Jennifer Egan was here a
few months ago talking about

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.830
and she gave her draft, and "Visit
from Goon Squad" [inaudible]

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.470
about her writing her group
and someone told her she had

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.850 position:56%
to drop the PowerPoint chapter
because it just doesn't work at all.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.150
It's my chapter.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.570
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Exactly
-- it's famous now.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.720
It reminded me of sort of
the movie, "Split Screen."

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.020
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
don't see it that often.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And it made me
think how constraining the page is.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.670
I mean we all just expect that
and why should it be that way?

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:43.970
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I don't know.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.270
I'm jealous of poets
because they get

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.570
to use the page all over the place.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.560
And novelists, we expect them to
just write in prose like that.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.620
Elizabeth Stout was here earlier
today and she wrote an essay

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.310
for "The Post" last week and she
said, "It was until she wrote

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.710
"The Burgess Boys" in 2013

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.720
that I fully realized what
I was doing with class."

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.470
You had said something
very similar recently.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.130
You told an interviewer,
"I've come to realize

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.400
that social class is
actually my big subject."

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.330
What kind of upbringing
did you have?

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.980
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I grew
up in western Nebraska.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.220
My dad was a construction
worker and, you know,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.770
I would say it was a
working class childhood.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:36.390
Neither of my parents finished
high school and it was sort of both

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:42.590 position:56%
of my parents had done better than
their own families in a lot of ways.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.830
On my mother's side, particularly,
it was sort of on the edge

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.960
of criminal class or,
you know, what I mean.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:58.920
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: So I feel like I
had a very like intense experience

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.950
like moving western Nebraska,

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.890
where I was the first
person to go to college.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.520
I went to Northwestern, which is a
fairly well-to-do school in Chicago

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.790
and then I became a college
professor, and a writer.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.920
There are a lot of distances
and steps between that.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did it seem
like real work to your dad?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:27.390
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, but, you know,
I think it was also just puzzling.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:35.450
I think it was hard for
people to imagine it.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:42.690
I mean I had a lot of cognitive
distance myself because, you know,

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.390
there were things where
I would be in a situation

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.980
that I would not have any kind

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.080
of real familiarity
with how to deal with --

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- how to behave.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.900 position:56%
What draws you to the subject class?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.450
What do you think that's a such
a central issue in your fiction?

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.830
When we think of you, we think
of the more flashier things

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.870
like the horror, and the
suspense and all that,

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.250
but there are these deeper things.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.570
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I think class is a
big issue in America and I think --

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you think it's
as big in America in fiction though?

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.050
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, I don't.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why is that?

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:19.230
Is it because our fiction is all
written by upper class professors?

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.300
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, I
don't think necessarily

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:30.420
but I think we romanticize class
in a certain way and I think --

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:38.110
that there's a question of betrayal
that's involved because I think

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:45.660
if you portray like the movement
from, you know, a working class

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.970
or a poor class background to
a more well-to-do background,

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:58.960
you're in some way betraying the
romantic notions of like rural life

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.850
and rural class life, the
Bruce Springsteen stuff gets --

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:08.250
we're not supposed to
problem-atize that stuff.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So
we just ride it out.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.880
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah --

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Make it invisible.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.480
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.970
I mean or else we take it
in a more gothic direction.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:25.150
I mean I think, for example,
"Winter's Bone" is a great book

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:30.390
about class, but there's no
movement out of that class.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did
you read "Brewster?"

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes, a wonderful book.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A spectacular book
about people stuck in a lower class.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.970
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No movement
out of that either except

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.700
for the narrator I guess
who's looking back.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.140
Stupid question, but what would you

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.420
like to see more in
American fiction?

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.790
What would you like to see
to represent more freely,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.770
or more accurately or more fully?

00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:02.820
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well,
we need more diversity

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.040
of voices all across the scale.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.360
I mean I think that there is a
tendency sometimes, you know,

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.240
like to look to the last big thing
and want to see a repeat of that.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.380
We have a certain kind
of expectation

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:27.910
about literary fiction
should be and, you know.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.890 position:56%
To me, there's not really a
distinction between literary fiction

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.870
and genre fiction because literary
fiction is, itself, a genre.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.450
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: And it's a genre
with very, very like rigid tropes.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.260
I'd like to see that the genre

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.460
of literary fiction get
broke a little bit more.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.160
Ad I think that's happening
to some extent.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes and you're
helping it happen too I should say.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.700 position:56%
You started as a short-story writer?

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.530 position:56%
I understand you were pretty nervous
about going to the long form.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: It's hard to move

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.290
between the short story
and the novel.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You can [inaudible]
the story all at once I imagine;

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.970
whereas the novel, as you
said, you can't and you don't.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.270
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I can't and I don't.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:13.500 position:56%
I mean I think almost all my novels
have an element a short-story writer

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.880
novels because they're broken into
pieces and they tend to have a lot

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.570
of stand-alone chapters
and I also tend to write

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.960
from multiple perspectives
I think in all my novels

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.340
so that I have these very
discreet short-story like chapters

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.570
that have helped me kind
of make the transition.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
camouflage that so well.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.170
I would've never thought of that.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.340 position:56%
I mean there are writers whose
novels are clearly just a collection

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.640
of short stories.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.940
That's not you.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.240
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No --

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
neither [inaudible] mine.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.840
Is this still what you're doing?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.140
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I mean I
think a lot of the novels started

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.220
out with short stories like
working parts and then I kind

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.380
of sewed them together slowly.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Definitely
-- very, very well.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, thank you.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now you teach
Creative Writing in Oberlin?

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.530
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I heard
you are immensely popular.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.130
I don't mean to embarrass you.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.470
It's what I'm hearing online.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.220
What makes for a successful
Creative Writing teacher?

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:12.030
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I think being open
to a variety of possibilities

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:17.480
in student work and, again,
not having a clear view

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:23.820
of what the final results should be
and being open to the possibilities

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.240
that students can discover
some new aspect of themselves

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.800
as they go along and they can
discover things through writing.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:38.810 position:56%
I mean the writing is this process
of not just following a set of rules

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.850
but a process of discovering
yourself

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.540
and discovering what you
want to know and what you do.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.600
I mean I think that's the
greatest thing about writing is

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.090
that you can't always know what's
real until you've written it down.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do
you find yourself --

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.900
I mean I had writing teachers
who would not accept any genre.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.010
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I imagine you're not
that sort of [inaudible] teacher.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.930
--

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.230
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- you accept
lots of different things.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.160
Not to call into question
your profession,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.950
but can you teach someone
to write better?

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.180
Can you teach someone to
write a better short story?

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.480
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yes.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You can?

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.080
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.990
Yeah, I mean I think anybody
can write a good short story.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.940
You can't teach somebody
to want to do it though.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.130
That seems to be the trick, right,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:32.180
I mean because it requires
all kinds of sacrifices.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.040
The first sacrifice is
like you need to want

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.870
to spend a lot of time by yourself.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.470
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: And you need to want
to spend a lot of time thinking

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:47.070
about an imaginary world that
when you're writing should take

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.140
precedence over the world that
you're currently living in.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.870
A lot of people really
don't want to do that.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's tough
when you're 21 years old.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.480
The world is such a great place.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.040
When I was teaching,
which was a long time ago,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.730
my students wouldn't read enough.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.000
They all wanted to write but
they wouldn't read anything.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.300
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is
this still a problem?

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.550
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I teach in Oberlin
College and it's not a problem.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: People are readers.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.270
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: They are readers.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.000
[inaudible] And they like
to read and I still think

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.700
that reading is an important
part of people's lives.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.080
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: You know, I don't
meet that many students who want

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:34.010
to be writers who haven't come to
that through a love of reading,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.860
right, because you have to
have the origin story --

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.330
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- origin
story, I'm sorry.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.300
It's always coming
from, "I read this book.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.930
It changed my life.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.410
It made me feel something
that I've never felt before

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.110
and I want to do that myself."

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, yes.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.900
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I mean you sometimes
get kids who want to be filmmakers

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.160
and they don't realize that until
they get to class, you know --

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.760
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- they realize

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.440
that what they were really
inspired by was by movies or TV.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.040
Who teaches you?

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.400
Who do you look to?

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.700
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: God --

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You read a lot.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.300
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I read a lot.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.600
I do read a lot.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.100
I mean people that I've loved
recently I mean Jennifer Egan is

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.400
certainly one of them.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: She has a new book.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.000
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I know.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.300
I'm super excited about it.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.050
the person who just
talked to, Jesmyn Ward,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.830
I think she's a fantastic writer.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: She's
a beautiful writer.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.620
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I really like
this guy, Victor LaValle --

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, yeah.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.470
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- I haven't read
his book, but I really like --

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: He
writes some fantasies.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.950
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.280
I mean it's hard to categorize.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It is.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.880
[Inaudible]

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.600
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Kelly Link I think
has a big impression on me.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, she
is incredibly clever.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.740
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you take
some questions from the audience?

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I will.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There
are two mics here.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.940
Just come up to the mic.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.620
It's very bright, so
wave your hand around.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.920
It's hard to see you.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.220
Yes, sir.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker: How you doing?

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.820
Ron, I love your work.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.330
I look forward to your
10 best books every year.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you very much.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Dan, you
mentioned genre.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.840
You talked a little
bit about genre before.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.480
I think one of the best
things about your books is

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.360
that they don't read like genre.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.130
It's a good -- it's not a
good serial killer book,

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.860
it's just a good book, but
I'm wondering when you write,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.140
are sort of aware of
sidestepping genre cliches?

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.320
Are you trying not to
sound like thriller?

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.520
Or is it the other
way, do you embrace it?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.980
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Well, I mean I
think with this particular book,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:42.000
I knew the points that I needed
to hit for a serial killer.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.550
I mean there are definitely
moments that are kind of expected

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:53.140
and so I wanted to build those in
even when I was also doing a kind

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.160
of end run around, at
least some of them.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.150
I mean what I was looking at
was that I had the skeleton

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.570
of that genre and that I was
putting a different kind of need

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.300
on the bones of that skeleton
if that makes any sense.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You read
this book, "Ill Will?"

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Yes.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You did?

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Yeah.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you think
it was incredibly freaky?

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Then at the end,

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.320
did you find yourself
being really panicky?

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker: You're absolutely
right about the columns.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.500
That's freaky.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.800
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Thank you.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's like a really
powerful psychological effect.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.870
To do that words, it
seems amazing to me.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.170
Yes, sir.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Hi, Dan.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.770
Thanks so much for being here.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.830
A lot of writers that
I've heard today tend

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.200
to have a unique environment so
they go into when they're composing

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.460
and when they're actually
doing their work,

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:47.470
and so what I've heard today is a
lot of the writers like to listen

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.080
to music while they're working.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.810
Can you describe a little bit
what your writing environment is

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.110
typically like?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:56.020
And if you listen to
music, who do you listen to?

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.020
Who's on your playlist?

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.320
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Oh, wow!

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.280
I have an attic that I work in.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.000
I usually work late at night.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.820
I usually start working around 11
and go until about three or four.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.320
I started doing that just
because when I had little kids,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.350
it was the best time to have quiet.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.760
I do listen to music.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:25.400
I usually make a playlist of, you
know, between 10 and like 50 songs

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.220
that I'll run through and they'll
be kind of a form of self-hypnosis

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.300
because I'll listen
to them so often --

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- they
don't distract you anymore.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.850
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- they
don't distract anymore.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.000
Some of the music that was on the

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.680
"Ill Will" playlist included
Modest Mouse song called,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.060
"Strangers to ourselves"
that is super important to me

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:58.350
and Beach House, the band Red
House Painters/Mark Kozelek.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.700
I guess that's probably enough.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's very
cool to hear those titles.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.810 position:56%
Did you publish that list somewhere?

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:11.010
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, I think
it's on "Large hearted Boy."

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay, I had to ask.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.890 position:56%
He's very clever with those stories.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.080
You've never been in a
sensory deprivation tank?

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.780
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, I've
watched people.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.380
It's part of the novel.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.830
That's why I'm asking.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.710
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I have like
serious claustrophobia

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.830
and it would never work for me

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.690
but I have watched the
terrifying You Tube videos

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.250
of people enjoying that experience.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
book does nothing

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.790
to promote sensory
deprivation tanks.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:46.970
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: No, it
depends on whose preceptive.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Anybody else?

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.560
Anything at all?

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.650
Yes, sir.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker: You were talking
about you had characters

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:12.760
who were unreliable, narrators
and tricks of memory and so forth.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.390
Were you inspired at
all by Edgar Allan Poe?

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.690
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Oh, absolutely.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.020
I don't think there's any American

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.220
who isn't inspired
by Edgar Allan Poe.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:30.960
I mean for -- I think speaking
of sensory deprivation tanks.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.340
I was probably very, very
inspired by Poe when it came

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:43.050
to that particular -- the
particular kind of claustrophobia.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.240
One of my favorite Poe stories
the "The Cask of Amontillado," --

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
so terrifying.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.850
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: -- which is with a
kind of -- what do you call that?

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's when
he crawls into the hole

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.310
in the wall and no response.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.610
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And the story ends.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.210
It's terrifying.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker: What about Ligeia --

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.810
what about Ligeia or
any of these stories?

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Ligeia,
how does Ligeia end?

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.810
Remind us.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Well, anyway, I can't.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.810
It would sort of be a spoiler.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.450
I just want to know if
his work is [inaudible].

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.750
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, I see
a lot of Poe in his work.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Okay.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, sir.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Glad to hear you
bringing up Jennifer Egan.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.090
I saw her in Arlington,
which is near here.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.610
You don't live here and told
her I listened to her audio book

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:40.720
and she said to me, "You list
this PowerPoint chapter thing

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.120
and if you have a CD,
it's on a CD ROM,"

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.390
and you can see it, of
course, so I never --

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.690
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.990
I had the same experience.

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.290
I listened to it first in the car.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:50.590
I didn't get it.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker: I then told her.

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.190
I said, "I didn't quite" -- so
I've never gone back to the book.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.040
I probably should but I'm
reminded of that because I listed

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.150
to "Ill Will" here as an audio
book and a friend of mine said,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.450
"You really need to read the paper.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.440 position:56%
It's got some weird stuff going on."

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.670
So I wondered do you have
any role though in that?

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.670
The audio book is very well read.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: I love the audio book.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:14.490
We talked about like how to
go about doing the, you know,

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:19.490
the sort of strange stuff
that happens on the page,

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.590
and we just couldn't figure out
how to get it across in audio

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.500
and so we just ended up
having to leave it out.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.290
I do feel bad about it
but I also couldn't think

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.520
of any way to get it across.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.790
I mean I think it's a similar issue

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.620
for the PowerPoint stuff
in Jennifer Egan used.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.920
It just doesn't translate.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker: So you're
saying I missed something.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.460
So I should really take a second
time here now that I got this.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.760
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, just glance it.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.060
You can glance at it.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You might have
gotten something else entirely

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.090
from the other book.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.390
I heard it's great.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:54.690
It's got four actors, you said?

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.520
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, it's
a really good audio book

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.770
and there are some really
wonderful performances.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, so that
has advantages the book does not.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.100
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Anything else?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.700
Is someone coming up here?

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.000
Yes?

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:19.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Hi, my question is
how can I be a good supporter

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.180
of budding writers
in your household?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.930
So I have a 9-year-old
that's interested in writing

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.630
and I have someone else

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.000
in my household that's
interested in writing.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.910
So how can I be supportive?

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:34.520
How can I be encouraging in that
regard, especially for a 9-year-old

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.080
and not be like helicopter mom?

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.380
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Right.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.980
I think it's about reading.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.300
Absolutely, just making sure
that there are books in the house

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.710
and making sure that they
have access to the library

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:57.150
and I think creating a
space where there's --

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:07.350
not to say cut out TV and video
games but also just create a space

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.770
where there's time to do these
kind of more quiet activities and,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.630
you know, set aside time for that
I think it's really important.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Right because we usually
have to come in his room at 1:00

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.230
in the morning and say, "go
to bed" because he's reading.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.480
So I get that part, so we
just need to figure out how

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.830
to put those things on paper.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.130
Thank you.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.430
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Absolutely.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I think
there was someone else.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker: I can't imagine
what it would look like,

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.730
but you have any interests or
have you ever been approached

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:47.000
to turn your books into cinema,
the screen, or anything like that?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.890
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, I'm working
right to actually "Ill Will" is

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.400
under option with HBO to be
made into a limited TV series.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Congratulations.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.040
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah, I'm not
sure how that's going to look

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.210
if it ever looks like
anything but we'll see.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It could be great.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.810
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Yeah.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.110
It's at very early in the process.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker: That's pretty scary.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.710
Good luck with that.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I hope that works.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.730
It's great fun talking to you.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.680
Thanks so much for coming.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.980
I really enjoyed this.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.280
&gt;&gt; Dan Chaon: Absolutely.
