00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.090
In part one of this series, I spent time in
the village of Nabi Saleh in the Occupied

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.620
West Bank, home to Palestinian teenager, Ahed Tamimi.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.480
She slapped an Israeli soldier in front of her home,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.180
and became a worldwide symbol of Palestinian resistance.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.420
Now 17 years old, Ahed grew up regularly confronting
Israeli soldiers who raided her village.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.150
The soldiers' efforts to suppress the villagers’
nonviolent protests were

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.780
captured in videos that went viral on social media.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.260
After 8 months locked up by Israel, Ahed and her mother are finally being released,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.140
on a day of total chaos and heightened emotions,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.700
I sat down with Ahed to hear her experience, and ask what lies ahead for the Palestinian teen icon.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.300
So it’s a little after 4 am on the day Ahed’s going to be released. And we’re in Nabi Saleh

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
meeting her family right now.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.820
This is the day the family has been awaiting for 8 months. The release of Ahed, and her mother, Nariman,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.680
who filmed her daughter’s confrontation with the Israeli soldiers and was charged with incitement.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.380
For days, the family has been preparing for the homecoming,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.760
and camera crews have had a constant presence around the house.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.360
Israeli authorities provided little information about where they’d release the mother and daughter.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.540
Bassem has heard different accounts from journalists who heard from Israeli prison authorities

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.700
that they’d be dropped off at a checkpoint called Jbara, near the Hasharon prison where they’ve been jailed.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440
It’s an hour and a half away by car.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.920
We were on our way to the checkpoint near Tulkaram, which is about an hour and a half away.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.300
They got a phone call saying it’s gonna be at the Rantis checkpoint. We’re at the Rantis checkpoint

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.240
right now and they just got a call saying no, they’re going to be released from the first checkpoint.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.040
There’s absolutely no clarity and it almost feels like deliberate confusion

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.840
that they don’t know where exactly she’ll be dropped off and released.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.780
After two and half hours of driving, we were told once again to turn around and head back to Rantis.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.400
We're by the Rantis checkpoint waiting for the release of Ahed and her mom

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.800
and an apparent settler has come to protest with his Israeli flag.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.960
An Israeli military vehicle just drove by that they believe her and her mom are in, but it went that way

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.600
so now everybody is getting in their cars to follow them. Like I said, this is complete confusion.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.980
We're going to Nabi Saleh.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.820
This is total chaos right now.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300
Ahed was finally released.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.340
But the soldiers still hadn’t released Nariman.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.000
So we just saw Nariman get out right there. The relatives are hugging her.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Their first steps of freedom were taken to visit the home of 21-year-old Izz Addine Tamimi,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.840
a relative who was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier while they were in prison.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.200
They went to give their condolences to his mother.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.900
The family is holding a press conference right now. Ahed and her mother,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.400
Nariman, will be giving statements and then they'll be  answering questions of journalists.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.400
I met Ahed on her first morning of freedom.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.540
