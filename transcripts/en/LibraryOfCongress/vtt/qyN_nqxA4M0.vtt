&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.570
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Good morning or afternoon.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.580
I'm not quite sure
which one it is, but --

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.040
My name is Betsy Peterson
and I'm the Director

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.080
of the American Folk Life Center
here at the Library of Congress,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.090
and on behalf of all the staff
I want to welcome you here today

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.860
for the latest in our Botkin,
Benjamin Botkin Lecture Series

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.650
which is an opportunity for
the American Folk Life Center

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.890
to offer the very best and latest
in cultural heritage, oral history,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.270
ethnomusicology, and
folk life scholarship,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.310
and share that with all of you.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.540
The lecture series here allows
us to do a couple of things,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.610
not only share all of this great
information but each lecture

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.030
that is given here is videotaped
and will eventually be webcast

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 position:56%
so that researchers around the world

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.670
and future researchers can
hear and learn from this.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.340
And it will become a
permanent part of our archive.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.230
So with that said, if you
could turn off any cell phones

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.970
or any other electronic devices
I would greatly appreciate it.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.440
Today we are really
thrilled to be able

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.620
to welcome a distinguished
colleague, Carol Silverman,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.940
who's an award-winning Professor of
Cultural Anthropology and Folklore

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.760
at the University of
Oregon in Eugene.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.530
Dr. Silverman has been involved
with Balkan music and culture

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.160
for over 30 years as a researcher,
teacher, activist, and performer.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.520
She has focused on Bulgaria
and Macedonia as well

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.370
as on Balkan Romani immigrants to
North American and Western Europe.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.160
Her work explores the relationship
among politics, ethnicity, ritual,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.290
music, and gender as you can see
from the -- her most recent book,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.760
<i>Romani Roots Cultural Politics
and Balkan Music in Diaspora </i>,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.140
which is -- will be the topic
of the lecture here today.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.590
It was published in 2012
by Oxford University Press

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.580
and it has won high
praise from all quarters,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.970
and received the prestigious
Allan Marion Book Prize

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.290
from the Society for
Ethnomusicology.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.320
Over the years Carol Silverman's
research has been supported

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.530
by fellowships from the
Guggenheim Foundation, from NEH,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.550
ACLS or the American Council
for Learned Societies,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.090
and many other foundations.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.780
And in 2014 she was
inducted as a Fellow

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.350
of the American Folklore Society.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.540
She is also a professional
performer in her own right.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.760
I know some of you may
have seen her yesterday.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.660
She provided some introductions
for our concert of Esma Redzepova.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.690
But Carol also teachers Balkan
music and works with the NGO Voice

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.640
of Roma based in California,
and I guess now

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.390
in Berlin, Germany as well.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.920
She has performed with numerous
musical groups including Zhenska

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.930
Pesna [phonetic] and Trio Slavej.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.650
And she's recorded with
the Yuri Yunakov Ensemble.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.040
So, immediately following today's
talk we will have a short Question

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.180
and Answer period, and then
Dr. Silverman will be outside

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.000
in the foyer and can sign books.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.140
But I want to encourage
you to go out there.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.040
Please buy one of the book
and talk with her some more.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.510
So with that said, please join
me in welcoming Carol Silverman.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.810
[ Applause ]

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.080
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Thank you so
much Betsy Peterson, Nancy Groce,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.250
Thea Austen, John Gold,
and all the staff

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.140
at the American Folklife
Center, for inviting me here.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.270 position:56%
Actually, I'm not really going to
talk about my book because I'm going

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.690
to be talking about my newer
research that came out of the book.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.110
So whereas the book
focused more on Romani music

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.490
in their own communities,
I'm actually talking

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.640
about the popularization of
Romani music among non-Roma

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.460
and what happens when
appropriation arises,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.180
what happens when the
management of Romani music is

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.810
in the hands of non-Roma.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.360
So you can see by my title
I've put "Gypsy" for a --

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120
in quotes very prominently.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.400
And that's because I only use it,
actually, as a marketing term.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.900
Roma use the word "Gypsy" --
Roma do not use the word "Gypsy"

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.920 position:56%
if there are Romani speaking when
they're speaking their own language.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.280
And so I'll be talking about
names a little bit later.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.280
"Gypsy" is an outsider term,
sometimes used by insiders,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.960
but Romani-speaking Roma
would prefer the word "Roma."

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.000 position:56%
It means a person in their language.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.590
And in the English language
"Gypsy" is an ethnic slur.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.950
It means to swindle or to cheat
somebody, like he gypped me.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.250
So I avoid that term.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.250
But I can't when I'm studying the
marketing of music because it's

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.180
under the rubric "Gypsy" music.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.530
So remember the quotes.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.460
So today I'm going to be talking
about the pathways of Romani music

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.130
into commercial markets, DJs,
celebrities, production houses

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.030
around the world, festivals.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.580 position:56%
For example, this festival that I
studied in Belgium that continues --

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.960
actually, it's happening right
now, the Balkan Traffic Festival,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.200 position:56%
that actually under the rubric
"Balkan" has about 90% Romani music.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.850
So these days the word "Balkan"
and "Gypsy" are starting

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.250
to mean the same thing even
though Romani music has many,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.240
many genres that are in
Balkan and many regions,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.700
and Balkan music has many
genres that aren't Romani.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:17.660 position:56%
So there's a collapsing then of sort
of the market into a singular path.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.230
This festival featured
three Balkan brass bands,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.780
and that's another
collapsing at this moment

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.060
because the most popular
Balkan Roman music genre

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.820
in popularity is brass
music which is, again,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.840
a tiny part of Balkan Romani
music in its entirety.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.170
But for outside audiences it seems

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.400
like all Roma are doing
is playing brass music.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.790
So the man in the white hat is
Marko Markovich from the Boban

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.230
and Marko Markovich Brass
Band in Southern Serbia.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.260
But the first person listed there
is Goran Bregovic, I'll be talking

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.980
about him later, as a
non-Romani appropriator of music

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.100
who made Balkan music
popular in his film scores.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.760
So we'll be looking at films,
we'll be looing at festivals.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.440
I'm giving you a little
taste of what's to come

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.040
in the first five minutes.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.000
So where do we find
quote Gypsies these days?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.330
We find Gypsies in the New York
Gypsy Festival which is now,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.980
I think, in its 11th year.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.880 position:56%
And every year the Statue of Liberty
plays a different Romani instrument.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.880
But this festival over the years
has had fewer and fewer Roma,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.480
so this is a trend
I'll be talking about,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.700
"Gypsy" music without Roma, okay?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.370
So if you have their music, and
other people are playing it,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.740 position:56%
and people don't know much about it,
why do you really need Roma anyway?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.530
Another group, Gogol Bordello,
who coined the term "Gypsy Punk"

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.390
as a genre, headed by the
former DJ Eugene Hutz,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.500
they became really famous and
they've crossed over not only

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.210
to world music audiences
but to pop music audiences.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.890
So they perform at
festivals like Coachella

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.710 position:56%
and the biggest festivals in Europe.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.600
And they're no longer
even world music.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.400
When they started out, Eugene Hutz
claimed he was one-fourth Romani

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.700
from Ukraine.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.580
People in the New York Community
of Roma said "not really, no."

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.950
But as he got more famous everyone
sort of has to agree with him

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.950
because he's the guy with the gigs.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.680
He's the one who has the contracts.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.270
Everyone wants to work with him.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.760 position:56%
So now many more members of his band
are even claiming that they're Roma.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.130
So one of the paradoxes
I'm talking about is

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:43.240
that in the music scene it's a
cache, it's a step up, to be Roma.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.990
But outside the music scene it's
absolutely low-class status.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.570
And this is the paradox
that Roma are admired

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.830
for their music but
reviled as people.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.490
So I'll be introducing the
political situation of the music.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.940
Madonna also got involved in
Romani music in her Sticky

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.330
and Sweet Tour in 2008/2009.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.330
She actually invited Eugene
Hutz to perform with her,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.990
the guy from Gogol
Bordello, but he was too busy.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.200
And we lobbied Eugene to
substitute other people for him

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.350
because other Roma should
get a break in their career.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.460
And, finally, Madonna agreed
to invite the Kolpakov Trio,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.530
which actually includes
one Jewish member.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.740
The violinist Arkady Gips is from
Ukraine, living in Columbus, Ohio.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.300
He's played Romani music quite
a lot, and the Roma wanted him.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.270
So on Madonna's tour you
had a 75-year-old guitarist,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.660
the uncle of the young guitarist.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.580
And this is unusual for Madonna.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.870
But did she do anything
for Romani music?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.850
Well, people heard the music.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.690
She did in Bucharest, Romania.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.080
She put down her guitar
and asked for quiet.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.040
And she asked the audience,
"Do you love gypsy music?"

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.340
"Yeah, we love Gypsy music."

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.060 position:56%
"I'm so happy you love gypsy music."

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.170
And then she said, "But I'm so
upset that you don't like Gypsies."

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.520
And then she was booed
by 60,000 people

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800
in the stadium she
was performing in.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.510
And the international
headlines were,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.790 position:56%
"Madonna doesn't understand
anything about our gypsy situation."

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.090
What did she do?

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.390
Well, she was lobbied

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.260
by the musicians backstage
to say something.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.740
So she tried, but failed.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.450
And then post-concert, she
sold one shoe at an auction

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.860
and donated it for a Romani cause.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.140
So that's the sum total of Madonna.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.160
But she's very important because
she actually included the music.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.590
And then, of course, we have Borat.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.020
If you remember that film where 95%

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.880
of the music was Balkan
Romani music,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.290
and the film itself was staged in
Glod, Romania, in southern Romania,

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.440 position:56%
a Romani village where the villagers
themselves did sign releases

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.680
for $10 a day because they knew
this was a good income for them.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.830
But they had no idea they would
be pictured as Kazakhstanis

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.340
in bestiality positions,
incest-type scenes.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:19.100 position:56%
And they actually tried to sue Sasha
Cohen as well as many other people

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.680
in this film tried to sue him.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.190
But nobody actually can
win against Sasha Cohen

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.420
and his Hollywood legal team.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.530
Another woman who was featured
in that film, Esma Redzepova,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.600
and she's performing tonight.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.230
If you are all free you
will not be disappointed.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.550
This is a legend of Romani
music from Macedonia,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.460
and she will be performing at the
Millennium Stage at 6 p.m. tonight.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.090
She also sued Sasha
Cohen because her --

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:56.000
the song that was used in the
film was on a Dutch label,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.170
but she had a clause, she's very
smart, unlike a lot of other Roma

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.370
who actually don't have the legal
background to put these clauses

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.490
in their contracts, or they
don't have contracts at all.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.000
She had a legal clause in her
contract with the Dutch firm

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.810
that said if it's used, her
music is used in a film,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.120 position:56%
she had to give personal permission.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.420
And they did not.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.720
The film just gave it.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.410
So she was able to
recover some money

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.990
from the Dutch film,
not from Sasha Cohen.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.150
And another recent thing is
Jason Derulo's hit "Talk Dirty,"

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.430
which used a saxophone riff,
which many Balkan Roma listened

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.730
to and said, "Oh, my god.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.330 position:56%
That sounds like Udi Yunakov or some
of our famous saxophone players."

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.460
It was definitely a
Balkan saxophone riff.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.620
But, actually, it was taken from
Balkan Beat Box, a group composed

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.300
of Americans and Israelis, no Roma.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.540
But the saxophone player,
Ori Kaplan,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.330
in the group took lessons
from Udi Yunakov.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.280
Actually, he's one of the
National Heritage Fellows

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.700
and you've seen him
here in Washington.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.500
Udi lives in New Jersey, and
Ori took lessons for him.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.510
But Ori took his music,
put it on this album,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.390
and then when Jason Derulo
needed to license it,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.170
it didn't involve Uri at all.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.900
So there's Uri's music
but without Uri anymore.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.940
And where else are
Gypsies these days?

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.090
Well, we can see Gypsies on
television in reality shows.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.430
If you know the history
of this particular show,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.300
it started in England as
<i>My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding </i>.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.720
It got the largest viewership
of the BBC channel it was on.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.760 position:56%
It's a sensational show, emphasizing
violence, sexuality, teen marriages,

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.750
conflict in the society, and
it isn't even about Gypsies.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.880
It's about Travelers or people who
have intermarried in England, Roma,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.160
and Travelers, and even
groups that were paid

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.750
to stage these exotic-type rituals.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.490
And so we have, basically --

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.700
this is the information that
the public knows about Roma.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.010
And then the TLC took
it up in America

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.660
and made the American version
using families from the south

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.300
in Texas and Mississippi.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.790
They, again, were paid

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.420
to do exaggerated type
of rituals and violence.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.320
Then the National Geographic
Channel took up this kind

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.300
of craze for Gypsy reality TV.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.490
We thought maybe it would
be more educational.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.700
They even tried to
appear educational

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.890
by putting a Romani
glossary on their website.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.250
And they asked scholars
for endorsements.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.540
Of course we were very,
very, very suspicious.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.590
I'm not Romani myself,
but I work with Roma

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.420
and basically people
ask you for endorsements

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.300
of Gypsy projects all the time,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.080
and you have to be
really, really careful.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.440
So you can tell this is, again,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.720
sensational about fortunetelling
scams.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.310
This is about the Kalderash
Group, a family in New York.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.250
But, again, they were paid
to exaggerate their customs,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.320
to fight on camera on purpose.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.240
Okay. So, in addition, there's an
entire network of DJs doing sampled

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:11.620
and digitized Roma music which
they take from Balkan groups

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.380
and they have trademarked the name.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.270
It is a, under trademark,
BalkanBeats.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.610
And this is a whole
network of hundreds of DJs.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.140
They started in Western Europe
and now they've gone to America

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.480
and Japan, Australia, and Mexico.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.780
It's very big.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.330
So I'll be talking about
this scene as well,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.660
the kind of sampled
world of Balkan music.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.360
And then here in New York
we have many different clubs

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.140
that have this kind of music,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.420
sometimes mixed with
live Romani music.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.170
But a lot of sampled music where
you don't need Roma anymore.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.890
So just to review, basically,
I am talking about this paradox

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:52.620
that Roma are revered for their
music, yet reviled as people.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.080
And historically the stereotype
about Gypsies is two-pronged.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.220
One may appear to be positive
because it's about romanticism,

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.770
musicality, talented people
who don't need to work,

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.890
who sit around the fire
every day enjoying music.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:16.070
It's a stereotype that is totally
fantasy and it goes hand-in-hand

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.380
with the negative stereotype
of criminality

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.830
and don't trust these people
and they will steal from you.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.820 position:56%
So I would say even, and, of course,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.110
stereotypes have been
studied by scholars.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.720
We know that the positive and
the negative are intertwined.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.650
This is very true for
African Americans.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.900
Not everybody is a
basketball player.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.390
Very, very important to look
at positive stereotyping

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.250
and the damage that it does.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.570
And I don't even call it positive,
but in the literature you call it.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.670
And I mentioned already
the name issue

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.590 position:56%
that I'm not using Gypsy except when
I have to for the marketing label,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.450
and that's actually
what I'm studying.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.910
The other labels, Tsigan,
which is tsigganos, Tsigane,

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.820
in many different European
languages, those --

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.720
that's also a false label because
it comes from the word "Athinganoi"

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.020
which is from a Byzantine
heretical sect,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.780
and those were not
related to Roma either.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.430
That word is also a
putdown in many, many Balkan

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.750
and Slavic romance languages.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.430
Okay. So what are we talking about
-- just a little bit of history?

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:26.220
We're talking about Roma as an
Indian diaspora from South Asia.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.070 position:56%
Linguistic evidence has led us to
tie the Romani language to Sanskrit,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.160
and even to modern-day
Hindi, and the diversity

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.320
of Romani subgroups even in
earlier migration, but definitely

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.460
in the current-day diaspora.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.280
Okay? So some people ask
what does unite Roma?

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.140
Well, if they speak the Romani
language they can understand

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.440
each other.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.490
But only half the world's Roma
speak Romani because it wasn't

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.000
to their advantage in some places
to continue their language.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.590
Some Roma passed out
of that category.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.110
Some were forced by
governments, schools,

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.850
to abandon their language,
to leave it.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:10.020
Okay? So even nomadism and
sedentarism is a complicated issue.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.740
Not all Roma are nomadic,
and even those

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.920
that are nomadic might have
been forced to move due to wars,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.520
due to evictions, due to prejudice.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.720 position:56%
So there are Roma, for example, in
the Balkans that have been sedentary

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.470
for hundreds of years and
don't relate well to nomadism.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.120
Or they might be seasonal
nomads or musical nomads

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.390
because they find their craft.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.400
Metal craft workers perhaps
would take a seasonal route in --

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.330
certainly we have evidence of Roma

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.580
in the Middle Ages taking their
forges, their blacksmithing tools,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.480 position:56%
from town to town to service people.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.090
So Roma have been very integrated
into the economy of Europe

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.820
for hundreds of years as
metalworkers, horse doctors,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.640
musicians, middlemen,
peddlers, some fortunetellers --

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.540
although not all groups --
offering amulets or advice.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.650 position:56%
You might say it's a folk psychiatry
before psychiatry was invented.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.900
Some of the very tragic periods

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.350
of Romani history need
to be mentioned here.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.870
Slavery in Southern Romania,
in Wallachia and Moldavia,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.810
for 500 years where Roma were owned
by the church and by the nobility,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.560
and traded at auctions,
selected and sorted according

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.720
to their populations
and their occupations --

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.150
the gold washers, the
agricultural workers,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.220
the musicians, the horse dealers.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.870
The Nazi period in which Roma
were singled out for extinction

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.170
and genocide just like Jews.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.730
And now we know over a million --

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.230
well, half-a-million to
a million Roma perished.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.700
And a lot of activism about
getting the recognition

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.020
of Roma in the Holocaust.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.720
Our Holocaust Museum here in
America, when it first opened here

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.640
on the Mall, had a
Romani Board Member,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.120
and then when that
person stepped down,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.350
for over 10 years there was
no Romani person on the Board.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:18.840
Just this year, Ethel Brooks from
Rutgers University was appointed.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.560
So it's a constant battle
to get recognition of Roma.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.100
Many other things during the
more recent Socialist period

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.130
such as taking the wheels off
of caravans of nomadic Roma,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.020
making their music illegal,
banning their language,

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.380
banning Romani types of dress.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.720
Many, many things can be listed.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.790 position:56%
Probably most striking would be the
forced sterilization or Romani women

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:54.300 position:56%
in Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Finland, Sweden, places in the West,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.140
just like other indigenous
groups, the Sami,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.090
and this has happened
certainly in America as well.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.110 position:56%
And still today we have the tracking

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.750
of Romani children
into special schools.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.180
This means, assuming
that they are disabled

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.670
because perhaps they speak the
majority language with an accent

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.770 position:56%
or just their dark skin, and putting
them into schools for the disabled

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.930
which is a track you
never get out of,

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.660 position:56%
and you're not in an academic track.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.200
And a very important case was
adjudicated in the town of Ostrava

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.480
in the Czech Republic
where they showed

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.330
that it was 27 times more
likely for a Romani child to end

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.550
up in a special school
than a Czech student.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.290
And still, in the European
Court of Human Rights

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.020
that case failed the first time.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.320
It only won on appeal.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.980
So these are the kinds of battles
that Roma and allies are fighting.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.180
And if you think the U.S.
is a little more open,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.270
it is in some ways, just because
Americans are more private.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.400
But still in the U.S., in
southern states there are quote

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.350
"gypsy crime units" attached
to police departments.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.680 position:56%
They're called Bunco Squads and they
are paid for by your tax dollars

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.330
and they assume that there are Roma
who do certain kinds of crimes,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.190 position:56%
and only those crimes are done by
Roma, and only Roma do those crimes.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.310
So it's a real huge assumption and
it's a form of racial profiling.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.730
And not to mention what I'd
call the entire erasure of Roma

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.790
from European history,
American history, and so on.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.330
So today Roma is the
largest minority in Europe.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.850
The majority actually
reside in EU states.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.080
And they have some of the lowest
rates of social integration,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.020
you can see here on the
PowerPoint, in healthcare,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.240
education, all of the indicators.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.740
But most striking, of
course, is employment,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.340
how little employment there
are because of discrimination

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.390
and also Roma were
tracked out of skilled jobs

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.130
in the Socialist government.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.100 position:56%
All the streetcleaners, for example,

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.850
were Roma in Poland,
Bulgaria, Romania.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.710
So after socialism, many
didn't have the skills.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.550
And those that had the skills
were not allowed to assume jobs.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.150
They're just cut out.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.010
And there's tremendous prejudice
against Roma in Europe today.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.450
When I do my field work, even
educated professors tell me, "Oh,

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.380
don't go to that Romani
neighborhood.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.580
You'll be killed, you'll be raped."

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.730
Of course, they've never been
in that Romani neighborhood.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.170
They don't know any Roma, but
they have the historic prejudices.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.340
And then if I invite them,
they'll say, "Oh, my God.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.430
This is an amazingly nice house.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.210
I had no idea."

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.710
You know, contact really does help.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.210
And the most upsetting
thing, of course,

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.250
is physical violence
and intimidation.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.710
Lots of incidences of targeting
of Roma, burning down houses.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.930
Many of these cases are
still in the courts.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.390
Roma rarely get justice.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.970
This has been compounded
these days by migration.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:59.010 position:56%
So after the wall came down in 1989,
many Roma, of course, wanted to move

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.150
to Western Europe for better
jobs, better opportunities.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.960
And it turns out West Europeans
are pretty prejudiced, too.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.120
So there's been a hysteria,
a panic, about the floods,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.550
the migrations, of East Europeans.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.110
You might know the Italian
fingerprinting incident a few years

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.380
ago where the Italian government --

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.280
Berlusconi decided to
fingerprint all Roma,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.620
to have a database for criminality.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.460
This is so reminiscent
of World War II.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.530
Okay? Can you imagine that,
an entire ethnic group?

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.800 position:56%
There have been expulsions of EU
citizens, who have the right to work

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.700
in Western Europe,
back to Eastern Europe.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.600
And outside the EU, in places like
Kosovo where it is really not safe

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.670
for Roma to be there, there
are expulsions back to Kosovo

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.350
of children, families who have
raised an entire generation

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.970
in Western Europe.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.600
There are continuing
demonstrations against Roma.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.900
It's a very tense situation.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.340
And you might remember the
Greek "Blond Maria" incident

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:10.000 position:56%
where a blond six-year-old was found
in a Turkish Romani settlement.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.530
Pardon me, a Greek
Romani settlement.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.790
And the -- when the police
saw her they assumed,

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.340
because she's blond,
that she was kidnapped.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.380
So this is a really old
European stereotype,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.260
you know, stolen by the Gypsies.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.260 position:56%
And actually when they
investigated -- it took a long time,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.290
and all the media was about
the "abducted Maria," okay,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.560
"blond Maria abduction" narrative.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.010
When they found out what happened,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.930
it was actually a Bulgarian
Romani family who was albino

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.490
who was working for
better wages in Greece

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.310
and the Greek Romani family offered
to watch the kids and raise them

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.590
because it's a better standard,
even though it looked pretty bad

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.980
to the police when they
saw the "blond Maria."

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.490
The Bulgarian family had
worse standard of living

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.530
and left their child
there voluntarily,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.090
to be raised by a higher
class Romani family.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.730
But the ramifications of
this incident were terrible.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:13.480 position:56%
Even as far as England, Roma, Romani
chilcren in England were going

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.750
to school and being told,
"Oh, well, you know,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.960
do you have a blond
sister in your basement?"

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.210
You know, "Did you
steal my blond sister?"

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.580
Terrible types of ramifications.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.380
So here's some photos of some
of the things that are going on.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.450 position:56%
The Hungarian Guard, which was
actually banned, is an informal part

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.030
of the Jobbik Party which sits
in the Hungarian Parliament,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:42.370
a xenophobic party that patrols
villages to keep Gypsies out.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:47.090
And they are using Nazi
symbolism and it is quite scary.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.120
And there have been
anti-Romani protests everywhere.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.350
This happens to be
one from Bulgaria.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.120
So now back to music.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.000
What does music have
to do with politics?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.130
Well, music never operates
outside of the political sphere.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.950
It is actually one of the realms
where Roma have some control.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.870
But what I'm going to show is that
this control is being contested

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.580
in the commercial markets by
a lot of non-Romani forces.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.330
So I wanted to show you a
little bit about the music

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.030
in some traditional
Romani communities --

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.980
that kind of music that you won't
see on the commercial stage, okay?

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.280
So I'm going to be looking

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.100
at insider/outsider
boundaries and so on.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:33.290
So here are some Romani settlements
in -- this one is in Bulgaria,

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.760
in a Western Thrace, and
this is a wedding from 1990.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.300
And this is another wedding from
1984, in Western Thrace as well.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.710
Roma communities coalesce
around music.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.350
It is a very important
performative means

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.840
to show your family solidarity,
your extended kin networks,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.850
how you are allied, and, of course,
the artistry of the music itself.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.580
Plus gender roles are
extremely important.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.080
Women are very much
in charge of rituals.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.470
They have knowledge that they
impart to the younger generation,

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.200
to tell them what to do when.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.450
These women are bringing gifts in
Macedonia to the bride's family,

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.110
and those gifts will
actually be opened one by one,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.470
and in public people will
announce who they came from,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.840
how much they cost, and
where this person is located.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.860
So this diaspora of family
security is very important.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.510
So let's look at a few
videos of these very short.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.180
[ Film: Singing and
sounds from the crowd ]

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.080
So we are in Macedonia,
in Suto Orizaro,

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.100
one of the largest Romani
neighborhoods outside

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.490
of Skopje known as Sutka.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:50.880
And these are the groomswomen
in a wedding bringing gifts

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.470
to the bride's family
with zurla-tapan

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.740
which is a historic
Romani instrument.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.370
In fact, it's been a monopoly of
Roma for 500 years until recently,

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.420
when non-Roma are learning it.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.510
And it's an outdoor
procession type of instrument.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.870
[ Music ]

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.930
This is the henna party
for the bride.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:20.510
You could see henna on a round
tray with red gauze on top of it.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:25.520
[ Music ]

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.820
Okay. So let me go on.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.120
Just going to give
you a little taste.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.190 position:56%
So, back to my argument about music.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.730
This is one type of very historic
and contemporary Romani music

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.090
that you will not find
at any Western festivals,

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.300
or even on CDs readily available.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.440
But it is very much a
part of Balkan Roma life.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.440
Here's another wedding
in Sutka, Macedonia.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:53.680
And now we'll look at
some dancing on the day

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.020
of the henna party for the bride.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.630
These are Muslim Roma.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.120
Henna is actually used by Eastern
Orthodox in Greece as well.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.510
It's a vegetable dye that
you put on the bride's hair.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:21.440
[ Music ]

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.840
You can see the predominance
of women dancing

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.290
and male instrumentalists.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:31.510
So there are segregated roles.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.050
[ Music ]

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.100
Okay. And here's a bride
from Sutka, Macedonia.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:45.520
And now we'll see a scene
from the bride's day.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.930
Weddings in 1990 were
about five days long.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.980
Now they're only two days long.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.920
But this is the Saturday
of the wedding.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.670
The bride is in the middle.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.380
And her type of solo dancing,
cocek, is very modest.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.180
It is related to belly
dancing, but no skin is used.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.510
And she's surrounded by her family.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:12.140
[ Music ]

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.260
So here you can see actually
a little solo performance

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.270
of cocek at a banquet.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.340
Again, this type of movement
is considered beautiful.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.220
Girls practice it, women
treasure it, men are encouraging.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.190
But the very same movement
before strange men

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.510
in a bar would be considered
very, like a prostitute.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.440
It would be very unacceptable.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.740
Absolutely not.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.170
So it's not the movement
itself, but the context.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.470
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Who said that?

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.770
[laughter]

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.160
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: That's
my colleague Sani Rifati.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.360 position:56%
I was going to introduce him before.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.260
But he came in late.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.030
Activist from Kosovo
now living in Berlin.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.680
And we work together.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.810
And he'll have some comments
later I'm sure [laughter].

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:02.600
There may be other activists
in Roma in the audience,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.660
and I'd love your comments.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.960
Okay [inaudible comment
from audience, laughter].

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.360
So Roma from the Balkans
have migrated, okay?

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.550
As soon as they could,
even in the 1960s

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.240
in the Yugoslav Guest Worker
Program, they were going

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.640
to Australia, Germany,
Austria, America.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.170
But more recently, many Roma have
left since the fall of Yugoslavia.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.010
And so I'm following
Roma around the world

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.120
because the music is
very much unified.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.850
People listen to the same music.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.590
People have the same
hits every new summer.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.880
And so this is a party
I went to in Dusseldorf.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.610
I was visiting Sani's cousins,
and 2 to 3 thousand Roma gather

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.280 position:56%
for these parties in Western Europe.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:54.140
Now the thing to remember is that
this is a Romani community event.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:59.540
But maybe next door is a bar with a
DJ playing Romani music for Germans

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.590
that have nothing to do
with the Roma next to them.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.260 position:56%
So it's a really separate scene even
though maybe all non-Roma know is

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.790
the festival or the bar.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.000
There's an active Romani
migration scene, diaspora,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.930
in Western Europe and America.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:18.090
So this party -- in fact,
the drummer tonight is

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.380
from [foreign placename], this
band that I saw in Dusseldorf.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.550
So we're going to see a
wonderful band tonight.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:29.290 position:56%
And another branch of the Macedonian
Romani diaspora is in New York City.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.500
So I've worked with them since
the 1980s, and they've been

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.860 position:56%
in the city actually since the '60s.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.880
And that's a very, very active
scene, hundreds of families.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.150
They live in that neighborhood.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.880
It used to be an Italian
neighborhood.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.180
Yes.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.480
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Carol, I'm sorry.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.780
But really I have to jump --

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.080
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yes.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.380
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: previous --

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.680
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Okay.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.980
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: in Dusseldorf --

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.280
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yes, okay.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.580
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: I live now in
Berlin, and I am working and trying

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.240
to collaborate these
Roma NGOs, so-called.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.410
So one of the things is
Roma are very determined

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.820
to have a party just for us Roma.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.820
And really they are determined

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.250
because of this global
Gypsy phenomenon.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.020
And they're disgusted
with this marketing

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.830
and colonizing the Gypsy image.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:24.190
And so, for me, working for
all these years with you

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.180
and producing Roma festivals,
I think it's important

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:33.140
to do a gathering and for
Roma and for the outsiders

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.570
because really then you
have a dialog or no.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.870
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman:
Yeah, I understand.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.880
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: But because of this
phenomena, it's so much colonized,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.220
the image and the culture and in
the meantime the Roma feel they're

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.130
losing their identity.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.700
And it's important to
gather in one place.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.030
For example, in San
Francisco, you have gay

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.470
and lesbian bars, for example.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:03.110
But, and, you see, those are
places safe for them to be there.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:09.290
And this is what is now coming out
from this Roma event in Dusseldorf.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.590
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yes.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.890
I think that's a very
important point,

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.650
that communities do need places
to share their own culture.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.700
But there should be
maybe other places

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.060
where there's interaction
across ethnic lines.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.870
And so, you know, we're trying --

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.410
I would say it would be good
to do both types of things.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.650
But I can certainly say that the
people running the festivals don't

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.850
care about Romani communities,
and that's my critique

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.910 position:56%
because I'm non-Roma and I feel like
I need to work with my own people

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.910
and present a critique of it, okay?

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:44.230
So in the Bronx, they have
parties and so on just

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.260
like in Dusseldorf,
just like in Macedonia.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.500
Many of the musicians play
in mixed bands, so Bulgaria,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.890
Macedonia, quite a number of bands.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.610
The events sort of look the same,
but they're in banquet halls

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.560
and you can't really do
it in front of your house.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.860
But they try.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.500
They have some kind of acoustic
music in front of the house.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.510
You can see one event here, I'll
play one or two, from New York.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.550
[ Music ]

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.280
So some of the older
women do wear shalvari,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.510
the traditional Muslin 10
meters of pantaloon costume.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.040
[ Music ]

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.080
And this is very early
in the wedding,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.850
so only the close females
are dancing.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.260
The woman leading is
the groom's mother.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.630
And I'll just go on to
show one other wedding

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.860
with an amplified band.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.160
Oops, this did not catch.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.960
Let me go back.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:47.510
[ Music ]

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:57.140
[ Music and Singing ]

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.430
Okay. So now I'm going to move
into the commercial markets.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.730
You've seen a little bit

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.520
about different kinds
of Romani communities.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.700
So only a few bands from
the Balkans have made it

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.720
into you might say the world music
market, have been successful.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.660
But when non-Roma kind of see them,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.640
they sort of think every Romani
orchestra back in the village is

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.840
like benefitting from
a festival in Belgium.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.500
And that's really a
false impression.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.760
Only a few bands get hired over
and over again in the West.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.750
So this Balkan Trafik Festival that
I mention, had three brass bands.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:38.140 position:56%
Two of them were from South Serbia,
this one, Boban and Marko Markovich,

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.380
Ekrem Mamutovich from
like just 10 miles away.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.130
And why did they need
to have two bands?

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.730
Because they staged a
Balkan brass battle.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.230
Again, the promotors
figure out gimmicks in order

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.320 position:56%
to present these bands in a new way.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.040
So I'll get back to that later on.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.370
And a third band from
Macedonia, the Braka Kadrievi,

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:03.190
half of whom actually
live in Belgium, anyway.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.900
So it was cheap to hire them.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.980
Now brass music is part
of Balkan tradition,

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.450
but only in certain places.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.490
So this is in Southern
Serbia in a Serbian wedding

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.230
where Romani musicians played.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.780
So it is active, but it's
actually declining in some parts.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.410
But you wouldn't know that if
you looked at a Western festival

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.220
where all you see is brass.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.790
And also in Eastern Macedonia
you do have brass bands.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.730 position:56%
But due to this man, Goran Bregovic,

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:37.360
brass has become the defining
genre of quote "Gypsy music."

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.820 position:56%
And he's a non-Romani man from
Bosnia of mixed background, Serbian,

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.700
who worked with the filmmaker Emir
Kusturica and wrote the film music.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.950
But actually took it
from Romani sources

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.950
and put his name as
the copyright owner.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:58.930
So he is absolutely hated and
reviled as a thief by most Roma.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.360
They call him an appropriator
and a thief,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.430
and yet he got the top
billing in Belgium.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.690
And he makes more money
than any Romani band.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.180
His fees are now about
30,000 euros for his show.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.560
He doesn't like appear
just for a little while.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.680
He needs his whole show.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.790
And he appeared at a Guca Brass
Band Festival, which is a festival

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.610
of competition of the
best brass bands, okay?

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.870
So he's really loved by
non-Romani audiences,

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.350
and they even mistake him as Roma.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.350
They call him the, you know,
Ambassador of Romani Music.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.650
But he's not.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.470
So I'm drawing attention to
what I'm calling the dialog

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.580
between celebratory and anxious
narratives of world music

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.960
that Steven Feld has written about.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.620
And celebratory narratives
tend to look at appropriation

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.540 position:56%
and exchange as a win-win situation.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.670
All you're doing is providing new
creativity, new artistic impetus.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.080
What could be bad about it

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.180
when we're all sharing
each other's culture?

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.250
The anxious narratives
-- of course I'm going

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.000
to critique the celebratory
-- but the anxious narratives,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.920
I would critique some of them, too,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.640
because some of the
anxious narratives are

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.200
about purity of music.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.030
We should keep things pure.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.760
And I don't subscribe
to that at all.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.420
Romani music has never been pure.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:24.070
Romani music has been an economic
commodity; has always been given

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.560
and taken by neighboring peoples.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.560
But I do subscribe to the
anxious mentality when we talk

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.260
about the political economy.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.090
What are the terms of the
trade when you exchange music?

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.890
Who is profiting?

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:44.610
Who is setting the terms of
those contract or no contracts?

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:49.090
Who's in charge of getting the
gigs, of dividing the money?

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.160
The other thing is that
"hybridity" has been used a lot

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.280
to valorize any type
of cultural exchange,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.860 position:56%
that something mixed is always good.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:04.070
It destabilizes these
old kind of categories,

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.600
the binaries that we
have, that mixtures

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.840
and borders are inherently good.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.090
But I would say that there's a
very healthy critique of hybridity.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:18.160
Hybridity is also a
marketing category.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.110
It's been used to actually put
a stamp on the earlier category

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.340
that valorized ethnic
music as authentic.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.400
Like ethnic music comes from
kind of stable communities

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.180
that have their real folklore,
their real traditions.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.080
That was the earlier phase
of world music marketing

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.560
in like, you know, the '80s.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.280
But by the '90s, now you
see marketing that says

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.960 position:56%
if it's hybrid it must be authentic.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.890
So they hybrid becomes
the authentic.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.020 position:56%
And I think we have to be suspicious
of all of these marketing labels,

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.080
especially because hybridity
has actually been used

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.010
to discredit Gypsy music
in the scholarship.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.360
Serbian scholars have said they
don't play real Serbian music.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.910
They just play their version
with some kind of, you know,

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.240
Eastern ornaments or some
corrupted type of rhythms.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.400
So, again, hybridity is
not inherently liberating

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.140
or progressive.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.530
It has to be seen in its context.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.850
So I'm actually analyzing
how decisions get made

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:29.290
about releasing Gypsy music
to non-Roma by looking

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.770
at the producers themselves.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:35.280 position:56%
So one of the biggest production
houses is in Germany, Asphalt Tango,

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.520
and they still do the old
types of stereotypes --

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.730
exotic, sexual, passionate,
dangerous,

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.620
from far away, maybe peasants.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.750
Again, either they are
authentic or hybrid as authentic.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:55.030
They picture Roma on their
CD covers as either villagers

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.770
or living in mud or with animals.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.830
And they stage what I called
before the Balkan Brass Battle

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.800
with two huge brass bands,
Boban Markovich from Serbia

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.280
and Fanfare Ciocarlia as Romania.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.790
And the way they staged
it is to take this group,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.960
which does come a village,
from a village,

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.260
so you could call them peasants.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.560
That's okay.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.130
But they stage Boban
Markovich as cowboys.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.470
So it was the cowboys
versus the peasants.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.300
So they wore cowboy hats, and
this is how they were portrayed,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.880
and it was a kind of almost
violent type of thing on stage.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.750
In fact, one of the stagers
told me they were supposed

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:38.340 position:56%
to take their trumpets, go back to
back, walk three paces, turn around,

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.100
and then play at each
other like it's a duel.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.280
So, again, they're hinting
at kind of violence.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.570
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: They
got that from Americans?

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.870
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yes.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.360
So these questions I've been
asking are about representation,

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.670
about hybridity, about who
benefits from the popularization

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.120
of Balkan Gypsy music

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.800
and the economic context
in hierarchies of power.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.730
And I'm going to end
with two other strands.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.190
And this is back to the DJs.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:13.940
So the BalkanBeats trademark
came from this particular fellow,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:18.730
I'll go back to that, Robert Soko,
who's an ex-pat from Yugoslavia,

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.030
Bosnian, living in Berlin.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.600
And now there's a network
of hundreds of DJs.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.360
You can see some of the posters.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.230 position:56%
They use Romani words without
really understanding what they mean.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.600
They're talking about
drunken parties.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.830
Again, a lot of these sort
of stereotypes of Roma

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.730
who just know how to
have a good time.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.250
End of story.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:45.950
Okay. And here he is DJing and
this is the Lido in Berlin.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:49.130
He has a monthly party and
it's very well attended.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.820
This was 300 people
waiting outside at 3 a.m.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.950
So it's very well attended.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:58.460
And you can't use the name
without involving Robert Soko.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.710
So these are -- this is
what the scene looks like.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.910
It has expanded to America.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:08.440
Kafana Balkan is in San
Francisco, Mehanata in New York.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.860
There are some clubs
in Chicago I went to.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:17.090
There's a healthy Scene in Mexico,
Japan, and Australia as well.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.560 position:56%
All of these DJs are non-Roma, okay?

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:26.110
There's maybe one Roma I found in a
Vienna club, and he was the busboy

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:31.050
in the club and heard the music and
started dancing, and the DJ said,

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.350
"Oh, you know how to dance?"

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.650
He said, "Well, this is my music!"

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:34.950
from the Balkans.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.200
So they showed him
how to do some DJing.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.930
But he's not one of
the ones who travels.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.510
So let me just show you
what the scene looks like.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:48.510
[ Singing ]

00:45:48.510 --> 00:46:13.070
[ Music ]

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:18.080
Okay. So some of the DJs are
willing to do some research

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.000
and they do some really creative
things in terms of their artistry

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.710
and the weaving together,
the back beats and so on.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.930
But others are basically curators.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:32.620
They just take Goran Bregovic
tunes, the man I mentioned before

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.490
who wrote the film scores
with a lot of brass music.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.720
And they kind of play the same
thing over and over again.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.910
And most striking is that
they don't really know

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.050
that there are Roma living in
a neighborhood next to them,

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.700
maybe having parties or doing
a different kind of music --

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.950
wedding music -- whole
other kinds of Romani music.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:57.450
If you look at their visuals, the
DJs rely on historical stereotypes.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.720 position:56%
These, you know, a lot of skin,
women, words like Gypsy dance party,

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.020
[Mistores?], which means good.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.170
But that's the DJs name.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:11.080 position:56%
The Gypsy sounds -- even their names
of the DJs are all about Gypsy,

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.870
Gypsy -- Gypsy sound
system, the Gypsy box,

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.740
the Tsiganisation Project.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.150
Remember that word "tsiganisation"
because it's very problematic.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.170
This woman, a woman actually in --

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.610
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Why [inauduble] --

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:24.910
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: -- Slovenia --

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.210
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: -- in Sega?

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.510
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.810
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Why
don't you translate it?

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.110
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.410
I did before you came.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:32.710
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Oh.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.010
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Okay.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.310
This woman calls herself
Gipsy Jungle, okay,

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:39.480 position:56%
and has the brass sticking out the
jungle again, you know, uncivilized.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:44.430
Many use visuals from the former,
you know, former Soviet times,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:50.200
the old cars, the old trains, a lot
of brass, accordions, and so on.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.390
This DJ made a symbol
called the trumpet-nikov.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.730
He combined the Kalashnikov
and the trumpet.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.680 position:56%
And to me that's pretty problematic.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.630
I asked him if it had
anything to do with guns.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.930
He said, oh, no.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.230
It doesn't have anything
to do with guns.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.000
It's about the song "Kalashnikov,"
which Goran Bregovic wrote.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.800
And the song is about guns.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.300
But there's certainly a
violent implication there.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.640
And these are some young
guys who don't have any money

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.890
and actually lose money
on their projects.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.180
But they call themselves
the Tsiganization Project,

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.250
and remember that word
because I'm going to be talking

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.610
about now the highest paid
DJ, Shantel from Germany,

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:35.350
who has a very illustrious career.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.220
He does about 250 shows a year.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.520
These are all his CDs.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.530
He's very, very, very famous.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.880
He doesn't take part in
the BalkanBeats Network

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.180
because he doesn't even need them.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.530
He doesn't need that
word BalkanBeats.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:53.680
But he wrote a song called
"Disko Partizani" in 2007,

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.770
and the refrain is "Tsiganizatia."

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.370
But you have to understand
that Tsiganizatia,

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:03.380
which means Gypsyfication, is used
by right-wing xenophobic parties

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:07.220
to say our country is
becoming too Gypsyfied.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.320
Let's get rid of those folks.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.850
So, again, even hearing that
word is very, very problematic.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.840
But he's using it as
the refrain of his song.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.410
So I'm coming to the end now
and I'd like to start where --

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.010
to end where I started, talking
a little bit about celebrities.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:30.330
So here is our friend Vadim
Kolpakov with his 74-year-old uncle

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.280
and the Jewish violinist
on the Madonna tour.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.510
And Vadim tried very, very
hard to get Madonna interested

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.450
in Romani music, and he
made this film to thank her.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.880
And so you can see a little
bit about what happens

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.090
when Romani music is taken
into pop culture, okay?

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.920
And after that I will take
questions and thank everybody.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.720
So this will be the last video.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:06.580
[ Music ]

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.900
So that's Vadim dancing
Russian Romani style.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.700
Very similar to Central European.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:20.760

because this is a work in progress.

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:11.180
I am working on this new project,
so if you have any experience

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.620
with Gogol Bordello or any of
the genres I'm talking about,

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.920
I would love to hear about it.

qualified people in the audience

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.950
to help answer questions.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.710
Yes, your hand was up first.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:31.470
&gt;&gt; Audience member: I'm
wondering if it's a question

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.560
of the zurla [inaudible],
the Roma and the --

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.660
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: So, the
zurla or zurna was banned

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.490
in Bulgaria during the
Socialist period in 1984.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:45.530
So between '84 and '89 you
couldn't play that loud instrument.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.040
It's the first one you heard.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.740
That outdoor instrument
that's double-reeded.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.650
And that was a Socialist
Government decision --

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:59.400
probably had input from
Moscow of targeting Muslims

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.680
and Roma, so Turks and Roma.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.630
So the Romani language,
Turkish language, circumcisions,

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.960
Romani costume, Turkish
costume, and zurla were outlawed.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.150
But after 1989 it's now free.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:15.390
So Roma are playing
the zurla everywhere.

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:19.300
My point was that zurla is
not found in the festivals

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.610
for non-Roma if you wondered that.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.910
Yeah.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.970
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Carol,
under the Communism,

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:29.330
most of these Eastern European
countries would really sponsor

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:34.620
and finance their national
instrument from the country.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:40.990
Given that zurla comes from India,
it was foreign to Bavarians.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.970
But in the meantime compared

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.310
to [inaudible] these instruments
were the Romance diaspora,

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:51.490
not the ethnic Bavarians or
other groups in the Balkans.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:56.100
So many instruments were their
music preserved no matter what.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.790
Even [inaudible].

00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.090
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:02.250
Zurla players, even when it was
illegal and you could go to jail

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:05.960
for playing it, were playing
it in private ceremonies

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.440
with somebody posted on the roof
to look out for police coming.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.680
Okay? So if you make
something illegal,

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.900
that doesn't necessarily
mean it goes away.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.580
It goes underground, and
actually becomes more important

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.510
to people's life.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.950
Bulgarian wedding music
was also prohibited,

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.250
and people went to jail for it.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.840
And that survived underground
as well.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.140
Yes.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:31.180

just curious if you can comment

<i>When the Road Bends </i>by Jasmine
Dellal, that is a documentary film

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:50.670
about the North American

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.970
I was on that tour.

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:53.270
I'm in the movie.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.180
I have a very, like
two seconds in it.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:54:02.310
The first tour was in 1999
and the second tour was 2001.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:06.120
And Jasmine mostly
documented the tour in 2001,

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.120
but she included the band
Taraf De Haidouks from 1999.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.060
So when you watch the film
you think it's one tour,

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.270
but it's actually two
tours combined.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:20.170
So the film includes
amazing Romani music

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:25.570
from Romania Taraf De Haidouks,
Antonio El Pipa from Jerez

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.890
in Spain, several other groups.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:34.040
And I think it gives a good idea of
the backstories of these musicians.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.060 position:56%
There were some problems with the
films just in translation and so on.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.460
But I do think, if I'm -- it is the
film you're asking about, right?

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:47.780
Okay. It does give a good biography
of the musicians -- Esma Redzepova.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.510
is in that film as well
-- of their backstories.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:56.900
But, yeah, it got some distribution
and I'm glad it was made, mm-hmm.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.200
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: I was at the --

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.950
I worked very closely
with Jasmine in that film.

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:07.150
And this is exactly what Carol
talked entirely presentation.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:11.290
And I had an agreement
with her not to market

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:16.930
that with just another Gypsy title,
you know, to capture the audience.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.230
And guess what?

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:21.390
She did exactly that because the
producer said "if you want really

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:25.660
to be successful then you
have to title it Gypsy."

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.630
And I really fell apart with
Jasmine since then with --

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:35.530 position:56%
are not any more good friends,
because this is another colonization

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:40.140
of the -- trying to
market the wild Gypsy.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.690
So this is really a
serious part of it.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:46.090
Yeah.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:48.270
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Anybody else
have any comments or questions?

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.850
Yes, thank you.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.140
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: I guess I
would say just the other side is,

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.720
you know, I was looking
in here up in early 2000,

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.200
and I think it was really popular

00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.730
like in [inaudible]
is the techno music.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:05.240
And after a while it's just
really excruciatingly boring.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:11.840
And so I'm just wondering if there
was this need to do something

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.130
that just seemed less
boring and different.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.290
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Well, of course
you know music tastes are personal.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:22.970
What's boring to you might be
really interesting to other people

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:26.610
because it puts them in a trance
or really gives them a groove.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.210
But I will say that in
the BalkanBeat scene --

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:32.530
I'm talking about the dance
clubs with remixed music --

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.410
many of those DJs were in techno

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:39.070
and house music before they
moved into the Balkan scene.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:45.230
And in the 1990s the
techno scene was kind of,

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:48.890
just kind of going along,
not really getting speed.

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:53.870
And the Balkan had this new
energy, the melodies are different.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:56.880
And that's what caught
people's attention.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.580
So I do think that the
introduction of Balkan music

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:06.430
into the dance club scene
was a very historic moment

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.200
in capturing youth
audiences mostly in Germany,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.110
Austria, Belgium, and so on.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:16.860
And a lot of the DJs actually
learned about remixing Balkan music

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.600
because their audiences want it.

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.330
So the DJs actually moved over.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:26.680
Shantel, Stefan Hantel, he's
from Germany, from Frankfurt,

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.970
he was a techno DJ,
not very distinguished.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.060
And as soon as he started
doing Balkan stuff,

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.060
that's where he got his reputation.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.200
So there is something
in what you're saying.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.460
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: There is also
this huge scene in San Francisco

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.650
with this -- we can them techies.

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:47.930
Most of the young kids are
working for Silicon Valley.

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:53.670
And the [Cabana?] Balkans which
Carol showed in one of the photos,

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:58.520
the organizer brings his
[inaudible] and he's DJing,

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.860
and he's trying really
kind of to get --

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.730
and these people are
working very hard.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:08.230
Probably they put in one
week 60 to 80 hours of work.

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.280
And then they got to party.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.580
There is nothing going on.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.970 position:56%
They just jump up and down because
their life is so busy and so this is

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:21.150
for them like one outlet
to become like wild Gypsy.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.970
So, mm.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.450
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: I haven't
done too much on ethnographic work

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:29.140
with clubbers themselves,
but I've done a little.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.060
And when I've interviewed
them and I said "what do you

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.720
like about the BalkanBeats?"

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.340
they usually say the
energy, the different kinds

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.680
of melodies, the variety.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.510
So I think they're
looking for something new.

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:47.190 position:56%
In Europe actually, the
BalkanBeats DJ's seen as going down.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.690
In America it's going up.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:53.800
It's going way up in
Mexico, Australia, and Japan.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.590
So the markets change.

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.290
You know, Europeans
have had it longer.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.590
They started it in the '90s.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.830
America much, much later,
even 15 years later.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.530
So that's what I'm studying now.

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:04.830
I'm looking for the new markets.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.130
Yes.

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.430
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: I just want to say

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:11.150
that yours is a space
that I'm familiar with.

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:19.140
The Roma and -- since you have
the opportunity to present here,

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:28.270
and you say with a German
audience in Heidelberg, yeah,

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:31.320
the [inaudible] center
for the [inaudible].

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.150
And one of the most
fascinating [inaudible]

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:42.980 position:56%
that I found was a bringing together
of flamenco musicians and dancers,

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:47.670
the musicians and dancers
from [inaudible]

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:49.620
which was organized by the center.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.930
It was really fascinating
to see the interaction.

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:54.230
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Mm-hmm.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:57.890 position:56%
Yeah. A lot of Romani events do
like to show Roma from the diaspora.

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:02.190
And sometimes it works;
sometimes it doesn't musically.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:06.090
There was a project, The Gypsy
Caravan Tour that you asked about.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:14.500
A Rockefeller Grant was secured for
the second tour to have a project

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:21.100
between Musafir, which was
later retitled Maharaja.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.980
That was the Rajasthani
Group and Antonio El Pipa,

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:30.120
again bringing flamenco and the
Rajasthani musicians together.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.000
But that's problematic, too.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.950
The Rajasthani musicians that
go around the world today

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:41.660
under the rubric "Gypsies,"
we don't really know

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.400
if they are Rajasthani musicians
from over a thousand years ago.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.990
We don't really know what group
Roma came from, maybe Kabelias.

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.290
But the Rajasthani ones in Maharaja

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.590
and Musafir are Langa
and [foreign word].

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.890
They're nothing to do with
modern-day European Roma.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:53.190
So all of this is hypothetical
and when I wrote the program notes

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.490
and I was the Educational
Coordinator

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:55.790
for the first <i>Gypsy Caravan </i>,
and I tried to problematize this

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:57.090
in the notes, but the
producer said, oh, no, no.

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.390
Just say they're all one people.

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:59.690
Just say they're all one people.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:00.990
So like the audience is hungry
to know about the unity of Roma,

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.290
but actually the musicians
like to talk

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:03.590
about the diversity,
and scholars as well.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.610
Yes, you had your hand up, yeah.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.910
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: Oh, yeah.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.210
I just had a flashback.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.610
I remember -- maybe you
all may remember this song

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.800
that is by singer Cher.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.100
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Cher?

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.400
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: Yeah,

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.250
the song called "Gypsies,
Tramps, and Thieves."

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.550
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yes.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:21.850
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
And I think it was a hit.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:24.590
It definitely was a hit,
but it also perpetuated

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:29.790
that negative stereotype now
that I'm coming to this forum

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:33.990
and finding out, you know, how
the Roma community really feels

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:39.410
about their culture
being prostituted.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.360
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Mm-hmm.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.660
Yeah, sure.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.860
I mean, again, this is a very old
pattern of using Gypsies as, again,

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.570
thieves, tramps, or you know,
happy-go-lucky wanderers.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.870
But not real people.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.600
So kind of a fantasy thing.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.900
Yes.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.690
&gt;&gt; Female audience member:
So, I like Gipsy Kings Band.

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:05.930 position:56%
Do you have any comments about them?

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.230
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:09.400
The Gipsy Kings band are
from Southern France.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.920
And they founded a style of rumba
that took some from flamenco

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.110
and some from Sinti culture
and other types of Roma.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:23.070
They were very important because
they were the first Romani band

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:28.470
to tour from the West into
Eastern Europe after 1989.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.750
So they were at all the festivals.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.520
The first like Roma festivals

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.590
in Bulgaria had the Gipsy
Kings, and they're still going.

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:37.110
They're a family band.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.100
But, again, it's one
genre of Romani culture.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.590
Again, some people may
object to their title,

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:44.820
but they know the word
"Gipsy" sells.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.400
So there are, again, bands
that would self-stereotype

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.350
because they know they need to.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:55.320 position:56%
Yeah. And they have a really amazing
quality of music, absolutely.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.620
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And, actually,

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:03.500
their parents did the first
recording in New York in 1951.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.290
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman:
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.590
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: So it's [inaudible]

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:13.070
They brought them to New York,
that was their first recording.

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:15.330
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah, so,
I mean, there are families

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.520
in Southern France who have
done that kind of music

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.060
for a long time for insiders.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.430
And they were the first group
to kind of break out in, again,

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.170
in the -- they got into
pop audiences which is --

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.510
the're even larger than
world music audiences.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:30.530
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Oh, okay, great.

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:33.370
Mm-hmm. Yes.

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:34.820
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
I'm going to ask you --

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.830
this isn't remotely related
to the entire topic here.

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:46.520
But, Django Reinhardt and how
the phenomena of Gypsy jazz --

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.510
which has become a
genre like bluegrass --

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:49.810
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Oh, yeah.

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.110
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:
They play swing tunes

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:52.590
on acoustic instruments,
same as [inaudible].

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.300
It seems like it's international.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.800
There's probably a [inaudible].

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.100
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman:
Yes, I'm sure there is.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.130
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: How do the
Roma perc-- it's not going away.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.430
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.120
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: Well,
how do the Roma perceive that?

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.420
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.720
"Gypsy" Jazz, again, is a genre

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.140
that comes directly
from Django Reinhardt.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:17.370
So he was a Belgian guitarist.

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:18.670
I'm sure you know the history.

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:22.760
But Belgian guitarist who started
playing with jazz musicians

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.360
and brought some of his
Romani heritage into jazz,

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.620
and people imitate him now.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.280 position:56%
Not only his family but many
non-Roma and it's actually the most,

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.740
I would say, accessible
style of Romani music

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.430
because it's been around
a long time.

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.550
He lived in the '20s and '30s,
through the War, actually.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:47.230
So "Gypsy" jazz has been on the
radar for non-Romani audiences

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:51.470
and many, many non-Roma
learn "Gypsy" jazz styles.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:54.180
But the word itself --
he didn't coin the word,

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.770
the genre named "Gypsy jazz."

01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:02.410
Many other people prefer to call
it Sinti jazz or Manouche jazz.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.910
That's the name for themselves.

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:05.210
That's what they call it.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:07.150 position:56%
They're a subgroup of Roma in France

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:11.180
and Spain called Manouche
in Belgium as well.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.290
And there's a very, very excellent
scholar getting her dissertation

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:19.450
at NYU writing about this, Siv
Lie, and she's going to be,

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.130
hopefully, publishing soon.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:24.760
She's working with
Django's family today.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.400
&gt;&gt; Male audience member:How do
the Roma feel about that, though?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.850
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Can I
talk about that, Carol?

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:31.580
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman:
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.880
Yeah.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.180
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: The "Gypsy"
jazz, actually, again --

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:39.380
we go back to this kind of how to
market the music and to sell it.

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.830
Actually the "Gypsy" jazz, I
would call it rather a Manouche.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:48.440
That's the style that
Django Reinhardt invented.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.300
What he did -- he used the -- given
that he was Manouche from France--

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.450
from the French in Belgium.

01:05:55.450 --> 01:06:02.020
He used this style of the French
music, kind of like a waltz style,

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.730
an old Indian classic raga, okay?

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.960
And what was he notorious for?

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:16.110
He invented this style of la
pompa which means the pump.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:17.410
And the emphasis --

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:18.710
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Rhythm.

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.570
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: -- are on the
second beat and the fourth.

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:25.810
When you go one, two,
three, four, with a guitar.

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:29.070
They guitar sounds like a drum.

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.630
But now there is also a very
interesting phenomena coming

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:34.120
out from Europe.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.250
Synthegenesis -- actually
not in the genre of music.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:44.790
It's -- that is either
swing or jazz music

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:47.570
or it's a Manouche style
playing [inaudible].

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:53.310
It's trying to get somehow
through the music their identity

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:59.190
which they tend to kind of
differentiate themselves

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:02.560
from the Roma, especially
from the Balkans.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: I would add that
according to Siv Lie's research,

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.660
that is now coming out
in her dissertation.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:12.120
There are many Romani songs

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.960
that Manouche people
play only for themselves.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.100
But when they go on stage
they'll play Sinti jazz.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.510
But they have other repertoires
that they only use themselves.

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.740
So they distinguish
between what they use

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.780
for like selling their music
and what they have at home.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.410
Many of the Roma don't distinguish.

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:33.040
In the Balkans they don't have any
secret songs or anything like that.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.050
Whatever, you know, people want
they'll play at a festival.

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:37.890
So you have to look at
each group separately

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.140
and see how they manage
their repertoire.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.440
Yes, Amy.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:48.090
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: Let me
see if I can phrase this right.

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:55.070
So I've been somewhat
associated with some of this music

01:07:55.070 --> 01:08:01.350
in my own American
way for my whole life.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:04.370
And it's usually been in
really small groups of people.

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:12.430
And sometimes they'll give a huge
party and there'll be hundreds

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.140
of people, but they're
still mostly Americans.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:21.060 position:56%
But, again, you know, something like
the [inaudible] Balkan is 10 times

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:31.810
as many people listening to
music that I care a lot about

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:35.480
and I care about [inaudible].

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.070
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: And
that does widen audiences,

01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:43.290
so it has one positive thing.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:48.340
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: So what
I see is that we have this kind

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:53.560
of a public -- I mean, I
don't really just think

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.310
that is [inaudible],
but there is this kind

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:04.880
of public relations war going
on, in a sense, between people

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.250
who are perfectly happy to sell
something and appropriate it

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:15.200
without basically spending very
much time thinking respectfully

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.980
about where it comes from,
and people who are trying

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.750
to put some energy into that
respectful way of doing it.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.610
And we don't necessarily
a lot of the time hang

01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:30.820
out in the same places,
although some of us try to be

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.170
in multiple places so we
kind of see what's going on.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.560
I'm kind of curious -- I've
know you for some years --

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.860
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.160
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: But
I'm curious over the question

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.460
of your life and Sani, you as
well, like have you seen --

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.760
what have you seen in
terms of forwarding

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.060
that respectful approach that's
been successful and what haven't.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.360
Like, you know, I mean
it's not really a war.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.660
We all want be --

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.960
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Right, yeah.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.260
&gt;&gt; Female audience member:
-- you know, together.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.560
But --

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.860
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Right.

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.160
And certainly I'm not against
the dissemination of Romani music

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.460
and more people listening to it.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.760
But it would be nice if they
were informed and they knew

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.060
where Roma were involved
at some point or another.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.360
I think that's important.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.660
But I would say in our -- you
know, we do Balkan music and so on.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.960
In the early years we to have
like "Gypsy" night at our camps.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.260
I mean, that -- we
wouldn't have that now.

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.560
We were ignorant.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.860
We just didn't know about
the label and so on.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.160
Now things go along with
explanations, Roma are involved,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.460
there's educational
materials available.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.760
But on the -- but our scene may
be actually different from some

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.060
of the other scenes
I'm talking about.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.360
So like I came across a brass
band in Portland, Oregon.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.660
I'm from Oregon.

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.960
Where the guy sells gold
teeth during intermission,

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.260
and puts fake gold teeth.

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.560
I mean, first I saw him
with fake gold teeth,

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.860
and then the next time he
was selling gold teeth.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.160
So he's like going in
the other direction.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.960
So, in other words, just because
we have our group that try

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.310
to become more respectful, work
with Roma, spread the education,

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.870
that doesn't mean it has
a kind of global effect.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.940 position:56%
There's many different scenes and
you have to look at them separately.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:35.860
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Actually, I
mean, you know, Carol is a --

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.130 position:56%
with Larry and many other friends --

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.430
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:40.730
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: -- through America.

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:43.740
It's really the pioneers who
introduce this kind of culture

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.570
to Americans because people are
really, completely misinformed.

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:53.890
Everything is like completely like
so much all with the Gypsy fantasy.

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:55.190
&gt;&gt; Female audience Memeber: Right.

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:58.940
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And that really --
this is what we see, the outcome.

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.240
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: Yeah, yeah.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.540
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: You know?

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.840
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: Yeah.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.140
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And
for us, for example,

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.440
we are trying still
to educate people.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.390
For example, now in this --
one of the films she showed,

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:10.670
the Gypsy fest, we
tried really hard to --

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:15.750
Carol put really some proper
wording and the organizer --

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.840
they just simply don't
care because they're afraid

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.300 position:56%
that they're going to lose audience.

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.600
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: Right.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.950
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And for us is very
important the educational aspect.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.250
&gt;&gt; Female Audience member: Yeah.

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.550
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Mm-hmm.

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:26.850
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And so
there are some really lot

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:28.150
of stuff, in a lot of schools --

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.450
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:30.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: -- and institutions.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.130
And now the book-writers
are contacting us, and --

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:36.430
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: So it's
growing, slowly, slowly, slowly.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:37.730
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:39.030
I would also just add that --

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:40.330
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: But -- hmm?

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:41.630
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman:
I would also just add

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:45.260
that Roma are extremely respectful
of non-Roma who take the time

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:51.140 position:56%
to learn their music well, and learn
about its history and its context,

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.300
and maybe invite them
to collaborate.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.680
It's -- that's the way
it should be, I think.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.200 position:56%
It's not like you shouldn't touch --

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.500
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: No.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.800
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: -- music.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.100
You're going to be
called an appropriator.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.400
It's like -- figure
out what your role is.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.270
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Carol, we
had the project in 2010

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:08.970
with a brass band in San Francisco.

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:12.970
And now they stripped that band and
they have one band for the marches

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:15.850
and the other band is
called [foreign words].

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:18.510
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Which
means in inspector of non-Roma.

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:19.810
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Yeah.

01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.110
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: So
they took this Romani word

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:22.410
for an outsider as their title.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.710
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And they --

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.610
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: They're owning
up to being outsiders, yeah.

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:26.910
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: [Inaudible]
you know?

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.210
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.510
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And
then they invited --

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:30.810
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Okay.

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:32.110
We have to stop.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.410

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:35.210
Now even the --

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:38.230
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.590
Sani Rifati: -- now they
literally force you not

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:41.890
to use the word "Gypsy" anymore.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.190
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:44.520
Yeah. So there are ramifications.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.820
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: Yeah.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.120
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: You
can make a difference.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.420
That's, I think, my point, mm-hmm.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.120
&gt;&gt; Sani Rifati: And it's all these
young kids are getting [inaudible]

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.060
some information.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.360
&gt;&gt; Carol Silverman: Yeah.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.170
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I want to thank
you all for coming and, of course,

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:00.510
thank Carol Silverman again
for doing a terrific lecture.
