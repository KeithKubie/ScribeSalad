00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:10.360
-To moderate this
panel, I'd like

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.980
to introduce Dr. Christine
Seidman, the Smith

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.100
Professor of Medicine
and Professor of Genetics

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.240
at Harvard Medical School
and Howard Hughes Medical

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.480
Institute.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.307
She is also at Brigham Women's
Hospital, where I'm from,

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.890
and she's the founding director
of the Cardiovascular Genetics

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.430
program there.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.360
She's also run the Brigham
Research Institute.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.812
Directed that, as well.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:33.020
She's a distinguished
scientist of the American Heart

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.250
Association and a
member of the Institute

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370
of Medicine at the National
Academies of Science.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.745
Please welcome
Christine Seidman.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.440
-Well, thank you.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.120
I am delighted to be here.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.050
I have enjoyed the
talk so far today.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.160
And I know that now
that you've seen

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.950
the ancient past, the
problems in ethical

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.420
and complexities that DNA
science can elicit, both at law

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.480
and society as well
as ethical regions,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.160
it's time to assume
we've got that covered

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.070
and jump into the future.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.390
So we're going to have
three fabulous talks

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.370
today from the individuals
in front of you.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.230
I want to introduce
them very briefly.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.850
Their detailed biographies
are in your programs.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.160
Jacob Corn is going to tell
us about new approaches

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.230
to modulate DNA sequences,
in particular focusing

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.490
on Cas CRISPR Professor Corn
is at the Innovative Genomic

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.460
Institute in the
Department of Molecular

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.990
and Cell Biology at the
University of Berkeley,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.260
in California.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.390
We're going to hear from
a fabulous practitioner,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.100
professor, and physician,
Alison Murdoch.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.450
She is the head
of the Department

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.340
of Reproductive Medicine
of Newcastle University,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.820
in the United Kingdom.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.920
And we're going to hear
from Floyd Romesberg.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.200
And he will tell
you that GATK, which

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700
are the nucleotide--
single-letter designations

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.000
of the nuclei-- are not
all the code that's there.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So he's going to tell us about x
and y that follows up on those.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.240
So we're looking forward
to each of these talks.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.610
Each of our presenters
will come up and give us

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.610
several minutes of information
about their particular fields

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.950
and expertise.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.360
And then we're going to
have the opportunity to have

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.770
a verbal discussion amongst
us, here, and very much,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.860
as you've seen before,
involving all of you.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.610
So warm up your questions,
and welcome to the future.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.043
We'll start, first
of all, with Jacob.

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:36.522
Thank you very much.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:41.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.104
-So, first off, thanks very
much for the invitation.

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:46.020
It's really fantastic.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.160
I've had a great day, listening
to the talks and the discussion

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.847
so far.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:52.430
I want to start off by asking--
this might be a little strange

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.860
ask this, here, in Boston.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.700
But who has ever
heard of CRISPR Cas9?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.830
I sort of expected all of
those hands, given this.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.020
That's sort of universal.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.520
Right?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.909
I've asked undergraduates this.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.200
I've asked high-schoolers this.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.366
People are hearing about
this, and it's in the news.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.450
So what I want to
talk about today

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.845
is the genome-editing
revolution.

00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:13.170
And I sort of want to maybe
distract some of the people

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.420
in the audience by starting
off by passing this around.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.295
This is the thing that
has everybody excited.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:20.490
This is a 3D model of Cas9 in
the act of actually editing

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.360
DNA.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.580
It has the RNA that's
guiding it around.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.460
Just feel free to
pass that around.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.489
Rather than nodding
off during the talk,

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.905
now you have an excuse to pay
attention to something else.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:32.099
-Was it color codes?

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.640
-Color codes.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.000
-Oh, sorry.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.650
The color codes.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.820
The orange is the guide RNA.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.000
In fact, this model comes apart.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.170
And so you can take the top off,
and you can see the guide RNA

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.220
wrapping around the target DNA
and illustrating to you how

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.520
it actually recognizes DNA.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.360
This type of model is
actually very useful.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.380
This is something that
is not just like a toy.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.920
I use this for education
in the classroom.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.630
But we also printed this to
try to understand something

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.830
about how the enzyme works.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.130
So it turns out
the enzyme is not

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.370
in a productive confirmation.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.828
One of the active
sites is pointing

00:04:00.828 --> 00:04:01.910
in the wrong direction.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.490
It's not clear why that is--
what the actual confirmation is

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.052
going to be.

00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:06.510
But just from
looking at the model,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.115
not even looking
at it on a screen--

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:10.490
a computer screen-- just
looking from the physical model,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.270
you can see this thing.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.728
And so it highlights neat,
interesting questions.

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:17.269
So what I want to
talk about today is

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.280
the fact that we're really good,
at this point, at reading DNA.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.520
We're very fast at it.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.824
This guy looks incredibly wise.

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:27.490
I might argue that
we're not necessarily

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.060
all that wise about
what's in our genomes.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.143
But we're at least able
to speed-read our genomes,

00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:31.760
at this point.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.801
And we're learning a lot.

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.270
We're learning very quickly.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.770
And,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.270
Thanks to work
that's been happening

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.400
over the last couple of
years, maybe the last 20

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.650
years, and now things have
started to really take off,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.600
we're starting to be
able to write in genomes.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.150
And, at this point, we're
still kind of tinkering around.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.340
So there's been this
huge democratization

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.120
of gene editing.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.703
And we're still
learning how to do it,

00:04:50.703 --> 00:04:52.870
but a lot more
people are doing it.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.690
To compare what I mean by
"reading" and "writing" DNA,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.920
I just want to
compare our ability

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.820
to synthesize the genetic
sequence with our ability

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.910
to read genetic sequence and
compare that to something

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.880
called "Moore's law."

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.713
You guys have probably
heard of Moore's law.

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:11.080
It's the speed with which
computers increase in speed.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.780
So this is a log scale.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.280
And this, here, is how
computers increase in speeds.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.760
So you can see it's basically
linear in log scale.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.111
And sequencing looks like this.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.610
It kind of follows Moore's law,
and then next-gen sequencing

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.670
comes around, and just explodes.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.260
Right?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.850
Suddenly we're able
to read whole genomes.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.990
It's relatively trivial.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.350
We have a MiSeq in the lab.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.005
Those things-- I mean, they
run 20 million bases at a time,

00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.530
and it takes eight hours to
run one of those experiments.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.030
OK?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.910
So it's huge amounts of data.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.180
It's really exciting to
have that capability.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.290
And this is kind of where
synthesizing DNA goes.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.436
OK?

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:47.060
The next important
part of the equation

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.280
is how cheap
sequencing has gotten.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.390
So this is the cost
of DNA sequencing.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.150
And you see that, as
speed has increased,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.990
it's just plummeted
through the floor.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.560
And the same thing
has not happened

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.140
to our ability to rewrite DNA--
the ability to make sequences.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.305
So I sort of make this akin
to-- we have this giant library

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:05.930
in front of us.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.132
And now we're able to
go through and we're

00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:08.779
able to read this
entire library.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.570
And it's not necessarily
as simple as this.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.110
But let's say we have
something in there, right?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.920
We would be able to
find that sequence-- be

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.250
able to find that word.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.330
And what genome editing
is really all about

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.441
is adding the Find/Replace of
Word on top of that library.

00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:21.940
OK?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.250
We want to be able
to say, there's

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.600
something wrong in this library.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.304
Right?

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.720
Maybe someone has cancer, and
we want them to be a dancer.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.290
And let's replace that C. OK?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.307
So, what is gene editing?

00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:34.890
Gene editing comes
down to our ability

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.770
to use tools and change
genetic sequence.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.740
And the way that we've
done that in the past

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.200
are two technologies.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.650
So in the '90s, so-called
zinc-finger nucleases

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.640
were invented.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.670
These are protein-based
recognition modules.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.280
So you're using proteins
to recognize DNA.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.162
And so you have to
reprogram the protein.

00:06:51.162 --> 00:06:53.120
And it's very hard, and
it takes a lot of work,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.120
but a couple of companies
and a couple of people

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.860
got quite good at it.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.460
It takes about $3,000 and 10 to
12 weeks to make one of these.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.900
So it's not super paralyzable,
but you can do it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.110
And so this really
remains sort of something

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.214
that a couple of people would
do and a couple of people

00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:10.630
would be good at, but you'd
have to collaborate with them,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.520
if you'd want to do
that kind of thing.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.610
Then in 2009 came TAL
effector nucleases.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.870
These were a bit more modular.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.520
So each protein
module recognized

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.820
one set of base pairs.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.680
And so you could
stack them together.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.464
They ended up being a little
tricky to make, sometimes,

00:07:26.464 --> 00:07:27.880
but people got
quite good at them.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.180
They were able to automate
that kind of synthesis.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.980
And it seemed to
work pretty well.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.232
TALENs are actually quite good.

00:07:35.232 --> 00:07:37.190
However, I sort of feel
bad for the people that

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.820
invested a lot of
time in TALENs,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.020
because what came along
only three years later

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.270
was this thing
called CRISPR/Cas9.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.859
So there's still reasons to
use TALENs and still reasons

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:48.400
to using fingers, and there are
all these kinds of, you know,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.710
compare/contrast articles
that people read and write.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.800
And I think what's really
important is we have a toolbox

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.300
now.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.540
Right?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.120
And we used to have one tool,
and then we had two tools,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.510
and now we have three tools,
and they're all very good,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.930
and they all have
their purposes.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.960
And so I think this
is-- as you'll see,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.840
it's the start of an upward
trend in genome editing,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.720
in general.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.270
So what CRISPR/Cas9
is it's a protein,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.070
it holds onto a
piece of RNA, and it

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.080
uses that RNA to make a cut.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.080
And since it's
using DNA-- that is,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.580
DNA that gets made into an
RNA-- to do the recognition,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.740
it's very cheap,
and it's very fast,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.810
and it's very easy
to reprogram this.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.370
To give you an idea of
how fast, cheap, and easy,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.240
at this point we typically
have undergraduates

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.386
who are learning how
to do PCR prepare

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:34.010
some of this
genome-targeting reagents.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.020
So people that have never
touched a pipette before,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.490
they learn how to
do it by making

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.500
genome-targeting
reagents for other people

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.120
in the lab to do
genome-targeting experiments.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.430
So I think it's really
important to stress

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.050
where CRISPR/Cas9 comes
from, because it's

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.470
sort of this crazy tool.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.390
And you might want to ask, well,
how did such a thing exist?

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.259
At its heart, Cas9 stems from
bacterial immune systems.

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:57.550
And these are called "CRISPRs."

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.390
CRISPR stands for Cluster
of Regularly Interspaced

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.410
Palindromic Repeats.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.440
And that's because you have
these things called CRISPR loci

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.550
that sit in bacteria.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.820
Where do they come from?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.140
When a virus infects
a bacteria-- that

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.110
is, when a bacteria
gets the flu--

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.177
it's injecting into
DNA into the bacteria.

00:09:14.177 --> 00:09:16.260
And the bacteria needs to
do something about that,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.280
because it may have some
negative consequence.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.990
And so it's developed
machinery to take

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.730
bits of the viral genome
and incorporate it

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.790
into its own genome.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.830
And people first
discovered CRISPR arrays

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.760
when they started noticing
that parts of bacterial genomes

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.684
were exactly the same as
small parts of viral genomes.

00:09:31.684 --> 00:09:33.100
And it turns out
that what happens

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.380
is the bacteria then
makes RNA off of this.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.900
So it incorporates
into the CRISPR array

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.670
through a process
called "adaptation."

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.120
It then makes RNA
off of the array.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.010
That gets separated into
these so-called "crRNAs."

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.550
Remember, these crRNAs are
now RNAs that stemmed back

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.330
from this original sequence.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.860
Cas proteins, of which
Cas9 is one of them,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.590
recognize those RNAs and
use them to guide back.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.120
So they complete the circle.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.570
So you start with
viral DNA, and you

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.550
have to find some way
to rerecognize that.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.150
And what the Cas proteins do
is they then cut at that site.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.000
And the really fundamental
recognition, here,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.750
is that this doesn't
have to be viral DNA.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.430
You can program these with any
kind of RNA to cut anything.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.720
So let's zoom in a little
bit into how this works.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.010
Cas9 is monomeric protein.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.520
It has an RNA that it binds.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.374
So there's a little
constant region.

00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:30.290
And then there's one
little bit that you vary.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.740
And this can be 20 bases
or so-- 18 to 20 bases.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.400
And we call it
the "protospacer."

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.910
And all you have to do is
know that A goes with T

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.180
and G goes with C. And you
can then program it to bind

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.210
and then cut anywhere
in the genome.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.630
So you just take
this constant region,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.970
and you add any
protospacer that you want,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.380
and Cas9 will cut there,
so long as-- there's

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.620
only one restriction--
there's a short sequence,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.440
here, called a "protospacer
adjacent motif" also

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.270
in that genome.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.830
For some organisms
that make Cas9,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.560
this ends up being three bases.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.210
For others, it's a
little bit longer.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.640
They're now a couple
of different enzymes

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.060
that have different
requirements.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.476
But that means, again, that
our toolbox is getting larger.

00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:11.250
We can target more and
more and more sequence.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.820
Cas9 then makes a
double-stranded cut

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.680
and has two active sites.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.670
And so it cuts both
of those places.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.500
So it's very easily
reprogrammed.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.285
And we can target it using
simple rules of base pairing.

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:24.070
If the model hasn't
gone around you yet,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.240
this is what it looks like in
3D space, rather than a cartoon.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.410
There's a guide
RNA, and it's really

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.500
wrapped around the molecule.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.060
There's a duplex of DNA,
coming in on either side, which

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.160
gets separated.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.660
If we take off that
one bit, you can

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.840
see the RNA itself is wrapped
all the way around the DNA.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.340
OK?

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.090
And something-- we
still don't quite

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.250
know what it is--
something tells Cas9,

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.840
once it's made all the
wraps, I need to cut now.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.340
And these--

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.180
Again, this is a
very emerging field.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.040
We still don't know
what triggers it to cut.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.760
You can make Cas9s that go
to a place and do nothing,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.610
and they don't cut.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.650
So there's still a lot of
mysteries to be worked out.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.090
Once you've made the
cut, you get editing.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.910
Right?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.510
But Cas9-- I really want
to stress this-- Cas9

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.680
is not the thing
doing the editing.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.170
In terms of zinc fingers,
TALENs, and Cas9,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.570
all Cas9 does is make
a double-stranded cut

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.570
inside the genome.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.650
And it turns out that
the host genome--

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.140
the thing that you
put it into-- is

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.000
taking care of the repair,
which does the edit.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.010
And so, if you make
edits in human cells,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.750
if you make edits in model
species, like Drosophila,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.862
it's their cells that are
actually doing the edit.

00:12:28.862 --> 00:12:31.320
And that's because there are
a couple of different pathways

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.572
to repair double-strand
breaks in cells.

00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:35.780
Cells really care about
having a double-strand break.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.330
You can imagine that, if you
get a double-strand break

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.913
in your cell, that's
not a good thing.

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:41.130
You need to somehow get
those pieces back together.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.370
And so there are all kinds
of break-repair machinery

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.580
in your cells.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.350
There's one, which is
dominant, called NHEJ.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.026
This is an error-prone process.

00:12:50.026 --> 00:12:52.150
So if you make a double-strand
break, at that point

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.170
you get variable-length
so-called indels,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.350
or insertions or deletions.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.725
As you might
expect, this kind of

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:58.790
screws up the sequence
that is in there.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.990
And so this makes what
we call "knockout."

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.200
Think of this as, like, a sword
that you're going to go in

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.340
and chop it into a gene.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.840
And you might do
this, when you want

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.190
to say, what does this gene do?

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.530
This is a very classic
thing in biology.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.360
You want to know what a gene
does, so you take a model

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.985
system and you break
that gene and say,

00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:15.720
what happened after I broke it?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.720
One thing that has a lot
of people very excited,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.720
though, is so-called
Homology-Directed Repair,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.439
or HDR.

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:23.730
This is where you make the
cut and you provide a donor.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.010
And this donor has
a different sequence

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.650
than what was in there before.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.280
The cell then incorporates that.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.840
These dashed arrows are meant
to say we actually don't

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.040
know what's going on here.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.380
There's some emerging
data, maybe a little bit

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.330
of which I'll talk
about, suggesting

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.050
that this is not what people
classically think of as HR.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.490
But what this does is
it does precise editing.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.400
So instead of
disrupting what's there,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.910
you're able to very precisely
flip in certain sequences.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.620
The problem is, this happens
at much lower efficiency

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.390
than knockout.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.806
And so this is
something that lets

00:13:53.806 --> 00:13:55.690
you test what does
this gene do and may

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.690
be applicable in some
therapeutic cases.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.200
But, in any case where
you saw, say, this person

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.120
had a disease that was caused
by certain mutation-- maybe

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.185
they had a severe
combined immunodeficiency.

00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:10.890
And we'll talk about so-called
"autologous bone-marrow

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.530
transplant."

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.900
If you wanted to
correct that and then

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.580
transplant edited
stuff back into them,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.790
you'd have to make an edit.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.424
OK?

00:14:16.424 --> 00:14:18.840
So this is useful for asking,
what does this very specific

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.820
part do?

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.960
What do these specific bases do?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.810
And can we cure diseases?

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.360
Now it turns out that Cas9 can
be adopted to do other things.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.250
So if you take the active
sites and you mutate them,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.150
at that point Cas9 is going to
different parts of the genome,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.450
but it's not cutting them.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.920
And so people then take
different so-called "effector

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.730
proteins," and they
attach them to them.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.100
Why would you want to do this?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.730
Well, your genes are making RNA.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.940
And those RNAs are
making protein.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.020
And so, if you attach
various effectors that

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.440
will either turn on or
turn off transcription,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.490
making of the RNA,
it turns out that you

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.560
can increase or decrease the
amount of protein that is made

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.500
from certain genes-- in situ.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.620
So you don't have to be
adding something extra in.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.690
You're making extra protein
from the endogenous context.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.540
And this ends up actually
being like a rheostat.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.850
You can tune this.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.690
So it's a matter of not
just coming in with a sword

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.950
or coming in with a scalpel.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.116
You're going to say, I'm
going to turn this gene up,

00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:16.880
or I'm going to turn this
gene down, and figure out what

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.959
dosage does, in this system.

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:21.500
But I think probably
what most people

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.730
have heard about,
for gene editing,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.575
is its ability to maybe
be therapeutic someday.

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:28.970
And so I wanted to
talk about what might

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.430
be possible in the near term.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.424
So, at this point, we're not
talking about germ-line editing

00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:34.340
or anything like that.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.310
I share some of
the thoughts about,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.180
is that really going to do
something in the short term?

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.760
In the short term, what
we're talking about

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.450
is so-called
"hematopoietic" diseases.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.660
These are diseases
of the blood system.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.750
And so this is cases
where, right now,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.070
if someone has a
bone-marrow disease,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.660
you might take a
healthy donor and do

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.750
a so-called
"allogeneic" transplant

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.140
into the person
with the disease.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.069
You'd have to get rid
of the bone marrow.

00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:02.610
And that would then
cure the disease.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.110
OK?

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.120
So the bone marrow has
some mutation in it.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.050
Maybe it's making
sickle hemoglobin,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.060
maybe it's not
making B or T cells.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.600
And so you ablate
the bad bone marrow

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.790
and put in healthy bone
marrow from the donor.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.530
This has a couple
of complications.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.330
There's graft-versus-host
disease,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.440
people have to be on
immunosuppressants,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.140
and so it has problems.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.070
But it works, and
it works very well

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.000
and provides a really
good proof of concept

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.590
for the next, which is so-called
"autologous" transplant.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.540
So when people talk
about gene editing

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.767
for hematopoietic
disease, we're actually

00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:35.350
talking about something
that might not

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.440
be that far in the future.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.920
Because here we don't
have to worry about,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.586
like, how are we going
to edit a tissue?

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:41.307
Like, someone with
muscular dystrophy--

00:16:41.307 --> 00:16:43.140
how do we get it into
the bone, or how do we

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.880
get into the muscle?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.570
We're talking about
doing something

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.990
pretty similar to what
I just told you about.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.796
Instead of taking bone marrow
from an unaffected person,

00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:55.170
we're going to take bone marrow
from the affected person,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.950
correct that gene, and then just
put it right back into there.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.610
And that would be
just as curative

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.240
as taking from a
different person.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.900
But there's no
host-versus-graft.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.986
You are your own donor.

00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:05.569
There's an unlimited
number of donors,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.790
because you are your own donor.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.280
You don't have to
worry about matching.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.196
And so this is, I think,
why people are really

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.650
excited about this possibility.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.150
Right?

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.410
We're already doing
this, except we

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.842
have the dangers of taking
bone marrow from other people.

00:17:16.842 --> 00:17:19.050
We just want to be able to
take from the same person.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.175
Now there are, of course,
a lot of safety concerns.

00:17:21.175 --> 00:17:23.359
How specific are the reagents?

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.940
How are we going to achieve
the right amounts of editing?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.030
What are the right
amounts of editing?

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.220
I think these are
very open questions.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.160
There's a lot of work going
on by very smart people.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.876
And well get answers to
those hopefully soon.

00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:39.000
I wanted to point out that
gene editing is not just

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.630
for genetic disease.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.660
For curing genetic disease.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.160
People can use it
in research cases,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.670
say, to model cancer in vivo.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.010
People have shown that you
can edit primary human T

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.640
cells to try to figure
out immune function.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.140
And people have also sort
of turned this on its head.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.230
Instead of having
bacteria-killing viruses

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.320
through CRISPR, they
actually had phage viruses

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.066
killing bacteria using CRISPR.

00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:03.940
So some people have made
actually pretty good

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.170
antibacterials out of this.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.980
So there's a lot of
different things you can do.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.940
I think that that brings up one
other really important point,

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.150
which is it seems-- so
far, at least-- Cas9

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.040
is very generally applicable.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.140
So it works in bacteria,
it works in yeast,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.320
it works in flies,
it works in worms.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.640
It works in a lot of
different model systems.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.310
Sort of presaging some of the
things that we've heard about.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.250
And maybe the end of my
talk-- relatively recently,

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.190
people showed that
it works in monkeys.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.950
And that should give you
a hint of what's coming

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.330
and the types of discussions
that people are having.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.980
It works in a variety of
agricultural crops-- wheat,

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.190
rice, sorghum, maize--
all kinds of things.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.650
And it works in human cells.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.660
One thing that I think is really
exciting, though, in terms

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.700
of working in nonhuman
systems, is that Cas9 also

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.815
works in nonmodel organisms.

00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:57.440
Nonmodel organisms are so called
because maybe you have trouble

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.570
growing them in the lab.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.230
But one other reason
something might

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.400
be a nonmodel organism is that
it so-called, quote-unquote,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.490
"has no genetics."

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.990
Right?

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.770
Maybe you've
sequenced the genome,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.200
you kind of know
where genes are,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.635
you don't have any way
to do anything with them,

00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:11.160
to figure out what
those genes are.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.380
And people have now shown that,
for example, cyanobacteria,

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.520
mosquitoes, butterflies,
goats, cows,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.750
chickens can all be
edited using Cas9.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.380
And I think this is
really important,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.370
because instead of
now learning something

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.170
about life and about the world
by looking at these few model

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.350
organisms-- right?
--flies, worms--

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.780
we can look at almost anything.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.689
There's someone in my department
who works on this really--

00:19:35.689 --> 00:19:36.980
I can't even remember the name.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.480
It's this crazy
little crustacean.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.021
No one else in the
world works on it.

00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:42.790
But it turns out that it does
limb regeneration like crazy.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.290
Right?

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.270
You can cut off any of its
limbs, and it'll grow back.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.144
And no one knows why,
because they don't have

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:49.150
any kind of genetics for it.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.267
And so he put Cas9 into
it, and he ejected it.

00:19:51.267 --> 00:19:53.225
He targeted this thing
called a "Hox gene" that

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.830
does body patterning,
and he found out

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.042
that he can make
antennae instead of limbs

00:19:58.042 --> 00:19:59.250
for those particular regions.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.916
And those antennae
will regenerate, too.

00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:03.100
So there's something that's
controlling regeneration

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.049
of this body part.

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.590
It opens up huge
amounts of questions

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.740
that you can ask on a
very fundamental level.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.196
So I think it's really
transformative, not just

00:20:10.196 --> 00:20:12.320
in the way that I think
people have been stressing,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.900
in terms of health
and cell biology,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.140
but also just our basic,
fundamental understanding

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.930
of what makes life life--
what makes an organism

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.000
an organism, how do
organisms develop.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.100
And I think that is
really the one take-home

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.100
that I'd like everybody
to take from this, which

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.950
is that, in the
past gene editing

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.540
was about systems that were
relatively difficult to use--

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.840
relatively specialized.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.087
And so a lot of different
people would have ideas,

00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:38.920
and they would have to
funnel through people

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.410
that were gene editors.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:40.920
OK?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.420
And that produced
kind of a blockade

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.690
in the types of questions
that you would ask.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.160
Whereas what Cas9 seems to be
doing-- it's very inclusive.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.559
Almost anyone can
get it to work.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.600
There have been courses,
here, on the East Coast.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.255
We've run courses at the
IGI, just teaching people

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:56.130
how to do this stuff.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.650
We've put protocols online.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.150
There are all sorts of freely
available reagents for helping

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.310
people do this stuff.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.940
And I think that's led to a
very inclusive technology,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.010
so that, when you
have a question,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.980
you can ask and answer
that question yourself.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.680
And it's hugely accelerated
the pace of research.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.380
To illustrate
that, I just wanted

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.260
to show you how fast
publications on Cas9

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.220
are exploding.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.250
So if you're a
biologist and you look

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.410
at PubMed, which is a
database of publications,

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.960
you've probably noticed
something like this.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.920
After a couple of
initial papers, I mean,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.470
this has just exploded.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.850
I actually got these
numbers in 2015.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.621
This is the number of
papers in PubMed per week.

00:21:33.621 --> 00:21:36.120
So there' ve been about 1,000
publications in the last three

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.820
years.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.500
In the last week,
there were four.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.664
So it's really exploded.

00:21:41.664 --> 00:21:43.830
And it's not like these are
all coming from one lab.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.850
I mean, that would be an
extremely prolific lab.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.400
The reason you see so many
publications is it's a tool.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.900
Right?

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.060
You can ask whatever question
you're interested in.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.090
If you're a
developmental biologist,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.400
you can ask a
developmental question.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.900
If you're a cancer biologist,
you can ask a cancer question.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.210
It's, I think, very
rapidly becoming less

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.910
about the tool and more
about what questions you ask.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.940
And I think that's
really very exciting.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.080
I think in terms of, when
people think about editing

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.040
of organisms, therapies,
things like that, that's really

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.790
also highlighted by increasing
the number of publications that

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.575
just mention the term
"genome editing."

00:22:16.575 --> 00:22:18.533
So right around the time
that Cas9 came around,

00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:20.040
there were certainly
publications down here,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.940
but they're sort of
hidden by the scale.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.860
Right around the time
Cas9 came around,

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.534
and maybe the TALENs, is when
the explosion in the term

00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:28.200
"genome editing" came
in the literature.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.166
So everybody's
thinking about it now.

00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:32.290
What impact does this have?

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.660
Well, today we're
already very quickly

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.420
able to identify gene function.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.630
We're able to make very
fast cell and animal models.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.840
And, like I talked about
with the nonmodel organisms,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.006
we have genetics everywhere.

00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:45.182
So think of this as
working better and faster.

00:22:45.182 --> 00:22:46.890
But what's going to
happen in the future?

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.990
So I say "medium term" in sort
of a very vague way, because I

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.430
think this is very
soon medium term.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.270
We're going to have
actual therapies

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.720
for the hematopoietic system--
the bone-marrow-transplant case

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.970
that I saw.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.720
The people pushing
this in the clinic

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.570
are a company called
Sangamo, in the Bay Area.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.320
I want to introduce
you to Tim Brown.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.090
He is the so-called
"Berlin patient."

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.340
So he had HIV, and he got
a bone-marrow transplant

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.230
for leukemia.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.680
And he was lucky enough to
get a transplant from someone

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.650
who had a CCR5 mutation.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.700
And it turns out,
totally coincidentally,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.360
if you have a CCR5 mutation
it makes you immune to HIV,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.230
because the HIV virus
can no longer grab on

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.460
to the immune cells.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.970
OK?

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.386
And so what Sangamo
has been doing

00:23:31.386 --> 00:23:33.840
is taking Tim Brown's
mutation and taking

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.060
people who have HIV--
take their own bone marrow

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.630
and put that mutation into it.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.270
And so this man, right
here, has been cured of HIV

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.230
by getting that mutation
with a zinc finger.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.710
I want to stress
it's zinc fingers.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.210
OK?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.150
So we're not seeing Cas9
in the clinic, right now.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.460
It's a matter of time.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.670
But we are doing this, and
I'm almost certain this

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.540
is going to happen.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.410
It's letting us also build
better disease models.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.990
And synthetic biology
in general has really

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.230
sat up and taken notice
of this sort of thing.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.540
In the long term,
I almost hesitate

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.170
to guess what's going to happen.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.628
I mean, this is where we start
to get into science fiction.

00:24:08.628 --> 00:24:10.839
And anything I say is
going to be proven wrong.

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:12.380
Certainly people
are already thinking

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.760
about in-vivo therapies,
where maybe someone has

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.240
muscular dystrophy-- which
is a disease of the muscle--

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.903
and you might want to correct
that-- something that's not

00:24:18.903 --> 00:24:20.090
in the hematopoietic system.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.329
There are a lot
of problems there.

00:24:22.329 --> 00:24:23.870
People have talked
to me about things

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.150
like designer organizations--
stuff like that.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.160
We heard about
personalized medicine.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.090
So one thing and I
think fast gene editing

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.780
enables is personalized cures.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.384
So, just by way of
background, before I

00:24:37.384 --> 00:24:39.300
was recruited to Berkeley,
I was at Genentech.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.797
And when pharma companies are
talking about personalized

00:24:41.797 --> 00:24:44.130
medicine, they're usually
thinking on a different scale.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.004
They're thinking about--
you sequence people,

00:24:46.004 --> 00:24:47.357
and you put them in bins.

00:24:47.357 --> 00:24:49.690
Now, those bins are not,
quote-unquote, "personalized"--

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.690
one or two.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.200
Those are 100,000
people, 500,000 people,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:53.990
a million people.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.490
OK?

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.440
It's very powerful.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.790
You're making sure people
get the right medicine.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.664
But if someone has
a unique mutation,

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.830
it's very difficult to think
about how to cure that.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.400
And I think when we have very
fast, cheap, and easy gene

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.700
editing, that's a
technical possibility.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.997
There's still a lot
of regulatory hurdles.

00:25:08.997 --> 00:25:10.830
How do you do a clinical
trial for something

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.080
when there's only one patient?

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.170
What does an N-of-1
trial even look like?

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.950
And these are
outstanding questions

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.810
that I think that regulatory
bodies, as well as patients,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.990
need to really weigh in on.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.500
I only have two minutes left.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.800
Since this is a
science symposium,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.330
I was going to put in
leading-edge data-- stuff that

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.340
is coming out of my lab.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.510
This is in review right now.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.660
All I wanted to say, since
I only have two minutes,

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.310
is that we've figured out
a way to do the editing

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.320
part-- the replacement
of sequences--

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.070
very, very quickly and easily.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.680
So we can add patient
mutations in really quickly.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.430
We can make mutants
to test mechanism.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.830
We can start tracking
genes very easily.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.800
We can even go backwards
and we can do cures.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.141
And we can do this with
basically the same frequency

00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:55.640
that you would
normally do knockout.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.140
So it seems to work
very, very well.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.810
And we think this is going
to be a really important tool

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.572
for introducing cures.

00:26:02.572 --> 00:26:04.530
I'm going to skip over
the data, unfortunately,

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.190
because I sort of waxed
philosophic too long.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.310
We were really asking
how is it that Cas9

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.664
works when it grabs onto DNA.

00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:13.580
What's really happening
in this question mark?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.160
And also, one thing
I want to stress,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.980
for people in the audience,
is you hear a lot about Cas9.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.580
It's only three years old.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.120
Right?

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.735
The most amazing, advanced
lab in the world-- I always

00:26:23.735 --> 00:26:26.110
tell this to students-- the
most amazing, advanced person

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.850
in the world has only been
working on these problems

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.590
for three years.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.260
This is this huge
opportunity for people

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.380
to do really amazing
work in this field.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.810
We don't understand,
really, what

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.150
happens in this black
box between Cas9 cutting

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:37.702
and editing.

00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:39.410
And there's a lot of
good reason to think

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.820
that what we have assumed is
not what's really happening.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.230
I'm going to skip over the data.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.680
We found some really fun stuff.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.150
It lets us make really,
really good edits,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.650
so we can have really fantastic
conversion to edited cells.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.310
It works in a variety
of loci, and it also

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.520
works in disease states.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.450
This is what happens
when I try to put data

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:03.540
into a more sort of
broad, philosophic talk.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.140
The one thing I want
to leave you with

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.223
is, really, how do we
understand this new ability?

00:27:07.223 --> 00:27:08.460
Right?

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.960
It wasn't so long ago that
next-gen sequencing came around

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.150
and we were able to read
genomes very, very quickly.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.970
And now we're very quickly
able to edit genomes.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.615
There are genome-wide libraries
for doing Cas9 cutting.

00:27:19.615 --> 00:27:21.740
Like I said, we have
undergraduates and high-school

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.698
interns coming in and
doing this sort of stuff.

00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:25.910
It's really accessible.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.070
But I do want to point
out that trust in science

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.170
is a very fragile thing.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.600
And almost everybody
in the world

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.890
has a preconception of
what gene editing is,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.200
because they may have read
a science fiction story

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.350
or seen a movie.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.710
Maybe they saw Gattaca.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.700
They think they know
what gene editing is.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.840
And that may or may not be
what gene editing actually,

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.730
is in terms of the
technology we have

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.002
and the technology
maybe in the future.

00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.460
And I think that's
really borne out

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.834
by some of the
articles that have

00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:53.580
been written pretty recently.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.720
So, for better or worse,
I spend a lot of time

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.420
talking to the press,
because I work on Cas9.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.080
And invariably,
no matter how much

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.330
I try to tell them it's about
disease, that, you know,

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.788
it's not about designer babies,
you end up with-- you know,

00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:08.670
The Economist had a
designer baby on the cover.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.420
It just happens.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.600
Right?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.260
Because this is what
people want to think about

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.426
and they want to talk about.

00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:14.810
And I think we do need
to engage this head-on,

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.140
as a community of scientists.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.049
But we need to be very
honest and open about it

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:21.965
and talk to people about
what it really means.

00:28:21.965 --> 00:28:25.670
I want to end by saying
germ-line editing is

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.870
potentially a real
thing to think about.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.210
I think that it's not
real, in terms of no one

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.120
has done it yet.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.352
Someone has tried.

00:28:32.352 --> 00:28:34.310
They were never going to
implant these zygotes,

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.460
but they were able to show
that they could make indels

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.739
in human zygotes.

00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:41.030
These were not brought to term.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.170
There were some problems
with those edits.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.110
They had a lot of
off-targets-- things like that.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:49.317
As the result of seeing some
of that stuff, we at the IGI

00:28:49.317 --> 00:28:50.900
called a meeting in
Napa with a couple

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.830
of people that were initially
involved in the Asilomar

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.630
discussions on recombinant DNA.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.530
And after that meeting we
pushed very hard for the IOM

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.760
and the NAS to take that on.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.677
Actually, today's
the second, right?

00:29:03.677 --> 00:29:05.260
I think tomorrow is
when there's going

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.670
to be a-- what happens
when the NAS gets involved

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.190
is now there's going to be a
premeeting to plan the meeting.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.730
And so that meeting--
the premeeting

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.280
to plan the meeting
is happening tomorrow.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.810
And there's going to be a large
National Academy of Sciences

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.117
meeting in December
to talk about what

00:29:18.117 --> 00:29:20.700
is human germ-line editing, what
are the guidelines around it.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.250
I think that's very important,
because right now, in the US,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.710
the FDA has said, we will
not sanction any research,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.430
at all, that involves
germ-line editing.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.130
Even if it's not for
reproductive purposes.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.920
Even if, you know, the zygotes
are going to be terminated.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.590
Even if it's going to be for
a purely basic research thing

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.770
and we're just going to do the
edit, find out what genes do.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.570
It is completely not allowed.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.200
-Human.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.700
-Human.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.140
Human.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.639
Sorry.

00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:47.540
Yeah.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.540
And so I don't want to say one
way or the other-- you know,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.630
is that good, is that bad.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.380
What I want to say,
though, is right now

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.310
it's this complete restriction.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.880
We called for a
temporary moratorium.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.220
We did not mean
to say, you know,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.680
no one ever do it ever again.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.950
I think that's part of
the conversation-- is what

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.760
those guidelines look like.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.380
I want to end up by thanking.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.640
These are the people who
really do the work in my lab.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.680
One of my lab's
favorite things is

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.555
this giant scissors that we
bought, as you might imagine.

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:18.055
[LAUGH]

00:30:18.055 --> 00:30:18.871
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:21.120
We told them that we were
going to go up to this place

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.703
where there's this
giant thing of DNA.

00:30:22.703 --> 00:30:24.840
And, like, we had photos
from the lab the next day.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.670
And they were on Amazon
within 10 minutes,

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.950
and they had, like, next-day
delivery of the scissors,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.400
they were so excited.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.090
Anyway, we have a website--
innovativegenomics.org.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.830
I'm on Twitter.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.210
I try to be more active on it.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.550
It's hard to keep up, sometimes.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.174
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:30:41.174 --> 00:30:43.035
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.560
-Well, that was clearly
a fabulous lead-off.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.740
I would only suggest that
the future isn't the future

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.170
anymore, because genome
editing of blood cells that

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.240
are taken from
children, in particular,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.120
with hematologic disorders.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.310
Their own cells are corrected
in the laboratories at the Dana

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.440
Farber Institute and also at
Children's Hospital Boston

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.530
and reimplanted
into those children.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.200
And all of the posttransplant
rejection problems

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.300
that I grew up with, when I did
my clinical training, are gone.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.580
So it is not so far off.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.390
I'd also mention that we
haven't yet really mentioned

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.580
a lot of the use
of this technology

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.870
for fundamental research
in ways that it has

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.570
propelled beyond our belief.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.850
You all have heard about induced
pluripotential stem cells--

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.630
that we can take a blood sample
or a cell from a urine specimen

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.420
and we can, from that,
deconvolute the cell so

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.290
that it does not know what was
the tissue it was derived from.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.740
And then we can alter
its genetic information

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.700
and grow it back into
a heart cell, which

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.610
is really important, because
we have no heart cell lines--

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.990
none-- in any species,
including human.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.030
And we can, for the first
time, study these in a dish.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.310
This provides an opportunity
that we simply could not

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.450
do without combining both lots
of advanced cell therapies

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.080
with the capacity to editing.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.040
So when you hear that
the world is just

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.211
beginning to use this
technology, Jacob's 100% right.

00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:17.710
OK.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.710
We're going to turn now
to hear a little bit more

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:25.180
about the practical use and
the forward-looking, creative

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.700
medical use of editing
at a broader scale.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.610
And Alison Murdoch, from
our colleagues in the United

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.590
Kingdom, is going to tell us
about the application of this

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.950
in human disease.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.700
I'd like to remind all of you
that our parochial view of what

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.860
is right and wrong
is sometimes very

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.950
different on the other
side of the big pond.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.620
So we look forward to hearing
all about these comments.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.828
Thank you.

00:32:47.828 --> 00:32:50.298
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.357
-I'm tempted to say,
gosh, follow that.

00:32:56.357 --> 00:32:58.190
First of all, thank you
very much for asking

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.125
me to come and speak to you.

00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.200
It's not only an
honor to come here,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.980
but I would never
refuse an opportunity

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.563
to come to your
lovely city of Boston.

00:33:05.563 --> 00:33:06.350
So thank you.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.730
What I'm going to talk
about is the translation

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.210
of a scientific procedure
into the clinic.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.460
And what's interesting
is that it's actually

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.920
almost the present in the
UK, but it's probably still

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.010
somewhere in the
future in the US.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.750
And that's why half of what
I'm going to talk about today

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.020
is not about the
clinical condition

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.680
or the scientific
solutions we have

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.267
but actually the
way that, in the UK,

00:33:31.267 --> 00:33:33.100
we've gone about the
ethics and the politics

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.450
and why it's actually managed
to get us to that situation.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.640
So, first of all,
the clinical problem.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.490
And forgive me for
very complicated slide.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.140
It's actually
deliberately complicated.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.250
Mitochondria, as
we've already heard,

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.030
are little organisms within
every single cell of our body

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.775
that make the energy.

00:33:56.775 --> 00:33:58.400
The number of
mitochondria and the type

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.300
of mitochondria in different
organisms, in different cells,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.510
change.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.240
And therefore if a mitochondria
is defective in one

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.002
particular tissue
type, it's going

00:34:07.002 --> 00:34:08.460
to give a different
sort of disease

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.460
than it will be if it's
in a different issue.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.580
Also, the severity
of the condition

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.362
will vary considerably,
both depending

00:34:16.362 --> 00:34:17.820
on the mutation of
the mitochondria

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.350
and the number of abnormal
mitochondria in each cell.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.659
So just about any cell in
the body that requires energy

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.010
has the potential to be harmed
by mitochondria disease.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.000
And therefore we
get a whole variety

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.929
of different clinical
situations such as this.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.600
Well, as I say, 90% of the
cellular energy within a cell

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.554
comes from the mitochondria.

00:34:38.554 --> 00:34:41.750
It contains its own genome.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.973
As I said earlier, it's
thought that the mitochondria

00:34:45.973 --> 00:34:47.389
originally come
from bacteria that

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.670
became incorporated into
single-cell organisms, all

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.080
those years ago.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.880
And by providing all
that extra energy,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.699
that allowed all
these single cells

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.180
to get together and make
complex cellular structures

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.880
that we have now.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.260
There is a debate about how
much the mitochondria talks

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.710
to the nucleus.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.960
And I'm not even
going to begin to talk

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.002
about the complex
diagram that's there.

00:35:11.002 --> 00:35:12.460
The evidence would
suggest, though,

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.530
that in clinical
practice there is not

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.380
any compatibility problem
between the mitochondria

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.270
and the nucleus.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.270
And that's because we
reproduce across ethnic groups

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.840
quite easily.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.160
We've also heard, of course,
that the mitochondria

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.410
is transmitted down
the maternal line.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.410
The sperm does obviously
have some mitochondria,

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.090
because it moves.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.330
It has to have some
energy from somewhere.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.204
But it's thought that
the mitochondria that's

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:45.670
within the sperm is removed at
the time of the fertilization.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.840
The amount of DNA,
obviously, in the nucleus

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.415
is huge, compared to the amount
of DNA within mitochondria.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.514
Those who work in
the fertility field--

00:35:58.514 --> 00:36:00.680
and when I give this talk
to the fertility audience,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.030
I really, really say the first
message you must go home with

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.515
is that mitochondria
transfer is not

00:36:06.515 --> 00:36:08.470
a treatment for infertility.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.932
It's nothing to do with IVF.

00:36:09.932 --> 00:36:11.640
It's a potential
treatment for people who

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.470
carry mitochondrial disease.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.060
But what they've done is looked
at oocytes at different levels

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.810
and looked at the copy
numbers of mitochondria

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:18.650
within the oocytes.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.340
And you see huge variations.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.220
But actually there's no evidence
that the number of mitochondria

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.690
within an oocyte have any
clinical significance,

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.564
in terms of the development
potential of that egg

00:36:28.564 --> 00:36:29.480
to make an individual.

00:36:33.372 --> 00:36:35.830
So, in clinical practice, we
start to get a little bit more

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.650
complicated.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.870
This is an example
from a woman who

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.845
carried this particular
mutation of mitochondria.

00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:43.220
But she had
different proportions

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.480
of abnormal mitochondria
in each cell in her body.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.810
So there was 18%
in her quadriceps

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.740
and 7% in leucocytes.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.590
But when they then
look at her oocytes,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.040
we found that the mutation
load varied from anything

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.130
from 0% to 45%.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.340
So it's going to be really
difficult to predict,

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.484
for the women who carry
mitochondrial disease, what

00:37:02.484 --> 00:37:04.900
their chances are that they're
going to have a baby that's

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.190
going to have a problem.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.579
Here's an example.

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:11.620
This mum, here-- I should
say "mom," shouldn't I?

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.580
I'm in the wrong place.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.046
--mom had 38%
abnormal mitochondria.

00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:17.420
She was actually
physically well.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.820
She had no clinical
significant symptoms at all.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.580
She had a daughter who had no
abnormal mitochondria at all

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.540
and was almost
perfectly healthy.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.880
But her son had 78%
abnormal mitochondria,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.310
and he died at the age of seven.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.900
So what's her chances?

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.440
What are her
options, if she wants

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.397
to try and make sure she doesn't
have a child with a problem?

00:37:38.397 --> 00:37:40.230
Well, of course, she
can have egg donations.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.300
She can take the whole egg from
some other woman, fertilized

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.320
with her husband's
sperm, put back in her.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.220
And that would give her
pretty much guarantee

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.840
that she's not going
to have a child

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.230
with mitochondrial disease.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.592
But it won't have any of
her nuclear genome, either.

00:37:51.592 --> 00:37:53.050
And, for a lot of
these women, this

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.080
is just not something that
they would want to consider.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.230
We could do prenatal diagnosis,
we can do amniocentesis,

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.300
and we can determine
what carrier

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.570
the child is going to have.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.153
But obviously the
only option for then

00:38:05.153 --> 00:38:06.730
is the question
about termination.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.930
Because it's so
difficult to identify

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.919
what the clinical phenotype
of that child is going to be,

00:38:12.919 --> 00:38:14.960
it makes that decision
about whether to terminate

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.920
the pregnancy even
more difficult.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.590
We can do PGD, and we do do PGD.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.250
So you can take a biopsy
of an egg and a cell

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:30.330
from an embryo at about three
days after infertilization

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.844
and look at the mutation.

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:34.510
But that's not always
very easy, either.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.950
Because you don't get, as you
would do with a nuclear DNA--

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.540
you don't get a yes or no.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.122
You get a percentage.

00:38:41.122 --> 00:38:43.580
So if you're lucky and you find
that, in that cell that you

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.300
take out from the embryo,
there's no mutations at all,

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.166
you can probably say that
child's going to be OK.

00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:53.280
At less than 30%, there's a
lifetime risk, but it's low.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.080
Once you get higher
levels of that,

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.790
you start to get an increasing
chances that that child's going

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.790
to be affected.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.750
The problem we have with
PGD is that, once you

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:08.740
start sticking a needle into
an embryo and taken cells out,

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.850
you start to
compromise the embryo.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:15.147
Its ability to go on and
then develop and implant

00:39:15.147 --> 00:39:16.230
is going to be disruptive.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.530
So you're then not only going
to look at mutation load you've

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.120
got in that embryo,
you've got to look

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.370
at the quality of that embryo.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.715
Do you put back a
blastocyst, for instance,

00:39:25.715 --> 00:39:28.210
that's a really
perfectly good blastocyst

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.160
but maybe have a 20% chance
of carrying a disease,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.090
or one that's not so good but
might only have a 5% but looks

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.030
like it's actually going to
be more likely to implant?

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:43.000
Complicated decisions
that need to be made.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.890
But for some people,
there are better options.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:52.080
And that would be to try and
do mitochondrial transfer.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.220
This is not three years
old-- three months old

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.990
or three years old.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.630
This is more like 15 years old.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.790
The Newcastle team, led at
that time by Doug Turnbull,

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.000
spoke to the chief medical
officer in the UK at the time

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.070
that they were looking
at the regulations,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.891
the potential legislation
around themselves.

00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:13.390
And the document
he put forward then

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.300
includes a chapter
on the potential

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.150
that we saw at that time that
doing mitochondrial transfer

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.169
was something that
we would start

00:40:20.169 --> 00:40:22.710
doing-- that we thought we might
be able to do in the future.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.376
And I think this was
the important thing

00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:26.670
about anticipating in advance
what was going to happen,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.290
to give ourselves time
to get the legislation

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.546
through in parallel.

00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:34.910
The techniques
we're talking about

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.470
was this, which is the diagram
that Janet was speaking

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.850
to you about at the beginning.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.955
Basically, you take an
egg that's a donor egg.

00:40:41.955 --> 00:40:43.552
You fertilize it.

00:40:43.552 --> 00:40:45.760
And then you take out the
male and female pronucleus.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.330
So you end up with an egg
that's got no nucleus in,

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.630
but it's got normal
mitochondria.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.296
You basically do the
same from the egg

00:40:53.296 --> 00:40:55.110
from the affected
woman, but then you

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.260
take out the nuclear genome from
the defected woman, put it back

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.690
into the donor egg, and
the resulting embryo

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:05.040
will be a healthy child, as
far as the mitochondria is

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.830
concerned.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.510
But it will be genetically
related to mum and dad.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.056
Sounds too easy, doesn't it?

00:41:11.056 --> 00:41:12.680
-[LAUGH]

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.260
-Of course, in order
to do that, you

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.530
have the potential that
you're going to create embryos

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.447
and then you're going
to discard them.

00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:20.780
So someone said, well, why
don't we do spindle transfers

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.529
as an alternative?

00:41:21.529 --> 00:41:24.750
That means taking the
genetic material from the egg

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.110
before it is fertilized.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:31.150
Then you only need to create
an embryo with-- basically,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.670
the final embryo that
you're going to put back.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.940
The problem is that, when
you're looking at the spindle,

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.090
I don't know if any of
you can see the spindle

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.572
in that top, unfertilized egg.

00:41:40.572 --> 00:41:42.530
You can see it quite easy
in the fertilized egg

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.410
because the male and
female chromosomes

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:45.910
are in that little
package karyotype

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.920
that you can see very clearly.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.756
You can use special polarized
light to actually see it.

00:41:50.756 --> 00:41:52.130
And you actually
see the spindle.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:56.764
The spindle's the line
that holds the chromosomes.

00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.180
But the problem
is you're not only

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.417
taking out the chromosomes.

00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:01.250
You've got to take out
all the proteins that

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.700
go with the spindle, to make
the spindle work properly.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.160
And then, if you're not
careful, you're going to take,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.730
potentially, some abnormal
mitochondria, to as well.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.604
So you've got to be really
careful what you do.

00:42:10.604 --> 00:42:13.020
Meiosis II, which is the state
at which you're doing this,

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.130
is a really very
highly dynamic state.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.850
And it's very sensitive
to disruption.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.683
So we've really got to
be careful about what

00:42:19.683 --> 00:42:22.340
we're doing at this time.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.450
However, the
spindle-transfer technique

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.010
has been shown to be successful.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:33.880
These are the two monkeys that
came from the Oregon group.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.970
Obviously these monkeys
are perfectly healthy,

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.110
but they did actually
publish in the paper

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.360
that there was quite a
high degree of abnormality

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.530
in the batch of embryos
that they actually created.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.090
Although subsequent
to that I think

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.090
they have improved
the technique,

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:48.180
and they are getting
better success rates.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.220
So there are two
potential options, there--

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.010
this one perhaps
compromised by the fact

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.801
that they tried to take
a patent out on it.

00:42:56.801 --> 00:43:00.030
And that's a different
issue altogether.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:04.090
So what are the issues
that we've had to address?

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:07.866
And this is where they've
gone down in parallel.

00:43:07.866 --> 00:43:10.490
The scientific work-- basically,
does it work, is it efficient,

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.050
is it safe?

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:12.660
That's been led by
Mary Herbert, who's

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.660
a senior scientist
on laboratory,

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.050
and Louise Hyslop, who's our
clinical embryologist, who

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.760
really has the green
fingers to make it work.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.890
And my role has been
more going along

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.991
the line of looking at
the regulatory and ethical

00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:24.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.676
How could we find to
get it to the point

00:43:26.676 --> 00:43:28.300
that it would be
legal to do in the UK?

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.860
Because at this time, when
we started, it was not legal.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.160
And how would we take the
population along with us?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.091
How would we make them see
that it was actually perhaps

00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:37.590
an ethically
acceptable thing to do?

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.890
So, on the science
side-- and, as I say,

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.740
this is 15 years' work.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:51.365
First of all, Doug Turnbull and
his team did work with mice.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.950
They did the pronuclear
transfer techniques,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.640
and they got live
pups, and they showed

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.030
that the mitochondria
carryover was sufficiently

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:03.380
low to be acceptable.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.675
We then got permission from
the Human Fertilisation

00:44:05.675 --> 00:44:09.360
and Embryology Authority,
who are regulators in the UK,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.300
to do work on abnormally
fertilized human eggs.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.551
When you do IVF, you will
often end up with eggs that are

00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:19.050
fertilized but there's only one
[? pronucleus ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:20.675
[? with ?] the three
or more pronuclei.

00:44:20.675 --> 00:44:23.011
And in order to show that
these techniques would work,

00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:25.260
we would switch over them
over So we ended up with two

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.340
and then developed them.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.430
That was the work that
was published in Nature

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.806
five years ago.

00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:33.180
And, on the back
of that, we then

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.890
got permission from the
HFEA to do the techniques

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.200
in normal eggs.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.120
So these are eggs
donated by healthy women

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.840
in order to do the procedure.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.470
We had to work out what
tests we would need to do,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.030
because not only can we
actually do the technique,

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:53.280
but we've got to show that
it's going to be safe.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.390
So we need to look things
like do the technique

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:58.056
and then look at the karyotype--
look at the epigenetics.

00:44:58.056 --> 00:44:59.430
We had a problem
in saying, well,

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.360
in order for it
to be safe, you've

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.470
got to compare it
with something.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.636
What do you compare it with?

00:45:02.636 --> 00:45:05.030
Because there isn't
a normal-type embryo

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.699
that's an in-vivo embryo that
you could compare it with.

00:45:07.699 --> 00:45:09.240
And the best we
thought we could find

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.890
would be the ICSI
embryos that are

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.340
created, because
these are embryos

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.664
what are already manipulated.

00:45:13.664 --> 00:45:15.455
They've already had
needles stuck into them

00:45:15.455 --> 00:45:17.340
as part of the IVF process.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.640
So we felt if we could
end up with embryos which,

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.430
by everything that we measure,
were going be the same as ICSI,

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.680
then we were probably as
good as we were going to get.

00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:28.590
Just very briefly, this
is some of the work

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.470
that came from the Nature.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.050
And you see, in
figure B, you can

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:33.760
see a one-pronuclear embryo.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.910
In C, you can see three.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.895
Basically, we take
them out, so we end up,

00:45:37.895 --> 00:45:40.680
with D, with no
nuclear material.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.490
And then we take
two, put them back,

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.430
activate the cell to make
it grow, and then go on.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.760
And we get blastocysts.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.140
Unmanipulate controls were 17%.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.240
And the pronuclear-transfer
ones were 8%.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.700
Those are low, compared
to any IVF program.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.120
But don't forget these are
abnormally fertilized embryos

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.590
in the first place.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.840
What we showed, basically,
are proof of principle

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.381
that you could
actually do it and you

00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:08.490
could get onward development
of embryos from that.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.340
And then, of course, you want
to look at the mean carryover

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.640
of the mitochondria.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.110
And the mean was less than 2%.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.590
So we felt we were getting,
in this particular study,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.805
down to levels that would
be clinically acceptable.

00:46:20.805 --> 00:46:23.180
Just as a slight sideline,
before I forget to mention it,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.300
less than 2% is the point
at which you would not

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.530
expect any abnormal mitochondria
to be passed onto the germ

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.949
line of any children
that will be conceived

00:46:32.949 --> 00:46:33.990
as a result of treatment.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.364
So you're not any potentially
helping this child,

00:46:37.364 --> 00:46:39.030
but you're potentially
helping, if she's

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.620
a female, her children, as well.

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:44.450
So where are we, at the moment?

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:48.470
Well, we're getting eggs
donated from healthy volunteers.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.467
We're looking to
develop the techniques.

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:53.050
We're looking to
evaluate the embryos,

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.160
we're looking at the
mitochondrial carryover,

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.910
and we're looking at
the efficiency of it.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.860
We're also working with
the scientific advisors

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.690
of the HFEA, because
they're the ones we're

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.231
going to have to
convince when we put

00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:05.029
an application in
to the HFEA to say,

00:47:05.029 --> 00:47:06.320
now can we do it for treatment?

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.670
So we needed to
be absolutely sure

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.544
that all the experiments
that they were going

00:47:09.544 --> 00:47:12.660
to ask us to do we would have
information about, so we were

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.825
not running behind
ourselves, at the same time,

00:47:14.825 --> 00:47:16.200
thinking there's
going to someone

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.616
that's going to trip us over,
at some point in the future.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.660
So let's move on to
regulation and ethical issues.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.700
These are all the bodies that,
in the UK, have looked at it.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.550
And I'll go through some
of these in more detail.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.530
I've put them into two big
groups, there-- one egg

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.363
donation and one to
mitochondrial donation--

00:47:37.363 --> 00:47:40.720
because those who were
opposed to what we did

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.950
realized very early on that
if we didn't have egg donors

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.700
we couldn't do the work.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.700
So we were challenged very
heavily by people who said,

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.840
it's not ethical for
you to ask young women

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.320
to donate their eggs.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.930
This is different from
any other medical research

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.695
where we have
healthy volunteers.

00:47:57.695 --> 00:47:59.800
And a lot of very
sensible people

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.025
thought that they knew better
than the women themselves

00:48:03.025 --> 00:48:04.400
who were coming
to us and saying,

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.990
yes, we will help donate, and
trying to stop us doing it.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.194
So that's been a bit of
a hurdle to get over.

00:48:10.194 --> 00:48:12.360
And then the question of
the mitochondrial donation,

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.550
as well, has been well debated.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:16.300
I've put in the
social-science literatures

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.840
there, because it
had been a field

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.640
day for social scientists,
over the past 10 years or so.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.030
I find myself the subject of
PhD theses of social scientists.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:29.680
So we're feeding a whole
different academic discipline.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.090
Very briefly, though, in terms
of altruistic egg-donation

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:36.304
for research.

00:48:36.304 --> 00:48:38.470
These are two documents
that you can go and look at,

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.570
if you want more
details about it.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.160
The HFEA did a report in 2006,
which we call the SEED Report.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.890
Now that was the donation
of sperm and eggs

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.552
for clinical treatment.

00:48:48.552 --> 00:48:51.010
But it was a year later that
they went back and said, well,

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.344
if we're going to allow
eggs and sperm to be donated

00:48:53.344 --> 00:48:55.010
for treatment, why
shouldn't we actually

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:56.260
do it for research, as well?

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.640
That, we thought,
was a good idea.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.140
The bottom line of
their discussions

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.620
also included the
question about payment.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.700
And they agreed
that we could pay

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:11.890
up to 750 pounds per donation
to cover their expenses.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:14.262
The Nuffield
Council on Bioethics

00:49:14.262 --> 00:49:16.220
also looked at the question
about egg donation.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.010
They did a wider
study which looked

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.875
at the whole question
about participation

00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:22.110
in medical research,
organ donation,

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.070
the whole question about
medical parts being

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.550
used for clinical
practice and for donation.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.430
But they include a chapter
on eggs for research,

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:33.110
as well, because it was
very topical at the time.

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:34.700
And basically they're
saying that they

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.820
didn't think there was
going to be a problem

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.819
Why should it be regarded
as anything different?

00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:39.800
The use of the eggs
might be contentious,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.430
But the actual
process of donation,

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.510
if the women wanted to
donate, was no more ethically

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.125
challenging than any
other participation

00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:48.185
in medical research.

00:49:51.276 --> 00:49:53.900
The Nuffield Council also looked
at the mitochondrial transfer.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.890
And this is why I should
declare an interest.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:58.760
Because I was actually on the
Nuffield Council at this time.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.740
But I didn't have any part to
play in their deliberations.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.180
I actually left
the room whenever

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.550
this particular
document was discussed.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.910
It's a very detailed document.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.724
And those of you that are
interested in the ethical issue

00:50:09.724 --> 00:50:10.640
should go and read it.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:18.180
I just picked out four parts,
just to go through in outline.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.890
Initially, I think,
people thought

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.376
we were trying to deny that
it was germ-line therapy.

00:50:22.376 --> 00:50:23.750
But that was never
the intention.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.083
And we were always very clear,
right from the beginning,

00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:27.760
this is germ-line therapy.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.720
There is no point in removing
the mitochondria for a woman

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.570
so she can be
healthy but passing

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.680
the same risk on to her child.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.610
And, in fact, germ-line therapy,
in this particular case,

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.660
is exactly what we want.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.890
Got into some difficulty--
some people suggesting,

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.862
well, why don't we then do PGD
and only put back male fetuses,

00:50:47.862 --> 00:50:49.320
because the male
fetus is not going

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.674
to pass on that mitochondria
to the next line?

00:50:51.674 --> 00:50:54.090
Well, hang on-- that's a bit
of sex discrimination, there.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.450
We can't have that.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.340
But there's a nice
debate about that.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.650
There's the whole ethical
issues about doing procedures

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:05.565
that are basically experimenting
on a child that's unborn

00:51:05.565 --> 00:51:06.940
and what the rights
of that child

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.870
might have to have any
say in what's being done.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.000
One of the issues
that's different here

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.320
than the sort of things
become challenging with IVF

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.110
and infertility is
it this is a child

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:22.410
that is likely to be born with
a very high risk of having

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:24.930
a serious medical problem.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.270
And what we're doing
with these techniques

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.322
is reducing the risk.

00:51:29.322 --> 00:51:31.405
It is absolutely true that
this child is not being

00:51:31.405 --> 00:51:32.854
given any choice in the matter.

00:51:32.854 --> 00:51:35.270
But I think we have to take a
little bit of responsibility

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.170
for doing our best
to try and reduce

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.980
the chance, as far of possible,
that that child will be OK.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.270
There was a lot of debate about
mitochondrial DNA and identity.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:48.600
Clearly it doesn't produce
the same identity issues

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.430
as the nuclear DNA does.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:54.300
There was discussion
about whether,

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.909
if you have an
abnormality of your DNA

00:51:55.909 --> 00:51:57.450
that makes you ill,
then that illness

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:59.194
is part of your identity.

00:51:59.194 --> 00:52:00.860
We get slight mixed
messages about that.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.867
Why would we try and cure
anybody, if that were the case?

00:52:04.867 --> 00:52:06.950
The state of the mitochondrial
donor-- big debate,

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.370
and a very important
debate, because it's

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.900
going to depend on what
relationship, then,

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.740
the mitochondrial
donor would have

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.070
with any child or any family
that might be conceived,

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.160
as a result. There's
two arguments.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.574
One what was that you can
say the mitochondrial donor

00:52:22.574 --> 00:52:23.740
is the same as an egg donor.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.240
So an egg or a sperm
donor, in order

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:31.060
to have a child, in the UK that
donor has to give their name

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.620
and has to potentially allow
the child to contact them

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.045
when that child's 18.

00:52:35.045 --> 00:52:37.890
That really restricts the
number of donors we get.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:41.080
Alternatively, you could think
of the mitochondrial donor

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.295
as being someone like a
blood donor-- an organ donor.

00:52:44.295 --> 00:52:46.951
And there are two different
ways of looking at it.

00:52:46.951 --> 00:52:48.450
Fortunately, the
way the regulations

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.520
have come out because
of where I wanted

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.620
it to be, they've come more down
the line of the blood donor,

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.550
not the whole-egg donor.

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.300
So our conclusion was
that, on balance, we

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.860
believe that these
novel techniques,

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.390
if they are adequately
proven to be acceptably

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:04.320
safe and effective
as treatments,

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.319
it would be ethical for
families to use them.

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:07.860
And if they wish to
do, and have been

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.330
offered an appropriate level
of information and support.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:15.060
And this particular document
that's came out was really

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:18.510
helpful, when the debate came
in Parliament to say [? we ?]

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:20.500
[? could ?] move ahead with it.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.590
So-- UK legislation.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:29.340
The act relating to what we
can do with human embryos,

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:33.540
preimplantation, was in 1990.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.950
It's very good legislation,
because it gives us a good

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:39.720
framework that says what
we can and we cannot do.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.826
And as long as we abide
by that legislation,

00:53:41.826 --> 00:53:42.700
we're going to be OK.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.230
I would have to say that the
way that it's implemented

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.984
by the authority that regulates
is perhaps a little bit more

00:53:47.984 --> 00:53:49.150
robust than will be helpful.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.770
They needed to come
back to it later on,

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.436
because the original
act of Parliament

00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:59.310
does allow us to do some
research on embryos,

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:00.300
but it was restricted.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.900
So we could do
research to understand

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.436
the cause of infertility.

00:54:03.436 --> 00:54:05.310
We could do research on
embryos to understand

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.740
the cause of miscarriage.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.180
But once you start getting
into potential research

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.940
to treat serious diseases
like mitochondria,

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.470
it wasn't covered by the act.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.870
So they came and
revised it in 2001,

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.030
so that then it was possible
to research on embryos

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.330
for the purpose of
understanding the causes

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:26.470
and developing treatments
for serious diseases.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:29.120
I've put in the
cloning act, there.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.472
There was a slight miswording
in the original act that

00:54:31.472 --> 00:54:34.584
meant potentially that
reproductive cloning could

00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:35.250
legal in the UK.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.208
They very quickly stopped
that, as soon as they

00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:39.190
realized that was a problem.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.450
We are not cloning.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:43.810
The act was revised
in 2008, because that

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.024
was at the point at
which we were-- it was

00:54:46.024 --> 00:54:47.190
a routine review of the act.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.160
But we were saying
then, we're not that

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.250
far away from being
able to come to you

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:54.180
and say this is actually
someone we'd like to do.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.490
So the important thing
in the act in 2008

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:59.290
was they put a clause in
that said we would not

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:01.770
need to go back to
primary legislation

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.140
in order to allow this to
become legal in the UK.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.290
It was still illegal,
under the act,

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.940
but they said that we could go
back to the secretary of state

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.360
and ask permission.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.290
And that would allow
us to get it through.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:17.340
But it would need to go back
to debate in Parliament.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.459
So the regulations
that were put together

00:55:19.459 --> 00:55:21.000
that will make this
something that we

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.360
can do-- these techniques
for nuclear transfer

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.510
an spindle transfer-- make them
legally acceptable techniques

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.670
were put to Parliament.

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:31.060
They were debated and voted
in the House of Commons

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.350
in February this year.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:36.150
Massive vote in favor.

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:41.410
And then, in the House of Lords,
later in February, again, 208

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.360
for and 48 against.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.070
It was pretty overwhelming.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.192
I was in the debate for
the House of Lords one.

00:55:47.192 --> 00:55:49.400
I'd never seen so many
members of the House of Lords,

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.358
because usually they
sleep in the back benches.

00:55:51.358 --> 00:55:53.220
But it was very full.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:58.350
But even the bishops who
were there were abstaining--

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:01.010
were saying, we're understanding
humanity-- what it was

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:02.310
and what we were trying to do.

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.050
I think the big
advantage in the UK

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.710
this it's not a party
political issue.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:07.940
This was a free vote.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.740
It was based on
consciences alone,

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.020
and that was very helpful.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.830
Issues related to reproduction
legislation in the UK

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:17.430
has never been a
party political issue.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:22.337
So where we are now--
these procedures

00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:23.920
were passed by
Parliament in February.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.460
They will become the law
at the end of October.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.110
That means at that
point we can apply

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.040
to be the HFEA for a license.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.590
At that point, the
scientific data

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:33.820
will be reviewed by the HFEA.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.004
And if they say that
we have provided

00:56:36.004 --> 00:56:37.420
the evidence as
necessary, we hope

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.628
we'll get a license to do it.

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:40.390
So we could be in
a position to be

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:43.646
able to offer this in treatment
within the next few months.

00:56:43.646 --> 00:56:46.020
I'm going to give you just a
little bit about the science

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.645
where they are.

00:56:46.645 --> 00:56:50.040
Because, obviously, the
science is developing.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.580
We're getting 92% oocytes
surviving the pronuclear

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.600
transfer procedure.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.370
And the blastocycte development
right now has gone up to 54%.

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.911
Louise is really
green-fingerprinting

00:56:57.911 --> 00:56:58.870
these techniques.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.930
Obviously the data
that's really important

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.957
is looking at the carryover,
looking at the chromosomes,

00:57:03.957 --> 00:57:05.790
looking at stem cells
that have been derived

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.130
and what the deal is.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:08.588
I'm not going to
give you this now,

00:57:08.588 --> 00:57:10.760
because it's too
politically sensitive,

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.260
and it's not
appropriate to give you

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.301
that sort of scientific
data before it's actually

00:57:14.301 --> 00:57:16.870
formally gone to peer review.

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:19.080
Mary Herbert, who's the
scientist that leads this,

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.770
is a very good scientist.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.250
She's very careful, and
she's very cautious.

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.010
Her team is small,
but it's really good.

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.850
The way that the
science has developed

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.050
in this particular
area of procedures

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.940
has to be slightly different.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.380
It's not any good
to be the "I want

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.970
to be the first in Nature
for the publication"

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.240
and then get it wrong
and make a mistake.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.461
What we need to do is
to be absolutely sure

00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:43.960
that, when we get
it published, it's

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.450
as good as it's going
to be, it's robust,

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:49.070
and that will give us
the safety of issues

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:53.070
that we need to have
to make it work.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.447
So these are the
scientists that were here.

00:57:55.447 --> 00:57:57.280
Now, obviously, there
have been an awful lot

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.030
of other people
who've been involved,

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.850
talking about the ethics,
the lobbying, the politics.

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:05.160
But I'm going to pick out just
one group on my final slide,

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.780
just to say.

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.220
The Lily Foundation
was an organization

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:14.890
that was set up
by Lily's parents

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.430
to support research and develop
treatments to help prevent

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.650
mitochondrial disease.

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:22.110
Lily died at the age
of eight months old

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.520
from mitochondrial disease.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.960
It was Lily's parents, and
like her who went to the press.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.620
They went on the radio,
they went to the newspapers,

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.680
and told their stories.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.562
They took their babies
into the television studios

00:58:35.562 --> 00:58:37.020
and showed them to
people and said,

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:40.090
my baby's going to die
in a few months' time.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:41.675
And really that
was the thing that

00:58:41.675 --> 00:58:44.720
was most powerful in getting
it to the stage in the UK

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.500
that it is now.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.050
I think Lily won, in the end.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.418
Thank you.

00:58:49.418 --> 00:58:52.292
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:03.380
-Clearly, they are
leading new frontiers

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.240
and are grappling with issues
that we'll have an opportunity

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.890
to learn from, as
this technology--

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:10.420
which, to the best
of my knowledge,

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.040
exists nowhere at
the development stage

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.034
that it is in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne--

00:59:15.034 --> 00:59:16.950
we'll have the opportunity
to learn from them,

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:18.030
as we go forward.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:18.850
The hour's late.

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.420
I want to move on
to our last speaker.

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:26.680
If we can find DNA, sequence
DNA, and change DNA,

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.990
is that enough?

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.220
And our last speaker
will tell us No,

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.240
because he's a
synthetic biologist,

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.700
and he's going to make new DNA.

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.970
If he can find his pointer.
[LAUGH] There we go.

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:41.690
Sorry.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.060
Welcome.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.160
-Yeah.

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:50.660
So, hi.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.344
So my name's Floyd Romesberg.

00:59:52.344 --> 00:59:54.010
It's a real pleasure
to come to tell you

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.593
about some of the
research in my group

00:59:55.593 --> 00:59:57.040
at the Scripps
Research Institute.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.664
So fundamentally what
I'm interested in

00:59:58.664 --> 01:00:01.000
and what my group works
on are different aspects

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.474
of thinking about
evolution and applying it.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.640
And it's all from a very
much chemist's perspective.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.830
I'm a chemist by training.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:10.210
And so what I'm so what the
project's largely focused on

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.560
are trying to develop--
use concepts from evolution

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.940
to develop novel approaches
to antibiotics discovery,

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.850
biophysical characterization,
to understand

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.225
the process of evolution.

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:20.100
And what I'm going to
talk to you about today

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.900
is an attempt to expand
the genetic alphabet--

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:27.250
to augment the potential of
what evolution can do so.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.527
So the project, especially
in its early days,

01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:31.860
was focused very much on
expanding the genetic alphabet.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.000
So there it is.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.300
That's the genetic
alphabet of E. coli.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.170
If you can't see it, let
me blow it up for you.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.394
So I gave this talk in
China, about a year ago.

01:00:40.394 --> 01:00:42.310
And someone came up to
me afterwards and said,

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.050
you know, you have
a lot of nerve,

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.035
showing the Japanese
flag in China.

01:00:45.035 --> 01:00:46.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.130
But anyway.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.360
So the genetic alphabet
in all organisms-- and I

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.690
could've told you-- I
mean, this is E. coli,

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.270
but it looks pretty
much the same.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:55.560
It's just long strings
of Gs, Cs, As, and Ts.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.040
And Gs pair with C,
and As pair with T.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.170
And that's the mechanism
of replication and storage

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:06.200
and retrieval of
genetic information.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.510
And so, if one were
interested in expanding that,

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:10.889
to create an
organism that stored

01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:12.930
more information-- eventually
could retrieve more

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:15.100
information-- such
a semisynthetic cell

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.805
might look something like this.

01:01:16.805 --> 01:01:18.180
There's a variety
of things you'd

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.305
have to be concerned about.

01:01:19.305 --> 01:01:21.200
You'd have to have your
unnatural nucleotide.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.490
So you'd have to have a
third pair of nucleotides.

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:25.749
So G, C, A, and T
are all nucleotides.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:27.790
You'd have to have nucleotide
X and nucleotide Y.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.982
And X and Y would have
to pair with each other.

01:01:29.982 --> 01:01:31.940
So, for example, if you
had Y in a piece of DNA

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.650
during DNA
replication, you'd have

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:35.966
to have the correct
triphosphate that's

01:01:35.966 --> 01:01:37.465
the activated form
of the nucleoside

01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:39.420
that the polymerase needs.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.310
You'd have to have that
polymerase faithfully

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.414
and with high
efficiency recognize

01:01:43.414 --> 01:01:45.080
the unnatural nucleotide
in the template

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.280
and put in its cognate
pair in the growing strand,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.734
during replication.

01:01:49.734 --> 01:01:52.150
And then, of course, you'd
have to have an RNA polymerase.

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:54.884
You'd have to have the requisite
triphosphates available

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:55.550
within the cell.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.341
You'd have to have an
RNA polymerase, then,

01:01:57.341 --> 01:01:59.880
that recognizes
templates containing

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.525
DNA genes-- for
example, containing

01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:04.221
the unnatural nucleotide--
to produce RNA strands that

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.720
contain the unnatural nucleotide
which would go out and find

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.390
the ribosome and
maybe direct tRNA--

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.760
the ribosomes-- to synthesize
proteins containing

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.740
unnatural amino acids.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.540
So I don't have a lot of
time to tell you about what

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.921
our interest and why we're
so interested in eventually

01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:20.670
getting to the state
of producing proteins

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.875
with unnatural amino acids.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:24.000
But suffice it to say that
protein therapeutics are

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.400
a big deal, despite
having really

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.887
limited chemical functionality
available within them.

01:02:28.887 --> 01:02:31.220
And if one could expand the
scope of what proteins could

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.864
be made, maybe even
in evolvable context,

01:02:33.864 --> 01:02:35.780
one could imagine
developing therapeutics that

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.630
really revolutionize medicine.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.089
So at this point I do want to
acknowledge the seminal work

01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.880
of a couple people.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.350
Peter Schultz, who has worked
with recoding an amber codon.

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:50.675
So, of the 64
possible codons that

01:02:50.675 --> 01:02:52.860
are available in natural
DNA, three of them

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.520
are reserved as stop signals.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.600
And Pete was clever
enough to figure out

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.550
how to take one of those
and have it recognized

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:04.360
by an unnatural-- a tRNA from
a different organism that

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.360
was charged by an enzyme
that charges tRNAs

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.730
with an unnatural amino acid.

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:11.146
And he a couple of those that
work really want in E. coli.

01:03:11.146 --> 01:03:14.160
And partly I'm acknowledging
him because we plan fully

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.450
on stealing those tRNAs.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:21.350
And, instead of recoding
for them with stop codons,

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:24.260
the idea is to generate
with unnatural nucleotides,

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.320
essentially, an infinite
number of new codons

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.056
that you could use to encode
for unnatural amino acids.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.680
And the second person
I want to mention

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.770
is Steve Benner, who was
the first to popularize

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:34.690
the idea of developing
unnatural nucleotides.

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:36.250
And the way Steve
did it was he said,

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:40.155
look-- G-C and A-T sort of
pair in a complementary way,

01:03:40.155 --> 01:03:42.030
based on something called
"hydrogen bonding."

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.000
So you have a hydrogen donor
here, and an acceptor here,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.030
and that's sticky.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.020
That's water-like.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.614
And he worked for years.

01:03:49.614 --> 01:03:51.280
And he's made a lot
of progress, lately.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.970
But one of the
problems that he had

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:55.430
was that those hydrogen-bonding
patterns could scramble.

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.380
And because natural G, C, A,
and T recognize each other

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.909
based on similar sorts of
hydrogen-bonding patterns,

01:04:01.909 --> 01:04:03.200
it was a real fidelity problem.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.850
So his unnatural
nucleotides would

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.640
mis-pair with the natural ones.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.321
So the approach that
we took-- I want

01:04:08.321 --> 01:04:09.570
to give you a couple examples.

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.611
Now there's way more
information here than I want

01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:13.890
you to absorb in any detail.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.140
So, first of all,
what I'm showing here

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.110
is the nucleobase
of the nucleotides.

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:20.240
So this is the part that
pairs with each other.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.870
The rest of the nucleotide
has a little sugar, down here,

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.070
and maybe a phosphate.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:26.080
And I'm ignoring
those, for simplicity.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.580
The synthetic
chemists in my lab who

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.400
slave away for
years, making these,

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.240
love me reducing
them to this little--

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.950
So one thing I want
to mention about this

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.658
is that we did not
take Steve's approach.

01:04:36.658 --> 01:04:38.880
We took up-- these are
all hydrophobic, oily,

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.850
greasy-looking.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.361
So everyone knows that
water and oil don't mix.

01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:44.110
So that's called the
"hydrophobic effect."

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:45.866
Partly that's the
hydrophobic effect.

01:04:45.866 --> 01:04:47.240
Water and oil
exclude each other.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.600
Water likes to be with water,
and oil likes to be with oil.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.683
So we thought, if we make
hydrophobic nucleobases,

01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:53.380
maybe they'll pair
with each other

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.680
and avoid the more
water-like nucleobases.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.660
And maybe we can start with
greater orthogonality-- greater

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.070
ability to not mis-pair with
the natural nucleotides.

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:02.140
So that's one thing about these.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:02.930
These are all hydrophobic.

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:04.555
They're also large,
because we thought,

01:05:04.555 --> 01:05:06.779
heck-- you know, we're taking
the hydrogen bonds out.

01:05:06.779 --> 01:05:08.820
What else is going to
stabilize the DNA, if we've

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.986
taken the hydrogen ones out?

01:05:09.986 --> 01:05:12.550
So we need large
surface area to pair

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:15.431
within a strand of that
double-strand, duplex DNA,

01:05:15.431 --> 01:05:16.180
to make it stable.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.935
So that's one thing-- they're
all large and hydrophobic--

01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:18.760
that I want to point out.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.799
And the second thing
about the approach we took

01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:22.590
is that we didn't take
the traditional sort

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:26.290
of biorganic chemists' approach,
where we make something,

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.265
design it very carefully,
maybe, make it, and then spend

01:05:29.265 --> 01:05:30.690
a year studying it.

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:32.580
We took a
medicinal-chemistry approach,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.480
where we made lots of
analogs, we analyzed them

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.660
with assays that were
very fast, and then

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.560
we could evaluate
changes that we made

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.830
and build structure activity
relationships-- SARs-- just

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:44.350
like medicinal chemists do.

01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:47.090
I'm a huge fan of
medicinal chemists.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:50.110
And, in that way, optimize
the unnatural base pair.

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.830
So the sorts of assays
is not real important.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.590
But we measure the
temperature at which

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:55.830
the duplex falls apart.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.890
That gives you a
measure of stability.

01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:59.690
So we put the different
unnatural pairs

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.560
within the duplex and
measured stability.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.330
And then the real key
SAR came out of kinetics.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:08.000
We take a DNA primer-- a
template that has the unnatural

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.230
nucleotide ready to direct the
incorporation of its correct

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.540
triphosphate, as I mentioned--
and then we add a DNA

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.130
polymerase and measure how
quickly and efficiently it can

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:18.570
do that, relative to
potential mis-pairs..

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:19.521
Now there's two steps.

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.770
There's an incorporation step.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:21.880
That's the step where
you actually pull

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.250
the unnatural nucleobase
out of solution-- unnatural

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.680
nucelotide-- and
covalently attach it

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.070
to this primer terminus.

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.200
But now the primer
terminus is unnatural.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.930
So the next step of maybe
adding the next correct, natural

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:34.050
nucleotide is different.

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:35.845
So we call that the
"extension" step.

01:06:35.845 --> 01:06:37.595
So we evaluate both
of them independently.

01:06:37.595 --> 01:06:41.989
The incorporation step
wound up-- in retrospect,

01:06:41.989 --> 01:06:44.030
we wound up sort of
referring to this first group

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:45.740
of unnatural
nucleobases' nucleotides

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.840
as our first-generation analogs.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.960
And the SAR that
really came out of that

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.640
was that those analogs--
we could optimize them

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.230
for that incorporation
step to be very efficient.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.890
What became the real challenge
was optimizing this extension

01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:58.840
step.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.520
That became the
biggest challenge.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.497
So we solved a structure
of one of the better

01:07:04.497 --> 01:07:06.580
of the first-generation
analogs, and that was just

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.947
this propinal isocarbostyril.

01:07:07.947 --> 01:07:10.030
It's kind of a joke, in
my lab, how we name these.

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.820
Because we tried to
be very systematic,

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.290
at first, but we've
synthesized about 250.

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:16.260
And you just run out of names.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:20.330
So we solved the structure
of DNA containing this.

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.970
And we solved it with Dave
Wemmer at Berkeley and Pete

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:24.426
Schultz at Scripps.

01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:25.050
And here it is.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.160
So here's a piece of duplex DNA.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.050
Here's our little pair,
stuck in the middle.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.960
And you see it doesn't look
like a Watson-Crick pair.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.900
So all these other
pairs-- these G-C pairs--

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.450
these famous rungs of the
ladder-- didn't look like that.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.010
It looks like this.

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:39.189
They cross-strand
intercalate, because they're

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:40.980
big and hydrophobic
and greasy, and they're

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.341
grabbing onto each other.

01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:43.840
And maybe that
doesn't surprise you,

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.131
because we didn't design
these to pair with each other.

01:07:46.131 --> 01:07:49.170
This just came out of the SAR.

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:50.610
But in our mind's
eye, we thought

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:53.720
that this explained that
SAR that I just described.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.780
So if you imagine this same
modality of interaction

01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.480
is occurring during replication
in a polymerase-active site--

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.970
let's say this is
a template, this

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:03.530
is a growing primer strand.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:05.160
As you add this
unnatural nucleotide,

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.270
it's going to reach out and
intercalate into its-- reach

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:10.650
into its opposite strand.

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:14.030
And most of the distortion that
comes with that pinching down,

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:17.790
for this to happen, is going
to be absorbed by the primer

01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:20.920
terminus, because it's less
locked down by the polymerase.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.041
It's more free to move.

01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:24.499
So that's why it synthesized
well, because it's getting out

01:08:24.499 --> 01:08:24.950
of water.

01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.000
It doesn't like being in water.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:26.620
It's hydrophobic.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.250
It's getting to this beautiful
hydrophobic environment

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.895
that it loves, but now it has
a distorted primer terminus,

01:08:30.895 --> 01:08:32.257
and it can't go on.

01:08:32.257 --> 01:08:33.840
So we thought that
explained the data.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.340
So, in what became known as our
"second-generation analogs,"

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.010
we made smaller analogs.

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.130
And we said, look-- the
incorporation step was

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:42.120
so subject to
optimization, maybe

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.500
we can make smaller analogs that
are less prone to intercalate

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.540
and optimize the incorporation
step anyway, and then

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.399
be in a better position to
optimize extension, as well.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:53.255
This kind of worked.

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:55.505
And I don't have a lot of
time to explain this to you,

01:08:55.505 --> 01:08:56.630
because there's a subtlety.

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.850
But there was a real
contradiction in the SAR.

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:02.200
And that was, it had to do with
the nature of the substituent

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.080
that I've shown here.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.100
So chemists would call
this the "ortho position"

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.630
to the glycosidic bond.

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:09.069
The "glycosidic bond" is just
a name for the sugar bond.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:10.569
So this is the sugar bond.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:13.979
And so it's this position
I've noted, there.

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:16.890
In order for the insertion
step to be efficient,

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.510
whenever the nucleobase--
the unnatural nucleotide

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:21.830
is in the template or is
the incoming triphosphate,

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:25.500
you want that substituent
to be hydrophobic-- greasy.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.452
But when it comes to the next
step, the extension step,

01:09:28.452 --> 01:09:29.910
you still want it
to be hydrophobic

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:31.439
when it's in the
template, but when

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.130
it's in the primer terminus
you need it to be hydrophilic.

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:35.569
You need it to accept an H bond.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:37.300
And for those
polymerase aficionados

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.870
in the audience-- I know
there are a couple of you--

01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:41.979
it's because the polymerase
is donating an H bond.

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:44.609
It needs to interact in
an H-bonding-like way

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:45.870
with that primer terminus.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.359
So it's not an
H-bond interaction

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.310
between the nucleobases,
it's an H bond

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.359
between the growing primer
terminus and the polymerase.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:55.282
So we were kind of stuck,
because that's a contradiction.

01:09:55.282 --> 01:09:57.490
How do you make an analog
that's both hydrophobic and

01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:59.050
hydrophilic simultaneously?

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.820
So we ran a couple of
independent screens

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.340
where we screened through
over almost 2,000 candidate

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.890
unnatural base pairs.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.670
They were independent screens.

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:09.910
And the only important point
is they both identified

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:13.450
the very same pair-- a
first-generation analog,

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:15.440
and a second-generation analog.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.050
This was the second of a series
of methyl methoxy derivatives,

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:22.880
and this was this 5-methyl
sulfur isocarbostyril.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.470
And notice the nature
of these substituents.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:29.710
Sulfur is able to accept
a hydrogen bond but not

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:31.990
as good as the oxygen.
But it's still able to.

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:33.980
But it's much more
polarizable and hydrophobic.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.060
So it's a compromise.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.890
And O methyl is
just a bond rotation

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:40.040
away from presenting
a hydrophobic surface

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.260
versus an H-bonding surface.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.830
So, at least in
our mind's eye, we

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:45.660
envisioned that was how that
SAR conflict was resolved.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.150
But this very much, very
quickly reinvigorated

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:48.950
our design effort.

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:52.740
And we optimized this pair
by filling in this ring,

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.620
here, resulting in what we
called this naphthyl methoxy

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.149
or NAM 5,6 pair.

01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:59.690
And a lot of what I'm going to
tell you about in this last 13

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:03.020
minutes is work with this pair.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.620
Very recently, we've discovered
this analog of TPT5,6 called

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.250
"TPT3," which replicates
better than this pair.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.030
In the early days, we
did a lot of kinetics.

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:17.740
This pair replicates too well to
measure by kinetics-- too fast.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.720
So we use a sequencing method.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.260
So we submit the DNA to
the sequencing facility,

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.181
using just standard
Sanger sequencing,

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:27.180
where you don't have the
unnatural triphosphates

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.720
present.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.590
You see an abrupt termination at
the spot of the unnatural base

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.270
pair.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:35.230
And you can ratio the amplitudes
and get calibration curves

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:36.640
to determine fidelities.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.440
We've done PCR amplifications.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.015
These are 150 more
pieces of DNA.

01:11:40.015 --> 01:11:42.140
And I'm only showing you
the local sequence context

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.010
so that we can replicate
in a whole variety

01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:45.620
of different sequence
contexts, including

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.890
sequence contexts where
the unnatural base

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.540
pairs are next to each other.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.130
Now, really quick, I shouldn't
take the time to tell you this,

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.046
but I love this story.

01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:55.100
This is maybe one my
favorite parts of the story.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.580
We solved the
structure of NAM5,6.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.896
And, lo and behold, it
was intercalated again.

01:12:01.896 --> 01:12:06.140
It was a real light-bulb
experience in my life.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.490
They're never going to do this.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.830
There's nothing to be
had-- there's nothing

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:09.990
to be gotten from doing this.

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.890
There's no H bonds there.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:12.598
They're going to do
whatever they can do,

01:12:12.598 --> 01:12:14.170
and that's intercalate.

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:16.420
Now, if you go into a medicinal
chemist, and you said,

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.500
look, we've got this molecule
with this great activity.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.530
It's a great antibiotic.

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:21.446
And the medicinal chemist
will tell you, well,

01:12:21.446 --> 01:12:22.260
what's the target?

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.210
And you'll say,
well, I don't know.

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:23.782
Who cares?

01:12:23.782 --> 01:12:24.990
It's got this great activity.

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:27.530
You won't get any interest,
because medicinal chemists have

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:29.900
been burned too many
times, chasing ghosts--

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.340
chasing artifacts.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.444
So we wanted to know, is this
a harbinger of a problem?

01:12:34.444 --> 01:12:35.860
Is there something
going on, here?

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.410
Because DNA polymerases don't
recognize things like this.

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:41.010
So how is it that--
I just told you

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:42.810
that it's really
well replicated.

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:43.350
How is that?

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.183
This makes no sense.

01:12:44.183 --> 01:12:45.900
So let me tell you
what I mean by that.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.760
Here's a G-C base pair.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.880
G paired with C. Doesn't
matter whether it's in a duplex

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.390
or whether it's at a
polymerase-active site, where

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.390
you're pairing a triphosphate
against a template

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.460
during synthesis.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.600
It just looks the same.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.262
A G-C looks the
same as a C-G. It

01:13:01.262 --> 01:13:03.720
looks the same as a T-A and an
A-T. They all look the same.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.345
The famous Watson-Crick
base-structure.

01:13:05.345 --> 01:13:06.449
There it is.

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.740
That's not what ours look like.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.580
Ours are this weird
intercalation.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.484
Ours look more like
an A-A mis-pair.

01:13:11.484 --> 01:13:12.900
And how is it that
the polymerases

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.910
are recognizing them?

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:15.330
So this is how polymerases work.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:16.860
Polymerases look
like a right hand.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.480
The template lies down like
this-- in the palm domain.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.750
And when the correct
triphosphate binds,

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.450
it induces a large
conformational change

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:27.740
of the fingers domain, down
over the palm and thumb domains.

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.750
That forms a tight
complex that's

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.880
supposed to rigorously select
for a Watson-Crick base-pair

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.601
structure.

01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:34.600
So we had two questions.

01:13:37.182 --> 01:13:39.640
Number one, does formation of
our unnatural base pair cause

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.973
that same conformational change?

01:13:40.973 --> 01:13:43.956
Number two, if it does,
what is that closed complex

01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:44.455
recognizing?

01:13:44.455 --> 01:13:46.039
Because our pair
doesn't look anything

01:13:46.039 --> 01:13:47.079
like a Watson-Crick pair.

01:13:47.079 --> 01:13:49.350
It looks like a mis-pair the
polymerases were supposed

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:50.615
to have evolved to avoid.

01:13:50.615 --> 01:13:52.990
So we collaborated with a good
friend of mine, Andy Marx,

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.310
at the University
Konstanz, who solved

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:55.330
a bunch of crystal structures.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.470
I'm willing to show a couple
of the key ones, here.

01:13:57.470 --> 01:14:00.759
This is the polymerase,
bound to the primer template.

01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:03.050
Here's the only part of the
polymerase I'm showing you.

01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:06.060
There are two helices at the
base of that fingers domain

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:07.990
that I mentioned.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.490
And here's our
unnatural nucleotide,

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:11.060
flipped out of the
developing duplex.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:11.910
Not a big surprise.

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:14.120
Most of the natural
nucleobases do the same thing.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120
There's a little hydrophobic
pocket right there.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.820
When you add the cognate
unnatural triphosphate,

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.380
it flips back in.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.170
And you get a large
conformational change

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:23.297
of that fingers domain.

01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:25.130
And, to show you that
conformational change,

01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:26.760
here's an overlay of
those two structures.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.170
And you can see the
conformational change,

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:28.800
right there.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.640
To convince you it's
exactly the same

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.190
as the conformational change
induced by a natural base pair,

01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:35.700
here's an overlay of those
complexes synthesizing

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.820
our unnatural base pair
with that synthesizing

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:40.660
a G-C. They're absolutely
superimposable,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.320
at the secondary structure-- the
protein-structure level-- even

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.940
at the side-chain level,
and even at the bound water

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.330
and magnesium level.

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:49.860
So it really induces the very
same conformational change

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.050
in the DNA polymerase.

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:52.674
So now, what about
the second question?

01:14:52.674 --> 01:14:54.440
What's that closed
complex recognizing?

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.170
And if your eyes are
good, you can already see.

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.300
But if your eyes are like
mine, let me help you.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.774
This was a good day in my lab.

01:15:04.774 --> 01:15:06.440
The unnatural base
pair's not replicated

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.880
by some weird mechanism.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.320
It's replicated by a subtle
variation of the same mechanism

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.820
that a natural
pair's replicated by.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.830
A natural pair is replicated by
what's called an "induced fit

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.430
mechanism," where
its formation drives

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.930
a large conformational
change in the polymerase.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:20.039
I already mentioned that.

01:15:20.039 --> 01:15:21.580
The unnatural base
pair is replicated

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.650
by a mutual induced
fit mechanism, where

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:25.858
its formation drives that
large conformational change

01:15:25.858 --> 01:15:27.910
on the polymerase, but
that conformational change

01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:29.910
on the polymerase drives
a conformational change

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:32.650
of the base pair,
to produce the pair

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:34.870
that it needs for recognition.

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:36.930
And I think the
ability to do this

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:39.340
is exactly what we spent
12 years optimizing on

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.987
in that med-chem-like campaign.

01:15:40.987 --> 01:15:43.570
I don't think-- if we would have
chosen any other force, other

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.986
than hydrophobicity,
I don't think

01:15:44.986 --> 01:15:48.944
we would have had this
strength and flexibility

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:49.860
to be able to do this.

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.880
Because the hydrophobic
force is strong,

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.230
but it's not very directional.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.350
So has the ability to respond to
the environment that it needs.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:59.510
So, having shown you
that replicates well,

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:02.330
and actually believing that
we understood why-- we're not

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:04.270
getting faked out, we're
not chasing a ghost--

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:06.450
we sort of return to
our idea of trying

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:08.490
to develop a semisynthetic
organism-- trying

01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:11.720
to implement the unnatural
base pair in a living cell.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.262
So the first problem that
just jumps out at you

01:16:14.262 --> 01:16:16.220
is, how do you get the
triphosphates available?

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.199
So anyone who thinks
about nucleotide chemistry

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.240
knows there's a couple
things that you could try.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.670
There are several drugs
based on free nucleosides

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:25.660
defusing in through membranes
and then being metabolized up

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.757
to this triphosphate
level by enzymes that

01:16:27.757 --> 01:16:28.965
are called "salvage" enzymes.

01:16:31.931 --> 01:16:34.190
It's one of the ways
cells make triphosphates.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.800
Bacteria do this
very sporadically.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.640
They don't actually
rely on it very much.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.617
And very little was
known about penetration

01:16:39.617 --> 01:16:40.450
across the membrane.

01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:44.400
Suffice it to say, despite
immense amount of work--

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.670
about a year of work-- that
did not work, in my lab.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:47.680
We could not get that to work.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.930
So there's another
method that I'm not

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:50.138
going to tell you much about.

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.345
But you could imagine
protecting the-- I mean,

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:54.470
the reason the triphosphates
won't get in-- they'll

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:55.890
get into through
the outer membrane--

01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:57.760
this is a gram-negative--
this is an E. coli

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.854
cell-- through channels
called "porins."

01:17:00.854 --> 01:17:02.270
They're just these
water channels.

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:04.629
And this hydrophilic is
charged, so it'll diffuse in.

01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:07.170
But then it won't be able to
get across this inner membrane--

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.740
Which, in this example, is blue.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.990
You might have not known that.

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:15.457
The cytoplasmic membrane
of a gram-negative is blue.

01:17:15.457 --> 01:17:16.790
And so the charge prevents that.

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:19.530
So maybe if you put on these
ester-blocking groups that

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.110
oblate the charge, it'd
help them diffuse in.

01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:25.610
And then, once in,
maybe E. coli will

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:28.330
have these nonspecific esterases
that-- just chop them off,

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:29.630
and you're ready to go.

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:30.190
Doesn't work.

01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:32.400
We made 18 analogs like that.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.620
And none of them would work.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:37.300
So we were really stuck,
not knowing what to do.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.340
This is where I
real-- so I just gave

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:42.150
a talk to the graduate students
at Scripps, at a retreat.

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.780
And the whole theme
of my talk was

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.987
to think differently, in a
really interdisciplinary way.

01:17:46.987 --> 01:17:50.550
And this was the example I used.

01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:52.305
It turns out that
there are a variety

01:17:52.305 --> 01:17:55.820
of genomes that have this
really interesting property.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.817
And the property is, they
autonomously replicate.

01:17:58.817 --> 01:18:00.275
So they have to
have triphosphates,

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:02.870
and-- but they don't
encode the machinery

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:04.640
of triphosphate synthesis.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.230
And these genomes are some
obligate intracellular

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:10.000
bacteria-- some
chlamydial species--

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.550
and some plastids in
eukaryotes-- like algae.

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:18.824
So, like mitochondria
and chloroplasts.

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:20.990
What they do is-- I mean,
they live their whole life

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:24.270
inside other cells, bathing in
the nutrients of those cells.

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.021
So what they do is
they scavenge instead--

01:18:26.021 --> 01:18:27.686
they've just found
it easier to do that.

01:18:27.686 --> 01:18:29.710
Over evolutionary time,
they've optimized that.

01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:34.205
So what these
organisms do is they

01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:36.330
don't make the machinery
of triphosphate synthesis.

01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:38.246
What they do is they
make dedicated nucleoside

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:41.390
triphosphate transporters
that assemble in the membrane

01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.280
and transport the triphosphates,
intact, as triphosphates,

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.390
into the cell.

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:49.250
We wrote all across the world
to about 18 different groups.

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:53.570
And a few of them were
willing to send us their DNA.

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.480
And so we cloned them
into our E. coli strain

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.250
and asked if they would work.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:01.300
And they did, and we narrowed
it down to three or four.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.760
So this is the strategy.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.712
Because we found
that the idea would

01:19:04.712 --> 01:19:06.670
be to get a transporter
here, the triphosphates

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.360
would diffuse in
through those porins

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.750
and then get into the cytoplasm
through this transporter.

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:14.475
And this particular transporter,
from a chlamydial species-- oh,

01:19:14.475 --> 01:19:16.230
I forgot to add a title.

01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:18.450
At least you know I got
this talk ready specifically

01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:18.991
for you guys.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:28.260
The transporter that we call
"PTNTT2"-- here's its activity.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.770
So it's importing A.
So what we're using

01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:32.670
is a radio-labeled
A triphosphate.

01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:34.930
So this is the triphosphate.

01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:36.790
This is the diphosphate,
meaning it's

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:38.230
lost one of its phosphates.

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.830
This is the monophosphate,
meaning it's lost two of them.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:45.020
And the product of removing
all three phosphates

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.070
of the free nucleoside,
you just can't see,

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.940
because the radio label's gone.

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.680
But what we were
extremely excited to see

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.610
was that it also
imported in the cytoplasm

01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:55.460
the triphosphates
of our analogs.

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.541
And they decompose,
just like the ATP does.

01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:00.290
There's the triphosphate,
there's the di-,

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.040
there's the mono-.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.830
Now we can see the
free nucleosides,

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.970
because these are HPLC assays,
and we're not relying on radio

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:06.764
labelling.

01:20:06.764 --> 01:20:09.180
So you can say, OK, there's a
lot of decomposition, there.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:09.920
And there is.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.350
And we're working
on solving that.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.480
We're tracking down what the
offending phosphatases are,

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.770
and we think we've
finally found it.

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.800
And we'll delete them.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.977
But what we noticed, about
a year ago or so-- a year

01:20:19.977 --> 01:20:21.560
and a half ago, god
knows-- two years,

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.730
or something-- when we
were doing this work

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.360
was that, even though these
concentrations were less

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:31.770
than these, these were
30 and 50 micromolar.

01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:33.790
That's an order of
magnitude above the km

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:36.830
for the polymerase, suggesting
that these concentrations

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:37.940
should be sufficient.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.900
There should be enough
triphosphate in the cell

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.250
to work.

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:41.666
And these are
steady state levels.

01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:43.660
These are
concentrations that are

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.800
the balance between the
importer pumping them in

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.030
and the phosphatases
chewing them up.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.070
So we construct a
couple plasmid packs.

01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:52.550
It's the accessory
plasmids, where

01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:55.100
we plan on putting all the
accessories that we need

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.630
for a semisynthetic organism.

01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:59.276
Right now, that's
just the transporter.

01:20:59.276 --> 01:21:01.150
And then what we call
"pINF," for information

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:04.620
plasmid.And it's just
pUC-- just pUC19.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.800
The one difference
between pINF and pUC19

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.500
is we replaced an
A-T pair with an X-Y.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.527
Now the X-Y was TPT3 dNAM.

01:21:13.527 --> 01:21:14.110
Remember this?

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:16.630
This I told you replicated a
little bit better than this.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:19.960
So when we constructed
this plasmid synthetically,

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.390
at our bench, we incorporated
this unnatural base pair.

01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.580
The experiment that
we're going to do

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.956
is with this
unnatural base pair.

01:21:27.956 --> 01:21:29.800
And I'll tell you why
we did that a second.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:37.080
So the experiment is, transform
E. coli with this plasmid

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.500
and induce
transporter production

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.820
so they're competent to
take up the triphosphates.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.140
Then add the triphosphates.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:50.150
So transform and induce the
production of the transporter.

01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:52.790
Then add the requisite
unnatural triphosphates.

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:55.380
And then add the unnatural
plasmid containing

01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.990
the unnatural base pair.

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:59.390
And then recover that
plasmid as a function of time

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:00.650
and characterize it.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:02.470
So there's a couple
control experiments

01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:03.344
that we wanted to do.

01:22:03.344 --> 01:22:05.080
We wanted to transform
with just pUC19,

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.538
so it doesn't have the unnatural
base pair in the template.

01:22:07.538 --> 01:22:09.400
So if we're mis-inserting
the triphosphate,

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.000
somehow, that's a
control against that.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.390
Or don't induce the
transporter, or don't add

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.760
the unnatural triphosphates.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.280
So we recovered the
unnatural plasmid.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.910
We PCR-amplified the region
around the unnatural base pair.

01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:26.480
And when we PCR-amplified it,
we incorporated a biotin tag

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.350
on one of the
unnatural nucleotides.

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.480
And then we looked at a
streptavidin gel shift.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.340
So any place that retained
the unnatural base pair

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.060
would then add this tag to it.

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:39.100
And this tag resulted
in a gel shift.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:42.175
So in the controls where you
don't have the unnatural base

01:22:42.175 --> 01:22:44.272
pair in the template, you
never get a gel shift.

01:22:44.272 --> 01:22:46.480
When you have the unnatural
base pair in the template

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.580
but you don't add the
requisite triphosphates,

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.490
you get no shift.

01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:51.840
When you have the unnatural
base pair in the template,

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.570
and you induce the
triphosphate, but you

01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:56.160
don't provide for their
uptake, you don't get a shift.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.730
Only when you have the unnatural
base pair in the template,

01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:01.150
provide the triphosphates,
and provide for their uptake

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:04.241
do you get the shift.

01:23:04.241 --> 01:23:06.240
The same trick that I
showed you for sequencing,

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.990
earlier, I don't know
if you can see this,

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:11.590
but here's just standard
sequencing chromatograms.

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:13.240
Suffice it to say
they look normal.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.970
And then only in the
experiment will you

01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.470
get the abrupt termination at
the site of the unnatural base

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.600
pair.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.900
So we were pretty excited.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.110
We submitted this as a paper.

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.310
Two of the three
reviewers agreed with us.

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:27.060
One of the reviewers
didn't like two things.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.980
The reviewer didn't
like this step,

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.610
and the reviewer
didn't like this step.

01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:33.500
He didn't like the fact that
we were manipulating the DNA

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.030
after we got it out of a cell.

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:37.400
So we collaborated
with NEB, which

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.850
was a great collaboration.

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:42.110
They have this
beautiful assay where

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:44.577
they take an entire plasmid.

01:23:44.577 --> 01:23:46.660
So we'd just recover the
plasmid-- send it to NEB.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:50.670
They chop it up into
nucleosides and then analyze it

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:52.021
by something called "LC-MS/MS."

01:23:52.021 --> 01:23:54.270
It's something that just
separates the nucleotides out

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:56.890
and then uses something called
"mass spectrometry" to identify

01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:57.540
them.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:00.209
Here is the total C
content of the plasmid,

01:24:00.209 --> 01:24:02.500
the total G content of the
plasmid, the total A content

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.330
of the plasmid.

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.237
D doesn't fly well.

01:24:04.237 --> 01:24:05.820
It doesn't behave
well in their assay.

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.736
And so it was expected
to have a small signal.

01:24:07.736 --> 01:24:09.390
But way out here,
right where we knew

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:12.300
it would come, based on
its LC properties, is 5,6.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:15.340
And it's present
at one per genome.

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.430
Now remember, the synthetic
plasmid that we made

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:20.960
was with this.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.570
Was with TPT3.

01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:26.130
The only spot that
5,6 was provided

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:29.840
was as a triphosphate
to the media.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.905
There was no detection of TPT3.

01:24:31.905 --> 01:24:32.990
It was only 5,6.

01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:34.510
So this is ambiguous
demonstration

01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:37.110
of replication of the unnatural
base pair inside the cell.

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:40.990
Here is E. coli.

01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:43.230
Every organism since
the last common ancestor

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:47.240
of all life on earth has had
two base pairs and four letters.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.180
These growing cells
have six and three.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.990
Very briefly, in the
remaining eight seconds--

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:56.745
negative 8 seconds-- we're
continuing to look at analogs.

01:24:56.745 --> 01:24:58.870
We have a whole family of
replicable unnatural base

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:59.370
pairs.

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:05.340
Before, we had this transporter
encoded on a plasmid.

01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:07.770
We've now integrated
it into the chromosome.

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:10.570
And, because found
out that it induced

01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:13.914
a little bit of toxicity
when we induced it,

01:25:13.914 --> 01:25:16.080
and that's why we had to
put on a high copy plasmid,

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.730
so we didn't want any
selection pressure to lose it.

01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:21.050
We found all that toxicity
came from the N terminus.

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:23.040
I mean, this is a
eukaryotic protein,

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.230
so it had signals to guide it
through eukaryotic-specific

01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:32.247
parts of the cell that aren't
doing anything, in E. coli.

01:25:32.247 --> 01:25:34.330
You delete them, and the
cells are no longer sick.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:36.580
You can now put it behind
a constituent of promoter,

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.407
so they're producing the
transporter all the time.

01:25:39.407 --> 01:25:41.990
They're always competent to take
up our natural triphosphates,

01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:45.950
and they grow with
wild type rates.

01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:49.560
So we've continued to move
on to the next step, now.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.120
And we're looking
at transcription.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.939
And this is all
relatively preliminary,

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.730
but let me just finish
by saying we created

01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:56.854
another plasmid or this
time put the unnatural base

01:25:56.854 --> 01:25:59.010
pair in the gene.

01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:02.440
And this time we had to import
the ribo- and the deoxy- ribo

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.300
variants of the unnatural
nucleotides, induce T7 RNA

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:06.880
polymerase.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.066
So I didn't tell you,
but, during all that SAR,

01:26:09.066 --> 01:26:10.440
part of that
optimization effort,

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.000
we also included recognition
by T7 RNA polymerase.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.250
So we wanted to make sure
that we had a base pair that

01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:18.510
was also transcribeable into
RNA so that it would produce

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:19.680
the RNA and then analyze it.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.980
And so we isolated the RNA,
reverse-transcribing the PCR

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:23.480
amplifier.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.646
So let me emphasize what
the unnatural base pair has

01:26:25.646 --> 01:26:27.730
to do to be detected here.

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:29.850
The unnatural triphosphides
have to get in.

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:32.835
It has to be stably
replicated within the plasmid.

01:26:32.835 --> 01:26:37.790
It has to be transcribed by
T7 DNA polymerase into RNA.

01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.080
It then has to survive
notoriously error-prone

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.440
reverse transcription back into
DNA and then PCR amplification.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.940
And there it is.

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:50.150
And we've done it now, in
about three different genes

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:53.080
and a tRNA.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.969
And, with that, it remains
only to thank my group, which

01:26:56.969 --> 01:26:58.260
my current group is right here.

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:02.830
And, of course, the New
England Biolabs group

01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:05.550
for that collaboration
was absolutely essential.

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:07.050
And I mentioned
these collaborations

01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:09.860
for structural work and
these groups for funding.

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.750
So, um, yeah.

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:11.918
Thank you.

01:27:11.918 --> 01:27:14.792
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.550
-Very, very, very cool
science, from all three

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:24.560
of our fabulous speakers.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.550
The hour's late, but I think
we have time for questions,

01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:32.480
if people want to come
forward, up to the microphone,

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.610
and please tell us
who you are, as you

01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:36.250
begin to ask your question.

01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:41.440
Please.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.930
-My name is Marcy Wells.

01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:48.610
And I have a question
about donor eggs.

01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:52.570
As I was watching your
presentations, instead

01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:54.830
of getting donor
eggs, can you just

01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:58.960
repair the mother's
eggs by taking out

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.090
the damaged mitochondria?

01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:06.670
-There is a suggestion that
there might be potentially

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:10.440
a scientific way to do that.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.110
It's theory.

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:12.910
It's not proven.

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:14.974
The problem we have--
in the UK, anyway--

01:28:14.974 --> 01:28:16.640
is that we would not
be allowed to do it

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.610
because that would actually
probably be altering a genome.

01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:22.300
While it might be considered
legal, it's altering a genome.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.390
And we're not
allowed to do that.

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:26.850
We're allowed to replace
the mitochondria.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:28.764
We're not allowed
to alter any genome.

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:33.620
-Sir.

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.540
-Irwin Shapiro,
astrophysicist at Harvard.

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.570
I have a question for Floyd.

01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:42.250
Sort of a generic question.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:45.970
This is very fascinating
work, making more pairs

01:28:45.970 --> 01:28:47.789
from the conventional two pairs.

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:50.205
-Yeah, everyone always told
me I should grow-- never mind.

01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:51.150
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:51.966
-Sorry?

01:28:51.966 --> 01:28:53.590
-I was going to make
a joke, but then I

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:57.080
pulled appropriately
back at the last second.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:02.650
-Do you have any speculations
as to why nature zeroed

01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:09.030
in on these two pairs-- A-T and
C-G-- as opposed to, say, three

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:12.570
pairs or two other
pairs or whatever?

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:14.060
-So I think it's
really difficult

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.620
to ask those kind of
evolutionary questions.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.310
I think they're fascinating, but
they're difficult to disprove.

01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:23.820
So it's tough science.

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.390
Let me mention a couple things.

01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:26.010
-Speculations.

01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:27.005
-Speculations-- sure.

01:29:27.005 --> 01:29:28.130
And I'm happy to speculate.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.150
But let me mention something
bout our unnatural base pair.

01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:33.990
We need the natural
environment provided by C-G

01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:36.390
and A-T. We could
never make long

01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:40.754
stretches-- we could replicate
long stretches of just X and Y.

01:29:40.754 --> 01:29:41.920
Of course, we don't need to.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.200
All we want to do
is evolve proteins

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.790
with multiple
unnatural amino acids,

01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:47.380
and you would never
need stretches.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:52.460
I mean, if you only could
incorporate one base pair,

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:56.527
there's more codons
than we could ever use.

01:29:56.527 --> 01:29:59.110
I think that, you know, that's
a question that a lot of people

01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.900
have asked.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.700
Watson very famously called
it a "frozen accident."

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.520
I tend to sort of think that
that's probably right, in that,

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.040
for whatever reason, it
happened across G-C and A-T--

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.010
probably because they
were available, somehow,

01:30:12.010 --> 01:30:13.843
in whatever the environment
was at the time.

01:30:13.843 --> 01:30:15.690
And they worked good enough.

01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:18.700
So, no more selection pressure.

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:22.550
I think all that my work does
is suggest that maybe they

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:25.646
could've done more if
they had wanted to.

01:30:25.646 --> 01:30:28.860
-[LAUGH]

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.010
-I'll add a question to that.

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:33.960
Given that we can
only sequence DNA

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:38.910
with the way we can
sequence it, how do we know?

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.180
-I actually get that
question sometimes.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.768
-[LAUGH] You just did.

01:30:42.768 --> 01:30:45.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:46.200
-Good question.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.830
I mean, I think
it's very unlikely

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:50.800
that there's anything as
radically different as NAM

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.910
and 5,6.

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:52.795
But-- sure.

01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:53.670
-[INAUDIBLE] we know.

01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:55.530
-Sure.

01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:56.030
-Sir.

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.529
-Hi.

01:30:56.529 --> 01:30:59.300
I'm Ryan Cross, from the Boston
University Science Journalism

01:30:59.300 --> 01:30:59.800
program.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.060
This is a question for Dr. Corn.

01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:07.380
Could you speak a little bit
about the non-GMO gene editing

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.230
trend that's going on
in biotech right now?

01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:13.040
Specifically with
editing plant genomes.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.250
Scientists seem to
have a lot of buzz

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:19.060
about using CRISPR Cas to
navigate around current GMO

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.788
regulations.

01:31:20.788 --> 01:31:21.779
-Oh.

01:31:21.779 --> 01:31:23.320
I mean, I think what
you're referring

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.040
to is the current definition
of GMO is that there's

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.460
a selection marker in there.

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.350
And one of the
possibilities of Cas9

01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:33.120
is that you could do the editing
without introducing a selection

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.990
marker.

01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:36.599
And therefore it would
not be technically GMO.

01:31:36.599 --> 01:31:38.140
Out of the companies
that I've talked

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:39.960
to that are serious
players in this game,

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:45.555
they think a lot about how would
their product be perceived.

01:31:45.555 --> 01:31:47.680
I don't know if they've
fully learned their lesson,

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.104
but they've learned that
people pay attention

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:51.020
to that sort of stuff.

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:54.220
So I have not heard
anyone, so far,

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:56.640
say we want to try
to slide something

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.840
under the radar with this.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.130
And I've even heard at least
one of them say, oh, someone

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.040
was mentioning this fact
to me and I berated them.

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.780
So I think that
they, on that end,

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:12.380
are not thinking about
doing something like that.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:14.490
If they were to try
to-- well, first off,

01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:22.565
I think they're going to
be more slow to adopt this

01:32:22.565 --> 01:32:24.940
in a commercial standpoint,
because they don't want to be

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.066
the ones running out ahead.

01:32:26.066 --> 01:32:26.565
Right?

01:32:26.565 --> 01:32:28.300
They already know
that they're going

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.160
to catch flak for that sort
of thing, deserved or not.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.659
And so they're going to wait,
and they're going to see.

01:32:33.659 --> 01:32:35.200
As to what startups
are going to do--

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.450
you know, biofuel, algae,
things outside of what

01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:41.069
we might eat or
put in our mouths--

01:32:41.069 --> 01:32:42.110
that's a different thing.

01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:45.740
There is one guy who's
doing some interesting stuff

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.230
with livestock.

01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:48.899
This is not with Cas9.

01:32:48.899 --> 01:32:49.940
This is Scott Fahrenkrug.

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.900
He has a company called,
I think, Recombinetics.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.890
And it turns out that this is--

01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:59.740
For him, it's more
of a humane thing.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.780
So it turns out that,
in the US, dairy cattle

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.200
are born with horns.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.130
And they have to be removed.

01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:08.381
And you can imagine that's
not a very nice process

01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:09.005
for the animal.

01:33:09.005 --> 01:33:11.850
So all dairy cattle in the
US have this done to them.

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:14.190
Whether you knew that or
not, it's really nasty,

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:15.250
and it's really terrible.

01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:17.180
And the videos that he
shows are really bad.

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.970
But it turns out there's a
natural allele called "polled"

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.150
that is naturally in
the cow population.

01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:23.900
And cows are just
not born with those.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.535
Well, the gestation time
with cows is very, very long.

01:33:26.535 --> 01:33:29.160
So if you try to introduce this
in all the various cow species,

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.310
it would take forever.

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:32.930
And so he's been able to
edit the naturally occurring

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:35.654
polled mutation into a
variety of founder cows.

01:33:35.654 --> 01:33:38.070
And they're normal cows; they're
just not born with horns.

01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:39.810
You don't have to
cut them off anymore.

01:33:39.810 --> 01:33:42.350
And so the goal with
his company is more

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:46.102
to not change the way we're
eating anything but to take

01:33:46.102 --> 01:33:47.810
a naturally observed
mutation and make it

01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:50.901
so we don't have to do
these inhumane things.

01:33:50.901 --> 01:33:51.883
-Thank you.

01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:53.356
-OK.

01:33:53.356 --> 01:33:54.070
-Hi.

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:55.070
I'm Jennifer Hochschild.

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:57.195
I'm a faculty member with
the Government department

01:33:57.195 --> 01:33:57.880
at Harvard.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.480
So I have a sort
of a meta meta meta

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.435
question, which is probably
too late in the afternoon.

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:03.700
And I don't know how anybody
could answer it, anyway.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:07.060
But what I'm struck
with is the contrast

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:09.590
between the previous
lecture by Dr. Kaplan

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:14.245
and the kind of enthusiasm,
excitement, recognition

01:34:14.245 --> 01:34:16.770
that there are deep moral,
ethical, political issues.

01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:19.380
I mean, you guys are all very
sophisticated about this.

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:22.770
But his fundamental
concern is, how are we

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:28.400
going to avoid seriously
harming people or society

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.300
through these new techniques?

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.030
Your positions,
collectively, are, look

01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:36.090
at all a fascinating, wonderful,
terrifically exciting things

01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:38.340
we can do to benefit
society through all

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.316
these new techniques.

01:34:40.316 --> 01:34:41.940
Those aren't necessarily
contradictory,

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:44.370
but they always tend in
different directions.

01:34:44.370 --> 01:34:45.620
How does one think about that?

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.245
I mean, my instinct
is to say that this

01:34:47.245 --> 01:34:49.190
is sort of characterological.

01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:50.620
That some people
are more focused

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.100
on avoiding harm and some
people are more focused

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.980
on producing gains.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.660
But that's probably too simple.

01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.440
So is there any way to get
into that very big question

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.810
of how do we frame these issues?

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:07.720
-How about quick answers,
right down the row?

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.458
-I'll leave it to them.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:13.665
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:13.665 --> 01:35:14.165
-Yeah.

01:35:14.165 --> 01:35:15.660
It's a big issue,
and it's an issue

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.934
that I've faced throughout
my clinical practice.

01:35:17.934 --> 01:35:19.850
Because when you're
working as a gynecologist,

01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:23.219
you're working with all
these issues all the time.

01:35:23.219 --> 01:35:24.760
I would probably
only say two things.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.660
The first thing
is that you can't

01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.868
stop the progress of science.

01:35:26.868 --> 01:35:28.560
You can't stop people thinking.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.314
And if you make legislation
in one country that

01:35:31.314 --> 01:35:32.730
stops something
being done, you'll

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:33.854
go through another country.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:35.720
That's the way it will happen.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.550
And that's human nature.

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:40.229
The way we've done
it clinically--

01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:42.520
and I think there's a difference
between what you do it

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.320
in the laboratory, in terms
of scientific understanding,

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.400
and then introducing
it in the medical field

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.795
into clinical practice in a
way that might-- hopefully help

01:35:50.795 --> 01:35:53.900
but theoretically
might harm people--

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.850
is how you get
that balance right.

01:35:57.850 --> 01:35:59.990
I've always done things--
one, there's two things.

01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:01.690
Firstly, there's
a clinical need.

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:03.560
So I've got patients
coming to me saying,

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.400
there's a problem here we want
you to try and solve for us.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.890
And I have to listen to them,
because I'm a clinician.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:13.740
And then the other way is
to go about it in a way that

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.150
takes the public along with it.

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:16.410
And it's explaining to people.

01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:18.440
If you explain to them
what it is you're doing

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.150
and why you're doing it, and
you do all the tests you can,

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:24.070
they then start to see you're
not some sort of Frankenstein

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.160
monsters.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.610
But people are just generally
trying to help people.

01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:32.150
And we've got a responsibility--
we've got an obligation

01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:36.687
to be responsible about it
and not to sit in ivory towers

01:36:36.687 --> 01:36:38.520
and play around with
things, but to actually

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.480
just be open and explain
what we're doing.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.480
And in the sort of
stuff that I've been,

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.310
there's always
been a good cause.

01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:49.340
-I think from the standpoint
of genome editing, as least,

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.480
what I would stress is
these things are just tools.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.900
You can use a hammer
to hit someone with,

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.310
but you can also build a house.

01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:59.900
It doesn't mean the hammer is
bad; it's what we do with it.

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.770
And we have a choice
of what we do it.

01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:05.860
So I think that, you
know, you could say, well,

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.110
let's not use hammers anymore.

01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:08.160
Well, you've still
got to build houses.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.950
Now you're building
houses with rocks.

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:12.800
You're smashing nails
in-- stuff like that.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.610
So I think there's
been a lot of buzz

01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:17.617
around Cas9 and
germ-line editing,

01:37:17.617 --> 01:37:18.575
and that sort of thing.

01:37:18.575 --> 01:37:20.730
And it's really more about,
what do you do with it?

01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:20.950
Right?

01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:22.857
It's about the biologies
that you can learn.

01:37:22.857 --> 01:37:24.440
Maybe that just makes
me an optimist--

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.314
that I think that there's
a lot we can learn,

01:37:26.314 --> 01:37:28.340
and there's a lot of
people that we can help.

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.400
But it's not that the tool
has any inherent good.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.530
The good is in how you use it.

01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:37.810
-I would also add that all of
the work you've heard today

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:42.600
is not done without considerable
oversight-- oversight

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.060
from funding agencies,
oversight from the institutions

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.850
that employ the
scientists, oversights

01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:51.600
from the national
institutes of health

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.930
and other federal
regulatory elements.

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:58.350
And I think that the
protections are there.

01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:59.980
They're not foolproof.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:04.520
And that's why getting
you, the population, who

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.070
will potentially benefit
from this research,

01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:11.100
and hopefully not
harm, to understand

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.850
the opportunity, the challenges,
and the ethics involved.

01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:16.350
You all need to be engaged.

01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:18.480
You've been fabulously
engage today.

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:22.100
And at this point I'm going to
let Janet Rich-Edwards close us

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.541
out today, because the hour's
late, and it's time for beer.

01:38:25.541 --> 01:38:26.965
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:26.965 --> 01:38:27.465
[APPLAUSE]

01:38:27.465 --> 01:38:30.360
-Well said!

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.810
I do want to thank
all our speakers--

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:35.910
this wonderful panel-- this
morning's panels and speakers--

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:36.680
thank all of you.

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.816
Thank our online audience.

01:38:38.816 --> 01:38:40.690
I've just been given
the list of where people

01:38:40.690 --> 01:38:41.940
have been logging in from.

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:44.660
It is all over the US,
all over the world.

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:47.690
Peru, Finland,
Kyrgyzstan, India.

01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:52.180
I think every continent is
represented except Australia.

01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.890
I've got to wonder
what's up with them.

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.810
So it's my charge to just
summarize, really quickly.

01:38:56.810 --> 01:39:00.050
I've got to say, I
learned a lot today.

01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:01.770
I think we learned a
lot about discovery.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:04.480
You can feel the palpable
excitement, here.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.200
We learned a lot, this
morning, about our history.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.840
I learned that our
history as humans

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.810
is more of a braided stream
than the old hard tree

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.300
that I'd imagined.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.150
I learned that we are,
today, more genetically

01:39:17.150 --> 01:39:20.520
similar amongst ourselves
than even our ancestors were.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.192
We have talked about
fantastic advances in biology.

01:39:24.192 --> 01:39:25.900
There's all sorts of
stuff we didn't even

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:30.430
talk about, like the fact
that all women are mosaics.

01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:32.270
We all have one of
our Xs turned off.

01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:35.987
Or that we're actually,
humans, chimeras.

01:39:35.987 --> 01:39:38.320
If you're a mother, you carry
the cells of your children

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.153
in your bloodstream.

01:39:40.985 --> 01:39:42.360
If you're a twin,
you're carrying

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.620
some your twin's cells.

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.090
So there's actually things as
strange in our current biology

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:50.900
that we're still learning about
through some of these new tools

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.590
and some of these
fantastical future visions.

01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:56.900
We've learned about
prevention-- how

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.020
we can prevent diseases,
such as the mitochondrial DNA

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.380
techniques we've heard about.

01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:04.230
We've learned about
protection of innocent people,

01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:07.690
of endangered species, even
of languages and cultures

01:40:07.690 --> 01:40:09.100
we talked about this morning.

01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.720
We've talked about new
therapies on the horizon.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.520
The hematopoietic diseases,
those blood diseases,

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.890
HIV-- can you
imagine curing HIV?

01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:18.570
--for ourselves.

01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:21.760
And we've even talked about
it a bit for other species.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.720
What could, for
example, mammoth DNA

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.760
do to help the Asian elephant?

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.620
We have a fantastic,
brand-new toolbox.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:34.360
We've talked about it as swords,
scalpels, knives, scissors.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.190
We are like three-year-olds,
running around

01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:37.440
with these tools in our hands.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.220
And I think there's
a lot of work

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:43.730
to do-- all of us, not
just the scientists,

01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:45.800
not just the
regulators-- all of us,

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.190
to consider where we
want to take this.

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:50.650
I think one of the most
exciting things today

01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:53.427
is this talk of the
power of citizen science.

01:40:53.427 --> 01:40:55.510
We've talked about the
democratization of science,

01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:57.530
the fact that the barriers
for doing this stuff

01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:59.970
are coming way down.

01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:02.550
We didn't talk so
much about the dream

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:05.344
or the spectre of garage labs.

01:41:05.344 --> 01:41:06.760
It's now getting
easier and easier

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.150
to do this outside
of the institutions

01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:12.940
that we're used to
regulating things for us.

01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.450
We've talked about
needing to anticipate

01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:18.200
the ethical and legal
issues, the importance

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.220
of public perception, and
the importance of using

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:26.050
careful, precise language as
we describe what we're doing.

01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:28.410
Last, it occurred
to me today that we

01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:33.550
are the first species that
can edit its own evolution.

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.350
This stuff is
incredibly profound.

01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:38.350
It could take us anywhere.

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:40.350
And it's up to us to guide it.

01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:43.510
I just, uh-- what did we say?

01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:46.150
We can't stop progress, and
we can't stop people thinking.

01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:47.027
That's true.

01:41:47.027 --> 01:41:49.360
But I would just say let's
be sure that our intelligence

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360
doesn't outrun our wisdom.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.480
Thank you all very much
for a terrific day,

01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.300
and we'll see you soon.

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.050
[APPLAUSE]
