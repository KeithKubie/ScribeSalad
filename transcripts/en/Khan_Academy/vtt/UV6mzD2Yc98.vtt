00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:02.266
- Every spring in rurr--

00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.993
Every spring in rurr--

00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:04.712
(laughs)

00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:05.786
It's hard to say!

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:08.743
Every spring in rural Vermont

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:10.358
the sound of sap

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.878
dripping into galvanized metal buckets

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:17.492
signal the beginning of
the traditional season

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:19.258
for gathering maple syrup.

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:21.130
Or maybe we have no error.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.443
So, what's the real subject here?

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:24.691
Every spring in rurr--

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.373
(laughs)

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:26.609
I can't say that!

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.789
Every spring in rural Vermont

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.230
the sound of sap dripping

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.149
into galvanized metal buckets.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.316
So this is the subject here,

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:37.604
"the sound of sap dripping

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.345
"into galvanized metal buckets."

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.949
Now, is that singular or plural?

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.628
We're talking about the sound,

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.265
we're talking about a
sound, the sound here,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:45.793
we're not talking about the sounds!

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:47.014
So this right over here,

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:48.177
this right over here,

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:51.113
is a singular subject.

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:52.886
Now, what do they do with the verb?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.978
Well the verb right over here,

00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:56.565
they have the plural form
of the verb "signal."

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:57.920
If we had the sounds,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.889
we could say, "the sounds signal

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.412
"the beginning of the traditional season,"

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:02.713
but we have only,

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:03.897
we only have one sound,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.177
we have the sound.

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:06.051
The sound, we need--

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:07.082
it's a singular subject,

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.465
we need a singular verb.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.381
So we need "signals" right over here,

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.703
so the error is in Part C.
