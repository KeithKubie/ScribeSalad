We're out here by the Computer History Museum

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.340
in Mountain View, California. The Google headquarters is

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.700
just around the corner. But before we start

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.830
to build our applications on the Google cloud platform,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.030
let's look at the history of building server

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.740
side applications. Fifty years ago this is where

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.140
most server-side applications were born. On a physical

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.530
computer sitting under the desk in some office. Yeah,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.080
seriously. A physical computer, you know, one that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.230
you can touch and smell. And the generated

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590
heat from the fan outlet, so you could

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.830
warm your feet, if the office was cold. Well,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.310
it didn't take long until the server-side applications

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.640
grew bigger. And it was no longer possible

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080
to run them on a computer like this.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.690
So the pizza box computer was created because it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.650
looked like a pizza box. And these were great

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.140
because you could stack them on top of each other

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.130
and on top of each other and on top of each other. And voila! The

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.630
computer rack had just been born. And the entire shebang was put in a dedicated

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.100
room called the data center, because all the fans made too much noise and stuff.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890
But it was no longer possible to warm

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.920
your feet against the fan outlet of course.
