00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.925
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We cannot write the equation of a vertical line in point slope form. Here,

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:07.573
the slope is going to be an issue again. We still can't plug in a single

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:11.754
numerical value for the slope in this form of the equation, so we can't use it.

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:16.170
But yes, we can write the equation for a vertical line in general form. This is

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.733
one of the major powerful aspects of the general form of linear equations.

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.834
Looking back at general form, or the general form of the general form, all we

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:28.928
would need to do would be to set B equal to 0. That would make this entire term

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.904
with a y in it equal to 0. And we would just have Ax equal C, which very easily

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:36.969
could be become an equation for a vertical line like many we've seen before.
