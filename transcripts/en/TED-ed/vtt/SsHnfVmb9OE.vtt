00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:15.752
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:17.530
Venom,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.042
the poisonous fluid secreted by animals,

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:22.017
like snakes and scorpions,

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:27.114
typically transmitted by bite or sting.

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.222
As vile as the word is now,

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:30.726
the history of venom begins

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:34.370
with the pleasant Indo-European root wen,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.384
which meant to desire or strive for.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.758
Perhaps, not surprisingly, wen also generated

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.399
a number of amiable modern words,

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.655
like win

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.095
or wish.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:51.210
Wenes, a form of the original root,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.128
was tailored to the mythology of the time,

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:57.861
and applied to the Roman goddess of love, Venus,

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.830
known to the Greeks as Aphrodite

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.013
and to the Egyptians as Hathor.

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.515
From this milieu of amore,

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:08.767
the word wenesom emerged,

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.521
meaning love potion.

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.622
Over time, wenesom became venenum,

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:19.041
a word that specifically described potions or medicines

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:23.437
that evoked intense physical reactions from the patient.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.361
The definition of venenum

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.304
eventually narrowed to refer solely

00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:29.930
to poisonous concoctions,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.977
a shift that puts us within striking distance

00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:35.816
of the word under investigation.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.087
A bit of shortening

00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:39.048
and a slight distinction in source

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:41.120
brings us to venom,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.557
a deadly fluid that comes from a snake

00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:46.523
rather than a pharmacist.
