00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.730
I think you're probably
reasonably familiar with the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.790
idea of a square root, but I
want to clarify some of the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.250
notation that at least, I always
found a little bit

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.000
ambiguous at first. I
want to make it very

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.100
clear in your head.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.680
If I write a 9 under a radical
sign, I think you know you'll

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.940
read this as the square
root of 9.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.880
But I want to make one
clarification.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.990
When you just see a number
under a radical sign like

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:38.650
this, this means the principal
square root of 9.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.420
And when I say the principal
square root, I'm really saying

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.300
the positive square root of 9.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.770
So this statement right
here is equal to 3.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.350
And I'm being clear here because
you might already know

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
that 9 has two actual
square roots.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.000
By definition, a square root is
something-- A square root

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.190
of 9 is a number that, if
you square it, equals 9.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.830
3 is a square root, but
so is negative 3.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.260
Negative 3 is also
a square root.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.310
But if you just write a radical
sign, you're actually

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.990
referring to the positive square
root, or the principal

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.650
square root.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.710
If you want to refer to the
negative square root, you'd

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520
actually put a negative in front
of the radical sign.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.170
That is equal to negative 3.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.970
Or if you wanted to refer to
both the positive and the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.520
negative, both the principal and
the negative square roots,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
you'll write a plus or
a minus sign in front

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.220
of the radical sign.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.650
And of course, that's equal to
plus or minus 3 right there.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.450
So with that out of the way,
what I want to talk about is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.280
the graph of the function, y
is equal to the principal

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520
square root of x.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.765
And see how it relates to the
function y is equal to x-- Let

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:04.740
me write it over here because
I'll work on it.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.960
See how it relates to y
is equal to x squared.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.090
And then, if we have some time,
we'll shift them around

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.940
a little bit and get a better
understanding of what causes

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.400
these functions to shift up
down or left and right.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.590
So let's make a little value
table before we get out our

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.490
graphing calculator.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.180
So this is for y is equal
to x squared.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.720
So we have x and y values.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.870
This is y is equal to the
square root of x.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.780
Once again, we have x and
y values right there.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.790
So let me just pick some
arbitrary x values right here,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.380
and I'll stay in the
positive x domain.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.300
So let's say x is equal
to 0, 1-- Let me

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.900
make it color coded.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.590
When x is equal to 0, what's
y going to be equal to?

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.090
Well y is x squared.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.250
0 squared is 0.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.750
When x is 1, y is 1 squared,
which is 1.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.710
When x is 2, y is 2 squared,
which is 4.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.510
When x is 3, y is 3 squared,
which is 9.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.240
We've seen this before.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.100
And I could keep going.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.340
Let me add 4 here.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
So when x is 4, y is
4 squared, or 16.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.430
We've seen all of this.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.000
We've graphed our parabolas.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.680
This is all a bit of review.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.800
Now let's see what happens
when y is equal to the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.300
principal square root of x.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.650
Let's see what happens.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.360
And I'm going to pick some x
values on purpose just to make

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200
it interesting.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.790
When x is equal to 0, what's
y going to be equal to?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.220
The principal square
root of 0?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.550
Well it's 0.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.410
0 squared is 0.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.280
When x is equal to 1, the
principal square root of x of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.110
1 is just positive 1.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.050
It has another square root
that's negative 1, but we

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.000
don't have a positive or
negative written here.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We just have the principal
square root.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.500
When x is a 4, what is y?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.340
Well, the principal square
root of 4 is positive 2.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.430
When x is equal to
9, what's y?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.630
When x is equal to 9,
the principal square

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.980
root of 9 is 3.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.950
Finally, when x is equal to 16,
the principal square root

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.960
of 16 is 4.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720
So I think you already see how
these two are related.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.920
We've essentially just swapped
the x's and the y's.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.250
Well, these are the same x and
y's, but here you have

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.510
x is 2, y is 4.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.020
Here x is 4, y is 2.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.480
3 comma 9, 9 comma 3.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.730
4 comma 16, 16 comma 4.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.960
And that makes complete sense.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.430
If you were to square both sides
of this equation, you

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.150
would get y squared is equal
to x right there.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.530
And, of course, you would want
to restrict the domain of y to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.480
positive y's because this can
only take on positive values

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.020
because this is a principal
square root.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.090
But the general idea, we just
swapped the x's and y's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.580
between this function and this
function right here, if you

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.620
assume a domain of positive
x's and positive y's.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.550
Now, let's see what the
graphs look like.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.730
And I think you might already
have a guess of-- Let me just

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.960
graph them here.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.450
Let me do them by hand because
I think that's instructive

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.160
sometimes before you take out
the graphing calculator.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.180
So I'm just going to stay in
the positive, in the first

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.260
quadrant here.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.800
So let me graph this first.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.740
So we have the point 0, 0, the
point 1 comma 1, the point 2

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.550
comma 2, which I'm going to have
to draw it a little bit

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.590
smaller than that.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.280
Let me mark this is 1, 2, 3.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.870
Actually, let me do
it like this.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.890
Let me go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.010
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.070
That's about how far
I have to go.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:02.340
And then I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.610
14, 15, 16.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.000
That's about how far I have to
go in that direction as well.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.060
And now let's graph it.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.580
So we have 0, 0, 1, 1,
2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.590
2 comma 4 right there.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.720
3 comma 9.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.410
3 comma 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.060
3 comma 9 is right
about there.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.450
And then we have 4 comma 16.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.660
4 comma 16 is going to
be right above there.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.770
So the graph of y is equal
to x squared, and

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.200
we've seen this before.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.180
It's going to look something
like this.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.740
We're just graphing it in the
positive quadrant, so we get

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.010
this upward opening
u just like that.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.870
Now let's graph y is equal
to the principal

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.210
square root of x.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.750
So here, once again,
we have 0, 0.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.490
We have 1 comma 1.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.900
We have 4 comma 2.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.580
1, 2, 3, 4 comma 2.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.140
We have 9 comma 3.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.750
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 comma 3
right about there.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.690
Then we have 16 comma 4.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.390
16 comma 4 is right
about there.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.620
So this graph looks like that.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.480
So notice, they look like
they're kind of

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.230
flipped around the axes.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.370
This one opens along the y-axis,
this one opens along

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.230
the x-axis.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.110
And once again, it makes
complete sense because we've

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.680
swapped the x's and the y's.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.090
Especially if you just consider
the first quadrant.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.460
And actually, these are
symmetric around the line, y

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.523
is equal to x.

00:07:39.523 --> 00:07:42.350
And we'll talk about things like
inverses in the future

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.850
that are symmetric around the
line, y is equal to x.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.580
And we can graph this better
on a regular graphing

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.720
calculator.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.960
I found this on the web.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.425
I just did a quick web search.

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.800
I want to give proper credit
to the people whose

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.360
resource I'm using.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.370
So this is my.hrw.com/math06.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.350
You could pause this video.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.580
And hopefully, you should
be able read this.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.490
Especially if you're looking
at it in HD.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.850
But let's graph these
different things.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.270
Let's graph it a little
bit cleaner than

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.600
what I can do by hand.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.030
And actually, let me have some
of what I wrote there.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.360
So that

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.590
should give you-- OK.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:24.390
So let's first just graph
y is equal to x squared.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.770
And then in green, let me
graph y is equal to the

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.720
square root of x.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.070
They have some buttons here on
the right, just so you know

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.650
what I'm doing.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.000
I have some buttons here on
the right: squared and the

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.030
radical sign and all of that.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.110
Let me just focus on this.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.900
So let me just graph those.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.250
So first it did x squared
and then it did the

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.050
square root of x.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.500
Look, if you just focus on the
first quadrant right here, you

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.680
see that you get the exact same
result that I got over

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.120
there, although mine
is messier.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.150
Now, just for fun and, you know,
I really didn't do this

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.590
yet with the regular
quadratics,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.730
let's see what happens.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.770
What we need to do to shift
the different graphs.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.250
So with x squared, I'm going
to do two things.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.990
I'm going to scale the graphs
and I'm going to shift them.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.800
So that's x squared.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.190
So let's just focus on the x
squared and see what happens

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.030
when we scale it.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.610
And then I'll do it with the
radical sign as well.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.930
This will really work
for anything.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.480
Let's see what happens when you
get 2 times-- no, not 2

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.050
squared --2 times x squared.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:36.070
And let's do another one that is
1.5 times our 0.-- I could

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.470
just do 0.4 actually.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.290
0.5 times x squared.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.350
Let's graph these right there.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.190
So x squared.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.290
So notice, our regular x
squared is just in red.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.610
If we scale it by 2, it's still
a parabola with the

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.970
vertex at the same place, but
we go up faster in both

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.790
directions.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.780
And if we have 0.5 times x
squared, we still have a

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.680
parabola, but we go up
a little bit slower.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.230
We have a wider opening u
because our scaling factor is

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.570
lower than 1.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.530
So that's how you kind of decide
how wide or how narrow

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.660
the opening of our
parabola is.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.990
And then if you want to shift
it to the left or the right,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.410
and I want you to think
about why this is.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.030
So that's x squared.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.690
Let's say I want to just take
the graph of x squared and I

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.040
want to shift it four
to the right.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.396
What I do is I say, x minus 4.

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.820
x minus 4 squared.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.640
And if I want to shift it two
to the-- Let's say I want to

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.980
shift it two to the
left. x plus 2

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.350
squared, what do we get?

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.570
Notice it did exactly what I
said. x minus 4 squared was

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.960
shifted four to the right.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.750
x plus 2 squared, was shifted
two to the left.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.740
And it might be unintuitive at
first, this shifting that I'm

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.530
talking about.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.420
But really think about
what's happening.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.320
Over here, the vertex is
where x is equal to 0.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.320
When you get 0 squared
up here.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.810
Now over here, the vertex
is when x is equal to 4.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.430
But when x is equal to 4,
you stick 4 in here,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.260
you get 4 minus 4.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.230
So you're still squaring 0.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.410
4 minus 4 is 0 and that's
what you're squaring.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.050
Over here, when x is equal to
negative 2-- negative 2 plus 2

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.360
--you are squaring 0.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.370
So, in other words, whatever
you're squaring, that 0 is

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.900
equivalent to 4 here.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.660
Or 4 is equivalent to 0.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.790
And negative 2 is equivalent
to 0 over there.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.990
So I want you to think about
it a little bit.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.000
Another way you could think
about it, when x is equal to

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.490
1, we're at this point
of the red parabola.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.070
But when x is equal to 5 on
the green parabola, you

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.010
have 5 minus 4.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.060
Inside of the parentheses you
have a 1, just like x is equal

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.250
to 1 over here, up here.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.550
So you're at the same point
in the parabola.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.910
So I want you to think about
that a little bit.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.840
It might be a little
non-intuitive that you say

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.560
minus 4 to shift to the
right and plus 2 to

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.380
shift to the left.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.650
But it actually makes
a lot of sense.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.820
Now, the other interesting
thing is to shift

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.950
things up and down.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.760
And that's actually pretty
straightforward.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
You want to shift
this curve up.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.400
Let's say we want to shift the
red curve up a little bit.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.930
You do x squared plus 1.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.130
Notice it got shifted up.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.090
If you want this green curve to
be shifted down by 5, put a

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.850
minus 5 right there.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.350
And then you graph it and it
got shifted down by 5.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.620
If you want it to open up a
little wider than that, maybe

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.320
scale it down a little bit.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.110
Scale it down and let's
say 0.5 times that.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.440
So now the green curve will be
scaled down and it opens

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.570
slower, it has a
wider opening.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.510
And the same idea can
be done with the

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.020
principal square roots.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.510
So let me do that.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.180
Let me do the same idea.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.340
And the same idea actually, can
be done with any function.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.260
So let's do the square
root of x.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.570
And in green, let's do
the square root of x.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.140
Let's say, minus 5.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.540
So we're shifting it over
to the right by 5.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.355
And then let's have the square
root of x plus 4.

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:07.650
So we're going to shift
it to the left by 4.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.860
Let's shift it down by 3.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.060
And so lets graph
all of these.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.110
The square root of x.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.730
Then have the square
root of x minus 5.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.470
Notice it's the exact same thing
as the square root of x,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.760
but I shifted it to
the right by 5.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.730
When x is equal to 5, I have
a 0 under the radical sign.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.400
Same thing as square
root of 0.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.070
So this point is equivalent
to that point.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.030
Now, when I have the square root
of x plus 4, I've shifted

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.630
it over to the left by 4.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.000
When x is negative 4, I have
a 0 under the radical sign.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.030
So this point is equivalent
to that point.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.140
And then I subtracted 3, which
also shifted it down 3.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.810
So this is my starting point.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:51.660
If I want this blue square root
to open up slower, so

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.070
it'll be a little
bit narrower, I

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.740
would scale it down.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.900
So here, putting a low number
will scale it down and make it

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.770
more narrow because we're
opening along the x-axis.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.430
So let me to do that.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.250
Let me make this green one--
Let me open up wider.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.460
So let me say it's 3 times the
square root of x minus 5.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.780
So let's graph all of these.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.660
So notice, this blue one now
opens up more narrow and this

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.640
green one now opens up
a lot, I guess you

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.470
could say, a lot faster.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.480
It's scaled up.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.410
Then we could shift that one
up a little bit by 4.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.000
And then we graph it
and there you go.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.240
And notice when we graph these,
it's not a sideways

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.120
parabola because we're
talking about the

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.540
principal square root.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.450
And if you did the plus or minus
square root, it actually

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.020
wouldn't even be a valid
function because you would

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.720
have two y values for
every x value.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.780
So that's why we have to just
use the principal square root.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.940
Anyway, hopefully you found
this little talk, I guess,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.900
about the relationships with
parabolas, and/or with the x

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.550
squared's and the principal
square roots, useful.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.340
And how to shift them.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.210
And that will actually be really
useful in the future

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.840
when we talk about inverses
and shifting functions.
