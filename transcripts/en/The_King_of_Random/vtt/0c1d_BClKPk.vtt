00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.449
new week and this time I'm taking off to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.240
Palm Springs California. See you babe!

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.700
Bye sweetie. Be  back in a week. I'm in Palm Springs

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.559
California today got in late last night

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.840
for an event called clamor con not

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.099
really sure exactly what it is I just

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.719
know there's gonna be about 300 creators

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.520
here and I got in late last night it was

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.410
too dark to see anything so we're going

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.520
to go for a walk and see what there is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.760
to see

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620
there's some kind of fruit in this tree

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:56.469
grapefruit tree

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.930
so clamor con what exactly is clamor

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.430
con I actually have no idea I'm here to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.629
find out apparently there's going to be

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.399
over 300 different YouTube creators that

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.720
come hang out so I'm looking forward to

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.280
meeting all them and just stop for a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.930
second here because I have the new

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.210
Galaxy S8 plus that I've been meaning

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.350
to unbox this has been sitting in my

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.149
house for about two weeks

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.790
and I just haven't had a chance to open it up

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.869
looks like a good place for an unboxing

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.539
beautiful. This right here is my S7 this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:23.470
is what I've been using for about the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.360
last year and if we compare that to the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.509
S8 you can see the S8s a little bit

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:28.960
taller

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.780
it's got maybe a half inch on the top

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.340
there a little bit longer so I bought a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.440
new case I like these cases because they

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.880
got a little kickstand in the back and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810

just on the same game screen oh no way

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.160

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.110
gameplay man my mind is blown for real it's

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.430

right into the world so my adrenaline is

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.580
pumping so hard right now and I didn't

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.660
even realize that we just killed four

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.610
hours so I'm taking a little breather

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.470

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.779
it's almost 10:30 I'm kind of starving

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:00.410
but check this out. I tagged my badge

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.400
that makes me unique.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.850
I hear little kisses coming through your eyeball that's

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.240
a little creepy

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.970
apparently there's a water balloon fight

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.100
so we're taking the golf cart.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.980
Okay so update guys we managed to stay

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.930
dry we skip the wait for the party got

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.520
this guy over here from Seattle he has a

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.830
channel called punish approxiately

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.330
so we're going to hang out and we're

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.040
going to talk EVA foam and 3d

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.170
printing day 3 is just about over we're

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.550
heading out with this group of fine

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.230
people we're going to go do something

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.060
healthy escape room which I've never

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.770
done before it based on the movie

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.380
The Saw so I'm slightly terrified yeah I

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.270
don't want to work well under pressure I

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.980
think I think we're doomed really

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.600
I've been told I look like Every Ure from us again

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.870
Wait what a saw room? Nobody told me about a saw! I think this is going

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.100
to take a little bit of teamwork I have

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.360
no idea what to expect but it's going to be

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.670
epic I think. Here's a shot of Bill's face

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.350
the big thing is here is it says a real life

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.780
escape game oh my gosh you're right it

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.730
says real life what if we don't come out that's

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.200
what I'm terrified about you know I'm gonna

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.030
be like I'm a good man

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.140
it's all about me yeah

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.590
oh yeah okay all right here we go

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.189
breaking the rules already

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:55.559
