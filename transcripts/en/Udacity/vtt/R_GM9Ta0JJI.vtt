00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Earlier in the unit, we talked about how much work this man does

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when he carries the bucket of full of water up this ladder.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we calculated that it was 350 J.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, it's tempting to say we're done here and we've studied all the work going on

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but there's another fore-set play--let's look at the diagram.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's not just the man pulling on the bucket, he's pulling against gravity.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In this situation of a 5 kg bucket being lifted at 7 m, can you tell me how much work is done by gravity?
