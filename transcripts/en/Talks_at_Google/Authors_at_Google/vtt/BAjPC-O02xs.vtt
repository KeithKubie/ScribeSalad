BEN BOYD: First off, on behalf
of Google and the Google

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.272
Veterans Network, a big
thanks to everyone that came.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:10.980
You know, we're in an
interesting company

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.000
that's full perks.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.110
I will argue that in
my personal experience,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.650
this Authors@ series
ranks towards the top.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.630
You just look at
the flow of just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.600
like pure intellectual
horsepower that kind of flows

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.570
through and shares
their perspective

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.090
on a topic that they're
just wildly experienced in

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.130
and I think it's a
rare opportunity.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.250
And so, as I look at what
we're going to talk about today

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.000
and who we're going
to talk about it with,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.870
this is again, of the
Authors@, this even

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.110
is towards the top
of my personal list,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.930
both in terms of
the person that's

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.660
communicating the
message and the topic

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.400
that we're going to discuss.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.000
A few kind of logistical
things to start.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.680
The first off is my personal
introduction is, I'm Ben Boyd.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.760
I work with the Google
Veterans Network here.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.970
I'm also in a sales role on
the Google For Work team.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.700
And for those in the
room that don't know

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.190
and for those that are
going to be watching later,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.590
a little intro to what the
Google Veterans Network is.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.360
Google is a company that
is interested in bringing

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.050
the whole person to work.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.210
For those that served, a
very big part of who you are

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.510
is that experience.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.360
And today, we are a community
of about 1,000 people

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.315
that's split between direct
veterans and people that

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:31.690
are supporters
and those that are

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.400
just interested kind of the
topics that get surfaced.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340
But at the end of the
day, it's something

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.390
that, for those that are
involved, is a huge value add.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.750
And kind of the reach of Google
as a supporter of the larger

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.590
veteran efforts is
something that I think

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.640
is worth bringing to light here.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.490
Second, in terms of
structure for today,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.470
we're going to have a
bit of a conversation.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.760
I want to start real
quick by giving you

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.560
a bit of an intro on Elliot.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.940
All I can say is that it's
an absolute privilege, right?

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.180
Elliot's going to
speak on topics

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.170
that I think everybody in
the room is interested in.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.750
This is, at a surface
level, it's war.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.650
Beyond that it's passion
and it's betrayal

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.370
it's all of these
sorts of things.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.050
But when you hear
a message, it's

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.640
important to know who's
communicating that message.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.262
And I think when it comes
to Elliot's experience,

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:38.970
it's worth going over
a couple of things.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.590
Five deployments between
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.850
His Iraq deployment was
during the heaviest fighting

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610
that we had in Fallujah.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.740
His Afghanistan deployment was
on the special operation side

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.760
in pursuit of the
most priority targets

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.160
that we had an in that country.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.200
And I think that just presence
there and participation

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.135
in that effort is
worthy of praise, right?

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.260
But in true form, you're
going to see a trend here.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.560
Elliot continues to kind of
go above and beyond this.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.994
Elliot has a Silver Star and
a Bronze Star with a V device.

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:15.660
And so what that means
in civilian speak

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.040
is that not only has he faced
the toughest environments

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.010
and scenarios that you're
going to find overseas,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.690
but he did in a
way that supersedes

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.510
the expectation of how
one would deal with them.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.810
And I think what we can
pull from that is one,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.510
there is deep
expertise when it comes

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.270
to what life on the ground
in countries such as Iraq

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.150
and Afghanistan is.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.450
And two, that like as a country
as a whole, we're in debt

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.100
and there's a deep gratitude
for that sort of background.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.430
As he transitioned
out of that, I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.420
think Elliot's going to
have this brand of just

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.790
a serial contributor, right?

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.780
He holds an advanced
degree from Tufts.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.200
He was selected as a
White House fellow.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.150
He's a member of the Council
on Foreign Relations.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.210
He has committed himself to
writing and his publications

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.989
and his work has
appeared in just, I

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.530
mean you name, the first class
publication, "The New Yorker,"

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.470
"The Atlantic," "The Wall
Street Journal," to name a few,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.780
and he's there.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.807
And so, as we transition
from the intro of the person

00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:21.640
to the intro of the
book and what we're here

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.010
to speak of today, I
think that "Green on Blue"

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.510
is, if you haven't
read it yet, I'll

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.800
encourage you to pick up a
copy as you make your exit.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.000
But the story of young
Afghan orphan who--

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.750
and the circumstances
of the environment

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.770
that he's a part of.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.010
And this is one that is
just, in this case, a war.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.240
As a personal
veteran, I think there

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.116
is-- what I've noticed
as the transition out,

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.656
is that everybody's
interested in it,

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:49.920
but few have an opportunity
to really directly relate.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.610
And so we like,
reach for things that

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.350
might give you an
opportunity to kind of better

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.480
understand what the environment
and the circumstances were.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.063
And I think what we
have here and what

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.940
we'll talk to, touch
on later, and what

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.720
he'll read from in a
moment is just that.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.575
So with that said, I
will get to some talking

00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:08.991
and let's give him a round of
applause and welcome Elliot.

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:13.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.987
So, I told him
earlier, we're going

00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:17.570
to start by keeping
this light, right?

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.720
We're going to start with
a little bit about Elliot

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.886
as a person, a little bit
about Elliot as an author.

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:24.624
And then we'll touch on the
topic in the book today.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.040
And so in true
Google fashion, I'm

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.956
going to put him a little
bit on the spot here

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:31.205
and we're going to play
two truths and a lie.

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.080
So I don't know if you're
familiar with this,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.180
but for those who
aren't, we're going

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.150
to hear three
statements from Elliot,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.030
and I did give him about
30 seconds before we

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.071
started, warning on this.

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.375
So this is pretty fresh, right?

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:41.610
You're going to hear
three statements.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.500
Two of them are
going to be true.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.874
One of them is
going to be a lie.

00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:47.110
And then we're going to
have Ms. Amy Carl guess

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.210
as to which one is the lie.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.910
Is that fair?

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.980
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.440
I'm forgetting my truths
for a moment and my lies.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.970
OK, so three things.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.020
First thing.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.316
My brother is an Olympic
wrestler and a mathematician.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.170
I once ran with
the Bulls in Spain.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.390
And my father used to race
Formula Four race cars.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.530
AMY CARL: I'm going
to pretend like it's

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.640
"Who Wants to be a
Millionaire" and I'm going

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.590
to get the audience to vote.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.690
And then we'll see how
I feel about their vote.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:36.160
OK, so who thinks that
the brother, wrestler,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.390
mathematician is the lie?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.040
OK.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.860
Who thinks the running with
the bulls in Spain is a lie?

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.480
And who thinks the NASCAR
racing-- I'm sorry, whoo,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.770
that was almost offensive.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.720
Formula One.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.470
I'm from Ohio, all right?

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.512
All car racing is NASCAR.

00:07:00.512 --> 00:07:02.220
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Some
of you voted twice.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.511
You think I'm telling two lies?

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.275
BEN BOYD: What
have you got, Amy?

00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:09.350
AMY CARL: I actually
am also going

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.776
to go with the bull
racing as the lie.

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:14.900
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: No, I ran
with the bulls in Spain.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.270
Right when I got back from Iraq.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.440
BEN BOYD: I would have guessed
Formula Four because I don't

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.606
know what a Formula Four is.

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.780
What's the difference
between a One and a Four?

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.154
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: It's One right.

00:07:22.154 --> 00:07:23.320
And that's actually the lie.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.194
My father was obsessed
with race car driving,

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:26.520
but he never actually drove.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.580
So when I was younger, the one
day that we didn't-- the one

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.439
Sunday we never went to church
is when the Indy 500 was on.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.730
BEN BOYD: And on that topic,
I'd love to again, kind of

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.120
understand a little
bit more about you.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.160
So we've talked about father.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.535
We've talked about
the truth that

00:07:41.535 --> 00:07:46.660
is a brother that is an Olympic
wrestler and a mathematician.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.350
Go a little bit more
on your background

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.380
and tell me a little
bit about those.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.536
What makes it unique and what
were those influences on you?

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:57.910
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I come from
a family that's-- I have one

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.295
brother who's two years older.

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:00.920
We were always pretty
tight growing up.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.390
My mother is a novelist.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.609
So I grew up around books.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:05.900
BEN BOYD: So you read a little.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.150
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Studied history
and literature at university.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.940
And yeah, I have this
very eclectic brother

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.625
who is "Good Will Hunting"
smart mathematician.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.000
I mean, who
literally, when I was

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.670
three years old in the back
of the Volvo, picking my nose

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.220
and banging my GI Joes
together, he was five,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.540
saying, Dad, if x equals
3, and y is unknown-- just

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.450
in his blood.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.770
And he was a gifted wrestler
and wrestled in 2004 in Athens.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.100
So that's my family
background at least.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.984
But no military in my family.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:38.900
BEN BOYD: No military.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.700
ELLIOT ACKERMAN:
I'm the only one.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.429
BEN BOYD: I understand there's
a lot overseas time when

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.304
you're young as well.

00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:43.678
ELLIOT ACKERMAN:
Yeah, there was.

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.310
So when I was nine years old--
I was born in Los Angeles

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.890
and lived there
until I was nine.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.320
And then in a dramatic,
climactic switch or climate

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.645
switch, we moved
from Los Angeles.

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:55.270
BEN BOYD: For a
nine-year-old that move

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.810
was climactic as well.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.809
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Yeah,
it was climactic as well.

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:00.994
But I have vivid memories
of, you know, at week number

00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:02.952
two of not seeing the
sun, asking when the hell

00:09:02.952 --> 00:09:04.525
I was going to get
out of this place.

00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:05.900
Then it wound up
being six years.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.430
So I stayed there till I
was 15 and then finished up

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.959
high school in the States.

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.750
BEN BOYD: What does
that do for you, right?

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.890
So what kind of diversity
does that contribute?

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.989
So traditionally, you come
from a fairly-- most of us,

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.280
myself included, come from
more or less a cookie cutter

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.189
kind of American existence.

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:24.730
But then you go to
college and that's

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.240
where you start developing
a little bit more

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.140
deeper personality.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.074
What do you think--

00:09:29.074 --> 00:09:30.740
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I
think some it kind of

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.365
starts to get into the themes of
what drew me into the service.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.584
London is not that
much different.

00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:39.250
If you want to go
like one culture over,

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.916
it's about the closest
you can obviously

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:44.350
get to being an American,
aside from going to Canada.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.480
And that's up for debate.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.550
But I think about a lot it now
because I live in Istanbul.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.620
So I'm raising-- I have
two small children.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.420
We have been raising them is
Istanbul, which is obviously,

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.670
especially with everything
that is going on right now,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.265
a pretty dramatic shift
from life of the East Coast

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.140
where we were before.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.710
But I think as a
young person, living

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.639
in London, what was great was
it allowed me to travel widely

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.430
through Europe, I think,
which just gave me

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:12.850
enough of a slant view on what
it means to be an American,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.980
to kind of start to inspire
a bit of an appreciation.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.060
I think going into college,
I always I felt and was

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.460
and am a fortunate
son of this country.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.590
I came from a good family.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.390
I got to go to Tufts
University, a great school.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.580
And I went and did ROTC in 1998.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.020
And so it was before 9/11.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.739
But I just sort of had this
sense that when I got out,

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:37.780
I wanted a job where
whether I was good at my job

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.690
or bad at my job,
really, really mattered.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.040
And I wanted a lot of
responsibility young.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.540
And I couldn't think of anywhere
else where at 23 years old,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.200
they put me in
charge of 45 people.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.480
That was I got in the Marines as
an infantry platoon commander.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.580
And so that coupled with
just sort of a visceral sense

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.230
of feeling like I should,
and was somewhat almost

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.290
obligated to give something
back, led me into the Marines.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.650
But I had, sitting there
in 1998, joined the ROTC,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.550
I sort of had no idea what
the next decade would hold.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.300
Like you give me a
very nice introduction,

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.133
my mother just says,
this is my son, Elliot.

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:17.174
He's like the Forest Gump
of the last 10 years.

00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:19.840
BEN BOYD: But I think there's an
interesting point there, right?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.490
So 1998 is business as
usual in the service, right?

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.030
And so 2001 strikes.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.970
You graduate college.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.770
I understand you got
your advanced degree

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.070
in a compressed schedule,
so in five years.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.790
So talk to me about what the
world was as you were starting

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.974
your Marine Corps career.

00:11:36.974 --> 00:11:37.890
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.970
I mean I remember viscerally
when 9/11 happened.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.350
And I was about a year out from
potentially graduating college,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.110
although I wound up doing dual
bachelor's, master's degree.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.050
I remember going into my senior
ROTC instructor and saying,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.925
I'm thinking about just
leaving school early,

00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:53.250
kind of very dramatically.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.500
And him saying, sit down,
whippersnapper, this thing's

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.790
going to go on for a long time.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.623
You should probably get
your college degree.

00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:02.790
But those first two years,
there was sort of a slow sea

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.760
change taking place.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.180
And I remember reporting down
to Quantico to the basics school

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.930
where Marine officers
go through training.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.550
And it was June of
2003 and the vibe there

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.780
was very much this sense of like
the Persian Gulf War had just

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.430
happened.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.013
And the captain's who were our
instructors sort of being like,

00:12:21.013 --> 00:12:23.570
oh hey, guys, you all
just missed the war.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.280
We just missed it too.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.670
So sad, too bad.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.140
We got to get down to training.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.750
And I remember over
that summer slowly,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.686
these first lieutenants who were
kind of the junior officers who

00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:37.310
had been in the
invasion, they had just

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.420
started trickling
back because they

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.230
were going to now
become captains

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.880
and instructors themselves.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.310
And then in August, I
remember August of 2003,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.430
there was this headline
in "The Marine Times"

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.324
and it was headlines,
Marines Back To Iraq.

00:12:48.324 --> 00:12:50.740
And when we saw this, everyone,
including the captains was

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.810
like, what are we going
to be doing in Iraq?

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.060
I mean, we're shock troops.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.200
This is occupation duty.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.605
The war is over, into that
winter and then in the spring

00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:01.670
and I was finishing my
infantry officer training

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.840
in the spring when the
contractors were hung

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.820
from the bridge in Fallujah.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.992
And within a week, sort of
all hell was breaking loose.

00:13:09.992 --> 00:13:11.950
An officer from the class
before us was killed.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.170
One of my buddies had to
go as a combat replacement.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.753
And there was this
very quick rotation

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.640
within a couple
months of this idea

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.000
that we were all going to war.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.820
And those of us who
were going weren't

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.320
going for occupation duty.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.380
We were going to fight.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.401
So I definitely do remember
that quick shift, which I think

00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:29.900
was a little bit
unique to that time

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.870
because I think that
in subsequent years,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.110
we really bore down.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.950
Because as we were
talking a little bit,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.010
by 2005, 2006, 2007,
these wars were going

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.760
and everybody knew
they were going to war.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.010
But for us, it was actually
a little bit of a process,

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.390
of a realization, like wow,
I guess we're going to war.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.730
BEN BOYD: Interesting.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.860
Interesting.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.410
You know, I'll ask the
general question, right?

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.369
I want to hear about
Elliot, the Marine, right?

00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:56.410
I want to hear about-- I
mean, we've read the bio

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.930
and we know that these valorous
awards are not something

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.890
that are just given out.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:06.480
Tell us about, at a high level,
those experiences and kind

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.510
of impact that they've had you
in the development as a person.

00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:15.654
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I have a
very good friend of mine

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:18.070
who has sort of always acted
as a Marine Corps big brother

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.570
to me.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.782
And he's been in Special
Operations for a long time.

00:14:20.782 --> 00:14:22.990
And he's got more deployments
to Iraq and Afghanistan

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.660
that I can count on both
of my hands, legitimately.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.300
And he still works
in those realms.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.650
And so one of the ways we
keep up is he's a big runner.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.560
So he doesn't like to sleep.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.280
So he'll be like at
5:00 in the morning,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.377
we'll go for a nice run.

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:36.960
We're buddies.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.330
So I get out of bed.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.185
I remember about probably six
months ago, I was in the States

00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:43.560
and we were meeting
up for a run.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.210
And we were sort of hoofing
our way up this hill.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.430
And just sort of
had been reminiscing

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.150
about the war at a
very macro level,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.229
talking about ideas like PTSD.

00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:52.770
Do I have it?

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.394
Do you have it?

00:14:53.394 --> 00:14:55.000
Who knows?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.680
What is it?

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.570
What did it all mean?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.820
And a certain point, he
looked over at me and he said,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.450
you know, he said,
you know, Elliot,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.630
he's like, the melancholy of it
all is that we grew up there.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.309
And I thought a lot about that.

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:06.600
It's like we did grow up there.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.580
I left for my first combat
deployment when I was 24.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.080
I came back from my
last one when I was 31.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.660
That was sort of the years where
you kind of grow up and become

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.279
like the adult
you're going to be.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.820
So something that's
fascinated me too

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.292
though is, so as much as
you know me and my buddy

00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:23.000
and so many others
have become completely

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.460
defined by these experiences.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.170
When you start
reflecting on it, you

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.559
realize there's a whole
other side of that coin.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.850
And that the whole time you're
having these experience,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.100
you're very much engaged in
this sort of shadow dance

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.510
with your adversary.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.994
And so I mean I
know intellectually,

00:15:37.994 --> 00:15:39.410
and again, it's
something I'm very

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.840
interested in in my writing,
that shadow dance has

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.860
been going on with
Iraqis, with Afghans.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.050
And for every one of
us, there's just as many

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.070
of them who've been
exactly so defined.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.250
And being so defined, in many
respects, I have more in common

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.090
with them than
many of the people

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.910
that I've come home with, to.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.160
And what does that mean?

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.620
So Yates has this great poem,
around the First World War.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.600
It's called "An Irish
Airman Foresees His Death."

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.590
And the poem opens, "I know that
I shall meet my fate somewhere

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.130
amongst the clouds above.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.410
Those that I fight
I do not hate.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.810
Those that I guard
I do not love.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.840
Nor law no duty bade me fight,
nor public men nor cheering

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.030
crowds, but a lonely impulse of
delight drove me to this tumult

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.270
in the clouds."

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.790
And so to me, that
poem has always

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.671
been a little bit about
kind of that idea of,

00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:29.670
what are those things
that drive us to conflict.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.420
Like, what is that
lonely impulse

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.320
of delight that so many
of us feel, whether or not

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.890
we're American, Iraqi,
Afghan, Syrian, what

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.230
perpetuates these wars?

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.480
And I do a lot of thinking
about that, I wrote a piece,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.052
I guess it was about a year ago.

00:16:49.052 --> 00:16:51.260
so I do a lot of writing on
the Syrian Civil War now.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.030
And I traveled down there
with a couple friends of mine

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.750
who started basically
a research company,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.550
that they bid on government
contracts and NGO contracts.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.710
down in this city called
Gaziantep, which is in Turkey,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.840
but it's a 45 minute
drive from Aleppo.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.030
And one of the fellows
who's working for them

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.290
is this guy named Abed,
who was a Syrian activist

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.200
during the revolution's
early days.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.460
And to give you
just a picture, Abed

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.985
is the grand nephew
of the Nizar Qabbani.

00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:19.376
A famous poet laureate of Syria
who died in exile in London.

00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:20.750
He, before the
revolution, worked

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.791
at the British consulate.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.230
He speaks English with a
perfect British accent,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.319
makes me sound
like gutter trash.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.756
And one day Abed came back
and he'd been basically doing

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.630
interviews in this place
called the Akcakale,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.485
which is a refugee camp
500 meters from Syria

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.720
where sometimes they
take incoming artillery.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.330
And he sat there with
me, we were saying down,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.019
kind of eating
dinner, drinking tea.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:44.060
And he was like, Elliot,
I was in Akcakale today.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.230
He's like, and I met
this fellow and I

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.923
think the two you should meet.

00:17:47.923 --> 00:17:49.664
And I was like, OK,
Abed, who's the guy?

00:17:49.664 --> 00:17:50.330
What's the deal?

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.240
He's like, well, he used to
fight for Al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.360
He's like, but bear with me.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.690
I think the two of you
would really get along.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.880
And so, OK.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.920
So we talked about it, and
basically the idea was like,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.180
I would go meet this guy and
do a story that was basically

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.040
two vets from the
Iraq war sit down

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.630
and have lunch but we fought
on different sides of the war.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.790
And then talking to Abed,
it was sort of this idea,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.180
how are we going to meet?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.000
I mean, we can't really just
tell him that I was a Marine.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.490
Because this guy was still
an Islamist at the time.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.110
And at the time, I
had some affiliations

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.180
with Jabat al Nusra, a
big fighting group there.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.992
And so then he was, the first
line of the story was, Abed

00:18:28.992 --> 00:18:30.950
and I agreed the night
before we'd lie and tell

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.540
I'd been a journalist.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.790
And that was what we told him.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.664
But within about half
an hour of sitting down

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:37.760
and he was sort of
telling me about fighting.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.470
You know, I felt like there was
a real sort of-- we were very

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.320
simpatico with one another.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.820
And I kind of dropped
my [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.530
and I was like, hey, listen,
his name was [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.515
I wasn't really there
as a journalist.

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:51.515
I was there as a Marine.

00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:53.990
And he kind of looked
at me and smiled.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.870
And then we kept talking and it
turned into a six hour lunch.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.577
And then I'll just relay
this, then I'll finish.

00:19:01.577 --> 00:19:03.910
And for me one of the most
poignant points of that lunch

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.060
was, Abed had been translating
between us the entire time

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.990
as we were talking, drinking
tea, eating baklava,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.820
sort of reminiscing about our
wars and what they meant to us.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.200
And then after about three
hours, good old Abed, he says,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.783
listen I've got to
go to the bathroom.

00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:18.960
So all tea.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.770
So he gets up to
go to the bathroom.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.170
And now Abu Hasar and I are
sitting there, the two of us.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.586
And we had this very intense
conversation for three hours.

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.590
And now we're sitting
there like two teenagers

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.280
on their first date.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.654
Like, we can't
talk, everything's

00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:31.080
really awkward all of a sudden.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.390
And so I had my notebook
where I was scribbling down

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.900
our conversation.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.890
And I had an idea.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.650
I sort of took a squiggly
line and basically traced out

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.662
on a page the Euphrates River.

00:19:42.662 --> 00:19:44.120
And he kind of saw
what I was doing

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.500
and then he traced out the
sharp, tangential border

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.129
between Iraq and Syria.

00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:51.420
Because he had run guns and
fighters across the border.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.250
That was one of his
responsibilities.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.940
And we started
writing in-- I started

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.089
writing in the names of places.

00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:59.380
And he could sort of see
where they were at on the map.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.930
And he took the pen from me and
started writing in the dates.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.465
And our hands were chasing
each other around the map

00:20:04.465 --> 00:20:07.090
much like the way we chased each
other around the country years

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.910
ago.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.050
And the only thing that
we could communicate

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.311
without an interpreter was
the place names and the dates.

00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:15.810
And we wrote those
dates down to see

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.800
if we'd fought in the same
place at the same time.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.020
And hadn't.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.170
BEN BOYD: Interesting.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.510
I want to transition
and I want to transition

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.990
to-- we've talked about the
upbringing and then the service

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.830
experience.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.206
And let's talk about as
an author a little bit.

00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:34.830
So you transitioned
out of the service.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.690
You got a stint as a
White House fellow.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.280
I'm sure you're
writing throughout.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.007
What was that kind
of conversation,

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.340
what was that decision point
that said, hey, this is me,

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.784
I want to go, I
want to go all in?

00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:46.700
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.620
You know I mean, I always knew
that I was going to write.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.930
Again, it was something
that I grew up around.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.430
Even from early
days in the service,

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.890
I felt like, I'm likely
going to write something

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.400
about this some day but
I could never really

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.354
get at the material.

00:20:58.354 --> 00:20:59.270
It was still going on.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.360
I didn't have any type of
feeling of closure with it.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.704
And actually my last deployment
in Afghanistan in 2011,

00:21:05.704 --> 00:21:07.870
I'd made the decision that
I was going to come home.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.040
It almost certain sounds
trite to frame it in this way,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.890
but literally two days later,
I start writing the first scene

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.390
that I ever that
ever really kind of

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.810
took sort of fictionalizing
what I thought would

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.360
be the beginnings of a story.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.610
And that was two days.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.520
So for me, it was
actually, I didn't

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.640
know what would enable
the writing to begin.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.690
But it was this hard decision
I made that the war is

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.484
over for me now.

00:21:28.484 --> 00:21:29.900
And once I'd made
that decision, I

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.300
think I had the mental space
to start trying to render it

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.650
and other things in fiction.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.358
But I think even if
I hadn't been writing

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:41.120
about the war, if I'd been
writing about guys hanging out

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.530
in Brooklyn or whatever, I
would've have been able to do

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.821
it while I was in the military.

00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:47.180
My emotional space was too
occupied by that experience.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.160
BEN BOYD: What is- tell me
about the process of writing.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.201
I see you're in Istanbul.

00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:53.870
I see like a balcony over the
Bosphorus and a cup of chai.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.270
I mean is this something
that just consumes you?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.420
Are you a like lock
yourself in a room and write

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.350
or slow and steady
sort of approach here?

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.600
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Well I'm
definitely like cup of chai,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.224
looking at the
Bosphorus is always nice

00:22:07.224 --> 00:22:09.000
if you can figure that out.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.260
I think everyone has
a different process.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.570
For me, once I have an idea, I'm
definitely kind of a grinder.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.100
It's probably the
military side of me.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.779
If I'm working on a new
project and it's going well

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:24.320
and I know where it's going, I
write about 1,000 words a day.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.611
It's kind of what I try to hit.

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:28.680
And then if I'm revising, I
sort of set intermediary goals.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.780
I'm going to revise
these 30 pages today.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.622
And again, you have to sort
of have a lead on something

00:22:34.622 --> 00:22:35.580
that you're working on.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.090
But for me, it's
very much-- I don't

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.150
work in spurts of inspiration.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.240
I actually know few
successful writers who do.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.659
Most will tell you,
it's very workman-like

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:45.700
BEN BOYD: Bit of a grind.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.240
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Bit of a grind.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.570
And you know, when
you're getting to the end

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.210
and you're sitting there
with a manuscript--

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.530
I mean, when I'm at the
final stages of a manuscript,

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.410
I lock myself in a
room, a quiet room,

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.960
and I read it out loud
to myself with a pencil.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.300
And I do that multiple times,
just to get the rhythm right,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.790
the sentences right.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.365
So it's a slog.

00:23:01.365 --> 00:23:04.390
BEN BOYD: Any mentors that
stick out to you here?

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.390
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.280
I've had great mentors.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.332
My mother, who's a novelist.

00:23:09.332 --> 00:23:11.540
I remember from a very young
age, sitting on her sofa

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.315
as she sort of tore apart
my sixth grade papers.

00:23:14.315 --> 00:23:15.520
But you know, that matters.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.745
Teachers matter.

00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:18.620
I had a couple of
phenomenal English teachers

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.245
in high school.

00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.750
And then later on as
you surround yourself

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.750
with other writers
who inspire you.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.500
When I was in college, my
freshman creative writing

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.090
teacher was Andre
Dubus, who wrote

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.714
"The House of Sand and Fog," if
you're familiar with that book.

00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:34.424
It was made into a film.

00:23:34.424 --> 00:23:36.590
I remember him, he was
actually finishing that novel

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.660
when he was sort of
adjuncting at Tufts

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.780
and working carpentry
jobs on the side.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.560
I remember he would
come in just exhausted,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.530
sawdust still on his jeans.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.430
What are we talking
about today, guys?

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.260
And then two years later, he was
this internationally acclaimed

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.520
author with a movie.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.360
And for me, it was
always fun to just know

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.940
that I had a window of him
when he was working hard.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.060
But so much of it is a struggle,
it's a lot of struggle.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.630
As your working
through your material

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.854
and trying to get it
out there in the world.

00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:07.770
BEN BOYD: Well, great.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.500
I want to give enough time to
talk about "Green on Blue."

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.500
So maybe I can just kind of pass
it to you for a few minutes.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.070
And maybe an intro to
the idea of the book

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.950
and then we'd would
love to hear passages

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.820
if you're willing to share.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.736
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure.

00:24:20.736 --> 00:24:24.680
Well, the title, "Green on Blue"
refers to the insider attacks

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.440
in Afghanistan.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.320
So green is sort of
military short speak

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.920
for friendly troops,
i.e. the Afghan soldiers

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.720
and blue for American soldiers.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.410
So a green on blue
attack is when

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.790
an Afghan soldier takes his
weapon and shoots his adviser

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.109
and we've seen that as a trend.

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.775
But in the novel, it
really sort of acts

00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:42.830
as a metaphor, this
idea of what happens

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.255
when the cause that you fight
for threatens to destroy you.

00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:48.130
So I'm just going to
read just from beginning

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.541
so you guys can get a sense
for what the book feels like.

00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:52.165
And this is basically
the opening page.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.790
"Many would call
me a dishonest man

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.140
but I've always kept
faith with myself.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.680
There's an honesty
in that I think.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.810
I am Ali's brother.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.930
We are from a village
that no longer exists

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.610
and our family was not
large or prosperous.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.280
The war that came
after the Russians

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.075
but before the Americans
killed our parents.

00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:15.810
Of them, I have
only dim memories.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.490
There is my father's
Kalashnikov,

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.660
hidden in a wood
pile by the door,

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.370
him cleaning it, working
oiled rags on its parts,

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.970
and the smell of gun
metal, and feeling safe.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.560
There is my mother's secret,
the one she shared with me.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.920
Once a month she'd count
out my father's earnings

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.320
from fighting in the
mountains or farming.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.620
She'd send me and Ali from
our village, [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.220
to the large bazaar in
Orgun, a two day walk.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.550
The Orgun bazaar sold
everything, fine cooking oils

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.150
and spices, candles
to light our home,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.510
and fabrics to
repair our clothes.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.810
My mother always entrusted
me with a special purchase.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.740
Before we left she would press
an extra coin in my hand, one

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.080
she'd stolen from my father.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.860
Among the crowded
stalls of the bazaar,

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.660
I would slip away from
my brother's watchful eye

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.000
and buy her a pack
of cigarettes,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.202
a vice forbidden to a woman.

00:26:09.202 --> 00:26:10.660
When we returned
home I would place

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.420
the pack in her hiding spot, the
birch wood cradle where she'd

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.460
rocked me and Ali as infants.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.970
Our mud-walled house was small,
two thatched roofed rooms

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.100
with a courtyard between them.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.170
The cradle was kept in the
room I shared with Ali.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.370
My mother would never
get rid of the cradle.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.760
It was the one thing
that was truly hers.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.400
At night, after we
returned from the bazaar,

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.400
she'd sneak into our room,
her small, sandaled feet

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.540
gliding across the carpets
that lined the dirt floor.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.450
Her hand would
cup a candle, it's

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:45.602
smothered light casting shadows
on her young face, aging her.

00:26:45.602 --> 00:26:48.970
Her eyes, one brown
and the other green,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.230
a miracle or defect of birth,
shifted about the room.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.920
Carefully she would
lean over the cradle

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.997
as she'd done before
taking us to nurse,

00:26:56.997 --> 00:26:59.330
she would run her fingers
between the blankets that once

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:03.790
swaddled my brother and me, and
finding the pack I'd left her,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.840
she'd step into the courtyard.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.540
And I'd fall back asleep to
the faint smell of her tobacco

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.600
just past my door.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.720
This secret made me
feel close to my mother.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.350
In the years since,
I've wondered

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.080
why she entrusted me with it.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.850
At times, I've thought it was
because I was her favorite.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.890
But this isn't why.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.660
The truth is, she recognized
in me, her own ability

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.870
to deceive."

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.279
So, that's the
opening of the novel.

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.070
The whole book is told
in the first person,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.960
from the perspective of
Aziz, who you hear there.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.770
This is him as a
young Afghan boy.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.478
And the trajectory of
the novel basically

00:27:42.478 --> 00:27:46.530
follows him as he goes off to
fight with an Afghan militia.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.100
It's always difficult to sort
of say where a book begins,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.141
because so much of the
process of writing a novel

00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:53.425
is you're really groping
in the dark for the story.

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:55.550
So oftentimes what starts
as the beginning winds up

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.110
as the middle.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.401
The middle winds up as the end.

00:27:57.401 --> 00:27:59.370
The end winds up
as the beginning.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.434
But for me, in writing
the book too, you know,

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:04.725
there sort of like-- I'll
just share an anecdote that I

00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:07.019
will keep coming back to.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:09.060
As has been mentioned,
when I was in Afghanistan,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.960
I served exclusively
in Special Operations.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.670
And as an adviser
to Afghan troops,

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.730
so in many respects, my war
buddies or a few Americans,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:17.980
but many of them were Afghans.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.860
So these weren't guys that
I, when the war was over,

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.502
would really ever see again.

00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:25.460
But we'd done all the
things people have always

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.230
done when they fight together.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.860
We'd fought together,
mourned friends together.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.651
We'd bled together.

00:28:28.651 --> 00:28:30.602
But trapped as they
were, in that country's

00:28:30.602 --> 00:28:32.310
elliptical conflict,
they weren't a bunch

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.730
of guys I could, you
know, friend on Facebook,

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.365
go get beers with at the
local VFW for a quarter

00:28:39.365 --> 00:28:41.210
or call long distance.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.800
So really for me, the
novel was an effort

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.820
to render their world, kind of
as a last act of friendship.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.550
And for me it was
also a way to reckon

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.925
with the loss of
that friendship.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.990
But when I think about
what that war was like,

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.280
I often come back
to this one story,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.865
which was one of
the guys I advised

00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:01.770
was this guy named Ezak.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.400
And Ezak was this
Tajik tribal guy

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.900
in Paktika province, which is
right on the border with South

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.050
Waziristan and Pakistan, really
sort of a remote, bad place.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.390
Ezak had worked here
for about 10 years.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.435
And we lived on a firebase
that was basically

00:29:16.435 --> 00:29:19.340
about three football fields
up in the high desert.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.384
And about once
every two weeks, we

00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:23.050
would have what was
very grandly termed,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.740
our operational
planning meeting.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.460
But what it really
involved was me

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.530
sort of bebopping
across the firebase

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.384
into Ezak's little hooch, which
was this sort of plywood hut.

00:29:31.384 --> 00:29:32.550
And I'd walk into his hooch.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.400
And Ezak would
be-- he had this--

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.600
I remember he has this
lumpy sofa in the corner

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.610
that he was always
sort of reclining on.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.110
And I would kind of flop down
next to him on the lumpy sofa.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.880
There'd be a little plywood
table in front of us

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.505
and he would go to
his dresser and he'd

00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:44.870
pull out a pack of smokes.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.970
get a pot of chai,
sit it on the dresser

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.660
and we'd sit back, the two
of us kind to leaning there.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.050
And we'd look up
at the far wall.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.040
And on the far wall
there were two things.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.680
There was a map and
there was a calendar.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.550
So Ezak would, sort
of, cigarette in hand,

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.600
would get up to the map.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.310
And he'd look at
it and I'd say, so,

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.920
Esak, what do you
think we should do

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.710
for the next couple weeks?

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.834
And looking at the map, he
would sort of sit there,

00:30:03.834 --> 00:30:06.760
and he'd look up at one of the
villages right on the border.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.410
And he'd say, yeah, well,
you know, Mr. Elliot,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.610
we could go up Rarakaray.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.240
There's always very good
hunting up in Rarakaray.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.530
So I'd say, all right.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.120
We'd get on the
trucks, load them up,

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.750
12 vehicles, about
120, 130 Afghans.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.420
We'd drive up to Rarakaray
over a couple of days,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.200
you know, 50-50 chance we would
get into a gun fight up there.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.380
We'd come back down.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.290
We would clean up
the trucks for a day,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.100
fix them up, give
the guys a day off.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.260
Inevitably I would come back
in for the operational planning

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:34.580
meeting.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.850
Two weeks would have passed.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.200
I'd sit down on the
lumpy sofa with Ezak.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.930
Same thing, pack of smokes, pot
of chai, Ezak up at the map.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.959
All right, Ezak, hey, that was
a great op up in Rarakaray.

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:47.750
You know, what are you
thinking about next?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.940
I mean, you know the
ground better than anyone .

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.650
You've been here 10 years.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.500
And he'd look at the
map, stroke his chin

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.340
and say, next village
south, you know,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.740
Mr. Elliot, we could
go to Mangratay.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.265
It's always very good
hunting in Mangratay.

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:00.390
And we'd do the same thing.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.812
Load up the trucks,
head up to Mangratay.

00:31:03.812 --> 00:31:05.520
And you know, the
conversation between us

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.510
was never one where it was
like, you know, Mr. Elliot,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.560
if we go to Rarakaray, then
we hit them in Mangratay,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.390
we can run one last operation
in Malashay, seal the border,

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.870
seal the border shut,
the war will be over.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.350
I can go back to my crops.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.277
You can get your
Master of Fine Arts,

00:31:21.277 --> 00:31:23.360
you know, write that novel
you keep talking about.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.510
Like it was not
that type of war.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.970
So what type of war was it?

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.790
And for me, one of the
ambitions of the novel

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.450
was to try to show that paradigm
that existed in Afghanistan.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.080
The one that existed
for Ezak, that

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.830
kept his war being
fought for every reason

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.884
but the ending of it.

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:41.300
You know for a war that's been
going on for over 30 years.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.770
But also the paradigm for us.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.434
It's kept us at
war for 15 years.

00:31:44.434 --> 00:31:46.600
Because as much as Esak was
going village to village

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.790
and had, in many respects
more in common with a beat cop

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.410
than with like a General
Eisenhower figure.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.240
Yet, so sort of did
I in a lot of ways.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.180
I wasn't sitting
there saying, hey,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.600
Esak, how are we going to win
the war in Paktika province?

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.602
I, at that point, was a guy who
worked in special operations.

00:32:01.602 --> 00:32:03.060
I'd been doing this
work for years.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.950
It's what defined me.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.060
I wanted to be on
the deployments

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.643
where sort of the
action was thickest.

00:32:06.643 --> 00:32:08.540
That assured my promotion.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.470
And that was sort of
my incentive structure.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.560
So for me, a real
ambition of the book

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.870
is to try to show that as
truly as I could and then

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.092
let the reader determine
what they think of it.

00:32:22.092 --> 00:32:23.550
BEN BOYD: Part of
what I pulled out

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.420
was, and you alluded
to it in the book,

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.950
where you superimpose
this American way of life.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.840
It's a timeline
and it's discipline

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.900
and it's these results,
x results by y date.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.700
And then you drop that on
top of this kind of beat cop

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.650
mentality in this very low
level way of life approach to it

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:45.350
as opposed to, let's get
something we can tag as a win

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.560
and depart.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.570
I'd love to know what kind of,
on a couple of different levels

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.330
maybe, and we'll start
with the American citizens'

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.330
interpretation of the Afghan
community and population

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.860
and partner network.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.500
I would love to
hear your thoughts

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.430
on what you hope the
American citizen can pull out

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.520
of this after reading, in
terms of their understanding

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.632
of the Afghan community.

00:33:09.632 --> 00:33:11.340
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Again,
I hope it sort of

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.320
is able to render the
war as the Afghan saw it.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.212
And as I mentioned,
people behave according

00:33:16.212 --> 00:33:17.420
to their incentive structure.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.206
So for a fellow like
Ezak, if the war ended,

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.830
it wouldn't actually
be great for Ezak.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.910
All of his stature was derived
by his position in his tribe,

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.770
in his community as the head
of one of these militias.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.550
So in many respects,
everything-- wars

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.710
build their-- economies
build out around wars.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.490
And I don't necessarily mean
like financial economies

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.697
exclusively, although they
can often be part of it,

00:33:40.697 --> 00:33:42.280
but economies in
terms of where people

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.650
stand socially,
people's careers,

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.160
and they build
out on both sides.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.800
And I think for us,
one of the things I'm

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.530
hoping a reader might
take away from the book,

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:59.270
and I think in fiction and
through story, oftentimes I

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.940
don't think good
work necessarily

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.290
provides pedantic answers.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.990
I think it just frames questions
in ways that are honest

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.210
and gives the reader
enough generous space

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.560
to start asking themselves
those questions.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.110
So I think in many respects
one of the questions

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.370
the book gets at is, why does
a war going for 30 years?

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.800
Why does it go on for 15 years?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.654
Why are these wars,
do they go on in a way

00:34:22.654 --> 00:34:24.570
and why are they being
fought for every reason

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.710
but the ending of them?

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:30.790
Is that because we just can't
get to that final peace treaty

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.300
where we've achieved
our objectives

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.799
or is it because
these wars are just

00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:34.719
starting to feed themselves?

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.050
And if they are starting
to feed themselves,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.759
what is the economy
that's creating that?

00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:38.966
And just trying to show that.

00:34:38.966 --> 00:34:40.389
And in many respects,
the paradigm

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.263
that exists in the book
is one I saw play out

00:34:42.263 --> 00:34:45.300
in Afghanistan many times
over in different provinces,

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.730
villages, districts.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.650
BEN BOYD: Interesting.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.534
Have you shared it
with any Afghans?

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.780
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: A
few of my readers

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.840
were Afghans, folks I knew in
Kabul who were checking it.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.530
There's a lot of
Afghan slang in it,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.690
to make sure that I had gotten
that all right, Pashto slang.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.447
They are folks who frankly,
their English is not

00:35:06.447 --> 00:35:09.030
at a level where they're really
appreciating literary fiction.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.630
They can kind of get by on it.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.620
So I would say the
first Afghan reader

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.480
who read who was someone who
was a literary person was Khaled

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.680
Hosseini who read it
in [? Tablurbit ?]

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.200
So we were glad when
he liked the book.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.235
BEN BOYD: OK.

00:35:28.235 --> 00:35:30.360
I'm interested in kind of
on this topic of feedback

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.340
that you've had since.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.548
Do you feel like you have
accomplished the objectives

00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:35.970
that you set out to in
terms of just posing

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.110
those tough questions?

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.070
Do you feel like
in retrospect you

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.450
would course correct any way?

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.450
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: You mean
like rewrite the book?

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.991
BEN BOYD: In terms of kind of
how you're-- in terms of really

00:35:46.991 --> 00:35:48.840
getting at how you
poll those questions.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.673
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Yeah,
I mean I sort of hate

00:35:50.673 --> 00:35:52.610
to frame in terms
of like, there's

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.930
an objective to be achieved.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.240
I mean, it's art.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.660
You're telling story.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:02.210
If people read the book
and they feel something,

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.975
that's all I care about.

00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:05.850
In so many ways, I think
one of things that's

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.875
interesting about writing
a novel in particular,

00:36:07.875 --> 00:36:09.625
because it's very much
rooted in emotional

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.700
is that you've had
this incredibly-- I've

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.840
had a very intimate experience
with that book for a long time.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.410
For a long, long
time was a thing

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.970
that I would hold like this.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.640
And only the closest
people were allowed

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.820
to read it as it was in draft
and give me their opinions.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.070
I had to really think
about all of those opinions

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.028
and how I would incorporate
them into the story

00:36:27.028 --> 00:36:29.460
or whether they merited the
incorporating in the story.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.150
And the book comes out and
you throw it out to the world.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.660
And everybody can
read it and everybody

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.510
can have their opinion.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.810
And people see
things in the book

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.515
that you didn't even
know were in the book,

00:36:36.515 --> 00:36:38.350
And that makes you
think about-- because so

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:42.420
much of these stories get
written by your subconscious.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.982
So again, I don't know
if there's an objective.

00:36:44.982 --> 00:36:46.440
I think the objective
of all art is

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.340
to basically transfer your
emotion into another person

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.340
through some type of
medium, whether it's visual

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.048
or through story.

00:36:52.048 --> 00:36:54.420
So if somebody reads the
book and they feel something,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.762
then that's a good thing.

00:36:55.762 --> 00:36:56.720
BEN BOYD: That's great.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.970
That's great.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.230
We as a society, I think this
is one of the many outlets

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.410
that we have to kind of hear
the message of specifically

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.007
kind of these global
war on terror efforts.

00:37:09.007 --> 00:37:11.340
I think the one that we just
consume at the quicker pace

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.090
is a lot of the
Hollywood renditions.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.430
And I think this
year especially,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.460
until recently the
lead box office

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.720
was in terms of sales was
the "American Sniper."

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.562
And we had "Lone
Survivor" before that.

00:37:24.562 --> 00:37:26.520
Can you tell us a little
bit about your-- share

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.970
some thoughts in terms
of how good of a job

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.920
those are communicating and what
messages they're passing on?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.382
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Well,
it's a lot of Seals.

00:37:35.382 --> 00:37:37.090
BEN BOYD: If there
was a marketing effort

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.000
to be had for the
military community,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.589
do what the Seals do.

00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:42.630
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: They
seemed to have nailed that.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.080
Without getting into like the
relative, sort of which one

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.280
I think is good, which one I
didn't like, which one I walked

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:58.390
out of, I think it's a good
thing that these movies are--

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.420
the fact that these
movies are doing well

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.120
shows that there is, I think,
an appetite in the country

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.970
for people to reflect
back on these wars

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.850
and what they meant and try
to understand what they meant.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.230
And I think that's a good thing.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.781
I'm glad.

00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:13.530
BEN BOYD: What would
you caution a viewer?

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.380
What would you
tell somebody going

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.310
in that might have that
thirst and that interest

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.665
in understanding, but not
have a direct relationship?

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.290
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I
think sometimes it's

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.490
the undercurrent is
kind of like, well,

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.840
is that what it was like?

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.680
Is "American Sniper"
what it was like?

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.010
No one can tell
you what it's like

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.461
because everyone's
experience in the wars

00:38:33.461 --> 00:38:34.710
has been very, very different.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.254
I had a very diverse military
experience from being in Iraq,

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:45.420
to being in Afghanistan,
to being in different parts

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.110
of Afghanistan.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.350
And so I'm just very
leery of someone

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.200
who feels like they
have to true experience.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.129
Everyone has a right
to their experience.

00:38:56.129 --> 00:38:58.420
BEN BOYD: So I want to give
the audience an opportunity

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.460
to participate.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.744
We have a mic.

00:39:01.744 --> 00:39:03.160
So based off the
discussion, would

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.368
love to hear maybe some
thoughts and some things we'd

00:39:05.368 --> 00:39:06.599
like to do hear.

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:07.640
AUDIENCE: My name's Mike.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.900
I'm interested in
hearing a little bit

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:09.830
about your transition.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.670
It looks like it was kind of a
model, successful transition.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.970
What advice you have for
the flood of new veterans

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.920
and people getting out of
the military right now.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.361
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Sure, thanks.

00:39:20.361 --> 00:39:22.110
I don't know if it was
a model transition.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.715
I think it's like, everybody
struggles when you get out

00:39:25.715 --> 00:39:28.090
to figure out what the next
thing is going to be once you

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.540
are leaving and how you're
going to basically repurpose

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.040
yourself.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.162
Because I think for
anybody, where we often

00:39:36.162 --> 00:39:37.870
derive our happiness
is from what we feel

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.540
is our purpose in life.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.630
And whether that's
defined as simply

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.790
as I work a job and that
job-- or as conventionally

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.460
as I work a job.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.793
That job puts food on the table.

00:39:47.793 --> 00:39:49.036
My kids get to go to school.

00:39:49.036 --> 00:39:50.660
They get opportunities
because of that.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.690
That's a good purpose.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.773
I think something that can
be a challenge for vets

00:39:53.773 --> 00:39:56.920
is that for those of us
who have gone and served,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.640
particularly in the
wars, you come out

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.889
and you're maybe 20 years old.

00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:01.140
You go right into the war.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.680
It's a very intense purpose.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.120
You're surrounded by
your best friends.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.600
You have an objective
that can oftentimes

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.220
seem at least somewhat
clear at face value.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.360
Hold an output
from patrols here.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.290
So coming back and
repurposing yourself

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:17.110
can sometimes feel disorienting.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.710
But it's what we
sort of have to do.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.220
It's kind of like the last
steps or the last mission

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.720
is figuring out
what that purpose is

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.820
going to be that carries
you on into your life.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.470
And for me it's writing.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.710
And I think that one thing it
seems this generation of vets

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.710
is doing a good job
amongst each other with,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.670
is sort of being the
support network that's

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:42.020
helping each other
achieve that last purpose,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.550
that final sense of purpose.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.256
So I don't know, I feel
very lucky to be part

00:40:46.256 --> 00:40:47.380
of this generation of vets.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.382
We seem to be a
pretty good group.

00:40:49.382 --> 00:40:50.965
BEN BOYD: I think
it's a good question

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:53.131
and I think it's one that
we discussed and we really

00:40:53.131 --> 00:40:55.280
tried to prioritize
as the veterans

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.130
network internal to Google.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.780
We certainly dabble and try
to have a positive influence

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.170
in some of the
recruiting efforts

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.480
and some internal things.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.980
But I think a big
part of what we do

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.940
is just the support of
the external community.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.000
Once a year, kind
of our big bang

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.560
is, 20 plus offices
throughout the country,

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.350
we do a Help A Hero
Get Hired events.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.460
We bring a bunch of folks that
have recently transitioned.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.710
We sit them down.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.396
We help them kind of
translate their resume

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:23.020
of what they did in
the service to what

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.580
can be read and
understood and digested

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.860
from a potential
hiring position.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.140
Would love to, on that kind of
topic of advice for somebody

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.110
that's trying to really
package what they did.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.320
And when the tangible
skill sets might not

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.490
be directly transferable,
what's your advice

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.450
in helping people think
through what they can

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.780
do to communicate their value

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.650
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I don't know
if I have any neat advice aside

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.400
from have a personal
narrative of kind of what

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.550
your experience was, what it was
to you, who you are as a person

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.810
and be able to tell that
story with a certain level

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.630
of consistency, I think helps.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.630
Because I can imagine
some of those things

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.347
don't necessarily-- if you
were an infantry squad leader,

00:42:09.347 --> 00:42:10.930
the level of
responsibility you've had

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.310
might not necessarily translate
across the pages easily.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.090
But hopefully, too,
I would tell someone,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.010
try to plug in with other
vets because no one's going

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.140
to take care of vets
better than other vets.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.030
And so if you can be at least
getting your entry experience

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:28.599
at a place where some
of that is understood,

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:30.140
I would look for
those opportunities.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.460
BEN BOYD: Yes, and like
you said, highlighting

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.680
that core competency.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.004
You can't train that
discipline and that work ethic

00:42:35.004 --> 00:42:37.170
and all those sorts of
things that just kind of come

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.910
with somebody that has earned
the position of squad leader

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.630
in an infantry, in
an infantry platoon.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.422
I think there's something
to be said for that.

00:42:44.422 --> 00:42:45.880
AUDIENCE: Elliot,
nice to meet you.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.290
My name is Will.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.690
I haven't served and but I
have family members and friends

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:53.370
that have.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.270
If you had the microphone
at our company-wide meeting

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.570
later this afternoon
that's broadcast

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.350
to 50,000 Googlers
across the world,

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.720
I'm curious, what would be the
two or three things that you

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.980
would want people that
live in a relatively

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.960
comfortable environment as you
can see here to think about,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.880
whether it's about
the experience you had

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.980
or misperceptions that
99% of the country

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.890
has who's not enlisted or
issues with veterans affairs.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.290
But what would be the two
or three bullet points

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:27.252
that you would want to
communicate to a wide audience.

00:43:27.252 --> 00:43:29.210
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I think
a couple bullet points

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.690
that I would communicate
about these wars is

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.210
and the experience of
them is, every time

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:40.120
the US has gone to war, it has
been under a certain construct.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.970
So the Second World War was
a national mobilization,

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.350
funded by war bonds.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.620
The Vietnam War was a
war typified by sort

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.860
of the draft and conscription.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.430
These wars have been fought
with an all volunteer military

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.290
and funded largely
through deficit spending.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.140
And that construct
that we put in place

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.610
has made it so unless
you are in the military,

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.090
you don't really feel the war.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:02.570
And it's led to
a system where we

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.920
have wars that can perpetuate.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.894
There's a discussion
right now, a debate about

00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:08.060
whether or not we're going
to be putting troops back

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.836
into Iraq to fight ISIS.

00:44:09.836 --> 00:44:11.210
And for most people
it's a debate

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.335
that's completely ancillary
to their personal lives

00:44:13.335 --> 00:44:15.705
because if you're not
affiliated with the military,

00:44:15.705 --> 00:44:17.080
you don't have to
feel that pain.

00:44:19.594 --> 00:44:21.510
And I don't know, if
that's the new framework,

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.330
we're probably going to have
wars that go on a lot longer.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.900
We probably won't feel
the wars in the same way.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.858
Is that the type of
country we want to live in?

00:44:26.858 --> 00:44:29.710
Is that how we think we want to
be projecting ourselves abroad?

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.960
I'm not going to sit here
and claim that I necessarily

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.020
have that answer.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.395
But I think it's
something that's

00:44:34.395 --> 00:44:37.400
going on beneath the surface
that many Americans might not

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.030
be recognizing, is how
we've sort of transformed.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.270
And how we project force says
a lot about us as a country.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.520
And it's a conversation, I
think, that's worth having.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.951
So I don't know if that was
two or three sharp PowerPoint

00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:51.950
bullets, but it's something
I think about a lot.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.410
BEN BOYD: We can get two
more before the meeting

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.034
this afternoon.

00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:57.244
ELLIOT ACKERMAN:
OK, you let me know.

00:44:57.244 --> 00:44:58.160
BEN BOYD: Well, great.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.340
So I'm going to pose
the final question

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.280
and open it back up to
you to cover anything

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.680
that you think we
might not have touched

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.340
on that you think the book
could be a good vehicle

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.590
to communicate.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.360
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: I
hate that question.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.020
BEN BOYD: You don't
like fast balls.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.353
That's what we're throwing here.

00:45:17.353 --> 00:45:20.496
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: What
we haven't talked about.

00:45:20.496 --> 00:45:21.670
I believe in books.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.930
I think books matter.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.284
I think as much as the world
has gone more to YouTube

00:45:27.284 --> 00:45:29.200
and has gone to film and
gone to other things,

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.350
I think that books matter.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.745
And I think that there's
a lot of great literature

00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:36.780
that has come out
about these wars

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.140
and that I know is coming
out on the horizon.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.500
And I hope people read it.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.740
And I feel like they are.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.120
I think that's a
good thing and that's

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.414
happened kind of
for each generation.

00:45:48.414 --> 00:45:50.080
BEN BOYD: Elliot,
sir, much appreciated.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.210
Absolute pleasure.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.293
ELLIOT ACKERMAN: Pleasure.

00:45:52.293 --> 00:45:53.060
[APPLAUSE]
