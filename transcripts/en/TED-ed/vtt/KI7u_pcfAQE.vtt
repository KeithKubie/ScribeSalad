00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:09.747
If someone called you scum,

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.451
you'd probably be offended,

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.868
but scientifically,

00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:14.451
they might not be far off.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.503
Have you ever thought about

00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:17.367
where your food comes from?

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:18.721
You might say it comes from

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.404
plants, animals, or even fungi,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:21.960
but you'd probably rather not

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720
think about the rotting organisms and poop

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.867
that feed those plants, animals, and fungi.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.352
So really, you and most of the matter in your body

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.935
are just two or three degrees of separation

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.772
from things like pond scum.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.564
All species in an ecosystem,

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:38.109
from the creatures in a coral reef

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.485
to the fish in a lake

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:40.821
to the lions on the savannah,

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.362
are directly or indirectly

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.325
nourished by dead stuff.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.826
Most of the organic matter in our bodies,

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.617
if we trace it back far enough,

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:50.413
comes from CO2 and water

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:52.249
through photosynthesis.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.070
Plants use the energy from sunlight

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.178
to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment

00:00:57.178 --> 00:00:59.587
into glucose and oxygen.

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:01.283
That glucose is then transformed

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:02.701
into more complex organic molecules

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.845
to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and so on.

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:08.764
The energy stored in these organic molecules

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.557
supports the food chains with which we're familiar.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.950
You've probably seen illustrations like this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.537
or this.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:16.981
These green food chains

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.241
start with living plants at their base.

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:22.034
But in real-life terrestrial ecosystems,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:23.989
less than 10% of plant matter

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.002
is eaten while it's still alive.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.701
What about the other 90?

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:29.159
Well, just look at the ground

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.326
on an autumn day.

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.079
Living plants shed dead body parts:

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.748
fallen leaves, broken branches,

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.501
and even underground roots.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.919
Many plants are lucky enough

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:38.617
to go their whole lives without being eaten,

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.254
eventually dying and leaving remains.

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.540
All of these uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.200
that 90% of terrestrial plant matter?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.846
That becomes detritus,

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:51.700
the base of what we call the brown food chain,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.034
which looks more like this.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.475
What happens to plants

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:58.064
also happens to all other organisms up the food chain:

00:01:58.064 --> 00:01:59.398
some are eaten alive,

00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.818
but most are eaten only

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:02.609
when they're dead and rotting.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.142
And all along this food chain,

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:06.031
living things shed organic matter

00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.655
and expel digestive waste

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:10.700
before dying and leaving their remains to decay.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.246
All that death sounds grim, right?

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:14.581
But it's not.

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.584
All detritus is ultimately consumed

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:18.533
by microbes and other scavengers,

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.169
so it actually forms the base of the brown food chain

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.452
that supports many other organisms,

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:25.368
including us.

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:26.701
Scientists are learning

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.469
that this detritus

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.712
is an unexpectedly huge energy source,

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.885
fueling most natural ecosystems.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.182
But the interactions within an ecosystem

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:36.476
are even more complex than that.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.118
What a food chain really represents

00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.651
is a single pathway of energy flow.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.694
And within any ecosystem,

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:43.859
many of these flows

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.987
are linked together

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:46.363
to form a rich network of interactions,

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:48.739
or food web,

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.243
with dead matter supporting that network at every step.

00:02:52.243 --> 00:02:53.538
The resulting food web

00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:54.617
is so connected

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:55.829
that almost every species

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.032
is no more than two degrees from detritus,

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.002
even us humans.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.616
You probably don't eat rotting things,

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.783
poop, or pond scum directly,

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:06.091
but your food sources probably do.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:07.841
Many animals we eat

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.927
either feed directly on detritus themselves,

00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:11.851
like pork, poultry, mushrooms, shellfish,

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:15.475
or catfish and other bottom feeders,

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:16.891
or they are fed animal by-products.

00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:19.686
So, if you're thinking nature is full of waste,

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:20.945
you're right.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:23.566
But one organism's garbage is another's gold,

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.025
and all that rotting dead stuff

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:27.152
ultimately provides the energy that nourishes us

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.070
and most of life on Earth,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.992
as it passes through the food web.

00:03:30.992 --> 00:03:35.175
Now that's some food for thought.
