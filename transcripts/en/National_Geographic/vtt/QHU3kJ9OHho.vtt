00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.735
Panut:<i> In Sumatra, the
 Leuser Ecosystem is</i>

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.672
<i>one of the largest and most
intact tropical rainforests</i>

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.040
<i> left in Southeast Asia.</i>

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.777
<i> It is the only place in
 the world where you have</i>

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.812
<i> Sumatran tigers,
 Sumatran rhinos,</i>

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:16.282
<i>Sumatran elephants and orangutan</i>

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.820
<i>living together in the same
 place at the same time.</i>

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.822
<i> Unfortunately,
 the Leuser Ecosystem</i>

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.890
<i> the forest is shrinking.</i>

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.994 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.395 line:0%
<i> For the last 15 years</i>

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.799 line:0%
I have been dedicating my
life to saving orangutans.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.601
<i>These orangutans are living
 in the Leuser Ecosystem</i>

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.837
<i> on the island of
 Sumatra, Indonesia.</i>

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.875
<i>So, the forest of orangutan
is really, really precious.</i>

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.778
<i> And not just orangutans</i>

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.346
<i>that depends on this forest
 for their survival</i>

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:51.918
<i>but humans depend on this
forest for many, many reasons.</i>

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.786
<i> And I would say that the
 orangutan is actually</i>

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.622
<i>the guardian of the forest</i>

00:00:55.622 --> 00:01:00.159 line:0%
because they actually keep
regenerating, you know.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.560 line:0%
They keep planting trees.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.929 line:0%
They are the best
gardener of the forest.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.465
And that means actually they are

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.235
the symbol of our fight
against global warming.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.271
<i> Unfortunately,
 the Leuser Ecosystem,</i>

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:17.143
<i>the forests in Sumatra and
also in Borneo are shrinking</i>

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.279
because of the bad planning.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.281
Even the Leuser Ecosystem
is not even recognized

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.617
in the government's
special plan.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:28.287
<i> 80% of the orangutan
 habitat has been gone,</i>

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.256
<i> mainly for plantation.</i>

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.491
And not just orangutan
that is suffering

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.592
because they are losing habitat

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:36.062
but also many other
animals become victims

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.964
of human-wildlife conflict.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.867
<i> And for orangutan,
being stranded is a problem.</i>

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.703
<i>It's a big, big trouble for them
because they cannot go anywhere.</i>

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.205
<i> They cannot find food</i>

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.473
and a picture like
this showing you

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.342
like, you cannot go anywhere,
and you face starvation.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:51.711
And you can imagine that like,

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.179
with this kind of situation,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.581
where orangutan just have
no trees

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.850
left to go back to the forest

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.987
and people can get access to
actually shoot the mother

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.223
<i>and get the baby for pet-trade.</i>

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.926
<i>This is a big male orangutan,
 kept there for 20 years.</i>

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:10.363
<i>You can see the small door there</i>

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.299
<i>when he was actually taken,
 when he was very small.</i>

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.601
<i> Now he is lucky because
 he is now in safety.</i>

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.003 line:0%
<i> And this gentleman,</i>

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.271 line:0%
<i> look at that handsome.</i>

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.572 line:0%
<i> And but-- unfortunately
 this guy is actually</i>

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.074
<i>really, really in trouble
 because</i>

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:24.243
<i> he is living in a very
 small forest patch</i>

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.247
<i> and we try to bring
 him into safety.</i>

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.515
So, we come to the
plantation area

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:33.085
and we check every tiny forest
patch left in the plantation

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.989
that is surrounded by
palm oil plantation.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.593
And sometimes we found
these things, that is sad.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.596
<i> Orangutan cannot survive
 in the plantation.</i>

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.431 line:0%
<i> And we have to rescue.</i>

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.800 line:0%
<i> When we rescue orangutan
 on top of the trees</i>

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.669 line:0%
<i> top of the canopy like
 this, like that--</i>

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.271
<i> You can see that it's
 very risky, dangerous.</i>

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:54.940
<i>But we have to do it anyway
otherwise they are in trouble,</i>

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.244
<i> being shot, you know,
 or captured</i>

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.079
<i>or even die of starvation.</i>

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.184
<i>And then we have to get the
mother, check their health</i>

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.619
<i> while the orangutan
 is still actually asleep</i>

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.154
<i>because of the anesthetic</i>

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.122
<i> because we actually
tranquilize the orangutan.</i>

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.291
<i>And not just young orangutan</i>

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.060
<i> but also male orangutan
 that we have to rescue.</i>

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.595
<i> And this massive
 animal, you know</i>

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.531
<i> we have to really
 carry into safety.</i>

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.400
<i> Sometimes we have to go
 find a very best place</i>

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.203
<i>crossing the river, and we
 sometimes have to cross</i>

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.672
<i>you know, peat swamp, and</i>

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:30.676
then we have to move them into
safety in the Leuser forest.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:33.746 line:0%
<i>And, this is like a happy moment</i>

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.915 line:0%
<i> when I see actually
orangutan being released.</i>

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.551 line:0%
<i> It's a freedom. This is
something that we want to do,</i>

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.886 line:0%
<i> we want to achieve.
 This is our final goal.</i>

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.321 line:0%
<i> Keep forest as forest.</i>

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.590
<i>We want to secure the habitat</i>

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.526
<i> so we chop down illegal
 palm oil trees.</i>

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.862
<i> And then we plant them
 with forest trees.</i>

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.665
<i>And that is actually my son
 planting trees with me.</i>

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:57.236
<i>And then, this is just showing
 you how we plant trees</i>

00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:00.106
<i> for growing forest
 from beginning</i>

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.341
<i> and we actually look
 at it from the top.</i>

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:05.077
<i> And for five years,
 actually we got this.</i>

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:06.746
<i> So, which is really,
 really promising</i>

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.649
and I believe that this is
like bringing you a new hope

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.419
that we can do something,
we can help our nature.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.122
<i> And not only that, but
 animals coming back.</i>

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.224 line:0%
<i> And then this actually</i>

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:21.827 line:0%
<i>this is also becoming playground
 for many, many animals.</i>

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:25.131
<i>So not only that but also many,
many people, local people</i>

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.802
coming to learn and join us to
actually help with the project

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:30.836
and this being--

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:33.906
this bring a good
momentum for local people

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.209
that we can still
save our forest.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.343
So, it's never

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.879 line:0%
<i>too late to save our nature</i>

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.282 line:0%
<i> so, you can do your own,
your own part, and I believe</i>

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.851 line:0%
<i> you can contribute
 in your own way.</i>

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.056 line:0%
So, please join me and save our
rainforest and orangutans.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.123
Thank you.

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.192
