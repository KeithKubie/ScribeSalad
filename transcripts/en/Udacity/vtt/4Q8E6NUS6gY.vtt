00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.840
As like any e-commerce
company should do, we

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.147
constantly optimize the conversion rates
as we think about the purchase flow.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:20.290
In traditional e-commerce, when you
have a visitor come to your page, and

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.058
a visitor actually checking out, it's
just a really big drop-off anywhere from

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:30.844
90% to 98% depending on
the e-commerce site.

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:35.556
This is because there's a lot
of different barriers in

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:40.720
that process as you're
trying to understand

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.250
what type of product do I want,
what type of color, what type of size,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.260
now I have to put in all my address
information and payment information.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.670
We constantly try to optimize
that experience to make it as

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.969
easy as possible and making it as few
clicks and things people are typing in.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.420
An example of that was as we
are thinking about, we have

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.600
people coming into Teespring and they
have already purchased from us before.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.150
What is a way we can make
that process easier for

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.980
them to actually be able to then import
all their previous address information?.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.970
This was a feature which
we hadn't ever built prior.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.290
As we looked at this, one of the things
that we really wanted to optimize for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.640
was around speed and especially for
people on their devices,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.081
like on their phones being able to type
in a lot of fields is really painful.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.030
That's just one example of how
we tried to optimize for this,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.720
is to say that if you're a buyer
who's come to Teespring before,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.270
what are the different
ways that we can actually

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.180
import your previous information
into the checkout experience?
