00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.262
Going down?
Yeah.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.140
You live in the building?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.280
(elevator ding)
Yeah.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.302
They keep making
'em bigger every year.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.654
Buildings.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.784
(elevator ding)

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.780
You grew up
around here?

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.260
I was born here.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.591
Oh, you were born here,
in the elevator?

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.494
Kidding, it's my New York
sarcastic sense of humor.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.364
(dinging)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.469
Looks like we
caught the local.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.400
And what about you--
You doing all right?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.268
Everything all
right?

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.174
Uh-huh.
Life.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.743
Yeah, I'm fine,
thank you.
I'm fine, too.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.744
I just need my first
cup of coffee,

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.479
then I'm
a little better.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.114
Not good for you, it's
not that bad for you.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.248
Like red wine.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.383
They say you have
a glass of red wine

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.817
and it's good for
your heart.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.586
This week went by
fast, didn't it?

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.254
I mean, it's
already Thursday.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.489
I was telling somebody
yesterday, I go,

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.356
"What is it, Tuesday--"
They go, "No, Wednesday."

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.191
I go, "Shut up."

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.492
They go, "Look."

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.694
I looked, you know, and it was
Wednesday, they were right,

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.262
but, yeah, you know,
you gotta enjoy--

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.864
We got a couple of days
left so we can enjoy those,

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.065
that's for sure.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.634
So how you doing,
all right?
Mm-hmm, fine.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.304
Me too, but rents keep going
up, paycheck stays the same.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.738
Give me a break, right?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.507
Ah, you got your health,
that's what matters.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.778
(repeated dinging)

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.748
What--

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.184
Is this the elevator
going to hell?

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.586
No.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.087
Sorry.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.322
This is hell.

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.759
(Satanic music)

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.195
Hot enough for you?

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.564
It's a dry heat,
I'll say that.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.099
I don't
mind the heat.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.802
You know what gets me--
The humidity.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.773
Seen the news
lately-- A lot going on.

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:52.874
