I was actually emailed by some

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
I was actually emailed by some
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.550
I was actually emailed by some
numberphile viewers young sang-gyu and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
numberphile viewers young sang-gyu and
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.590
numberphile viewers young sang-gyu and
Gockel rajeev they've been doing it

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
Gockel rajeev they've been doing it

projects about cutting your fingernails

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
projects about cutting your fingernails
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.799
projects about cutting your fingernails
and they sent it to me and there was

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
and they sent it to me and there was
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.209
and they sent it to me and there was
some pretty cool maths in there which

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
some pretty cool maths in there which
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.740
some pretty cool maths in there which
I've sort of developed don't be nice to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
I've sort of developed don't be nice to
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.850
I've sort of developed don't be nice to
talk about what we're gonna talk about

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
talk about what we're gonna talk about
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.379
talk about what we're gonna talk about
here is what happens when you cut them

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
here is what happens when you cut them
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.490
here is what happens when you cut them
with a pair of scissors

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
with a pair of scissors
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830
with a pair of scissors
you know you might is this gonna freak

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
you know you might is this gonna freak
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.529
you know you might is this gonna freak
you out so I got a cut like that so I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
you out so I got a cut like that so I
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.730
you out so I got a cut like that so I
cut from the bottom there and I you you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
cut from the bottom there and I you you
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.580
cut from the bottom there and I you you
probably would try to cut to the top

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590
probably would try to cut to the top
 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.720
probably would try to cut to the top
right and then you'd do another one like

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
right and then you'd do another one like
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089
right and then you'd do another one like
that alright and then and then I would

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
that alright and then and then I would
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.560
that alright and then and then I would
cut across the top like that and then

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
cut across the top like that and then
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.520
cut across the top like that and then
you can go right fly it off to let's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
you can go right fly it off to let's
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.110
you can go right fly it off to let's
draw a picture of our anger Nelson well

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
draw a picture of our anger Nelson well
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030
draw a picture of our anger Nelson well
joy it's a semi-circle Magic's got

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
joy it's a semi-circle Magic's got
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.869
joy it's a semi-circle Magic's got
radius one

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
radius one
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580
radius one
so the first cut well we cut out a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
so the first cut well we cut out a
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740
so the first cut well we cut out a
triangle right this is a 45-degree angle

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
triangle right this is a 45-degree angle
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750
triangle right this is a 45-degree angle
so next cuts so you don't want a big

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
so next cuts so you don't want a big
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130
so next cuts so you don't want a big
pointy fingernail it's cut across the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
pointy fingernail it's cut across the
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560
pointy fingernail it's cut across the
top in such a way that each new side

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
top in such a way that each new side
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.760
top in such a way that each new side
that we create they're all the same

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
that we create they're all the same
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709
that we create they're all the same
length do that again we do another cuts

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
length do that again we do another cuts
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810
length do that again we do another cuts
the idea being that we're now got four

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
the idea being that we're now got four
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639
the idea being that we're now got four
sides and that these are all the same

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
sides and that these are all the same
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069
sides and that these are all the same
length and of course if I do this enough

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
length and of course if I do this enough
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540
length and of course if I do this enough
times it's going to start looking like

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
times it's going to start looking like
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850
times it's going to start looking like
an arc of a circle okay and that's your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
an arc of a circle okay and that's your
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.289
an arc of a circle okay and that's your
goal that's where you want to end up up

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
goal that's where you want to end up up
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480
goal that's where you want to end up up
right because you don't we yeah you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
right because you don't we yeah you
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550
right because you don't we yeah you
don't want stabby fingers nails right

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
don't want stabby fingers nails right
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.929
don't want stabby fingers nails right
you want a nice smooth beautiful

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
you want a nice smooth beautiful
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850
you want a nice smooth beautiful
fingernails so you want to reach a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
fingernails so you want to reach a
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770
fingernails so you want to reach a
circle so we do that by doing successive

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
circle so we do that by doing successive
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.420
circle so we do that by doing successive
polygons essentially so you could carry

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
polygons essentially so you could carry
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580
polygons essentially so you could carry
on with this ad infinitum now assuming

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
on with this ad infinitum now assuming
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.630
on with this ad infinitum now assuming
you've got an infinite amount of time

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
you've got an infinite amount of time
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.219
you've got an infinite amount of time
after a hundred cuts gonna definitely

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
after a hundred cuts gonna definitely
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510
after a hundred cuts gonna definitely
look like a circle okay now the question

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
look like a circle okay now the question
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399
look like a circle okay now the question
is how big is this circle because we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
is how big is this circle because we
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190
is how big is this circle because we
never cut at this point again after the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
never cut at this point again after the
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.039
never cut at this point again after the
first cuts these angles here are still

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
first cuts these angles here are still
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.679
first cuts these angles here are still
gonna be 45 degrees and that's very

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
gonna be 45 degrees and that's very
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.510
gonna be 45 degrees and that's very
important that tells us a lot so I'm now

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
important that tells us a lot so I'm now
 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190
important that tells us a lot so I'm now
going to draw a line there which is a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
going to draw a line there which is a
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.560
going to draw a line there which is a
right angle to this new circle that I've

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
right angle to this new circle that I've
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149
right angle to this new circle that I've
created here and I'm gonna do another

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
created here and I'm gonna do another
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219
created here and I'm gonna do another
one coming from this point on the circle

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
one coming from this point on the circle
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530
one coming from this point on the circle
again at right angles now what does this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
again at right angles now what does this
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569
again at right angles now what does this
tell me because this is hitting the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
tell me because this is hitting the
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789
tell me because this is hitting the
tangent to the circle a right angle this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
tangent to the circle a right angle this
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859
tangent to the circle a right angle this
is actually a radius of the new circle

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
is actually a radius of the new circle
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109
is actually a radius of the new circle
so I can kind of complete the new circle

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
so I can kind of complete the new circle
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.510
so I can kind of complete the new circle
the other thing I noticed for this point

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
the other thing I noticed for this point
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490
the other thing I noticed for this point
here whilst it's also the center of the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
here whilst it's also the center of the
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.550
here whilst it's also the center of the
big circle it's also the bottom of the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
big circle it's also the bottom of the
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410
big circle it's also the bottom of the
top circle that's because of something

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
top circle that's because of something
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840
top circle that's because of something
that you know about circles is that if

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
that you know about circles is that if
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.059
that you know about circles is that if
you take two points diametrically

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
you take two points diametrically
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800
you take two points diametrically
opposite and you connect them via any

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
opposite and you connect them via any
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510
opposite and you connect them via any
point on the circumference they will

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
point on the circumference they will
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.430
point on the circumference they will
meet in 90 degrees so you know the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
meet in 90 degrees so you know the
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.910
meet in 90 degrees so you know the
picture

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
picture
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770
picture
from this we can very easily work out

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
from this we can very easily work out
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.480
from this we can very easily work out
how much we've cut off our original

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
how much we've cut off our original
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.510
how much we've cut off our original
circle had radius of one a little bit of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
circle had radius of one a little bit of
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.880
circle had radius of one a little bit of
Pythagoras tells you that this line here

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
Pythagoras tells you that this line here
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.130
Pythagoras tells you that this line here
is route to from there to there is route

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
is route to from there to there is route
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.190
is route to from there to there is route
to from there to there is one so from

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
to from there to there is one so from
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.620
to from there to there is one so from
there to there is root 2 minus 1 so now

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
there to there is root 2 minus 1 so now
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.110
there to there is root 2 minus 1 so now
we can compare the ratio between the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
we can compare the ratio between the
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300
we can compare the ratio between the
size of our nail before to the size of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
size of our nail before to the size of
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.650
size of our nail before to the size of
the nail afterwards they're sort of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
the nail afterwards they're sort of
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.380
the nail afterwards they're sort of
height before a call hates before h

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
height before a call hates before h
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.650
height before a call hates before h
after h before was 1 h after is root 2

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
after h before was 1 h after is root 2
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.199
after h before was 1 h after is root 2
minus 1 and it's not too difficult to

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
minus 1 and it's not too difficult to
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.949
minus 1 and it's not too difficult to
show that this is the same as root 2

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959
show that this is the same as root 2
 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.300
show that this is the same as root 2
plus 1 well big deal what's so good

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
plus 1 well big deal what's so good
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640
plus 1 well big deal what's so good
about that by cut my fingernails so the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
about that by cut my fingernails so the
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.670
about that by cut my fingernails so the
the rank one I had before was bigger

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
the rank one I had before was bigger
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.190
the rank one I had before was bigger
than the one I have after by a factor of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
than the one I have after by a factor of
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560
than the one I have after by a factor of
the silver ratio that's what so the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
the silver ratio that's what so the
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.479
the silver ratio that's what so the
silver ratio is there okay so what is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489
silver ratio is there okay so what is
 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.920
silver ratio is there okay so what is
the silver a shoe you know about the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
the silver a shoe you know about the
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.380
the silver a shoe you know about the
golden ratio right so golden ratio you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
golden ratio right so golden ratio you
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.940
golden ratio right so golden ratio you
think about with the Fibonacci sequence

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
think about with the Fibonacci sequence
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.350
think about with the Fibonacci sequence
okay that's one way of understanding

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
okay that's one way of understanding
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360
okay that's one way of understanding
where the golden ratio comes from so you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
where the golden ratio comes from so you
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.850
where the golden ratio comes from so you
start off with zero and one and then you

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860
start off with zero and one and then you
 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.590
start off with zero and one and then you
add these two together and you get one

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600
add these two together and you get one
 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.240
add these two together and you get one
and then you add these two together and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
and then you add these two together and
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.130
and then you add these two together and
you get two these two together you get

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
you get two these two together you get
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.080
you get two these two together you get
three these two together you get five

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
three these two together you get five
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.910
three these two together you get five
carry on like that that gives you the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
carry on like that that gives you the
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.710
carry on like that that gives you the
Fibonacci sequence their ratio between

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
Fibonacci sequence their ratio between
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300
Fibonacci sequence their ratio between
terms and there's Fibonacci sequence

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
terms and there's Fibonacci sequence
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.000
terms and there's Fibonacci sequence
tends towards the golden ratio so the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
tends towards the golden ratio so the
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.009
tends towards the golden ratio so the
silver ratio is slightly different so

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
silver ratio is slightly different so
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.900
silver ratio is slightly different so
you start off at the same point zero and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
you start off at the same point zero and
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.210
you start off at the same point zero and
one you double this and you add that

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
one you double this and you add that
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.330
one you double this and you add that
gives you two double this and add that

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
gives you two double this and add that
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.670
gives you two double this and add that
so that's now four plus one is five

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
so that's now four plus one is five
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.120
so that's now four plus one is five
double this and add that so that's 12

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
double this and add that so that's 12
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.370
double this and add that so that's 12
double this and add that that's gonna

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
double this and add that that's gonna
 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.440
double this and add that that's gonna
give me 29 and I carry on like that with

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
give me 29 and I carry on like that with
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.880
give me 29 and I carry on like that with
that pattern if I want to write down

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890
that pattern if I want to write down
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.650
that pattern if I want to write down
what that pan is it's like this if he

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
what that pan is it's like this if he
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.020
what that pan is it's like this if he
and is 2 P n minus 1 plus P n minus 2 so

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030
and is 2 P n minus 1 plus P n minus 2 so
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.759
and is 2 P n minus 1 plus P n minus 2 so
in other words I take the 1 before I

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
in other words I take the 1 before I
 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.770
in other words I take the 1 before I
double it and then I add the one before

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780
double it and then I add the one before
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.759
double it and then I add the one before
that you can see this ratio between

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769
that you can see this ratio between
 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.050
that you can see this ratio between
consecutive ones will tend to the silver

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
consecutive ones will tend to the silver
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.759
consecutive ones will tend to the silver
ratio so you do it the same way as you

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769
ratio so you do it the same way as you
 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.680
ratio so you do it the same way as you
derive the golden ratio so I just take

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690
derive the golden ratio so I just take
 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.509
derive the golden ratio so I just take
this expression here and I divide

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519
this expression here and I divide
 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.210
this expression here and I divide
through by PN minus 1 so that gives me P

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
through by PN minus 1 so that gives me P
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.039
through by PN minus 1 so that gives me P
n divided by PN minus 1 is 2 plus P and

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
n divided by PN minus 1 is 2 plus P and
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.690
n divided by PN minus 1 is 2 plus P and
minus 2 over e n minus 1 so at large n

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
minus 2 over e n minus 1 so at large n
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.400
minus 2 over e n minus 1 so at large n
this ratio becomes what I'm going to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
this ratio becomes what I'm going to
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.590
this ratio becomes what I'm going to
call Delta R s this is 2

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600
call Delta R s this is 2
 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.630
call Delta R s this is 2
this is 1 over the ratio that's 1 over

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640
this is 1 over the ratio that's 1 over
 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.310
this is 1 over the ratio that's 1 over
Delta s and if you solve that equation

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
Delta s and if you solve that equation
 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.360
Delta s and if you solve that equation
you get root 2 plus 1 okay so that's the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370
you get root 2 plus 1 okay so that's the
 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.950
you get root 2 plus 1 okay so that's the
silver ratio so there is an entire

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960
silver ratio so there is an entire
 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.540
silver ratio so there is an entire
family of these guys and they're called

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550
family of these guys and they're called
 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.550
family of these guys and they're called
the metallic creatures this is the pal

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560
the metallic creatures this is the pal
 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.290
the metallic creatures this is the pal
sequence actually there's some fun facts

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300
sequence actually there's some fun facts
 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.910
sequence actually there's some fun facts
about this if the pail number is prime

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920
about this if the pail number is prime
 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.880
about this if the pail number is prime
its index is prime okay like it's

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890
its index is prime okay like it's
 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.830
its index is prime okay like it's
positioned yeah yeah exactly its

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840
positioned yeah yeah exactly its
 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.370
positioned yeah yeah exactly its
position is prime we'll call this p2

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
position is prime we'll call this p2
 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.980
position is prime we'll call this p2
okay so this is the second pair number

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990
okay so this is the second pair number
 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.140
okay so this is the second pair number
not count in zero we'll call this one p3

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
not count in zero we'll call this one p3
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.300
not count in zero we'll call this one p3
okay so you can see that this is a prime

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310
okay so you can see that this is a prime
 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.640
okay so you can see that this is a prime
and this is prime this is prime and this

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650
and this is prime this is prime and this
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.770
and this is prime this is prime and this
is pro this one here is also a prime

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780
is pro this one here is also a prime
 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.320
is pro this one here is also a prime
number and yet surprise surprise it's

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330
number and yet surprise surprise it's
 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.510
number and yet surprise surprise it's
the fifth power number which is also

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
the fifth power number which is also
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.310
the fifth power number which is also
prone so has this called property that

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320
prone so has this called property that
 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.760
prone so has this called property that
if the pal number is prime its index is

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
if the pal number is prime its index is
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.710
if the pal number is prime its index is
prime the other weird property of this

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720
prime the other weird property of this
 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.350
prime the other weird property of this
sequence is it contains very few powers

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
sequence is it contains very few powers
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.450
sequence is it contains very few powers
of anything so but by that I mean you

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460
of anything so but by that I mean you
 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.180
of anything so but by that I mean you
know does it contain squares or cubes or

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190
know does it contain squares or cubes or
 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.550
know does it contain squares or cubes or
fourth powers well very few actually the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560
fourth powers well very few actually the
 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320
fourth powers well very few actually the
only ones it contains in the sequence

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330
only ones it contains in the sequence
 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.440
only ones it contains in the sequence
are 0 1 Java C power 169 is in there

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450
are 0 1 Java C power 169 is in there
 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.470
are 0 1 Java C power 169 is in there
okay which is obviously 13 squared there

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480
okay which is obviously 13 squared there
 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.420
okay which is obviously 13 squared there
we know others there are no fourth

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430
we know others there are no fourth
 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.010
we know others there are no fourth
powers there are no other squares there

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
powers there are no other squares there
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.350
powers there are no other squares there
are no other 26th powers not fit that's

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360
are no other 26th powers not fit that's
 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.740
are no other 26th powers not fit that's
it

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
it
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.450
it
this PAL sequence gives you the silver

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
this PAL sequence gives you the silver
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.330
this PAL sequence gives you the silver
ratio there are of course

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340
ratio there are of course
 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.740
ratio there are of course
generalizations of this that give you

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750
generalizations of this that give you
 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.140
generalizations of this that give you
the other metallic ratio so you've got

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
the other metallic ratio so you've got
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.850
the other metallic ratio so you've got
the three Bonacci sequence it's 0 1 3 10

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860
the three Bonacci sequence it's 0 1 3 10
 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.440
the three Bonacci sequence it's 0 1 3 10
30 309 you got starts off with these two

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450
30 309 you got starts off with these two
 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.450
30 309 you got starts off with these two
you take this one multiply it by 3 and

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460
you take this one multiply it by 3 and
 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.270
you take this one multiply it by 3 and
add this take this one multiply it by 3

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280
add this take this one multiply it by 3
 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.940
add this take this one multiply it by 3
and add this take this one multiply it

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950
and add this take this one multiply it
 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.610
and add this take this one multiply it
by 3 and add this right and you go on

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620
by 3 and add this right and you go on
 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.150
by 3 and add this right and you go on
like that

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160
like that
 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.640
like that
so this is the Fibonacci sequence

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650
so this is the Fibonacci sequence
 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.290
so this is the Fibonacci sequence
multiplying by 1 and adding the 1 yes

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300
multiplying by 1 and adding the 1 yes
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.270
multiplying by 1 and adding the 1 yes
yes and all the other metallic ratios

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280
yes and all the other metallic ratios
 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.760
yes and all the other metallic ratios
come from multiplying by a different

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770
come from multiplying by a different
 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.160
come from multiplying by a different
number I thought it seemed arbitrary but

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170
number I thought it seemed arbitrary but
 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.510
number I thought it seemed arbitrary but
I hadn't thought of the Fibonacci

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520
I hadn't thought of the Fibonacci
 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.970
I hadn't thought of the Fibonacci
sequence as fitting this but it does fit

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980
sequence as fitting this but it does fit
 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.280
sequence as fitting this but it does fit
yeah absolutely absolutely so in general

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290
yeah absolutely absolutely so in general
 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.110
yeah absolutely absolutely so in general
you can think about sort of n Bonacci

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
you can think about sort of n Bonacci
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.080
you can think about sort of n Bonacci
sequence which would have the rule PN is

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090
sequence which would have the rule PN is
 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.420
sequence which would have the rule PN is
n PN minus 1 plus PN minus 2 so you take

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430
n PN minus 1 plus PN minus 2 so you take
 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.400
n PN minus 1 plus PN minus 2 so you take
one of the numbers you multiply it by n

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410
one of the numbers you multiply it by n
 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.999
one of the numbers you multiply it by n
you add

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009
you add
 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.679
you add
one before that gives you your new

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689
one before that gives you your new
 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:43.999
one before that gives you your new
number so this one give you the bronze

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009
number so this one give you the bronze
 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.489
number so this one give you the bronze
ratio n equals four n equals five they

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499
ratio n equals four n equals five they
 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.439
ratio n equals four n equals five they
don't have to really have names so I

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449
don't have to really have names so I
 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.749
don't have to really have names so I
think some people call it copper nickel

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759
think some people call it copper nickel
 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.399
think some people call it copper nickel
but I think we're free to call them what

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409
but I think we're free to call them what
 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.010
but I think we're free to call them what
we like actually so the bronze ratio

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020
we like actually so the bronze ratio
 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.929
we like actually so the bronze ratio
which we'll call Delta P we limited the

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939
which we'll call Delta P we limited the
 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.010
which we'll call Delta P we limited the
ratio of these terms

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020
ratio of these terms
 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.629
ratio of these terms
that's three plus root 13 / - okay all

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639
that's three plus root 13 / - okay all
 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.799
that's three plus root 13 / - okay all
right which is roughly three point six

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809
right which is roughly three point six
 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.969
right which is roughly three point six
yeah but they're not right because you

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979
yeah but they're not right because you
 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.320
yeah but they're not right because you
can think about what you get from the

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330
can think about what you get from the
 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.739
can think about what you get from the
nth one

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:09.749
nth one
 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:12.439
nth one
okay the nth one the ratio that you

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449
okay the nth one the ratio that you
 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:13.790
okay the nth one the ratio that you
would associate with that I'll call it

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800
would associate with that I'll call it
 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.179
would associate with that I'll call it
Delta N and that is n plus the square

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:17.189
Delta N and that is n plus the square
 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:20.779
Delta N and that is n plus the square
root of n squared plus four over two and

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:20.789
root of n squared plus four over two and
 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.670
root of n squared plus four over two and
you get that just by applying the same

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680
you get that just by applying the same
 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.019
you get that just by applying the same
method as we did for the silver ratio

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:24.029
method as we did for the silver ratio
 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:25.820
method as we did for the silver ratio
here everything you think about the

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830
here everything you think about the
 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.170
here everything you think about the
golden ratio will generally have an

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180
golden ratio will generally have an
 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.760
golden ratio will generally have an
analogue here so you can talk about

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770
analogue here so you can talk about
 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.950
analogue here so you can talk about
golden rectangles you can talk about

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960
golden rectangles you can talk about
 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.110
golden rectangles you can talk about
silver rectangles bronze rectangles you

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120
silver rectangles bronze rectangles you
 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.519
silver rectangles bronze rectangles you
can talk about golden spirals you can

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
can talk about golden spirals you can
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.649
can talk about golden spirals you can
talk about silver spirals bronze spirals

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659
talk about silver spirals bronze spirals
 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.350
talk about silver spirals bronze spirals
so you know so what are their properties

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360
so you know so what are their properties
 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.879
so you know so what are their properties
okay so it probably needs some more

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889
okay so it probably needs some more
 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.699
okay so it probably needs some more
favor so the golden rectangle is the

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:43.709
favor so the golden rectangle is the
 

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:46.070
favor so the golden rectangle is the
follow so you take a rectangle okay and

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080
follow so you take a rectangle okay and
 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.110
follow so you take a rectangle okay and
its sides have the ratio of the golden

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120
its sides have the ratio of the golden
 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.820
its sides have the ratio of the golden
ratio so if this one's got length one

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:49.830
ratio so if this one's got length one
 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.459
ratio so if this one's got length one
this one will have length the golden

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:52.469
this one will have length the golden
 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:56.570
this one will have length the golden
ratio which is one plus root 5 over 2

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580
ratio which is one plus root 5 over 2
 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.049
ratio which is one plus root 5 over 2
right I really suspect it's not even a

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:00.059
right I really suspect it's not even a
 

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:03.589
right I really suspect it's not even a
rectangle look at the stage if this were

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599
rectangle look at the stage if this were
 

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.299
rectangle look at the stage if this were
really a golden rectangle what property

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:05.309
really a golden rectangle what property
 

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:06.949
really a golden rectangle what property
would it have if I remove the largest

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:06.959
would it have if I remove the largest
 

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.409
would it have if I remove the largest
square then what's left over would be

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419
square then what's left over would be
 

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.139
square then what's left over would be
another golden rectangle basically 1

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:12.149
another golden rectangle basically 1
 

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:14.920
another golden rectangle basically 1
over 5 minus 1 is actually equal to

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:14.930
over 5 minus 1 is actually equal to
 

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.269
over 5 minus 1 is actually equal to
what's the silver version of this we

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:17.279
what's the silver version of this we
 

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.790
what's the silver version of this we
draw a rectangle whose sides have ratio

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800
draw a rectangle whose sides have ratio
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.920
draw a rectangle whose sides have ratio
given by the silver a ship removed two

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:21.930
given by the silver a ship removed two
 

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.290
given by the silver a ship removed two
large squares both of side 1 and what we

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.300
large squares both of side 1 and what we
 

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.540
large squares both of side 1 and what we
have left over is going to be another

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.550
have left over is going to be another
 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.639
have left over is going to be another
silver rectangle if you did it with the

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:28.649
silver rectangle if you did it with the
 

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:30.079
silver rectangle if you did it with the
rectangular whose sides we're in the

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:30.089
rectangular whose sides we're in the
 

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:32.930
rectangular whose sides we're in the
bronze ratio you'd have to remove three

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940
bronze ratio you'd have to remove three
 

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.699
bronze ratio you'd have to remove three
and then you'd get one leftover which

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:34.709
and then you'd get one leftover which
 

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:36.860
and then you'd get one leftover which
was another bronze rectangle in England

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:36.870
was another bronze rectangle in England
 

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.649
was another bronze rectangle in England
of course we have a four paper now you

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659
of course we have a four paper now you
 

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.240
of course we have a four paper now you
may know something about a4 paper that

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.250
may know something about a4 paper that
 

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.339
may know something about a4 paper that
the ratio between the lengths of the

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:43.349
the ratio between the lengths of the
 

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:46.759
the ratio between the lengths of the
sides is root 2 if this is 1 this would

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:46.769
sides is root 2 if this is 1 this would
 

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:48.470
sides is root 2 if this is 1 this would
be root 2 this is another kind of

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480
be root 2 this is another kind of
 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.850
be root 2 this is another kind of
rectangle actually another kind of

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860
rectangle actually another kind of
 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.800
rectangle actually another kind of
interesting one it's not just a 4 this

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:51.810
interesting one it's not just a 4 this
 

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.960
interesting one it's not just a 4 this
is sometimes also called

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:53.970
is sometimes also called
 

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.960
is sometimes also called
a silver rectangle but it's not our

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:56.970
a silver rectangle but it's not our
 

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.579
a silver rectangle but it's not our
silver rectangle so we're not going to

00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:58.589
silver rectangle so we're not going to
 

00:08:58.589 --> 00:08:59.809
silver rectangle so we're not going to
call it silver rectum because some

00:08:59.809 --> 00:08:59.819
call it silver rectum because some
 

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:02.150
call it silver rectum because some
people would call a route to the silver

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160
people would call a route to the silver
 

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.429
people would call a route to the silver
ratio actually we're going to call it

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:04.439
ratio actually we're going to call it
 

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.439
ratio actually we're going to call it
the Japanese ratio because it is big in

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:06.449
the Japanese ratio because it is big in
 

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:08.360
the Japanese ratio because it is big in
Japan this ratio this would this route

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.370
Japan this ratio this would this route
 

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.819
Japan this ratio this would this route
to and these what I'm going to call a

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:10.829
to and these what I'm going to call a
 

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:12.679
to and these what I'm going to call a
Japanese rectangle you know lots of

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:12.689
Japanese rectangle you know lots of
 

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:14.509
Japanese rectangle you know lots of
Japanese architecture uses this

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519
Japanese architecture uses this
 

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.579
Japanese architecture uses this
particular ratio and these particular

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:16.589
particular ratio and these particular
 

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.740
particular ratio and these particular
rectangles you also see in Roman altars

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.750
rectangles you also see in Roman altars
 

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.059
rectangles you also see in Roman altars
all these sorts of things but we're

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:20.069
all these sorts of things but we're
 

00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:22.069
all these sorts of things but we're
interested in the real silver ratio so

00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079
interested in the real silver ratio so
 

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:23.210
interested in the real silver ratio so
how would you create it from this guy

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220
how would you create it from this guy
 

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.490
how would you create it from this guy
you would just remove the largest square

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500
you would just remove the largest square
 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.530
you would just remove the largest square
kind of a provillus feels like origami

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540
kind of a provillus feels like origami
 

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.389
kind of a provillus feels like origami
and you know talk about a Japanese

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399
and you know talk about a Japanese
 

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.360
and you know talk about a Japanese
rectangle so this would be the largest

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.370
rectangle so this would be the largest
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.030
rectangle so this would be the largest
square here and if I remove it I'm gonna

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040
square here and if I remove it I'm gonna
 

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.199
square here and if I remove it I'm gonna
do it quite crudely I would set this

00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:41.209
 

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:46.579
this is a silver rectangle yeah April

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:46.589
this is a silver rectangle yeah April
 

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:47.929
this is a silver rectangle yeah April
paper is wrong in America you have to be

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:47.939
paper is wrong in America you have to be
 

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:49.490
paper is wrong in America you have to be
in England for this to work well some

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500
in England for this to work well some
 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.290
in England for this to work well some
other places that have a4 paper but

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300
other places that have a4 paper but
 

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.360
other places that have a4 paper but
definitely this can work in England not

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.370
definitely this can work in England not
 

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.920
definitely this can work in England not
necessarily in America so this is a

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:54.930
necessarily in America so this is a
 

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.420
necessarily in America so this is a
silver rectangle now if I start removing

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:56.430
silver rectangle now if I start removing
 

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.040
silver rectangle now if I start removing
two larger squares from this I'll get

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.050
two larger squares from this I'll get
 

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.970
two larger squares from this I'll get
all the silver rectangles

00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980
all the silver rectangles
 

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.740
all the silver rectangles
ever-decreasing so those are the

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:00.750
ever-decreasing so those are the
 

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.059
ever-decreasing so those are the
rectangles that you can have and is

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:02.069
rectangles that you can have and is
 

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:03.290
rectangles that you can have and is
again there's a whole family of them

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300
again there's a whole family of them
 

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.090
again there's a whole family of them
that you can talk about but more

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100
that you can talk about but more
 

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.530
that you can talk about but more
interesting than the rectangles of

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540
interesting than the rectangles of
 

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.290
interesting than the rectangles of
course and the spirals

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:08.300
course and the spirals
 

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.090
course and the spirals
okay now the spirals are great because

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100
okay now the spirals are great because
 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.499
okay now the spirals are great because
they're the spirals are the things that

00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:12.509
they're the spirals are the things that
 

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:14.600
they're the spirals are the things that
everybody says appear everywhere now

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.610
everybody says appear everywhere now
 

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.519
everybody says appear everywhere now
people normally say oh the golden ratio

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:16.529
people normally say oh the golden ratio
 

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:18.019
people normally say oh the golden ratio
is everywhere isn't it it's everywhere

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:18.029
is everywhere isn't it it's everywhere
 

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:19.850
is everywhere isn't it it's everywhere
because they're talking there about the

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860
because they're talking there about the
 

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.369
because they're talking there about the
spirals but it's not really the golden

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:22.379
spirals but it's not really the golden
 

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:24.379
spirals but it's not really the golden
spiral that's appearing everywhere it's

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:24.389
spiral that's appearing everywhere it's
 

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:26.660
spiral that's appearing everywhere it's
all these other ones we starts off with

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:26.670
all these other ones we starts off with
 

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.210
all these other ones we starts off with
a square and we draw the circle that

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220
a square and we draw the circle that
 

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.579
a square and we draw the circle that
goes between there and there now we

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:31.589
goes between there and there now we
 

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.280
goes between there and there now we
create another square which is a factor

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.290
create another square which is a factor
 

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.259
create another square which is a factor
smaller by that ratio we're interested

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:36.269
smaller by that ratio we're interested
 

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:37.970
smaller by that ratio we're interested
in so we decrease it by a factor of

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980
in so we decrease it by a factor of
 

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.799
in so we decrease it by a factor of
Delta okay where Delta's out of the

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:39.809
Delta okay where Delta's out of the
 

00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:42.019
Delta okay where Delta's out of the
golden ratio or the silver ratio or the

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:42.029
golden ratio or the silver ratio or the
 

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:43.249
golden ratio or the silver ratio or the
bronze ratio whichever one you're

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:43.259
bronze ratio whichever one you're
 

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:45.710
bronze ratio whichever one you're
interested in and we continue our circle

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720
interested in and we continue our circle
 

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.499
interested in and we continue our circle
but now we create another square but we

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:48.509
but now we create another square but we
 

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:51.199
but now we create another square but we
drop by the ratio again and we continue

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:51.209
drop by the ratio again and we continue
 

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:53.299
drop by the ratio again and we continue
our curve around and then we go on again

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:53.309
our curve around and then we go on again
 

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:55.730
our curve around and then we go on again
it's gonna have 1 over delta cubed but

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740
it's gonna have 1 over delta cubed but
 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.319
it's gonna have 1 over delta cubed but
let me go around like this and we create

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:57.329
let me go around like this and we create
 

00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:59.780
let me go around like this and we create
a spiral if this was the golden ratio

00:10:59.780 --> 00:10:59.790
a spiral if this was the golden ratio
 

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.939
a spiral if this was the golden ratio
this would be a golden spiral if this

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:01.949
this would be a golden spiral if this
 

00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:03.169
this would be a golden spiral if this
was the silver ratio it's a silver

00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:03.179
was the silver ratio it's a silver
 

00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:04.819
was the silver ratio it's a silver
spiral if it's a bronze bronze ratio

00:11:04.819 --> 00:11:04.829
spiral if it's a bronze bronze ratio
 

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.590
spiral if it's a bronze bronze ratio
it's a bronze power brother

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600
it's a bronze power brother
 

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.480
it's a bronze power brother
these are all a family of spirals which

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:08.490
these are all a family of spirals which
 

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.309
these are all a family of spirals which
are called logarithmic spirals so what

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:10.319
are called logarithmic spirals so what
 

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:12.110
are called logarithmic spirals so what
is there a formula for these spirals so

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120
is there a formula for these spirals so
 

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.150
is there a formula for these spirals so
this particular one I can compare you

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160
this particular one I can compare you
 

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.410
this particular one I can compare you
know I can think of an angle the angle

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420
know I can think of an angle the angle
 

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.629
know I can think of an angle the angle
that I've gone round so I'm going round

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639
that I've gone round so I'm going round
 

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:20.150
that I've gone round so I'm going round
like this they've been changing angles I

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160
like this they've been changing angles I
 

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.790
like this they've been changing angles I
can ask how does the distance from the

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800
can ask how does the distance from the
 

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.920
can ask how does the distance from the
centre change so the distance from the

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:24.930
centre change so the distance from the
 

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.870
centre change so the distance from the
centre I'll call our well you can sort

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880
centre I'll call our well you can sort
 

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.160
centre I'll call our well you can sort
of see that if I if I were to go around

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.170
of see that if I if I were to go around
 

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.829
of see that if I if I were to go around
this way I gain a factor of Delta every

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839
this way I gain a factor of Delta every
 

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:32.600
this way I gain a factor of Delta every
time I go around a quarter turn so

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.610
time I go around a quarter turn so
 

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.490
time I go around a quarter turn so
actually it turns out that our will go

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500
actually it turns out that our will go
 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.689
actually it turns out that our will go
like Delta 2 over PI beta so 2 over PI

00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:38.699
like Delta 2 over PI beta so 2 over PI
 

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:41.269
like Delta 2 over PI beta so 2 over PI
of course is or PI over 2 is of course a

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279
of course is or PI over 2 is of course a
 

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:43.879
of course is or PI over 2 is of course a
quarter turn in radians ok so this is

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:43.889
quarter turn in radians ok so this is
 

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.309
quarter turn in radians ok so this is
the formula for this this spiral it was

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:46.319
the formula for this this spiral it was
 

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:48.110
the formula for this this spiral it was
PI over 2 I have you bought 2 and PI

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120
PI over 2 I have you bought 2 and PI
 

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.360
PI over 2 I have you bought 2 and PI
because I need to scale it by the better

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.370
because I need to scale it by the better
 

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.519
because I need to scale it by the better
number of radians okay and this is part

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:52.529
number of radians okay and this is part
 

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.259
number of radians okay and this is part
of a larger family the logarithmic

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:54.269
of a larger family the logarithmic
 

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:56.480
of a larger family the logarithmic
spirals which look like this ok so the

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.490
spirals which look like this ok so the
 

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.189
spirals which look like this ok so the
theta times the time Hey

00:11:58.189 --> 00:11:58.199
theta times the time Hey
 

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:00.740
theta times the time Hey
so what is P here P is called the pitch

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:00.750
so what is P here P is called the pitch
 

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.389
so what is P here P is called the pitch
of the particular spiral that you're

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399
of the particular spiral that you're
 

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.439
of the particular spiral that you're
interested in and that's very

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:03.449
interested in and that's very
 

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:04.550
interested in and that's very
characteristic of it

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560
characteristic of it
 

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.259
characteristic of it
imagine I'm coming along this spiral and

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:06.269
imagine I'm coming along this spiral and
 

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:08.329
imagine I'm coming along this spiral and
I'm going along this direction call that

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339
I'm going along this direction call that
 

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.579
I'm going along this direction call that
alpha and then I could draw a right

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:10.589
alpha and then I could draw a right
 

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:13.129
alpha and then I could draw a right
angle there and I'll call that P and

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:13.139
angle there and I'll call that P and
 

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.170
angle there and I'll call that P and
that's called the pitch of the spiral

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180
that's called the pitch of the spiral
 

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.540
that's called the pitch of the spiral
now each spiral has its own pitch okay

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:17.550
now each spiral has its own pitch okay
 

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.740
now each spiral has its own pitch okay
so we can write down what the pictures

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:18.750
so we can write down what the pictures
 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.030
so we can write down what the pictures
are for the different spirals that we're

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040
are for the different spirals that we're
 

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.889
are for the different spirals that we're
interested in so for the gold for the

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899
interested in so for the gold for the
 

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:22.759
interested in so for the gold for the
golden spiral

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:22.769
golden spiral
 

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:25.460
golden spiral
the pitch is actually you can show it's

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:25.470
the pitch is actually you can show it's
 

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.769
the pitch is actually you can show it's
about 17 degrees you can work out by

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779
about 17 degrees you can work out by
 

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:29.540
about 17 degrees you can work out by
comparing these two formally I'm just

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:29.550
comparing these two formally I'm just
 

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.009
comparing these two formally I'm just
comparing the two you put in the golden

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019
comparing the two you put in the golden
 

00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:32.809
comparing the two you put in the golden
ratio here you can extract what the

00:12:32.809 --> 00:12:32.819
ratio here you can extract what the
 

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:33.259
ratio here you can extract what the
pitch is

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:33.269
pitch is
 

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:35.780
pitch is
it works out it's about 17 degrees but a

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:35.790
it works out it's about 17 degrees but a
 

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.150
it works out it's about 17 degrees but a
silver it corresponds the pitch is about

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160
silver it corresponds the pitch is about
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.290
silver it corresponds the pitch is about
29 degrees for the bronze it's 37

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300
29 degrees for the bronze it's 37
 

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.110
29 degrees for the bronze it's 37
degrees so N equals 4 we get 42 degrees

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120
degrees so N equals 4 we get 42 degrees
 

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.679
degrees so N equals 4 we get 42 degrees
for N equals 5 we get 46 degrees n

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:48.689
for N equals 5 we get 46 degrees n
 

00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:52.100
for N equals 5 we get 46 degrees n
equals 6 49 degrees remember the

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.110
equals 6 49 degrees remember the
 

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.079
equals 6 49 degrees remember the
Japanese ratio which we said was root 2

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:54.089
Japanese ratio which we said was root 2
 

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:56.210
Japanese ratio which we said was root 2
that has a picture of about 12 degrees

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220
that has a picture of about 12 degrees
 

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.490
that has a picture of about 12 degrees
people always go on all the golden ratio

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500
people always go on all the golden ratio
 

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.319
people always go on all the golden ratio
it's appears everywhere in nature it

00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:00.329
it's appears everywhere in nature it
 

00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:02.480
it's appears everywhere in nature it
does appear in some places in nature but

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.490
does appear in some places in nature but
 

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.040
does appear in some places in nature but
when they're talking about spirals it's

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.050
when they're talking about spirals it's
 

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.720
when they're talking about spirals it's
actually these family of spirals that

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:05.730
actually these family of spirals that
 

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.850
actually these family of spirals that
appears for example sometimes you'll

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860
appears for example sometimes you'll
 

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.829
appears for example sometimes you'll
hear it said that the Milky Way sees the

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839
hear it said that the Milky Way sees the
 

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.079
hear it said that the Milky Way sees the
golden ratio okay through its spiral

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:12.089
golden ratio okay through its spiral
 

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:14.240
golden ratio okay through its spiral
it's not true it does indeed see a

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.250
it's not true it does indeed see a
 

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.980
it's not true it does indeed see a
logarithmic spiral with some average

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:15.990
logarithmic spiral with some average
 

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.250
logarithmic spiral with some average
pitch it's about 12 degrees so the milky

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260
pitch it's about 12 degrees so the milky
 

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.489
pitch it's about 12 degrees so the milky
way is not a goal

00:13:20.489 --> 00:13:20.499
way is not a goal
 

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.379
way is not a goal
and spiral it's much more like a

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:22.389
and spiral it's much more like a
 

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:24.089
and spiral it's much more like a
Japanese spiral actually there's another

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:24.099
Japanese spiral actually there's another
 

00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:26.009
Japanese spiral actually there's another
one that I quite like is that Hera groom

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:26.019
one that I quite like is that Hera groom
 

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.289
one that I quite like is that Hera groom
Falcons really i love program falcons

00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:28.299
Falcons really i love program falcons
 

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:30.689
Falcons really i love program falcons
are the fastest creature on the planet

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:30.699
are the fastest creature on the planet
 

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:33.479
are the fastest creature on the planet
you even get them in england right so

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:33.489
you even get them in england right so
 

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:34.829
you even get them in england right so
there's something cool and animal that

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839
there's something cool and animal that
 

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:36.509
there's something cool and animal that
we actually get in England it wins it

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519
we actually get in England it wins it
 

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:38.099
we actually get in England it wins it
Top Trumps as well you know presents the

Top Trumps as well you know presents the
 

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.839
Top Trumps as well you know presents the
top storms and my kids ago the program

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:39.849
top storms and my kids ago the program
 

00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:40.979
top storms and my kids ago the program
problems one in the winning one so I

00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:40.989
problems one in the winning one so I
 

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.539
problems one in the winning one so I
love a peregrine falcon the peregrine

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:42.549
love a peregrine falcon the peregrine
 

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:44.099
love a peregrine falcon the peregrine
falcon knows about these ratios as well

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:44.109
falcon knows about these ratios as well
 

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:45.899
falcon knows about these ratios as well
right imagine you're a peregrine falcon

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:45.909
right imagine you're a peregrine falcon
 

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.009
right imagine you're a peregrine falcon
you're flying around

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:47.019
you're flying around
 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:48.389
you're flying around
here's your prey it's sitting here at

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399
here's your prey it's sitting here at
 

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.739
here's your prey it's sitting here at
the center now you want to keep your

00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:49.749
the center now you want to keep your
 

00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:51.659
the center now you want to keep your
eyes on the prey but you can't move your

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:51.669
eyes on the prey but you can't move your
 

00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:53.369
eyes on the prey but you can't move your
eyes you don't wanna start moving your

00:13:53.369 --> 00:13:53.379
eyes you don't wanna start moving your
 

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:55.739
eyes you don't wanna start moving your
head around right so yeah that stays in

00:13:55.739 --> 00:13:55.749
head around right so yeah that stays in
 

00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:57.929
head around right so yeah that stays in
a fixed position so you have to keep a

00:13:57.929 --> 00:13:57.939
a fixed position so you have to keep a
 

00:13:57.939 --> 00:14:00.389
a fixed position so you have to keep a
fixed angle relative to the prey so that

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399
fixed angle relative to the prey so that
 

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:02.699
fixed angle relative to the prey so that
necessarily means you have to follow one

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:02.709
necessarily means you have to follow one
 

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.529
necessarily means you have to follow one
of these logarithmic spirals the angler

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:04.539
of these logarithmic spirals the angler
 

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:06.469
of these logarithmic spirals the angler
has to look at is actually 40 degrees

00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:06.479
has to look at is actually 40 degrees
 

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:10.439
has to look at is actually 40 degrees
which means the pitch of the spiral is

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:10.449
which means the pitch of the spiral is
 

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.619
which means the pitch of the spiral is
about 50 degrees which is what almost

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:13.629
about 50 degrees which is what almost
 

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:15.659
about 50 degrees which is what almost
one of our metallic spirals the I'm

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:15.669
one of our metallic spirals the I'm
 

00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.009
one of our metallic spirals the I'm
going to call it the N equals six one so

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:17.019
going to call it the N equals six one so
 

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:18.299
going to call it the N equals six one so
I mean I don't know what this is right

00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:18.309
I mean I don't know what this is right
 

00:14:18.309 --> 00:14:20.369
I mean I don't know what this is right
so we've got gold silver bronze copper

00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:20.379
so we've got gold silver bronze copper
 

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:23.249
so we've got gold silver bronze copper
nickel aluminum value eight so it's

00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:23.259
nickel aluminum value eight so it's
 

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.809
nickel aluminum value eight so it's
there right it's pretty much there I

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:24.819
there right it's pretty much there I
 

00:14:24.819 --> 00:14:26.489
there right it's pretty much there I
mean it's a good approximation right so

00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:26.499
mean it's a good approximation right so
 

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.379
mean it's a good approximation right so
people talk about seashells that they

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:28.389
people talk about seashells that they
 

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:30.899
people talk about seashells that they
see the Golden Spiral they don't really

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:30.909
see the Golden Spiral they don't really
 

00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:32.639
see the Golden Spiral they don't really
they see a whole all possible pictures

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:32.649
they see a whole all possible pictures
 

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:33.449
they see a whole all possible pictures
though what they're seeing these

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:33.459
though what they're seeing these
 

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:35.099
though what they're seeing these
logarithmic spirals and it's a good

00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:35.109
logarithmic spirals and it's a good
 

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:37.589
logarithmic spirals and it's a good
reason why why for example seashells see

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:37.599
reason why why for example seashells see
 

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:39.659
reason why why for example seashells see
these these log spirals they have a very

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:39.669
these these log spirals they have a very
 

00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:41.639
these these log spirals they have a very
nice property all of them all of them

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:41.649
nice property all of them all of them
 

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:43.319
nice property all of them all of them
the golden one the silver one all of

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:43.329
the golden one the silver one all of
 

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:44.729
the golden one the silver one all of
them they kind of have what's called a

00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:44.739
them they kind of have what's called a
 

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:46.469
them they kind of have what's called a
self-similar property so you go round

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:46.479
self-similar property so you go round
 

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:48.779
self-similar property so you go round
and then you go round again and when you

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:48.789
and then you go round again and when you
 

00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.669
and then you go round again and when you
go round again you're basically seeing a

00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:50.679
go round again you're basically seeing a
 

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:52.799
go round again you're basically seeing a
scaled-down version of exactly the same

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:52.809
scaled-down version of exactly the same
 

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.139
scaled-down version of exactly the same
thing and you keep seeing that as you go

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:55.149
thing and you keep seeing that as you go
 

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:57.210
thing and you keep seeing that as you go
round and round and round and when you

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:57.220
round and round and round and when you
 

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.159
round and round and round and when you
think about growth in a biological

00:14:59.159 --> 00:14:59.169
think about growth in a biological
 

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:01.199
think about growth in a biological
system that allows you to grow very

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:01.209
system that allows you to grow very
 

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:02.759
system that allows you to grow very
efficiently if you follow that pattern

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:02.769
efficiently if you follow that pattern
 

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.009
efficiently if you follow that pattern
of which is repeated repetition

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:05.019
of which is repeated repetition
 

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:07.469
of which is repeated repetition
repetition repetition you also see these

00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:07.479
repetition repetition you also see these
 

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:09.869
repetition repetition you also see these
log spirals a lot in architecture and in

00:15:09.869 --> 00:15:09.879
log spirals a lot in architecture and in
 

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:11.669
log spirals a lot in architecture and in
art again there's probably a good reason

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:11.679
art again there's probably a good reason
 

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.989
art again there's probably a good reason
for that it's related to this self

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:12.999
for that it's related to this self
 

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:14.699
for that it's related to this self
similar property so basically when you

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:14.709
similar property so basically when you
 

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:16.499
similar property so basically when you
look at something you know your eye

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:16.509
look at something you know your eye
 

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:18.479
look at something you know your eye
performs visualizations on lots of

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:18.489
performs visualizations on lots of
 

00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:20.009
performs visualizations on lots of
different scales and then correlates

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:20.019
different scales and then correlates
 

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.959
different scales and then correlates
them when you look at this and you look

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:21.969
them when you look at this and you look
 

00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:23.849
them when you look at this and you look
at it lots of different scales you're

00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:23.859
at it lots of different scales you're
 

00:15:23.859 --> 00:15:26.429
at it lots of different scales you're
seeing the same thing and so that maybe

00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:26.439
seeing the same thing and so that maybe
 

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:27.809
seeing the same thing and so that maybe
there's some sense in which that that's

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:27.819
there's some sense in which that that's
 

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:29.939
there's some sense in which that that's
good because we're correlating a lot of

00:15:29.939 --> 00:15:29.949
good because we're correlating a lot of
 

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:31.289
good because we're correlating a lot of
the same thing on a lot of different

00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:31.299
the same thing on a lot of different
 

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:32.990
the same thing on a lot of different
scales reducing

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000
scales reducing
 

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.180
scales reducing
exactly and somehow we like that so this

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.190
exactly and somehow we like that so this
 

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.060
exactly and somehow we like that so this
is why this files appear did you know

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.070
is why this files appear did you know
 

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.800
is why this files appear did you know
