00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.628
We have negative 5x cubed times y squared, squared. So I should write this

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:09.217
twice. Now that I have a product of factors, I can regroup the basis that are

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:13.794
alike. So I have two negative 5, two x cubes, and two y squared's multiplied

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:18.423
together. That would have been the same if I would just distributed the square

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.902
to each of the terms. I would have had two negative 5, two x cubes, and two y

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:29.097
squared. Now that I'm here, I can multiply my numbers together, and my bases

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:35.417
together. Negative 5 times negative 5 is positive 25 times 2 is 50. For the base

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:41.277
of x, I simply add the exponents together, 3 plus 3 makes 6 and 7 makes 13. The

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:45.977
y's are a little bit easier, so I just have y to the 4th. All together I have 50

00:00:45.977 --> 00:00:50.144
times x to the 13th times x to the 4th. If you reasoned your way somewhat

00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:54.457
through that or got any of these exponents right, great job. If you got this

00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:58.288
right on your first try, that's even more impressive, great work.
