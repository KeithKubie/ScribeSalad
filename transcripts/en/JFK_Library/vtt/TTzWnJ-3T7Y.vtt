00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.630
- I live near Mikie Sherrill's district

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.100
and you would go to these events

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.180
and I would see these mothers I knew

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.450
from my school district.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.260
And they were out there running
Mikie Sherrill's campaign.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.330
I mean it really wasn't
just the women running,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.100
it was the women running their campaigns.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.560
Whether they were campaign
managers or volunteers.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.290
This was really a surge
of women that we started,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.280
you know we saw initially
with the women's marches

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.113
and it just kept going.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:23.750
And I was one who thought
about the women's marches,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.780
oh you know will this energy
really sustain itself?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.760
And it did.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.270
- You know, it's interesting
you say that because

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.940
I remember those women's marches

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.680
and being on the top of the roof

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.910
and watching the parade
go down the street.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.420
And then watching the women's marches,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.205
that whole weekend in Washington DC,

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.077
it was really supposed to
be Donald Trump's weekend

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:43.437
and it wasn't Donald Trump's weekend.

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.380
And my thought was, exactly as yours,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.700
it's great that you all came
down here and they you marched

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.650
and you feel good about yourself.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.721
But are you going to show up

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.970
when it matters to knock on doors.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.460
And just to add to what
everyone's saying here

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.600
that this will be the first Congress

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.890
with more than 100 women
who will be serving.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.752
Which is a record.

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:00.585
(applauding)

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:01.910
- It's a lot, and something like.
