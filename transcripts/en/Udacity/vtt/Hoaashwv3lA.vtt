00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
If you draw a vertical line on the same coordinate plan as a function, and the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.203
functions curve should only intersect that line 1 or fewer times. Let's pretend

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:13.557
for a second that this pencil is a vertical line. Now saying that a functions

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:18.045
curve should intersect this vertical line 1 or fewer times, is exactly the same

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.244
as saying that each x value should have only 1 y value associated with it.

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:26.798
Remember, just like line A over here, and like this pencil now any vertical line

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:31.172
has an equation that can be written in the form, X equals some number. 4 in the

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:35.354
case of line A right here. This means that every single point along this line

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:39.681
will have the same x coordinate. It also means that if another curve intersects

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:43.581
a vertical line at more than spot, and there's more than one point on that

00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.542
curve, that has the x coordinate of the vertical line. So even if we drew

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:52.005
something like this. A little bit messy but you get the picture. This blue curve

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.257
is not a function. Why is it not a function? Because if we move our pencil to,

00:00:56.257 --> 00:01:00.283
actually a tiny different positions along the x axis, this curve would cross to

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:04.084
the pencil in more than one spot. That means that for a given input, a given x

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.867
coordinate, you might either end up with one y coordinate, or a different y

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:12.035
coordinate. So vertical lines and other functions that don't pass this test over

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:15.769
here, don't work the same way that the candy machine does. If we had a candy

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:19.609
machine that worked like this, for multiple values of amount of money you put

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.305
in, you could end up with different amounts of candy.
