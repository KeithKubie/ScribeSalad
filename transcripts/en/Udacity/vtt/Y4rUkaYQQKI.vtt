00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.180
To create this new plot, we really just need to

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.530
switch out gender with our year_joined.bucket variable. This is the new

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.740
categorical variable that will take the place of color. Now, I'm

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.860
also using year_joined.bucket here so that way, I can exclude the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.630
two people who have values of NA. I'll clean up

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.650
my code just a little bit, and then I'll run it

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.580
to create my plot. And now, here's the plot that examines

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220
the relationship between friend_count and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.050
age, split up by year_joined.bucket variable.
