(male announcer)
Today on <i>Judge Jessie,</i>

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.505
Judge Jessie turns up the heat.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.039
You signed a piece of paper.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.341
He gave you the snake.

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.642
Then you bring a snake

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.378
into the home
with two small Chihuahuas.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.846
I had not been made aware

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.515
that the snake
would get rid of its skin,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.150
and then the sprinklers
came down with the snakeskin,

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.485
ruined my carpet.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.953
(Jessie)
What--what set off
the sprinklers?

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.523
Unrelated popcorn fire,
Your Honor.

Coming up on <i>Judge Jessie...</i>

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.698 line:0%
 
Mr. Simmons, before you speak,
I know from experience

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.667 line:0%
 
that the police have completely
mishandled your case,

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.068 line:0%
 
and there is legal precedent
for you to win,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.970 line:0%
 
and any good defense attorney
would have told you that.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.506
I also know that obviously the
place where you hurt your back

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.374
wasn't structurally
up to code, Mr. Oyama.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.542
And furthermore,
as a sensei,

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.244
you should know a man
of his skill set

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:18.245
cannot do a Mike Yaki.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.446
You should know that.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.848
Obviously, I can tell
by looking at your alignment

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:24.151
that you've herniated a disc
someplace in your L4 or your L5.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.886
I'm finding for the plaintiff
not $2,500,

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:28.488
$2,700, Mr. Oyama.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.489
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.525
You're quite welcome.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.897
