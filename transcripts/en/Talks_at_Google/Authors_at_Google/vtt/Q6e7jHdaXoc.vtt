CHRIS DIBONA: Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.138
My name's Chris DiBona.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.870
I help out Cliff sometimes with
the Authors at Google Program.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.670
So today we have
John Scalzi here

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.640
to talk to us about
"Lock In" book things.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.619
JOHN SCALZI: Yeah, book
things, book things.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160
CHRIS DIBONA: Next week, we have
some really terrific guests,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.569
too, but this week is John.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:21.360
JOHN SCALZI: Right.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.026
CHRIS DIBONA: So

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.440
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.330
JOHN SCALZI: I'm here
all week, try the veal.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.480
CHRIS DIBONA: Try the veal.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.980
You might remember
John for his time

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
as an AOL employee--
writing for an AOL sub-site.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.560
Which one was it?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
JOHN SCALZI: A little
humor area called "howdy."

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.710
CHRIS DIBONA: Slash, howdy?

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.380
JOHN SCALZI: Yeah, actually,
you would click on the triangle

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.770
when you signed into AOL at
your lightning fast 28k VOD.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.600
Yeah.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.910
And you click on that
and it would pop up

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.204
a cartoon or an essay
or something like that.

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:51.120
CHRIS DIBONA: So the
interface-- the gateway--

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.210
was like a triangle.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.920
JOHN SCALZI: Yeah, the
gateway was a triangle.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.480
CHRIS DIBONA: And everyone knew
that the triangle meant funny.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.250
JOHN SCALZI: Right, that's
exactly how it worked.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.040
CHRIS DIBONA: This is
how the internet was

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.781
before the internet,
just for the record.

00:00:58.781 --> 00:00:59.780
JOHN SCALZI: Good times.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.345
Good times.

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.470
CHRIS DIBONA: You didn't
have your own go link on--

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.150
JOHN SCALZI: Well, no, I did.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.650
I did.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.767
You "Go Scalzi."

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.850
CHRIS DIBONA: "Go Scalzi."

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.389
Oh, that's nice.

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.680
It's not the end of the world
if I tell the world this.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.360
Our internal
system, all the time

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.720
we're telling people to go
slash here, goes slash there.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.890
And so, you were "Go,
Slash, Scalzi Live"

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.785
was the link for
this particular talk.

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:19.660
I'm going to get off
stage and let you start.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.034
What we're going
to do is, John's

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:24.410
going to speak about some of
his wanted works of literature.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.701
And then we'll be
taking some Q and A.

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.700
So you'll have ample time
to ask some questions.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.269
And then we'll have a
signing in the back.

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:32.310
JOHN SCALZI: Sounds good.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.435
CHRIS DIBONA: There you go.

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.672
And so everyone, John Scalzi.

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:41.700
JOHN SCALZI: One, thank
you for having me.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.220
The last time I was
here is 2007 when

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.100
"The Last Colony"
was coming out.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580
And as Chris
mentioned, at the time,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.900
my publisher was suing Google.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.530
So that wasn't awkward at all.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.150
But now I think things have
been reasonably well settled,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.540
and I think we'll be
moving on just fine.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.390
I have to say again,
it's always a lot of fun

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.509
for me to come back to Google.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.480
Because he was mentioning that I
was at AOL when AOL was Google,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.916
you know, back in the 1990s.

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:17.540
So every once in a
while, I come around

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.104
to the campus with all the
cafes, and the pet care,

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:24.020
and the masseuses, and
all that sort of stuff.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.410
And it's like, all I'm
missing is "Third Eye Blind"

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.470
and it would be just
like I was there again.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.380
I can understand if that doesn't
go over particularly well here,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.480
because you guys remember
what happened to AOL.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.264
Not going to happen to you.

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:38.620
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.210
It's totally not
going to happen.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.600
So the new book that I have
out is called "Lock In".

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.620
This is the book, which
obviously quite a few of you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.190
have.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.530
I'm going to read a
little bit from it.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.321
I'm going to tell you
a little bit about it

00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.300
before I do the reading,
which is that as you know,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.400
technology is a really
interesting thing.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.380
And you can do many
things with technology.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.900
And some of them can be
awesome and some of them

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.970
can be troublesome.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.490
You know, you
experience it even with,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.490
like, some of the Google
products that you have.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.450
On one sense, there are people
who love the fact that, like, I

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.160
can go to Google
Earth or Google Maps

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.130
and actually find a
picture of my house.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.400
I think that's really awesome.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.441
I also think that Google
needs to go and redo it,

00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.640
because the picture
you took, my lawn

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.670
is yellow because it
was like early March.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.860
And my trash can is tipped
over in front of my house.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.380
This is not how I want
the world to see my house,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.052
so please, Google
Maps, go fix that.

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:41.510
But some people
think it's awesome.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.530
On the other hand,
there are some people

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.150
who feel that all this is
somehow an invasion of privacy.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.969
I think in Europe,
they had some people

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.260
who were like there's some
places where they don't want

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.740
you to map or
something like that.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.150
The folks over here with
Google Glass-- in one sense,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.870
it's awesome that you can
walk around and actually

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.610
have that stuff without having
your phone directly in front

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.610
of you, and therefore,
walking into trees.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.860
On the other hand, there are
some people who are like,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.190
will you please turn
those things off?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.800
Because they don't know if
you are running the pictures

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.580
live or not.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.270
So there's always that back and
forth about what technology is

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.070
and how we integrated
it into our lives.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.670
And it's really interesting
to me, quite frankly,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.880
just how quickly you get
used to how technology just

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.900
is integral to your life.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.270
Like my Google phone
here from Motorola,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.600
which you dearly departed.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.860
And so, the thing that is
awesome about this piece

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.910
of technology is not that I
can talk to it and say, "Hey,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.970
Google Now,"-- turn that
off-- and have it respond.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.940
And I will ask it a question
and it will give me an answer.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.420
What is awesome is that I
can say, "Hey, Google Now,"

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.810
and ask it a question
and give me an answer,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.090
and if it gets it
wrong, I get annoyed.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.620
Right?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.230
And what that means is--
why that's so cool--

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.820
is that I'm so
used to this being

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.190
an integral part of my life-- of
living in the future, of having

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.520
the entire world
at my doorstep--

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.410
that frankly, when the
technology does not

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.280
work the way it's supposed
to that I can get annoyed.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.230
That the wonder of all
this technology, the wonder

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.670
of everything that science
has wrought and that you guys

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.010
work on on a day
in, day out basis

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.250
will just piss me off when
it's not working exactly

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.560
the way it's supposed to.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.470
That means we are
living in the future

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.010
because it is just part
of our everyday lives.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.680
And "Lock In" is about that.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.060
What happens is that the day
after tomorrow, as they say,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.780
there is a new disease that's
sweeps around the world.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.630
And so, let's say
everybody in this room

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.620
gets sick with this disease.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.200
At first, it's like a flu.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.990
So you all get sick, right?

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.550
About, let's say, everybody
but the first three rows

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.870
here gets better.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.770
You get sick, you get
better, it's the flu.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.870
Not a problem.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.750
But these folks in
the first three rows,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.140
you get to the second
phase of the disease.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.650
And what that is like
viral meningitis.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.680
And your brain swells up
and it's really painful.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.300
And then some of you drop dead.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.100
Let's say--

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.450
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.710
Those folks, sorry, you're dead.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.646
And these folks are still alive.

00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:29.270
And of these folks
who are still alive,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.980
there is a third stage,
which is called lock in.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.670
And lock in means that your
entire autonomic system

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.570
breaks down.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.840
Your brain is still
functioning but you are not

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.676
able to do anything.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:47.550
You are literally locked
inside of your body.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.470
And so, it's about
1% of the people.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.020
So you and you.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.800
You are locked in.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.050
Sorry, Chris.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.400
And so, in one sort
of sense, it doesn't

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.980
seem like that many
people altogether.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.821
But if it's these two in a
room of 200 people replicated

00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:08.320
all across the
country, that ends up

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.360
being 1% of the population
maybe like at the time.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.850
Let's say about
4.35 million people,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.736
which is the city of Los Angeles
or the state of Connecticut.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:21.360
And then, all of the sudden, it
becomes this huge public health

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.859
crisis.

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:22.880
And how do we solve it?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.260
How do we get them
out of their minds,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.650
so to speak, in a
very literal sense?

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.700
And the answer is--
and this is something

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.000
the folks here at Google would
know-- is you throw technology

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.190
at it and also a lot of money.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.760
And so there's this
research initiative that

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.680
includes brain prosthesis,
you know neural networks

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.350
within your brain--
integrating with your brain--

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.900
a multiple online place for
the people who are locked in

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.770
to have some semblance
of conversation

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.540
amongst each other,
and then these things

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.880
called Threeps-- which are
named after C3PO-- that they

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.940
are basically androids that they
drive around with their brains.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.680
So Chris is locked in, but
he will have this really cool

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.960
looking android--
ironically enough--

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.920
and he will wander around
and do all the stuff

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.740
that he does in the android
while his body is at home being

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.400
tended to.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.650
And the thing is, is when
it first happens, of course,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.920
it's the most amazing thing.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.900
We've turned you
into an android.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.719
25 years on-- which is
when this happens-- nobody

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.260
cares that you're
an android anymore,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.039
you're just part of the world.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.240
1% of everybody in the
world is an android.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.030
And how do you deal with that
and where do you go from there?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.280
So that was interesting to me.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.549
The thing that interests
me about technology

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.530
is not how awesome
the technology is.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.160
It is what happens after
the awesome wears out.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.700
You know, when it just becomes
part of your day-to-day life

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.390
and you deal with this stuff
and it's not that big of a deal.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.110
And the most that you
think about your technology

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.790
is when it's not doing
what it's supposed to do.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.610
And to give an idea
of kind of what

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.630
that would be like to be someone
who is dealing with this stuff,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:20.000
I'm going to read a quick
chapter from chapter five

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.390
where our protagonist,
Chris Shane,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.480
is looking for an apartment.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.240
Chris is someone
who is a Haden-- who

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.980
is one of these people
who is locked in--

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.040
and so when Chris is
looking for someplace,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.310
it has to be some place
that actually caters

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.167
to the needs of someone
who is locked in.

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:45.000
So I'm going to go ahead
and read from that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.900
And just so you know, Chris
is part of a famous family.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.070
So Chris would be
very much like someone

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.260
who is like a child
star at one point

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.720
and stops being that
child star and tries

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.880
to have a normal life.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.870
And right now Chris works
for the FBI, first couple

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:10.690
days on the job, he's trying
to get a new apartment in DC.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.080
The Realtor was a small, elegant
woman named LaTasha Robinson,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.890
and she met me directly
outside the Bureau building.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.760
One of her Realty specialties
was the Haden market,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.790
so the Bureau connected
me with her to help me

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.030
find an apartment.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.440
Given her clientele, the
chances that she might not

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.240
know who I was were close
to nil, a suspicion that

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.040
was verified as I approached.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.840
She smiled the
smile I recognized

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.090
from years of being trotted out
as the official Haden's poster

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.690
child, part of the official
Haden's poster family.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.690
I didn't hold it against her.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.090
"Agent Shane," she said,
holding out her hand.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.260
"Really lovely to meet you."

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.410
I took the hand and shook
it. "Ms. Robinson, likewise."

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.910
"I'm sorry.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.170
This is just kind of
exciting," she said.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.180
"I don't need that
many famous people,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.010
I mean, who aren't
politicians."--

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.690
This takes place in DC--

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.150
"Not in this town,
no," I agreed.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.380
"And I don't think of
politicians as being famous,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:01.960
do you?

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.620
They're just politicians."

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.390
"I couldn't agree more."

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.050
"My car's right over
here," she said,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.590
pointing to a relatively
unflashy Cadillac parked

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.940
where it would get ticketed.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.620
"Why don't we get started?"

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.330
I got into the passenger side.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.620
Robinson got into the driver's
seat and pulled out her tablet.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.850
"Amble," she said,
and the car slid out

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.630
from the curve
just ahead, I noted

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.710
as I glanced in the rear-view
mirror, of a traffic cop.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.949
We headed east on
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:30.240
"The car's just going to
drive around for a few minutes

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.850
while we get set
up here," Robinson

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.470
said, tapping her tablet.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.640
For all her gushing
a few seconds before,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.041
she slipped into business
mode pretty quickly.

00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:40.540
"I've got your basic request
list and personal information."

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.210
She looked over as
if to acknowledge

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.100
that I was, in fact, a
Haden and she knew it.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.170
"So let's get a few things
narrowed down before we start."

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.610
"All right," I said.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.730
"So how close do you
want to be to work?"

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.020
"Closer is better."

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.630
"Are we talking walking-close
or Metro line-close?"

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.580
"Metro line-close
is fine," I said.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.080
"Do you prefer a
neighborhood that's

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.900
hip or one that's quiet?"

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.640
"It doesn't really
matter to me."

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.450
"You say that now,
but if I get you

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.380
an apartment over a bar in
Adams Morgan and you hate it,

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.500
you're going to
blame me," Robinson

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.220
said looking over at me.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.250
"I promise, noise isn't
going to bother me,"

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.920
I said. "I can turn
down my hearing."

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.450
"Do you plan on using the
apartment to socialize?"

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.640
"Not really," I said. "I do most
of my socializing elsewhere.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.210
I might have a friend
over from time to time."

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.160
Robinson looked
over again at this

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.970
and seemed to be
considering whether to ask

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.780
for clarification and
decided against it.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.230
It was a fair call.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.010
There were Threep
fetishists out there.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.910
They weren't really my
thing, I have to say.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.420
"Will your body be physically
present, and if so,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.060
will you need room for
a caretaker?" she asked.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.200
"My body and its care-taking are
already squared away," I said.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.560
"We won't be needing
space for either, at least

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.160
not right away."

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.590
"In that case, I have some
Haden efficiency flats

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.540
on my availability
list," she said.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.429
"Would you like to see those?"

00:12:57.429 --> 00:12:58.470
"Are they worth my time?"

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.350
I asked.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.630
Robinson shrugged.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.137
"Some Hadens like
them," she said.

00:13:02.137 --> 00:13:04.220
"I think they're a little
small, but then, they're

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.450
not designed for non-Hadens."

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.410
"Are they close by?"

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.030
"I've got a building of them
on D Avenue in Southwest,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.377
right by Federal Center
Metro," Robinson said.

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:15.210
"The Department of
Health and Human Services

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.809
hires a lot of Hadens, so it's
convenient housing for them."

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:21.100
"All right," I said. "We
might as well check them out."

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.350
"We'll go there first," Robinson
said, and spoke the address

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.710
to the Cadillac.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.210
Five minutes later,
we were in front

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.810
of a depressing slab
of anonymous brutalist

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.370
architecture.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.942
"This is lovely," I said dryly.

00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:36.150
"I think it used to be a
government office building,"

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.817
Robinson said. "They converted
it about 20 years ago.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.650
It was one of the first
buildings redesigned

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.150
with Hadens in mind."

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.850
She nodded me into the lobby,
which was clean and plain.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.120
A Threep receptionist
sat behind a desk.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.210
The Threep was set
to transmit ID data

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.780
over the common channel.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.580
In my field of vision,
it's owner's data

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.660
popped up above
the Threeps head--

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.360
Genevieve Tourneaux,
27 years old, native

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.720
of Rockville, Maryland.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.350
Her public address
for direct messages.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.220
"Hello," Robinson
said to Genevieve,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.670
and showed her her Realtors ID.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.530
"We're here to look at the
vacancy on the fifth floor."

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.830
Genevieve turned to me
and I realized belatedly

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.360
that I didn't have my
own personal data out

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.700
on the common channel.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.510
Some Hadens found that rude.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.200
I quickly popped it up.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.470
She gave me a quick nod
as if an acknowledgement,

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.600
did a small double-take,
then recovered

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.580
and turned her
attention to Robinson.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.590
"Unit 503 is unlocked for the
next 15 minutes," she said.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.590
"Thank you," Robinson said
and nodded over to me.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.130
"Hold on a second," I said.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.870
I turned back to Genevieve.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.550
"May I have guest access to
the building channel, please?"

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.310
Genevieve nodded to me and I
saw the channel marker pop up

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.840
in my field of view.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.720
I connected to it.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.890
The lobby walls
exploded into signage.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.590
Some of the notes were your
basic cork board notes-- people

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.180
looking for roommates
or to sublet

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.010
or asking after lost pets.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.430
At the moment, however, signs
about the walk-out in March

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.210
dominated.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.230
Signs reminding
tenants to stay home,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.270
plans for walk-out
activities, requests

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.340
to let Hadens coming
into town for the march

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.560
crash in apartments with
the sardonic notation

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.980
that they would not
need much space.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.920
"Is everything OK?"

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.410
Robinson asked.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.710
"It's fine," I said.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.122
"I'm just taking in the
posters on the wall."

00:15:18.122 --> 00:15:19.830
I read a few more and
then we walked over

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.640
to the elevator bank and took
the lift up to the fifth floor.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.340
"Extra large elevators,"
Robinson noted as we rose.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.660
"Hydraulic lift.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.960
Makes it easier to bring
bodies up to the room."

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.600
"I thought these were all
efficiency apartments," I said.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.690
"No, not all of
them," Robinson said.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.310
"Some of them are full-sized and
have dedicated medical suites

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.580
and caretaker rooms.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.960
Even the efficiencies
have cradle hookups.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.180
They're supposed to be
used on a temp basis,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.560
although I hear some Hadens
are using them full time now."

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.060
"And why is that?"

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.280
The elevator stopped
and the doors opened.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.650
"Abrams Kettering"-- which is
a bill that has been passed

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.660
that will cut government
funding for Hadens research

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.890
and medical services--

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.540
"Adams Kettering,"
Robinson said.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.990
She walked out of the
lift and down the hall.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.120
"Assistance is getting
slashed so a lot of Hadens

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.140
are downsizing.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.880
Those in town homes are moving
into smaller apartments.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.550
Those in apartments are
moving into efficiencies.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.070
And some of those
in efficiencies

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.460
are taking on roommates.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.782
They're using the
chargers in shifts."

00:16:19.782 --> 00:16:21.240
She glanced back
to me and her eyes

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240
flickered over my shiny,
expensive Threep as if to say,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.577
not that you have
to worry about that.

00:16:26.577 --> 00:16:28.410
"It's been bad for the
market, to be honest.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.480
But that's good for you
as a potential renter.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.540
Now you have a lot more
options a lot cheaper."

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.480
She stopped at apartment 503.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.060
"That is if this
doesn't bowl you over."

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.700
She opened the door and stood
aside to let me pass through.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.890
Haden efficiency apartment 503
was two meters by three meters

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.670
and entirely bare save for
one built-in counter top.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.760
I stepped inside and
immediately got claustrophobia.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.710
"This isn't an apartment,
it's a closet,"

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.930
I said, stepping forward
to let Robinson in.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.490
"I usually think of
it as a bathroom"

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.270
Robinson said, and pointed
to a small tiled area which

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.839
had a bank of electrical outlets
and a couple of covered drains

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.740
on the floor flush
with the tile.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.970
"That would be the
medical nook, by the way.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.970
Right where the
toilet would be."

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.270
"You're not exactly
giving me the hard sell

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.780
on this apartment,
Ms Robinson," I said.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.990
"Well, to be fair, if
all you're looking to do

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.710
is park your Threep every
night, this isn't a bad choice,"

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:24.729
Robinson said.

00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:26.270
She pointed to the
back right corner,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.020
where the grooves and
high voltage outlets

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.100
were set into the wall ready
to receive inductive chargers.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.920
"It's designed with
standard Threep cradles

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.270
in mind and the hard wired
and wireless networks

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.210
are fast and have
deep throughput.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.790
The spaces have been
designed with Threeps in mind

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.710
so you don't have
inessential things taking up

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.510
space like closets or sinks.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.460
It's everything you need and
absolutely nothing you don't."

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.960
"I hate it," I said.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.630
"I thought you
might," Robinson said.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.100
"That's why I showed
it to you first.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.730
Now that we have
that out of the way,

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.771
we can show you something
that you might actually

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:01.980
be interested in."

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.780
I stared back at
the spot of tile

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.700
and thought about
putting a human body

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.410
there more or less permanently.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.420
"So these kind of apartments
are hot right now?"

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.520
I asked.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.590
"They are," Robinson said. "I
don't usually deal with them.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.290
Not enough commission on them.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.580
They usually get rented
through online want ads,

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.380
but yes, right now,
this kind of apartment

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.920
is selling like hotcakes."

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.470
"Well, now I'm feeling a
little depressed," I said.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.880
"Well, you don't have to feel
depressed," Robinson said.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.730
"You're not going to live here.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.330
You're not going to
have your body in here."

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.780
"But apparently some
people are," I said.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.300
"Yes," Robinson said.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.880
"Maybe it's a blessing that
the bodies don't notice."

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.670
"Ah, but that's
not true," I said.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.220
"We're locked in, but
we're not unconscious.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.710
Trust me, Ms Robinson, we
notice where our bodies are.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.630
We notice it every
moment we're awake."

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.180
All right, so that's that.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.605
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.460
And like I said,
one of the things

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.480
that you can see from
that particular thing

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.290
is this is someone who is just
trying to find an apartment.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:15.040
But an apartment that conforms
to the reality of their life

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.200
situation.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.672
That there is an
android that they

00:19:18.672 --> 00:19:20.380
will use to get around
in the real world,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.390
but there needs to be
a space for the body.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.260
And that body will need to have
a caretaker looking after it

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.940
while the owner of the
body is, literally,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.490
somewhere else in the world.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.660
And like I said, on
a day-to-day basis,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.330
this is just the life they lead.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.220
For us reading a book about
the future, this is all new

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.300
and this is all cool, right?

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.020
But one of the things you
have to really do as a writer,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:52.430
you really want to try to avoid
is making a big deal out of it

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.190
for the people who
are living in there.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.981
One of the things that
science fiction does

00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:57.670
really badly is the
exposition trap,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.800
which is the "As you know, Bob."

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.010
Where you go, you
know, "As you know,

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.720
Chris, we are here at Google,
this worldwide technological

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.110
company that was founded on
the search engine thing."

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.820
and you'd be like,
"Oh, yes, absolutely."

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.960
He knows that.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.370
He's been working
here for 10 years.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.250
But in fiction, you
see a lot of that

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.370
because the audience
doesn't know that.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.490
You have to give that
information while

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.990
at the same time
respecting the fact

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:27.680
that the characters that you are
following and creating actually

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.690
have all of this internalized.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.230
One of the defining challenges
of writing science fiction

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.040
is to establish for the
reader in the present time

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.210
this awesome technology while
at the same time establishing

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.400
for the characters who
live in that future

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.970
that this is their life.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:45.850
Right?

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.210
That this magnificent
technology is

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.190
no more exciting to them as
than a cellphone or a DVR,

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.130
which both of which,
if you think about it,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.600
are pretty damn awesome.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.000
If I went back 25 years ago
and told the 20-year-old me

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.846
about a cellphone, I would
be like, "Are you a wizard?"

00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:06.345
You know?

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.980
You Think about it-- remember
Star Trek, the original Star

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.430
Trek, where Kirk's
got a communicator.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.340
And you're like, oh,
so it only does voice.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.850
That's cute.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:22.240
Because it's like my phone
here does voice, it does text,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.440
it takes pictures, it
does-- it's basically,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.990
you can use it now
as a tricorder.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.740
Quite frankly, if you've got
one of those Google Gear things

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.080
that's got, you can
check your heart rate,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.430
you can see what's
going on with your body.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.660
And so that communicator
that Kirk had back in 1967,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:45.450
but supposedly the 23rd century,
is just unbelievably quaint.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.980
So it's just a fascinating thing
about how the future catches up

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.930
with you and how, as a
science fiction writer,

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.680
you deal with that.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.810
So what I'm trying to say
is that, when you read this,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.520
I hope what you get out of it
is that this feature is cool.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.420
But for them, it's
just another day

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.510
with a whole different
set of problems.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.960
We are, I think, about
at the half hour point,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.910
which means that it's time to
actually open up to questions

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.471
from you folks here at Google.

00:22:15.471 --> 00:22:17.220
And I'll be happy to
talk about "Lock In."

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.840
I'll be happy to talk about
the other books that I have.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.260
I'll be happy to talk
about the TV series that

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.970
are being developed
out of a couple

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.070
of my books or the video game.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.310
My personal life, my website,
you can ask anything.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.209
I will answer any
question you have.

00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:34.750
Sometimes the answer will be,
I can't believe you asked that.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.050
Leave and never come back.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.770
But as long as we're clear
on that, then we're good.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.010
So let's go ahead.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.110
CHRIS DIBONA: Can you
mention your appearance?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.943
JOHN SCALZI: Oh, I also
did want to mention.

00:22:43.943 --> 00:22:48.020
I do have an appearance
tonight at Books Incorporated

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.097
in Mountain View.

00:22:49.097 --> 00:22:50.430
I will be doing a reading there.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.804
I will not be
doing this reading.

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:54.070
I'll be doing an entirely
different reading,

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.270
so it will be an all new
show as far as it goes.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.200
If you're not doing
anything tonight, come out.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.440
It starts at 7:00.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.370
Bring yourself and every
single person you've ever met.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.552
All right, so first question.

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:09.760
AUDIENCE: Specifically in
the "Old Man's War" series,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.632
something that I
noticed in your writing

00:23:11.632 --> 00:23:13.340
that I don't see in
a lot of other places

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.769
is that you portray
people who are married

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.310
or have been married
for a long time,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.295
longstanding
relationships as opposed

00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:22.850
to simply the chase portion.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.450
This seems-- I don't want
to say unique in fiction,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.040
but pretty rare.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.040
What brought you to do that, and
why you and pretty much nobody

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.707
else.

00:23:31.707 --> 00:23:33.790
JOHN SCALZI: I don't know
that I would necessarily

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.840
agree with that particular
premise, because for example,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.620
in "Forever War", there is
a longstanding relationship

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.110
between the protagonist
and Mary Gay

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:50.020
who, interestingly enough,
has a very near name

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.510
of Joe Holdeman's wife, Gay.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.300
And so, for me
also-- I mean, I've

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.180
been married for a certain
number of years, going up

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.780
on 20 years now.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.490
My wife is, actually, the
template for Jane Sagan.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.640
Right?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.310
So when you imagine Jane Sagan,
imagine a woman who's about

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.680
5'10", straight,
brown hair, you know,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.130
and will kill you if
you get in her way.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.190
Because that is my wife.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.790
She is no-nonsense, super
awesome, and when it came to,

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.110
I need to develop this
bad ass character,

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.675
here's who I will use.

00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:32.050
But the simple
fact of the matter

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.100
is that being married or
being in relationships

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.920
and having those long term
relationships are part of life.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.330
And that they are a
significant portion of it.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.460
And almost everybody
has those relationships.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.340
If you're not showing
those, then you

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.260
are not accurately
reflecting life.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.260
And people are like, well,
it's science fiction,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.410
you don't really have to
accurately reflect life.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.360
Which is a rotten lie.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.210
I mean, you can actually
talk about the future

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.510
and you can speculate and
you can do whatever you want.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:07.680
But at the end of the day, the
human creature is important.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.260
We have all this technology
now that's amazing.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.390
We'll have all this
technology in the future.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:18.500
Humans are the same build that
they were 30,000 years ago,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.820
as far as it goes.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:25.860
So not having those things
that humans do in your books,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.299
eventually, it makes
it feel artificial.

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:30.090
It was also really
important from the point

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.480
of view of that particular
character, John Perry,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.640
to establish some of what
he was leaving behind.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.110
So much of who he was was about
who he was with that someone

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.060
else-- with his wife.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.190
And so it made leaving the
earth that much more, because he

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.610
was leaving that aspect of his
life behind or so he thought.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.910
The other thing
is that also when

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.410
you write a military
science fiction

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.510
book like I did
with guns and lasers

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.490
and explosions and aliens
who want to eat you

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.335
and all that sort of stuff, you
have a really good opportunity

00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:07.620
to lose like three-quarters
of your audience

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.960
right away if you start
off with a scene, you know,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.810
where Hunky McChesty
starts shooting

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.562
the aliens with his big zapper
gun and all that sort of stuff

00:26:18.562 --> 00:26:20.270
and it's just blood,
blood, blood, blood.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.350
I wanted to show--
I intentionally

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.480
did the first scene of
this action-adventure story

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.490
with a guy missing his wife.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.260
Because that is something
everybody-- anybody who's

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.800
been in a relationship, can you
think about losing your spouse

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.940
or losing your longtime partner?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.977
It just rips your heart out.

00:26:40.977 --> 00:26:43.310
I mean, I'm getting kind of
choked up thinking about it.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.100
And so, everybody has that
moment that all of the sudden,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.270
you're thrown in, you
understand this guy.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.770
And you will follow
his story because you

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.230
know how much he
misses his wife.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.659
So that was part
the reason to do it.

00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:58.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.729
So I'm enjoying a lot of
your books as audiobooks.

00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:02.520
And many of them are
ready by Will Wheaton,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.049
you guys make a great team.

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:06.340
So with "Lock In," you're
trying something a little bit

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.970
difference, where you have two
versions of the audio book--

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.785
one read by Will and
another one ready by Amber--

00:27:11.785 --> 00:27:15.140
I forgot her last name, Benton.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.260
And I'm only a couple hours in.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.181
And so far, I think if
I hadn't known about it,

00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:21.680
it wouldn't even
have occurred to me

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.250
that the character could be
anything other than male.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.510
So great job there.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.760
But I think I still need a
little bit more convincing.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.610
So like, once I'm finished
with the Will Wheaton version,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.330
why should I listen
to the other one?

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.985
JOHN SCALZI: Because
it's awesome.

00:27:34.985 --> 00:27:35.860
Because it's awesome.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.090
Because Amber did
a fantastic job.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.440
And that, Amber's
way of doing Chris

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.690
is different than Will's
way of doing Chris.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.377
And both of those
ways of doing Chrises

00:27:47.377 --> 00:27:49.460
are slightly different
than my way of doing Chris.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.430
You're right, when I originally
wrote Chris and in the book,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.860
Chris nowhere in
there is gendered.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.729
And there's a reason for that.

00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:00.270
Part of it is because
I wanted to see

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.180
where people assigned Chris.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.230
What are your defaults
as a human being?

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.490
And the answer is,
you'll find out,

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.900
by how you respond to Chris.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.559
My wife read Chris and I did the
thing-- because I automatically

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:15.350
just sort of, when I'm
talking about people

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.770
in a nonspecific way, just sort
of automatically gender male

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.020
because that's what we do.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.890
And that's what I
got brought up with.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.890
Literally, the style guide for
AP and Chicago and everyone

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.899
else said, when in
doubt, gender male.

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:31.190
So I will still slip into that.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.080
And one time, I slipped
in that with Chris.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.480
And she's was like, what?

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.240
No.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.826
Chris is emphatically
female for her.

00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:42.080
For other people, Chris
is emphatically male.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.077
What it comes down
to is, really,

00:28:44.077 --> 00:28:45.660
what your own reading
comes out of it.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.450
And I put that in
there for the purpose

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.176
of making it interesting,
making it kind of exciting.

00:28:52.176 --> 00:28:53.800
But I also didn't
tell people about it.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.216
It's coming out
now because people

00:28:55.216 --> 00:28:57.770
are like-- thousands of
people have read the book now

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.975
and they're like,
hey, I was confused.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.060
I need guidance.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.550
And I'm not offering
any sort of guidance.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.190
When I wrote Chris, I
specifically was like,

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.100
I'm not going to go there.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.440
Chris could be male.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.460
Chris could be female.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.490
Chris could be intersex.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.570
Chris could be trans--
started one, went the other,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.990
maybe went the other direction.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:24.567
Maybe Chris has decided
that gender is not a thing

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:26.150
to be considered at
all, that it's not

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.630
necessary in the construct
that Chris exists in.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.010
Because Chris is a
Threep to most people.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.760
And in the Agora, which
is the online world

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.440
that the Hadens are, you can
be anybody who you want to be.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.990
So this is essentialism
towards gender

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.550
is not necessarily a construct
that works in the same way

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.710
as it works in the
physical world.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.490
So when it comes
down to the readings

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.870
that Will and Amber
did, they both read

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.370
from their gender
essentialist point of view.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.240
And so it's really
interesting for me

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.320
to get the back and forth.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.190
And I say you should listen to
Amber's-- aside from her doing

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:10.450
a fantastic job-- to see how
you respond to Chris making that

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:10.950
switch.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.390
You know?

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.860
Does it change
the story for you?

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.444
Does it change the power
dynamic between Chris and them?

00:30:16.444 --> 00:30:18.360
Does it change the power
dynamic between Chris

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.400
and the other people that
Chris associates with?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.764
And the answer is,
that will be up to you.

00:30:23.764 --> 00:30:26.180
Again, you don't want to hit
people over the head with it.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.960
Like I said, I didn't
mention it at all

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.210
until other people
started to mention it.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.250
Because I didn't want it to
get in the way of the story.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.166
I wanted it to be the
thing that you noticed

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.540
after you were
done with a story.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.975
Like, that story was cool,
Chris is-- what is Chris?

00:30:39.975 --> 00:30:41.010
Oh, shit.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:41.840
You know?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.440
And then it kind of blows your
mind and you go off from there.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.460
So yeah, listen to
Amber and see how

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.611
it changes the main
character for you.

00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:51.110
There we go.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.560
AUDIENCE: So as
someone named Amber,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.290
it's a little bit awkward
following that up.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.916
JOHN SCALZI: You
did a great job.

00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:01.470
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.980
AUDIENCE: So I work with the
social group here at Google,

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.490
which among other
things, we run Google+.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.090
And one of the big things that
Google+ is trying to do is

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.830
encourage really interesting,
thoughtful discussions

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.720
and conversations
between people.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.240
And clearly, you've been doing
this for years on your blog.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.860
Clearly, longer than Google+
has been doing it for.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.290
Do you have any
insights on, like,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.690
what tools or key elements
are necessary to promote

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.792
deep, thoughtful,
insightful discussion?

00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:32.000
JOHN SCALZI: Absolutely I do.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.230
And I'll send you information
about my retainer fee.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.370
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.460
Quite honestly, I think
the first thing is

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:47.627
that you have to have-- the
dynamic on my website is,

00:31:47.627 --> 00:31:49.960
basically, there's someone
there to lead the discussion.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.335
And that would be
me, saying here

00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:52.690
is the topic under discussion.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.740
Here are my thoughts on
this particular topic

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.770
under discussion.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.410
The common thread is open.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.850
Make your comments.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.580
People come in to
make the comments.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.670
The person who is refereeing
the conversation-- who

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.982
would be me-- makes sure
the ground rules are set,

00:32:06.982 --> 00:32:09.190
that people understand the
rules of the road in terms

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.710
of the communication, and is
able to direct people when they

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.870
get off topic, remove the
trolls when they show up

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.610
as they so often do,
and basically make sure

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.890
that the conversation
that is being had

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.770
is the conversation
that is worth

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.100
having on that particular topic.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:33.260
Now, how do you do that
without going too far

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.100
and just basically shutting
down the conversation

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.800
or not doing enough
and just basically

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.730
having it go discursive
all over the place?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:44.160
And a lot of it comes down to
practice, practice, practice,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.830
which is the thing that
most people don't have.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.450
You know?

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.200
The simple fact of the
matter is that I've

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.650
been doing whatever
for close to 16 years--

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.872
16 years on the 13th, right?

00:32:55.872 --> 00:32:57.080
I been doing this since 1998.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.470
It is paleo as far as the
internet is concerned.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:03.915
I'm Cretaceous period.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.340
You know?

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.720
But because I've been
doing it for a long time,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.180
those rhythms are established.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.730
Most people don't have
the same amount of time

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.790
to devote to it as I do.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.832
And they don't have the
same sort of either practice

00:33:18.832 --> 00:33:19.790
or rhetorical training.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.680
Because I also have a degree
in philosophy and rhetoric

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.020
and stuff like that.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:29.310
So that a lot of the
detailed instructions

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.100
about how to do
this are not there.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.520
And I guess one of the things
that maybe Google+ or anybody

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.280
else who wants to foster these
sorts of things can do is, A,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.690
make sure that the people who
are leading the discussions

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.920
have a robust set of tools
to deal with discursiveness

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.881
so that they actually
own the conversation.

00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:52.380
The other thing that I would
say would probably be useful is

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.260
somewhere online just say,
how to comment on Google+,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.817
how to have a conversation.

00:33:59.817 --> 00:34:02.400
And in one sort of sense, it's
like wow, that seems insulting.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.580
But on the other hand, I
have it up on my website.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.140
It's like, how to
be a good comment.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.110
It's like, are you on topic?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.590
Are you doing what I call the
Libertarian dismount, which

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.590
is the thing where
someone-- I'm sorry,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.239
you're clearly
confused about this.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.007
The Libertarian
dismount would be,

00:34:17.007 --> 00:34:18.840
like, we're talking
about same-sex marriage.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.520
And someone goes, well,
that's just because, frankly,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.000
the state shouldn't be involved
in the marriage process at all.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.350
And that's fascinating,
but that's not the topic.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.360
You're dragging this
topic over to the thing

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.050
you want to talk about, which is
whether or not the state should

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.590
be involved with
marriage at all.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:40.560
Which is not the topic of how
do we deal with the emerging

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.400
consensus about
same-sex marriage.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.239
And so, that sort
of dismount into,

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.719
I'm uncomfortable
with this topic,

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.290
so I really want
to talk about this.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.364
And I'm going to make
you all talk about that,

00:34:50.364 --> 00:34:51.530
is something you don't want.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.340
Knowing when to quit.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.830
Knowing when to
have the final word.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.160
Knowing when to walk away.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.411
These are all things that
actually have to be learned.

00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:02.160
And some people don't
want to learn those.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.640
Some people do
want to be trolls.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.910
Or some people don't think
that their point of view

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.729
is ever possibly wrong.

00:35:09.729 --> 00:35:11.520
They don't even mean
it in a malicious way.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.340
They just don't understand
why, through the process

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.700
of continually talking
and never shutting up,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.250
you don't eventually come
around their point of view.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.112
Yeah, who knew that
that would happen out

00:35:23.112 --> 00:35:24.820
on the internet, where
you don't actually

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.570
have that face-to-face
communication?

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.200
So a lot of that really
will come down to,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.732
you give the people the tools,
you do as much as you can do.

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.440
But sooner or later,
it's the whole thing

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.690
of leading the horse to water.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:41.250
Sooner or later, the horse
either has to drink or not.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.900
And I would say
give as many tools

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.290
as you can to allow
people to have

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:46.830
those robust conversations.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.950
Highlight when and where you
see robust conversations.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.840
If you go MetaFilter,
they'll have that-- you know,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.590
Matt Houghey has that
list on the side of,

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.420
these are really
cool conversations

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.710
that we're having a MetaFilter.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.600
Those are perfect examples.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.870
And you just train people
over the course of time.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.330
It's not something that's
going to immediately happen.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:10.166
It has to happen over the space
of years and years and years.

00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:11.790
And the problem is
that then you always

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.160
have new people coming in.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.960
There's an old term
from the Usenet days

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.620
that-- what is it-- the
September that never ends?

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.644
Which was when, every year,
new kids would come to colleges

00:36:26.644 --> 00:36:28.810
and they would get on the
Usenet for the first time.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.600
And then everyone had
to go, oh, it's time

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.380
to train them how to use it.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.820
And then AOL-- bless
its heart-- dumped

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.620
all it's 20 million people
on the internet all at once.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.580
And it was just
September everywhere.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.200
And so you have a continual
September going on with any

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.011
social media, whether it's
Google+ or Twitter or Facebook

00:36:49.011 --> 00:36:49.510
or whatever.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.442
Everybody, sooner or
later, cycles through.

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.775
And you just have to accept
that that's part of the deal

00:36:53.775 --> 00:36:54.994
as well.

00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:57.160
That's what I think, and
I'll be sending you a bill.

00:37:00.799 --> 00:37:02.840
AUDIENCE: Hey, another
question about audiobooks.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.790
I'm kind of interested in
how the audiobook production

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.850
process ties into
writing, if at all.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.125
Does it just come that
you finish a book,

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.750
throw it over the
wall to Will Wheaton?

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.735
Or is it something
more involved?

00:37:14.735 --> 00:37:17.210
Do you think about that
while you're producing?

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.610
Does this like
effect your choice

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.620
of first versus
third person at all?

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.300
JOHN SCALZI: I'm
sorry, I'm stuck

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.560
on the image of
me chucking things

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.601
over Will Wheaton's wall.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.020
Actually, I will give
an example of something

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.620
that I do less
now, because I know

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.250
that audio is important to a
large segment of my audience.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.720
Which is dialogue tags.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.480
"Let's go down to the
store," Chris said.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.630
"All right," Christine said.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:55.730
"Well, make sure that we
get Coca-Cola," Chris said.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:00.120
And the thing is, is when you're
writing that, the he said,

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.444
she said, he said, your
brain filters it out.

00:38:03.444 --> 00:38:05.610
Because enough of it, you're
like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.070
The dialogue tag is there
almost in a subliminal way

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.990
to let you know who is talking.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.250
So in a printed
medium, the fact that I

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.600
put said at the
end of everything

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.090
doesn't really affect things.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:24.150
In audiobook, it gets
astoundingly monotonous.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.730
And I didn't-- people started
saying this to me once

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.109
Will's versions of
stuff of mine took off.

00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:31.650
And they're like,
you use said a lot.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.470
And I'm like, no, I don't.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.740
I don't really.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.230
And then I listened to-- I
was listening to "Red Shirts."

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.890
and there was like a
part in chapter two.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.940
It's like, blah,
blah, blah, Doll said.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.600
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, Hanson said.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.680
I was like, who is this idiot?

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.510
Who is the idiot
who wrote this crap?

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.530
I need to talk to him.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.760
Because what works in one
medium doesn't necessarily

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.430
work in another medium.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.810
So for "Lock In,"
because I knew that it

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.180
was going to be done
in audio, I took out

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.730
I would say, probably 30%
40% of the dialogue tags.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.910
Where if it's just
like two characters

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.370
having a conversation, it'll
be Chris said, John said.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.380
And then the next
time I go to Chris,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.500
it doesn't have a
dialogue tag because that

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.750
is the logical place
for that to be going.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.380
And so, in that
respect, yes absolutely.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.530
That is one example
of how my writing has

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.030
accommodated this other medium.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.600
Now, whether it's enough for
people who really dislike

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.290
the fact that I use
that dialogue tag,

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.150
we'll have to see.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.930
But yeah, you are
aware, no matter

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.740
what you're doing,
where your audience is

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.620
and what their expectations are.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.430
And to the extent that
it doesn't actually

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.410
compromise your story
or compromise what

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.440
is that you want to do, you
want to accommodate that,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.870
because you want them
to buy your stuff so you

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.480
could make your
mortgage payment.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.240
So frankly, I was
happy to do that

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.951
and to incorporate that in.

00:39:57.951 --> 00:39:59.700
And there are other
things that probably I

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.060
do now that I'm not aware of.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.934
But since I've been
listening to Will and Amber

00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:07.600
and William Dufris, who does the
"Old Man's War" stuff and Tavia

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.020
Gilbert who did "Zoe's
Tale", listening to them

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.650
do my stories, you
definitely soak that in

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.870
and you find out new
things about yourself

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.390
as a writer because of it.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:22.464
Come on down.

00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:24.630
AUDIENCE: You've talked
online before about that you

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.200
deliberately make
your novels very,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.450
like, approachable to readers.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.200
And it's definitely
something I've noticed

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.940
and you're sort of
the author I recommend

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.820
to non-science fiction
fans just to kind of get

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.695
into science fiction.

00:40:33.695 --> 00:40:35.250
Do you think science
fiction needs

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.305
to do more of that-- needs to
grow beyond its genre roots?

00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:41.010
And where is that
line kind of blurring

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.630
at the moment, between things
that sit in the science fiction

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.100
section of the bookstore
versus a general novel?

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.037
JOHN SCALZI: I do think science
fiction could do with some more

00:40:52.037 --> 00:40:53.370
sort of gateway science fiction.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.000
I'm torn, because in
one sort of sense,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.840
there is not a huge amount
of gateway science fiction

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.006
out there, which is great
for me because I write it.

00:40:59.006 --> 00:41:00.647
So I end up being
recommended a lot.

00:41:00.647 --> 00:41:01.980
It was like, what should I read?

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.060
I don't read a lot
of science fiction.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:03.790
Scalzi.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.770
Anybody else?

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.270
No.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.199
So that's awesome.

00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:13.240
On the other hand, it's
not necessarily very good

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.510
for the genre.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.150
The thing about it
is that if it has

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.760
to be working on
all sorts of levels.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.030
You need people like me who are
writing the gateway fiction.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.080
It's kind of going,
hey, just one hit.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.405
It'll be fine.

00:41:27.405 --> 00:41:29.030
And the next thing
you know-- you know.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.340
Then you need people who are
doing the next level of science

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.600
fiction, where the water
is a little deeper,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.050
things are a little
more complex.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.490
And then, eventually
you lead them

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.910
down the path that takes them
to Charlie Strauss and China

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.310
Mieville, right?

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.150
And then, once they're there,
they're trapped, right?

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.910
They will never escape
that hole-- the Venus fly

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.804
trap of science
fiction and fantasy.

00:41:51.804 --> 00:41:53.970
But I think it needs to
operate on all those levels.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:57.727
You can't just have everything
be open and accessible and fun,

00:41:57.727 --> 00:42:00.060
because then the people who
are really dyed-in-the-wool,

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.367
heavy science fiction fans
are just going to sit there

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:04.200
and roll their eyes.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.240
There are people who won't
read me because they're like,

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.040
Scalzi, take off
the training wheels.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.550
And that's perfectly reasonable.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.690
It's like, I'm not
writing for them.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.590
But there are other
people who, you

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.595
know-- if I tried to hand my
mother-in-law-- who I love

00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:25.270
and who reads Julie Garwood and
Nora Roberts-- hand her Charlie

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.130
Strauss or hand her China
Mieville-- both of whom

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.389
are writers that I
think are fabulous

00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:33.430
and have created some of
the best science fiction

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:37.710
work of the new
century-- she would

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.620
like read for maybe
about five pages

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.900
and she would set it down
and never do that again.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.830
You have to have all
that work in all levels

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.950
if the field is
going to be healthy.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.557
So I do think we need more
people doing stuff like me.

00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:54.390
We need more people
doing stuff like Charlie

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.750
and more people doing stuff
like Kameron Hurley, who

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:02.510
is doing some fantasy right
now which is very complex.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.300
We need more people like
her doing stuff like that.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.200
Ann Leckie, who just
won every single award

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.180
imaginable for
"Ancillary Justice,"

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.750
we need more of people like
her who are taking space opera

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.940
and just basically breaking
it apart and putting it

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.640
back together again
in new formats.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.390
We need more of
everything is basically

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.280
my feeling about science
fiction and fantasy.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.160
So hopefully we're
in the place where

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.017
we'll get some more of that.

00:43:30.017 --> 00:43:32.100
AUDIENCE: So, I love the
"Old Man's War" universe,

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.770
and I look forward to
more books in that genre.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.480
But how, as an
author, do you decide

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.090
when to continue
expanding the universe?

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.444
And when you kind of don't
have anything new to say?

00:43:43.444 --> 00:43:45.610
JOHN SCALZI: That's actually
a really good question,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.100
because there is that tension.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.480
Because "Old Man's War"
is very successful.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.850
You've done very well
for me, thank you.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:59.090
I will sit in my hot
tub in honor of you.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.140
We did just buy a
hot tub, by the way.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.385
And it's ridiculous.

00:44:05.385 --> 00:44:06.710
It is a ridiculous hot tub.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.630
I was telling them
earlier, it's a hot tub--

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.230
it's like an RV of hot tubs.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.920
It's just like it seats seven.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.299
You can have a TV in
it, it has chilled

00:44:15.299 --> 00:44:16.590
drinks, all this sort of stuff.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.324
And it's the thing that--
you know that old story,

00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:20.740
if you give a mouse
a cookie, it's

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.940
going to want a glass of milk?

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.481
If you get yourself
a hot tub, you're

00:44:23.481 --> 00:44:25.900
going to want a gazebo
for the hot tub.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.620
It's a money pit.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.710
So I'm very excited
about the hot tub.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.660
So please buy more books
is what I'm trying to say.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.200
But no, here's the tension.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.210
On one hand, I could,
quite literally,

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.530
write an "Old Man's War"
book and then something else,

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.905
and then another "Old Man's
War" book and something else,

00:44:43.905 --> 00:44:47.030
and another "Old Man's War"
book, until the cows come home.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.509
And a lot of people
would buy them.

00:44:48.509 --> 00:44:50.050
And they would get
to the point where

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.570
they're like, oh, you know, "Old
Man's War" 17, whatever it is.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.986
They'd be like,
oh, you know, it's

00:44:53.986 --> 00:44:57.260
not as good as they were
when he started out.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.250
But, I guess it's OK.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.165
You know?

00:44:59.165 --> 00:45:01.840
And I don't want to be that guy.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.430
For one thing, because
if I'm bored writing,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.960
which I would get bored writing
if I just kept hacking them

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.640
out, you're going
to be bored reading.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.470
And you might buy
them out of habit,

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:12.950
but I don't want you to
buy them out of habit.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.741
I want you to buy them
because you're like,

00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:17.800
holy crap, this out, this
is new, and I need it now.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.580
I want to actually
want to get it,

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.735
as opposed to feel sort
of a moral obligation.

00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:23.360
Kind of the way you
felt about watching

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.810
episode three of the Star
Wars prequel trilogy.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.110
It's like, I've invested
this much time, off we go.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.360
Are you Vader, yet?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.650
You know what I mean?

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.440
You were there.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.870
Yeah, and I don't want that.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:43.270
I want you to
actually be excited

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.750
about every new episode.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.570
And sometimes that means
actually stepping away.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.180
Like, I did an arc that
started with "Old Man's War"

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.040
and ended with "Last
Colony" and "Zoe's Tale."

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.370
It told the story of John
Perry and his family, right?

00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:59.700
That was a complete art.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.200
And then, when that was
done, I took five years off

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.230
of the "Old Man's War" series.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.120
And part of the
reason for that was I

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.900
didn't know where
else to go with it.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.980
I mean, their story was
told, I put the universe

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.410
in a precarious position, but
I didn't know what that meant.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.100
And so, I went off
and did other things

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.700
while it was rolling
around in my brain.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.070
And then I became interested
right around the same time

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.060
that the folks at
Tor were like, we

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:29.130
would like to do this episodic
project where we do everything

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.060
electronically in
a serial fashion.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.290
I was like, well,
interestingly enough,

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.390
I was thinking of doing
a series of short stories

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.911
with these characters.

00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:39.410
Why don't we combine
those together?

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.680
And that's how that showed up.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.060
The second "Human
Division" book,

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.610
which I'm working on right now--
which will be out next year--

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.400
is going to be kind of in the
same sort of boat of things.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.080
But ultimately,
what's going to happen

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.910
with that is, when those
two books are done,

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.330
I will probably step away from
the "Old Man's War" universe

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.934
again, because I've
got to figure out

00:47:00.934 --> 00:47:02.100
what's going to happen next.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.016
And I would rather take
the time to figure out

00:47:04.016 --> 00:47:07.440
what's happening next then
to just again hack it out.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.430
The good news is that apparently
you guys do by my other books.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.650
This actually just landed on the
New York Times hardcover best

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:15.940
seller list.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.164
So I'm like, yes.

00:47:18.164 --> 00:47:19.610
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.770
I was like, wow, what a relief.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.690
But it seems like you
guys are willing to let

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.060
me do other things,
which is the other trap.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.250
Because the question
becomes, do people love you--

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:36.360
this is the author neurotic
thing-- do they love me for me

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.450
or do they love
me for my series?

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:39.670
Right?

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.380
Like, if I write something else,
does that something else become

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.130
like, the band
that goes, "This is

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.060
the title track
of our new album."

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.810
And everybody goes
out to go pee.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.250
Right?

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.870
Play the hits, which would be
the "Old Man's War" series.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.636
So fortunately, it
seems like you're

00:47:53.636 --> 00:47:55.010
willing to let me
do other things

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.380
and I really appreciate that.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.954
But it is a consideration.

00:47:57.954 --> 00:47:59.120
I do have a mortgage to pay.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.710
I do have a daughter who's going
to go through college one day.

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.932
I want to retire one day.

00:48:04.932 --> 00:48:05.890
All this sort of stuff.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.040
I have a hot tub.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.305
So all of these things
conspire to what

00:48:10.305 --> 00:48:11.680
things are going
to be commercial

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.350
and what things
are going to work.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:17.230
But you know, for me, I do
have the luxury of saying,

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.000
I'll get back to it
when I get back to it.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.615
So I might, after the
end of this next book,

00:48:21.615 --> 00:48:23.990
get back to the "Old Man's
War" five years down the line,

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.450
10 years down the
line, wherever.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.866
But when I get
back to it, it will

00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:28.620
be because I want to
be there as opposed

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.130
to I feel like I
have to be there.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.005
And I think this should
be the last question,

00:48:32.005 --> 00:48:34.005
and then we'll get
to the signing stuff.

00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:36.480
AUDIENCE: Can you share details
of your non-book projects

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.780
that you're working on?

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.860
JOHN SCALZI: Non-book projects?

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.270
TV, TV, you want to
know about the TV?

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.910
OK, I have two TV projects.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:50.230
One is "Old Man's War,"
which is going to be at SyFy.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.640
Which apparently fills a
lot of people with terror.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.620
They're like, SyFy,
they do wrestling.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.870
They don't do science fiction.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.328
No, they actually have started
doing science fiction again.

00:49:01.328 --> 00:49:04.270
They've got "The Expanse"
series by James S A Corey,

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:07.560
"The Magicians" by Lev
Grossman, yeah, right?

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.650
Yeah.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.040
I'm excited about it, too, sir.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.000
And then, of course,
my book series as well.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.060
So they seem to be going
all-in about actually living up

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.490
to their network name.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.910
That's going to be positive.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.990
"Redshirts" has
been optioned by FX

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.349
as a mini series, which is
kind of cool because they've

00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:26.140
been doing really well
with the miniseries.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.300
They've just got
nominated for-- and I

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:33.360
think have won-- quite a few
Emmys for their "Fargo" series,

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.710
as an example of that.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.530
And those are at the
writing stage right now.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.761
I've met with the writers for
the "Old Man's War" series.

00:49:41.761 --> 00:49:43.260
Which is also another
reason why I'm

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.380
OK to step back, because in the
meantime, while I'm thinking

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:51.630
about where it goes next, you'll
have these guys dribbling out

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.740
new episodes of whatever's going
on in the "Old Man's War" world

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.400
and that will be kind of fun.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.550
And it's fascinating,
because, you know,

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.130
it's a completely
different medium.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.710
You understand when you go
into that the book is not

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.830
going to be the TV
series, and the TV series

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.437
is not going to be the book.

00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:08.020
And the changes that
they have to make

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.614
because the storytelling
is different.

00:50:10.614 --> 00:50:12.280
The fact that they
actually have to work

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.821
within certain
budgetary constraints,

00:50:13.821 --> 00:50:15.170
and so on and so forth.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.960
And just the way
that that all works.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.460
And people are like,
are you worried

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.870
about them changing your books?

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.800
And I'm like, no,
because they're not

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.450
going to change books.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.650
The books are over here.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.670
They will always
remain the same.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.100
I own the copyright on those,
they ain't changing, right?

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.450
But what they do do will
be kind of interesting.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.850
Now, if they're successful,
it doesn't matter.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:36.380
Because what they do to the
series in some sort of way,

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.400
because the books will take off.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:45.540
Like, you may have heard of
this guy, George Martin, right?

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:50.640
He's got this little series on
HBO called "Game of Thrones."

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.370
His books are just
this huge clot

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:57.980
at the top of the best
seller lists in paperback.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.710
It's like every
month, in and out,

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.900
you've got all like--
four out of the six

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.060
books-- I think there's
six, how many books now?

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.340
Five?

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.840
You guys would know.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.950
Four out of the five--
there's always right up there

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:15.590
at the top.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.350
And the thing is that, the
fact that they can just

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.120
wait until season six or
whatever or season five comes

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.910
out doesn't stop the
books from selling.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.954
So I'm kind of looking
forward to that, you know?

00:51:26.954 --> 00:51:29.610
Because then I will take this
hot tub that I just bought

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.200
and I will fill
it full of money.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.726
I'll just sit there and
rub the money on me.

00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:36.720
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.960
Just like that.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.890
So that will be really positive.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.270
So that's one thing.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.430
I'm also working on a video
game called "Midnight Star"

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:52.850
with Industrial Toys, which is
a first-person-shooter that's

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.280
designed for tablets.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.610
So can play a
first-person-shooter literally

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:57.370
with one hand.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:59.710
So on hand holding the
tablet, the other one

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.420
killing all the aliens
and stuff like that.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.090
One of the principals
of Industrial Toys

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.200
is Alex Seropian, who co-founded
Bungie and co-created Halo.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.230
So when he called me
up and was like, hey,

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.550
would you like to do
this video game with me?

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.160
I was like, that seems
an acceptable risk.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.370
So that will
actually hopefully be

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.670
out in the next couple months.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.360
And I've seen it
and I've played it.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.557
And it's a hell of a lot of fun.

00:52:24.557 --> 00:52:26.390
And that's what I'm
going to say about that.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.140
Well, we are at the
two o'clock hour.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.740
And what I will do now is I
will go to the back of the room

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.170
and I will happily
sign your books.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:36.920
Thank you all for
coming and spending

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.000
your free hour with me.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.150
[APPLAUSE]
