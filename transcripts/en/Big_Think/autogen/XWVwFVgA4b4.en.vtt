okay well the destination implies an
ethic and then you need to be able to

pursuing it and then if you're a leader
 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.760
pursuing it and then if you're a leader
well first of all you have that

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770
well first of all you have that
 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.169
well first of all you have that
established but the second is that you

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179
established but the second is that you
 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.080
established but the second is that you
can communicate that okay and then you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
can communicate that okay and then you
 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.760
can communicate that okay and then you
communicate that in the manner that also

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770

appeals to others other people's sense
of purpose and so you'd say to someone

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810
of purpose and so you'd say to someone
 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.219
of purpose and so you'd say to someone
like if I wanted to move forward with

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229
like if I wanted to move forward with
 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.889

you on an enterprise I would have to say

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899
you on an enterprise I would have to say
 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.060
you on an enterprise I would have to say
well here's the purpose of the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070
well here's the purpose of the
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.649
well here's the purpose of the
enterprise and here's the reasons that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659
enterprise and here's the reasons that
 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.440
enterprise and here's the reasons that
it's not only eminently justifiable but

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
it's not only eminently justifiable but
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.300
it's not only eminently justifiable but
more justifiable than anything else we

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
more justifiable than anything else we
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.510
more justifiable than anything else we
could be doing at the same time and then

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
could be doing at the same time and then
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.950
could be doing at the same time and then
I'd have to say well here's what's in it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960
I'd have to say well here's what's in it
 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.590
I'd have to say well here's what's in it
for me and here's what's in it for you

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600
for me and here's what's in it for you
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.919
for me and here's what's in it for you
and here's why the two of us together

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929
and here's why the two of us together
 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.959
and here's why the two of us together
can further the enterprise and further

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969
can further the enterprise and further
 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.730
can further the enterprise and further
what's in it for you and further for

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
what's in it for you and further for
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.279
what's in it for you and further for
what what's in it for me and then you

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289
what what's in it for me and then you
 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.260
what what's in it for me and then you
you have a situation there that Piaget

assign everyone their parts and then
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.649

they manifest the play and that's how

do that is say look here's the goal

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
do that is say look here's the goal

conscientiousness then people will

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819
conscientiousness then people will
 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.179
conscientiousness then people will
participate in the game voluntarily you

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189
participate in the game voluntarily you
 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.780
participate in the game voluntarily you
don't have to overlord them and so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790
don't have to overlord them and so
 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.429
don't have to overlord them and so
that's that's well and if you have any

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439
that's that's well and if you have any
 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.140
that's that's well and if you have any
experience in the world at all in

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150
experience in the world at all in
 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.920
experience in the world at all in
complex processes you know that that's

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930
complex processes you know that that's
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.499
complex processes you know that that's
the optimal circumstances under which to

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:56.509
the optimal circumstances under which to
 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.749
the optimal circumstances under which to
engage with other people it's like hey

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759
engage with other people it's like hey
 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.460
engage with other people it's like hey
we're all in the same boat we're going

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470
we're all in the same boat we're going
 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.990
we're all in the same boat we're going
somewhere interesting everyone's got a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000
somewhere interesting everyone's got a
 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.059
somewhere interesting everyone's got a
role to play we're all in this together

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069
role to play we're all in this together
 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.240
role to play we're all in this together
and it's working out for each of us as

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250
and it's working out for each of us as
 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.879
and it's working out for each of us as
well now there's a there's a corollary

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889
well now there's a there's a corollary
 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.369
well now there's a there's a corollary
to that which is an interesting one so

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379
to that which is an interesting one so
 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.499
to that which is an interesting one so
imagine this so let's say you have your

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:14.509
imagine this so let's say you have your
 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.210
imagine this so let's say you have your
organization and you have your goals and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220
organization and you have your goals and
 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.219
organization and you have your goals and
you and your you're out to do something

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229
you and your you're out to do something
 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.229
you and your you're out to do something
worthwhile and you can tell a good story

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239
worthwhile and you can tell a good story
 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.089
worthwhile and you can tell a good story
about that so you've got people on board

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099
about that so you've got people on board
 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.459
about that so you've got people on board
now you really want to get people on

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:24.469
now you really want to get people on
 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.740
now you really want to get people on
board and so now you've got two choices

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750
board and so now you've got two choices
 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.650
board and so now you've got two choices
you could you could tell people

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660
you could you could tell people
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.530
you could you could tell people
go home and spend four or five hours and

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540
go home and spend four or five hours and
 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.190
go home and spend four or five hours and

includes your job at this organization
as a subset all right and then you run

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
as a subset all right and then you run
 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.240
as a subset all right and then you run
imagine you do that with a hundred

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250
imagine you do that with a hundred
 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.490
imagine you do that with a hundred
people in each group then you run those

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500
people in each group then you run those

people in a head-to-head competition for
a year to see who's more most productive

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190
a year to see who's more most productive
 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.300
a year to see who's more most productive
the answer the people who formulated a

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310
the answer the people who formulated a
 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.640
the answer the people who formulated a
plan for their life they're ten percent

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650
plan for their life they're ten percent
 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.920
plan for their life they're ten percent
more productive so you can gain a 10

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930
more productive so you can gain a 10

out a plan for their life we have a
 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.100
out a plan for their life we have a
program like that called future

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110
program like that called future
 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.810
program like that called future
authoring online that thousands of

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820
authoring online that thousands of
 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.730
authoring online that thousands of
people have done now that increased the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740
people have done now that increased the
 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.380
people have done now that increased the
probability that university students

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390
probability that university students
 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.440
probability that university students
would stay in university by 30 percent

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450
would stay in university by 30 percent
 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.610
would stay in university by 30 percent
so and that's part of the narrative

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620
so and that's part of the narrative
 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.860
so and that's part of the narrative

like if they can't do that for their
 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.410
like if they can't do that for their
life what the hell makes you think

they're gonna do that for your
 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.640
they're gonna do that for your
organization and then you want them to

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650
organization and then you want them to
 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.870
organization and then you want them to
see how working for you serves their

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880
see how working for you serves their
 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.080
see how working for you serves their
higher-order purpose and if it doesn't

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090
higher-order purpose and if it doesn't
 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.000
higher-order purpose and if it doesn't
because maybe they can't formulate that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010
because maybe they can't formulate that

that hierarchical really integrated
hierarchical relationship well then they

hierarchical relationship well then they

should find another job
 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.230
should find another job
right because that isn't the job for

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240
right because that isn't the job for
