00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.470
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.940
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.650
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and entering

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.590
the code name,
Rogan,

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.450
you will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men.

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
Both Brian and I have used them.
They're awesome.
People love them.
Great.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.960
Don't say that Brian,
cause that's not true.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.120
Are you allowed to suck on them and like is it poisonous?

9
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:30.900
Like is there any powder on it?
90% mineral oil out here.
So you could,

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.480
you could tell you eat it if you wanted to.
It's not recommended.

11
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.480
Now we met our friend Aubrey,
the artist formerly known as Chris through a,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.050
the fleshlight who is now optimus prime.
And you said a recent experience?
Yeah,

13
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.510
we don't know if he's changed his name again.
Um,

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.740
it was Chris and then he had a crazy psychedelic experience and that made him

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.980
change his name to his middle name,
which was his grandfather's name.
So that's,

16
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:56.100
that's the,
that's it.
The genesis behind the Aubrey name.

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.010
Just for future reference,
what is your grandmother's name?
Bonnie.

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000
She's the one here on the on the arm.
So you're bonding or lost.

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.850
So you put it,
you say it's real coffee Bonnie.
Right.

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000
It's getting a little boy,
man try that domain.

21
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.330
Johnny got how many times you can only change your name once after that.

22
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:19.530
Like you can't keep fucking around,
right?
Yeah.
People are don't allow that.

23
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:22.820
Like they'll let you do it once.
Even once they're like what?
How old are you?

24
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.510
You know,

25
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.360
I mean I would have changed my name if I knew you could do prior to there was a

26
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.380
real practical element too cause I was actually born my father after I was named

27
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:34.800
after my father ceremoniously Michael,
so like the bank and all that shit.

28
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.320
They would call me Michael,
which was super annoying because I was Chris,

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.930
so I just decided drawing the line in the sand.
I'm choosing one,

30
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.420
my middle name Auburn.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.680
But the spiritual thing actually led me to choose that one versus than just

32
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:49.830
changing my name officially.
You should never say the spiritual thing.

33
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.220
Like you should really be like super clear as to what the fuck you're talking

34
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:57.210
about.
Unless you already know because people could like,
take that out of quote.

35
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.180
Here's a recent quote by Aubrey Micro Margaret.
So the spiritual thing,
yeah.

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.650
Made me change and just,
sorry to go on so far,

37
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.540
the practice of the type of man you want running your business.
Well,

38
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.250
what he means by the spiritual thing.

39
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.820
And so life changing Iowasca experience,

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.040
they have it at pier one didn't get that block chain.

41
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.860
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh and it makers of Alpha brain

42
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.630
and a Alpha brain,
my favorite,
uh,
nootropic supplement.

43
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:32.100
And Aubrey also makes that as well.
So that's crazy.
What a coincidence.

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.350
That doesn't even make sense.
This is a board meeting.
No commercial,

45
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.350
Bro.
You know how we do it.
Our commercials are fucking stupid,

46
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.610
but that's the only way to get through them.
I need more of that new alpha brain.

47
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620
I don't have,
do you have any,
what would you,

48
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.810
why don't you explain now for brand new people since you're the,

49
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.000
you're the man behind the shed.
Explain it.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

50
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.800
what we were trying to do is create,
you know,

51
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.580
concentrated nutrients that would help many different types of
neurotransmitters.

52
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.950
Lift them all up without getting your too out of balance.

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.080
<v 1>So we really focused on Acetylcholine,</v>

54
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.350
a bumping up your acetylcholine levels with two Perseus Harada,

55
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.540
which is an Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor,

56
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.470
which helps prevent the breakdown of a acetylcholine and then boosting it up

57
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.190
with Alpha GPC,
a very potent bioavailable form of Coleen.

58
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.560
So that's going to raise your acetylcholine levels,

59
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:22.060
which is what accounts for sharpness,
acuity,
just kind of being on your game.
Um,

60
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.170
but some of the,
some of the downside of that is people can get a little hyper,

61
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.870
they can get a little manic.
So we put some anxiety,

62
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.200
lytic anti-stress herbs in there,
uh,
as well oat Straw and a few other things.

63
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.840
A gabba stimulating herbs as well.

64
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.160
And then combine that with a bunch of super strong antioxidants to kind of

65
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.710
eliminate that,
the clutter in your mind,

66
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:45.940
that kind of fog that you get when you're just having to deal with an oxidating

67
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.470
uh,
effects and um,
put it all together to make a,

68
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.290
what we call a balanced nootropics tropics here.

69
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.720
<v 0>What's the deal with Gabba?
Cause I've seen arguments that Gaba is not,</v>

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.870
it doesn't,
it's not bio available when you,
when you ingest it,
there's,

71
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.840
there's some research yeah.

72
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.340
<v 1>Points to um,</v>

73
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.360
nutritional Gabba not being able to effectively cross the blood brain barrier.

74
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.610
There's kind of studies on both side of the fence.

75
00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:15.170
Some say that the blood brain barrier is leaky and so that using actual Gabba

76
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.250
even if it only comes in,
you know,
in small amounts is still effective.

77
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.690
Other people say no,
no,
it's a fucking,
it's the wall of China.
Nobody's getting,

78
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.991
you know,

79
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:27.470
nobody's getting through the blood brain barrier kind of arguments on both side.

80
00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:31.760
I think in our future formulations were going to use for more [inaudible] in

81
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:32.660
conjunction as well,

82
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.470
which is definitely operates similarly on the Gaba mechanism and that way we'll

83
00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:40.730
have,
uh,
have our bases covered.
But I'm part of the inclusion for Gaba is,

84
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.370
you know,
like all the things is,
you know,
we take it,

85
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.960
we give it to people to take on its own and um,
they felt that,
you know,

86
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:48.230
they notice the difference.
So

87
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.620
<v 0>because there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that it works.
Absolutely.
Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.540
Do there's been studies,
even the,
that show that it works.
I don't,
you know,
I've,

89
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.640
I've really haven't experienced it.
I'm not sure.
You know,

90
00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:02.360
I've never really just taken straight Gaba.
Yeah.
And tried to,
you know,

91
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.180
it's supposed to calm you down though.
That's the idea behind the important,

92
00:05:05.181 --> 00:05:08.840
there are four important neurotransmitters,
so if it's not available that way,

93
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.480
how else,
how can people get it?
Well,
I'll,
theologian operates

94
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.650
<v 1>pretty closely with that mechanism,
kind of like Al tyrosines operates on the,</v>

95
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:20.120
on the l Dopa mechanism and some other things that we were using,
um,
as well.

96
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.040
Uh,
it's hard to get,

97
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:24.920
I mean the pharmaceuticals have done actually a very good job with the Gaba

98
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.400
formula.
They created something called Gabapentin and that,
um,

99
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.820
and that definitely by changing it,
that helps it cross the blood brain barrier.

100
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.220
But it's a trickier one as far as nutrition.

101
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:38.810
But I think the combination of Lte and nene and nutritional Gabba a is going to

102
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:42.140
be,
is going to be the best bet and I think we're going to have a even better

103
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.520
results than we currently have.

104
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.050
<v 0>What do you say to people that are worried about this shit?
People that go,
well,</v>

105
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.950
what are you doing man?
You're taking these weird nutrients and they're,
they're,

106
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.440
they're,
they're changing your,
your brain levels like,
but what are you doing?

107
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.420
Well,
you know,
it can be dangerous.
Yeah,

108
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.040
well all food is changing about your body.

109
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.450
<v 1>You know,
every type of food you eat,</v>

110
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.740
if you're having a greasy hamburger that's causing a certain effect,
does it,

111
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.070
what this is doing is basically concentrating really hard to get nutrients that

112
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.230
if you were following a special diet,
you know,

113
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.380
you could try and target and try and go after,
but we can't do it.

114
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.450
It's just doesn't make sense.
So you know,

115
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.520
by doing this we're giving ourselves an advantage.

116
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.730
It's like putting extra tools in your kit.
You know,

117
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.590
if you want to really be sharp and heightened these levels.
Yeah,

118
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.270
you could go out and find different things,

119
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.090
tons of things with natural levels of Coleen in it,
you know,

120
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.770
hit some less than like a madman and do a bunch of things like that.
Or you know,

121
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.970
because of our busy lives,

122
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.790
because we have other shit to do than go out and pound a bunch of less than,

123
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.610
you know,
we put these together in a nutritional supplement.

124
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.840
So it's just another tool in your kit.
Now you want a sick workout.

125
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.000
We have a formula for that.
You want to get it,
you know,
get your brain on it.

126
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.390
We got something there for that.

127
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:49.880
It's just extra tools in your toolkit that you can use and and go to whenever

128
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:50.630
you need to.

129
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.150
<v 0>That's Alpha brain advertisement ever.</v>

130
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.210
I always thought Gabba was that big green monster with the long arms that Gabba

131
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.990
Gabba Yo Gabba Gabba Gabba oh,
it's name is Yo Gabba.
Gabba yeah,

132
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.000
I thought that whole time that really up Gabba Gabba Gabba has a hit song called

133
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.470
don't bite your friends.
Yeah.

134
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.180
That's like one of those things where I've heard it.

135
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.500
I've heard Yo Gabba Gabba but I never really knew what it was.

136
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.180
It's this right here.
See Picture,
I think.
Oh Wow.
See,

137
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.230
I always thought that was gal.
That's weird.
I thought it.

138
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.560
I thought Alpha brain had that in it.
It's weird now.

139
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.910
Suddenly cut little pieces of it.

140
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.530
Reach you in the culture again or heard the name somehow over and over again.

141
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.940
It gets a kid show,
right?
It's awesome kid show.
Isn't that an adventure time?

142
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:35.380
My two favorite things.
Seriously.
All right.

143
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.520
Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t.
N,
a.
Checkout all the different supplements.

144
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.650
Where's I'm shroom tech sport from tech,
immune,
new mood,
all cool stuff,

145
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.070
all explained in depth and if you enter in the code name Rogan,

146
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.910
you will get 10% off.
All right?
Actually right now to,

147
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.380
we want people to try these four minutes so every 30 count is 35% off.

148
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:59.660
If you just get the 35 count,
30 count bottle,

149
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.490
you sound like a salesman [inaudible] percent off,

150
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.860
but it's a good deal.
We just want you to try.

151
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.080
These are actually cool tools and we should also tell people that the first

152
00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:15.081
three 30 pills we offer a 100% money back guarantee and the idea behind it,

153
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.850
and one of the cool things about doing business with you and knowing you as a

154
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:23.930
human being is that we're way more concerned with making sure that no one ever

155
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:26.840
feels ripped off than we are with making money.
It's the number one thing,

156
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.810
so we couldn't make it any easier.
Try it.

157
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.060

You know you have to return the pills.
He's just,
that's it.

158
00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:35.260
Just let us know.
We'll give you your money back.
Yeah.
We just,

159
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.860
we just try to do the right thing and we're doing and,

160
00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:42.440
and sone things that we actually take and believe in.
All right.
Halacha boy.
Yeah,

161
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.310
I'm Marcus is in the House,
Ladies and gentlemen.
We're going to experience,

162
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.010
<v 2>try my day job.
You block gas by night.
All Day.</v>

163
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.490
<v 3>We're going deep kids deep to the dark jungles of Costa Rica deep.</v>

164
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.740
Ooh,
you were in Costa Rica.

165
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.690
You were in Costa Rica.
You just returned.
Yeah.
And you had,
uh,

166
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.740
you went to an Ibogaine retreat.

167
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.890
If you don't know what I began is I began,

168
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:23.080
it's the stuff that hunter s Thompson accused a,

169
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.890
one of the guys who's running for president of being on,

170
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.240
and I was like in 1970 or whatever the hell it was to governor,

171
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.130
I believe it was McGovern or was he former governor?
I don't remember.

172
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.560
But if you watch the movie Gonzo,
uh,

173
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.070
the life and work of a hunter s Thompson,

174
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.970
they go into detail about how he just started saying that this guy was,
uh,

175
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.260
taken Ibogaine and that he was brilliant bringing in a Brazilian doctor.

176
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.550
He's just made up this shit and put it in the rolling stone and fucking people

177
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.420
were believing it.
And so everybody would go,
I think it's Ed Muskie.

178
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:01.610
I think that's the guy's name.
And everybody would go and watch this guy,
uh,

179
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.880
have speeches.

180
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:07.170
And he was having psychological meltdowns because hunter kept accusing him of

181
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:09.700
being on Ibogaine.
Yeah.
And so he would have,

182
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.330
there was this really crazy rambling speeches,

183
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.920
these campaign speeches where it's clearly a man who's just been deeply affected

184
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:18.810
by this fucked up thing that's happened to them.

185
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.450
Some guys just accused him of being on like some crazy psychedelic drug and the

186
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:27.240
guy just,
you know,
the pressure of the campaign and all that just crushed him.

187
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.540
It could just crush them.
But I began was the shit that was,

188
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:34.770
that was what a hundred shows that would be a very difficult drug to function
on.

189
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.480
I mean,
it is a challenge to lie on your back,
let alone give a speech.

190
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.280
Let's just put it that way.
What is the idea behind it?
It's,

191
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.280
it's been used in other cultures for eons.
Right.
So the origin of it,

192
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.290
they found a,
there's a legend surrounding,
you know,
uh,

193
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.490
a porcupine that found it was knowing on a tree and then the shaman,
you know,

194
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.860
came and brought it home to his wife to cook and the wife ate the porcupine and

195
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:03.090
just started tripping out and have this intense visions and encounters with

196
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.640
deities and understanding,
you know,

197
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:08.040
truth about things in a way that was never possible.

198
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.610
And the Shaman goes back to his wife.
I was like,
Holy Shit,
what's going on here?

199
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.830
And uh,
and then so you know,

200
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:17.220
they look back where they trapped the porcupine and was eating the bark of this

201
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:20.310
particular tree.
And the tree was the Boga tree,

202
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:24.330
which grows in a gap bone in Africa.
And so the Shaman took it,

203
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.900
got it directly from the source and started using the medicine and the it Bo got

204
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.600
booty tradition was born,

205
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.040
which is where the main shamonic tradition is.

206
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.520
And part of the shamanic tradition that I went to go see down in Costa Rica,

207
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:41.880
I went to see a gentleman who was a 10th generation.

208
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.970
We t Sharman straight out of Gabon.
So,
uh,

209
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.180
that's where it was initially founded.
And then it's got,

210
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:52.410
it gets a lot more press actually for,
it's,
um,
kind of drug rehab use.

211
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.640
There's a lot of,
for rehabilitation

212
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 1>for like heroin addicts and a in different people like that.
And that's,</v>

213
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.490
they generally isolate the alkaloid ibogaine out of the Iboga root when they do

214
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:07.150
that.
So it's not quite the same as what we did.
We did a partial extraction,

215
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:08.560
so it was like half a bowl game,

216
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.880
but still had a lot of the full alkaloids of the,
uh,
of the,
of group.

217
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.111
But the clinics,

218
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:18.490
they just focus on the Ibogaine and have an amazingly high a success rate with

219
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.720
detox situations.

220
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.220
And I actually saw a gentleman down there at the Boga house where I went,

221
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.460
who showed up addicted to heroin and then just had a harrowing brutal like three

222
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:35.881
and a half day at bogus session and came out and he was on top of the world.

223
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.660
I mean really,
you know,
obviously the mold is what is the condo?
It's actually a,

224
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.840
it's a,
it's a bark.
Yeah.
But what is the actual,
you know,

225
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.080
ingredients are that the medicine side of that's making it?
Yeah,

226
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.580
it's an alkaloid actually.

227
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:53.110
So it's the Ibogaine alkaloid is the main alkaloid and then alkaloid is found in

228
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.350
the bark and in the roots of this particular tree that has this weird pepper

229
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.950
shaped fruit grows on it.
So what does it do with you?
Yeah,

230
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.570
well it's um,
you know,
the,

231
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:08.770
the interesting thing about a boga that separates it from everything else,

232
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:11.830
and I'll tell my full experience as well,
but um,

233
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.430
Thea Boga Schamens in the way they talk about it is completely different than

234
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:19.030
the Iowasca Shama I WASC a Shaman's talk about going farther.

235
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.520
Everything is about exploring other dimensions,

236
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:24.610
going beyond and bringing back information from those dimensions.

237
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.910
And the Bui Schamens they talk about going deeper,

238
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.170
like going farther inside yourself because inside of you is a soul that has

239
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.670
access to infinite knowledge.

240
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.620
So you can actually go inside yourself and find out the truth to virtually

241
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.540
anything without having to go outside.

242
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.830
So it's a whole different kind of paradigm has holy Shit.
And you know,

243
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.440
I really,
I mean as we'll get into my story,
the lucidity on a bogus,

244
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.610
unreal like nothing you've ever experienced.

245
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:55.720
It's almost like Iowasca when you're going farther and trying to pee,
you know,

246
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:57.970
trying to get information from these other dimensions.

247
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.410
There's a translation issue.

248
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.400
So sometimes it smashes against your perception and all you see are webs and

249
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:08.080
colors and figures and spirit teachers and weird shit cause you can understand

250
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:12.040
the information from beyond.
But at Boga it's like yourself talking to you.

251
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:15.700
It's like the best version of you just telling you what the fuck is up.

252
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.590
And you're like,
there's like no translation issue,
inner voice.
It's like that.

253
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.190
But it's like a,

254
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.390
it's like the ruthless inner voice of truth that you just can't fudge with it.

255
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.610
You can,
I mean,
there's no even arguing,

256
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.710
like there's some things that are uncomfortable to think about.

257
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.220
Like you don't want to look at them and it'll just be like,
stop,
stop,

258
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.250
stop bullshitting.
You know?
It's just ruthless.
I mean,

259
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.520
it's been compared to dealing with your stern father.
Well,
you know,

260
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:43.060
I mean that's not a paradigm that I use because that wasn't just how I grew up.

261
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:44.860
But I think for a lot of people,
you know,

262
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:48.310
that kind of voice of res w reason that's just,
you know,

263
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:51.710
not letting you slide and not letting you slack on anything comes in.

264
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:56.560
And that's really what you experience on the,
uh,
on the Boga.
Scared.
I'm scared.

265
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.200
Just listen to bark now.

266
00:14:58.201 --> 00:15:01.250
Or are you like all different kinds of bars is a brutal experience.

267
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:05.120
Like I wast guts,
pageantry.
It's ceremony.
You get a flush.
Yeah,

268
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:08.450
you get a little nauseous.
It's fun.
It bogus.
Fucking intense.

269
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:11.910
Like is there anything else now?
They mix it with anything else?
We did fun.

270
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.080
It is not,
I mean,
it is a brutal,
harrowing experience.

271
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.890
Like did you do it again or would you be scared of,
yeah,
I would do it again,

272
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:22.880
but whoa.
It's only because of the amazing gains that you get.
I mean it's,

273
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.060
it's a ridiculously brutal experience.
And I'll,

274
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.230
I mean I guess I might as well just kind of get you guys into the story to tell

275
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.860
about all the physical,
a downside of it.
But it's rough.
I mean,

276
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:37.580
you're nauseous as fuck.
You're dizzy,
you know,
you can't walk,

277
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:42.350
you can't hardly drink water for,
you know,
24 hours.
You're on it forever.

278
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.150
You know,
it is not comfortable and not fun.
And it's like,
it's intense.

279
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:49.120
But that access to truth,
you know,

280
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.650
if you're trying to figure something out unparalleled,

281
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.660
that's like going on the biggest roller coaster.

282
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.400
I know things I [inaudible] good.
So

283
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.630
sounds like you lived the perfect life so that you never have to go through that

284
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.000
too.
Hey,
I have to die one.

285
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.380
Be the nicest person you could ever be in every possible situation.

286
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.430
Always do the right thing.
So you never have to take your boat.

287
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.180
And that's kind of,
you know,
there's funny,
the Shaman,
Shawn's very,

288
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.390
he's very kind of straightforward and he talks to you like a normal,

289
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.330
like most of these good shamans do.
They're not like pseudo spiritual.

290
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.940
They're not trying to create an aura of mysticism.

291
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.180
They're joking with you more than anybody.
They're lighthearted.

292
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.570
So he's joking around and he was talking about the guy who was detoxing from

293
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.650
heroin.
He's like,

294
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.430
I gave him enough that he will never want to do heroin again cause he's never

295
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:36.980
going to want to go through this shit.
And that's part of it.
I mean,

296
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.550
it's such a savage process that when they get out,

297
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:43.490
they're like not only have they learned things from the Voice of truth,

298
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.100
learn why they were doing it,
learn why they shouldn't do it,

299
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:47.390
and learn what it's doing in their body.

300
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.240
They just don't want to go have to see this dude again.

301
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.240
Who's going to just put them through the gauntlet.
Oh my God.

302
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:56.080
So it lasts 24 hours at least.
Geez.

303
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.540
There was people there who were up for three days.
So very similar to pod.

304
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.400
It will like the same kind of,
it's not similar to fucking anything.

305
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.240
Do I just care?
It's,
it was,
it was unreal.
So,
so I'll,

306
00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:12.260
I'll tell you how it kind of goes about.
We go fly in the library.

307
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:16.310
I get picked up Liberia,
Liberia,
Costa Rica.
Yeah.
The northern airport.

308
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:20.780
Nice little like Africa.
Yeah,
it does.
It does.
Um,
get picked up,
get set in,

309
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.500
got a beautiful place like a ton of acres,
fruit trees,
coconuts.

310
00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:27.920
You can cut off and drink the coconut water straight out of the coconut or

311
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:30.830
Poland fruit out of there.
It's like really nice set up,
you know,
and,

312
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.460
and find lodgings there's like a,

313
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.530
a lodging place for the people who were getting treated and going through the

314
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:37.490
ceremonies.
And then there's the,

315
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.170
in his house with his wife and his little baby are great.
And so,
uh,
we get in,

316
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.090
um,
first day we have our,

317
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.720
we just get a climatize and then we do what's called a spiritual shower,

318
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.180
which is kind of very similar across most mnemonic traditions.

319
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:54.720
It's kind of preparing you for that.
So we go to the Stream,
um,

320
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.590
did a ceremony where we put some intention into some leaves and let them kind of

321
00:17:58.591 --> 00:17:59.460
flow through the river.

322
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.120
And I was impressed with the sham and then he did it with a lot of earnesty and

323
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.570
it felt just very,
very honest,
you know,

324
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.760
about what he was doing and just kind of preparing you,
um,

325
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.210
traditionally for what you're about to go through.
And then that night,

326
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.410
around seven 30,
we sit around there and we're in a little circle and uh,

327
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.230
he starts talking and he starts talking,
you know,

328
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.090
just generally about basically faith based experience and experience based

329
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:28.470
spirituality and just kind of railing against people who just believe things on

330
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:30.810
faith.
He says,
you know,
in our culture,

331
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.520
if we can't share that experience of multiple people can't get it.
It's bullshit.

332
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.630
You know?
And he was like pointing,
he was talking about astrology.
It's like spam.

333
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.370
People want to tell me that that star is going to make me feel a certain way.

334
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.830
Okay.
You know,
I'll go find out.
I'll go check,

335
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.190
I'll go see if that star doesn't give me anything.
Well,

336
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.610
I'm not going to believe it.
You know,
it's,
it's not,
it's not truth for me,

337
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.091
you know,

338
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:56.091
and that they have this very much kind of like a show me a kind of philosophy on

339
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:56.851
their spirituality,

340
00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:00.000
which is very similar to what I encountered encountered in Peru as well when

341
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:01.040
they were talking,
you know,

342
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.510
very esoteric stuff about the weed or coach and about the soul leaving the body

343
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:07.920
and was like,
how do you know,
like,
oh,
we see it stupid,
you know,

344
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:11.790
like we see that happen and it's repeatable,
at least to them.
It's repeatable,

345
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:15.840
are not saying is native to a gap bone in Africa.

346
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.380
So,
and it's actually,
it's legal in,

347
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:20.810
in Costa Rica and a lot of South American countries,

348
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:25.070
legal in the UK as well actually.
Um,
but,
um,
but it comes out of Africa,

349
00:19:25.071 --> 00:19:27.780
so they just ship it over and he prepares it in the same way.

350
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:31.230
They ship them the whole bark and he,
uh,
he does the preparations on it.

351
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.310
So we're going in this little speech and he gives us one pill and you know,

352
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.110
looks like about a gram and a half capital kind of a horse capsule with a brown

353
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.860
kind of powder in it.
And then he keeps talking and you know,

354
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:47.880
kind of talking in is in about different things.
Just pretty normal things.

355
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:50.280
He was talking about how hope is a prison,
you know,

356
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:53.940
hope traps people as much as fear because people sit around hoping for
something,

357
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.280
Oh,
I hope this is going to happen.
You know,

358
00:19:56.281 --> 00:20:00.000
instead of just going out and doing it and they have a real kind of tradition

359
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:02.850
where it's like,
if you want something,
you know,
you manifest it,

360
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:05.640
you believe in it,
you've set your intent and you go fucking get it.

361
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.970
Like don't sit around hoping for something cool to happen.

362
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.700
Like that's just not the way they work.
So he was,

363
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:14.250
it was some cool stuff that he's talking about it,
what's going on for a while.

364
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:17.310
Then he passed around another pill and he didn't know how much he was going to

365
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:19.320
give us.
He kind of feels it out.
Uh,

366
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.660
as you go and kind of assess as you and what you need.

367
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.410
So we take a another horse pill and it's partially a straw extracted,

368
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.940
Ibogaine mixed with the Iboga root.
So getting some combination of both.

369
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.970
He also gives some people spoonfuls of the actual bark,

370
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.140
but that's more for a physical detox,
I think under what he was talking about.

371
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:39.570
It makes you even more nauseous,
which more nauseous.

372
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.560
I can't even fucking imagine how terrible that is.
So is there,
anyway,

373
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:48.160
so we start to,
it's been about an hour,
like a good hour a half since we took it.

374
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.190
And I'm still not feeling anything and I'm starting to get a little cocky and

375
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:53.890
I'm thinking,
Oh man,
you know,
maybe I'm just so experienced,

376
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.950
maybe this is not gonna not gonna hit me.
You know,

377
00:20:57.951 --> 00:21:00.270
when to start worrying that maybe he didn't give me too.

378
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.570
You didn't give me enough.
So I'm thinking all that,
but,
and then,
you know,

379
00:21:03.571 --> 00:21:07.270
as they're doing it with my fiance and uh,
and she started to drop,

380
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:08.710
like she started to feel it,
right?

381
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.790
So she moves over to the bed and she's feeling a lot of things.

382
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.560
She's certainly not as experienced as me.

383
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:16.840
So she started to feel a lot of weird things and I'm like,

384
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.110
I'm really not feeling it.
You know,
I'm not not quite there yet.

385
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.560
And the Shamina one of the traditions in,

386
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.910
in the it bogus ceremonies is you talk to different people,

387
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.700
you talk to get direct access to talk to their souls.

388
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.720
They say so whether they're alive or dead,
you just have conversations with them.

389
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.590
And that's like one of the main staples of the tradition of their spirituality.

390
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.220
So he's still whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What?
Yeah.
So that's so you,

391
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.400
whether they're alive or dead,
you're talking to them.
Yeah.

392
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.400
It's almost like you're talking to them.
This is what they believe.
Now,

393
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.190
now I'm gonna,
I'm gonna put a disclaimer out there,

394
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:54.280
but in the state you felt this as well.
Yeah.
And I'll tell you,

395
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:56.290
I'll tell you how it,
how it goes a little later.

396
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:58.810
Cause at this point I didn't feel anything right.

397
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.180
So he was trying to ask and you should prepare these questions.

398
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:03.430
It's different from another ceremony to other ceremonies.

399
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:04.540
You prepare your intent,

400
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.000
what you want to get out of it pretty much across the board,

401
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:08.450
whether it's mushrooms,
Payoti,

402
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.190
Iowasca set your intent and this you do it even more focused and you actually

403
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:16.330
write questions down and questions you want to get answered.
You know,

404
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.170
of some people calling,
asking Doctor Boga,
you know,

405
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.530
cause the Boga will tell you the answer.

406
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:22.120
So he actually has you write the questions.

407
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.290
So he starts trying to ask Kaitlyn and these,
these questions and uh,

408
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.160
and she's,
you know,
she's having a tough time.
So she says,

409
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.370
so he goes over to me and he's like,
well,
why don't you,

410
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.420
why don't you respond for Kaitlin?
You know,
like have the conversation with her.

411
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.320
And I'm like,
ah,
I'm just not feeling it.
She's like,
doesn't matter.

412
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:45.670
It's not about the medicine.
Like,
you know,
you know what her soul would say,
like,

413
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:48.580
you know how to answer these questions.
And I was like,
ah,
I can't see it.

414
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.330
And he kept trying to do these visualization things and I kind of like half

415
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:56.540
imagined it,
half kind of faked it just to get through.
And I was,

416
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.830
I guess the question I was answering better than I thought I would,

417
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:04.210
but so he goes through this whole thing and then you know,

418
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.440
and then he kind of finishes with that and he smiles and I guess he had gotten

419
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:10.360
me to the point that he wanted,

420
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:14.650
which was that to realize that I didn't need to take the medicine to have access

421
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.191
to the truth.

422
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:18.310
And I think that's one of the good things about it Boga is you learn,

423
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.380
it's easier to take what you learned there and apply it elsewhere.
So then,

424
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.530
but pretty much as soon as he hit,
he was finished talking.

425
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.630
I started to feel like I'd walked into a high voltage shed and it was like an

426
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.540
intense hot buzzing around my whole body.

427
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.980
And my heart was thumping like crazy and I was like,
Holy Shit,
am I nervous?

428
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.220
Like am I freaking out here?
Like am I panicking,

429
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.380
panic attack and my heart's just boom,
boom,
boom.

430
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:49.040
I'm like thumping in my chest and he starts playing this music that's Brian's

431
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:52.910
playing right now and I'm just hammered in my chest and in the buzzing gets

432
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.990
crazy intense like around me,
like zero.

433
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.220
Like literally like I was in a high voltage tech and things start to get

434
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:04.700
nauseous.
I start to get dizzy and it feels at some point I hear,

435
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:07.470
I hear my fiance go,
I feel like I'm spinning in this Shannon.

436
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.280
Just very matter of fact that scopes make it stop.

437
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.570
And then so when I was spinning I was just like make it stop.
Okay.
And you could,

438
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.250
you had that kind of control to do it,

439
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.990
but it was miserably uncomfortable and my eyes started to get real fucked up.

440
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.720
So we had blindfolds and we lay down and then,
you know,

441
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.480
just kind of dealing with this bad experience so far as far as what I'm feeling

442
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:32.324
when I'm going through.

443
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.710
And then all of a sudden things start to crystallize a little bit more.

444
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.480
And I start to see this like almost like the only thing I can talk about it

445
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.110
being similar to is like the cursor on a Google search.

446
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.820
Like I could literally point to anything I wanted to go and any question that I

447
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:54.821
had and find answers and access that would come to me and usually in words,

448
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:58.550
but sometimes in pictures when I needed pictures.
So then I was,

449
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:03.350
I had full kind of control over this experience.
Yeah,
it was nuts.
Like,

450
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.790
and so there for air,

451
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:08.930
from there I start going through my questions and I had about 10 questions and I

452
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:13.220
start analyzing different things.
So my first question was very personal.

453
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.180
It was about what,
you know,
my own demons,
my own limitations,

454
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.130
things that were holding me back.

455
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.120
And it gave this very kind of like in depth dissertation about the different

456
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.670
aspects of myself.
So there was one aspect,

457
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:31.880
which was kind of my soul aspect,
you could call it,
if you will,

458
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:35.420
and that some people have called it your God's self,
but that's your ideal self,

459
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:38.480
that's your actualized being.
That's your soul.
You know,
the,

460
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.130
the best part of yourself,

461
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.810
but then there was the mind and the mind does all kinds of things for survival

462
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:49.430
that end up sabotaging what you're really want to do there.
What you know,

463
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.520
what Pressfield would call resistance,
you know,

464
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:56.480
all of these different games that your mind will play when it's running the ship

465
00:25:56.481 --> 00:26:00.560
and it when it's at the helm that are going to sabotage what you're trying to

466
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:04.910
get out of life and your true happiness.
For me it was,
you know,
certain fears,

467
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:08.330
certain fears of um,
you know,
bad things happening,

468
00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:11.150
fear I might get sick or fear,
I might,
you know,

469
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.470
something bad might happen or worries about this worries about future events

470
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:17.960
that didn't need to happen.
All of these worries and fears,

471
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.260
which are part of some stupid survival mechanism and you know,

472
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:25.700
these doubts that my mind had created and I realized that that wasn't really me.

473
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:28.190
That was just some apparition of my mind.

474
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.750
And so I ended up naming that part of myself,
you know,
the dominion of name.

475
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:36.410
I named it mind boy.
And that's,
that was an important,

476
00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:41.120
crucial lesson there for me is that not always are you acting under your best,

477
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.040
truest being.
You know,

478
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:48.050
sometimes you got this juvenile little stupid kid who's trying to fuck up,

479
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.500
you know,
your happiness and sabotaging you and that's your mind.

480
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.030
And so unique,
just being a,
being able to recognize that,
you know,

481
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:01.440
was able to kind of put that in its place and uh,
and make a huge difference.

482
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.850
And then of course,
the third component is,
you know,
the physical being,
your body,

483
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:10.020
the primate part of yourself.
And um,
you know,
that's,
um,

484
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.210
I think maybe in some illusion,
uh,

485
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.880
to what to being called clay before I had the image that it was mud,
you know?

486
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.140
And so I called that mud body.
And what is mud body like?
My body likes to fight,

487
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.650
my body likes to fuck,
mud,
body likes to eat,
you know,

488
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.960
he just likes the physical parts of things.

489
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:32.280
And that's the very animal side of us.
And,
and that's,
you know,

490
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:33.570
that's an important side.
I mean,

491
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:36.180
that's part of the joy and the magic of being alive.

492
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.370
But you can't get run by that shit either.
You know,

493
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:42.870
you can't be just on some obsession to cram as much pleasure into every orifice

494
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:43.410
you can,

495
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.520
either food through your mouth and coke in your nose and Dicks in your ass.

496
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:50.790
I don't know,
whatever,
whatever.
You know,
whatever mud body wants,

497
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.620
he can't just be a slave to that either.

498
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.890
And really the key is to try and let that eternal,

499
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:59.160
that best part of yourself run the show as much as possible.

500
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.020
So that right there,
that lesson,
just being able to kind of visualize that,

501
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.370
you know,
it was so simple,
but it's an experience that I'll always remember.

502
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.530
Like even driving around,
you know,

503
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:13.020
concerned about some of them that I'll have a worry,

504
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.440
I'll have a fear and I'm like,
ah,
you know,
shut the fuck up mind boy you're,

505
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.320
you know,
you're,
you're out to get out of here.
Like I don't need you right now.

506
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:23.040
And you'll be able to kind of identify what's not your best interest.

507
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:25.130
And just dispatch of it.
Right.

508
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.750
<v 4>Do you have any desire to do I would gain of course tonight,
you know,</v>

509
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.250
I think I'll,
I'm happy not feeling any of this.

510
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.120
I think that's feels like,
I think that feels like death to me.

511
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.740
That's not,
that doesn't seem happy.
Like I want to do stuff that like,

512
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.030
like makes me happy and then he's like,
shrooms makes me happy.

513
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:51.370
Molly makes me happy.
Yeah,
that's about it.
We mixed.
We have,
I think,
you know,

514
00:28:51.371 --> 00:28:52.030
depending on what and what

515
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.780
<v 1>your goals are,
but I think that uh,</v>

516
00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:01.050
all the various psychedelic experiences can offer unique perspectives on life,

517
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.040
you know?

518
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.900
But I think for sure a little different taste of each one of them is going to

519
00:29:07.901 --> 00:29:11.190
give you a different sort of a thing.
There are different,
you might,

520
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.510
different tools,
you would hate it,

521
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.190
but I bet when it was over you'd be [inaudible].
No,
it does not sound fun.

522
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.600
So fun.
It does,
it gets the whole experience as a total.

523
00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:27.100
I mean it has certainly its positives and its negatives.
But this,
this,
this,

524
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.390
you know,
so you have immense physical discomfort,
but your mind is just on fire.

525
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.000
I mean,
you're thinking things really perfectly clearly.

526
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.630
You've never eaten pot and gone into an isolation tank.
Have you?
I,

527
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.280
I did.
Actually.
I don't have a good,
I don't have a good relation.

528
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.530
<v 3>That's the only time I've done the isolation tank,
unfortunately.</v>

529
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.850
But I don't have a good relationship with,
with pot like it especially eating it.

530
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.470
No,
no.
It's just not something that I can deal.
It gives me a little,

531
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.560
it gets me both oddly and paradoxically sleepy and anxious at the same time when

532
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.080
I eat it.
Although when I,
when I smoke it,

533
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.610
I feel either sometimes goofy,
but sometimes awesome and lucid.

534
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.860
So it's that kind of would,

535
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.710
depending on what kind of part you're getting to and I have no fucking clue.

536
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.650
Yeah.
So that's the issue.
I have no idea.
Yeah.
We've,

537
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.090
we've discussed ad nauseum with people because most people in the country that

538
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:22.090
don't have a medical marijuana program don't know that there's two different

539
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:25.930
types of pot.
Yeah.
Indicating Sativa Shit.
Nowadays.

540
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.190
Most kids that listen to this show know that everybody,
exactly.
Yeah.

541
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.190
I'm telling people in cases like your dad's listening for the first time.

542
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.940
My Dad even knows that your dad's a scientist.
My mom wants to,

543
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.280
we're wants to smoke weed I think,

544
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.420
I think and stuff like that because every time she's been bringing it up in such

545
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:47.890
a positive light lately.
And then I talked to somebody else's,
uh,

546
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.330
who I know their mom,
their Franks from Ohio and they want,

547
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.820
her mom wants to smoke weed right now.
I don't want to say here.

548
00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:00.080
And so it's kind of weird.
And my mom's friends with that person.
Wow.
So,

549
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.400
well,
you know what Pat Robertson just turned the corner on everybody.
Yeah.

550
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.660
Pat Robertson just said that we should be illegal.
Fucking Robertson.

551
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.490
Who thinks,
you know,
Satan is alive and well living in Afghanistan.

552
00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.270
Got To get people over this fear.
It's such bullshit.

553
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:19.570
I mean these are valuable fucking tools.
Like you got it.

554
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:21.820
And we got to know about him first of all.
You know,
I mean,

555
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:25.360
it's one thing for me to take it,
but what if we had geniuses taking obligate,

556
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.250
you know,
that's when that's what you need.

557
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:32.251
You need like find these fucking people who are on the cusp of brilliance and

558
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.830
give them access to these tools and who knows what they'll find.
Actually,

559
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:38.080
I just recently learned that Francis Crick,

560
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:42.010
the guy who first perceived the DNA helix,
the double helix molecule,

561
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.570
admitted before he died,

562
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.890
that he perceived the DNA double helix while on acid.
Yeah.

563
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.520
But it's totally like this.
There's no evidence that,
you know what I mean?

564
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:58.090
Someone said it.
So instead of completely anecdotal,
maybe,
you know,
maybe,

565
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.020
but it makes sense.
Well,
did,
it is true though,
the Francis Crick,

566
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.130
it was a regular user of Lsd then.
I think that has been documented.

567
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.010
There's a lot of those guys.
I mean,
why wouldn't you be when you,

568
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:12.190
back in the day when no one really knew what the fuck was going on and none of

569
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.950
the things,
none of these things would become illegal yet.
Yeah.

570
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.910
And one guy would have amazing results and he'd be recognized as a,
you know,

571
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.240
a brilliant guy by his peers.
So they'd be like,
well,
what the fuck are you doing?

572
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:25.600
Let's,
let's try this.
What's happening here?
Yeah,
I've had a lot of them did it.

573
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.950
It's been,
it's been around.

574
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.220
I actually finished Graham Hancock's book supernatural,
which is amazing,

575
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:31.680
isn't it?
Awesome book.
Yeah.
I mean,

576
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.080
and he goes through that whole story of so many different cultures back from the

577
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:37.510
Paleolithic cave drawings too.
You know,
the,

578
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.130
the temple of elusive and ancient Greece

579
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.380
<v 5>and Rome and where they're actually,
he thinks eating Ercot,
which is that a,</v>

580
00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:47.300
a some mix of ergot fungus,
which has lysergic acid in it.

581
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.410
So I think it is the hero's journey,
you know,

582
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.450
that's what I think these psychedelic trips on it.
I know people say,

583
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:56.600
that sounds grandiose.
It sounds ridiculous.
But when you,

584
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:59.450
when you take a psychedelic,
there's a reason why it's called a trip.

585
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.450
It's not an ordeal.
It's a trip.
You're going,

586
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:04.610
so you're going on a fucking hero's journey.

587
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:09.980
You're going to be a hero of your own life to sort of reconstruct your own life

588
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:13.490
and get a chance at at starting in a new gonna reset button.

589
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:17.540
Get a kind of perspective enhancement where got you realize the terrible

590
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:20.360
patterns even existing under and you don't have to do them anymore.

591
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.170
Let's get through this.
But yes,
a Horowitz ordeal.

592
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:28.140
But every warrior must go through horrid battles.
Yeah,

593
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.240
that's it.
I mean we don't have this place.

594
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.630
I don't have the external fights that we used to.

595
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:36.830
I mean some people are yet UFC fighters,
they don't last.
But really those,

596
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.790
those kind of external manifestations of testing what you have in a life or

597
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:43.070
death situation and we don't have it,

598
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:47.290
but where are we can find that still is going deep,
challenging,
you know,

599
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.230
facing your fears about death and coming out the other side.
I mean that,

600
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.370
that's it.
We don't have sword fights anymore.
That's it.
Yeah.

601
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.580
We don't have no anymore.
No Musashi rolling around.
You know,

602
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.970
that was the reason why he was such a brilliant man about so many different

603
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:05.930
things with cause he had to be operating at full potential.

604
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:09.770
Impeccability you're fighting people would fucking swords,
man.

605
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.760
Jesus Christ.
He would always make people wait too.
Yeah.

606
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.290
He was kind of the content like that.

607
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.280
Musashi would always make people wait like hours before he showed up for these

608
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:22.010
duels so they'd be so mad.
They just charge out of him.

609
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.710
Then he would find the gift a couple of extra hours alive.

610
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.730
If you look at it that way,

611
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:31.340
giving up your extra foam is tales of people having to wake him up on the day he

612
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.300
was supposed to have a duel.

613
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.930
They have to wake him up and he would like leisurely eat a breakfast and then go

614
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:40.810
where the hooks are supposed to go.
That's scary.
Is there a scary of human?

615
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.860
No.

616
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.860
I killed like 62 people swords in one on one combat man fucking hey.

617
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.680
I mean to compare that to a fighter,

618
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:51.950
it's almost like a fighter who's never even taken a hard shot cause the

619
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:55.630
equivalent of a hard shot in a sword fight his death.
Well,

620
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.340
those days in feudal Japan to man real,
there was,

621
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:02.570
there was a lot of those Ronan's just wandering around bad ass sword fighters.

622
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.190
Like what the fuck man?

623
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.610
Could you imagine if a guy rolls into town and he's really awesome at killing

624
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:12.320
people,
but swords,
how fucking outfit is that guy going to be terrified of him?

625
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.580
This motherfucker wanting to the street,
he's got 16 desks.
He's looking at you.

626
00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:17.410
He's got,
you know,

627
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.600
a little fucking skulls tattooed on his cheeks from everybody's killed.

628
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:25.280
Sees holy fuck man.
When back then there was no equalizers,
you know,

629
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.920
I mean people had barely embraced the Arrow,
right?

630
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.390
The Japanese weren't really in the guns.
They really,
especially back in the day,

631
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:35.480
they thought it was like,
uh,
like a cowardly way to fire,

632
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.820
which is really incredible when you think about it.
Like they were,

633
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.850
they didn't want to embrace guns initially.
Yeah.
Honor.

634
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:43.920
Honoring was more important.

635
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.460
Killing people with swords that it's gotta be the craziest fucking thing ever.

636
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.790
I mean,
that's why the Japanese culture,

637
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.160
the Samurai culture fascinates me so much.

638
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:58.340
What a unique exploration of man in his most terrifying environment and what he

639
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:05.970
does to steel himself for combat.
What he does to keep his mind pure,

640
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.320
what he does to stay completely in focus and in control of his emotions.
Wow.

641
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:13.620
And the s,
the answer is what he does is become a balanced man.

642
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.410
What he does is become emotional and write poetry.

643
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.760
What he does is become an artist and what he does is work hard and turn his body

644
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:23.940
into a fucking killing machine and he balances it all.

645
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:29.010
And at the moment of battle,
you remove all the emotions and find that zen space.

646
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.220
I mean,
those are the scariest buyers nowadays.

647
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.290
You could see it in some of these guys walking out the chaps like Anderson
Silva,

648
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:36.960
John John,

649
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.620
that kind of Uri calm where they're smiling and they look like they're high,

650
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:43.740
but they're not high.
They're just fucking in the zone like Zen.

651
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.610
That's fucking the scariest shit when people are pounding themselves in the head

652
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.390
and slapping themselves.
Yeah.
It's a little scary too.

653
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.950
They're making a big show of things,
but the fucking killers,

654
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.500
Anderson Silva was he the one got that in spades.
He's got it.
Yeah.

655
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.860
If you looked at it,
the one guy who's got,
you know,
fucking a full hand of aces,

656
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.020
but it comes to like his,
his mental ability,
his uh,
you know,
it's like,

657
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:09.230
it's,
it's almost like not even fair.
You know,

658
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.390
when Anderson Silva steps in and he's like super confident,

659
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.340
he's got this crazy look in his eyes were like,

660
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:17.850
this guy doesn't even look a little freaked out by the fact that he's in,

661
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.940
like when he went to fight rich Franklin for the title dude,

662
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:25.270
he's fighting for the title.
Okay.
I mean,
and he walks in the octagon and he,
it,

663
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.720
he doesn't even look remotely concerned.

664
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.520
Just didn't even look remotely concerned.

665
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.000
Who's fighting rich Franklin in the USC for the title and he looks like

666
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:35.060
completely calm and totally relax.

667
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:40.140
A guy who's got that ability to do that in the heat of combat and execute the

668
00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:44.250
way he does.
That's so rare.
So rare that a guy comes along like that.

669
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:47.340
Like the last fight that he had with you,
she'll call me.
Did you see that fight?

670
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.870
That was,
yes.
Anderson Silva vintage.
The end of the first round,

671
00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:56.400
he fucking head kicks Okami and all my God.
Yeah.
It just,
it just,

672
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.260
if it wasn't the end of that round,

673
00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:02.220
I mean surely it would have probably stopped it in that round and he blasted him

674
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:05.400
with the fucking head kick at the end of the first round and then he'd just tees

675
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:07.380
off on him in the second you look at me go,

676
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.620
who the fuck has ever been better than this guy ever?
I mean,

677
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.780
this guy's better than people that are in movies.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

678
00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:17.710
John Claude van Damme never beat anybody's ass like that.
Oh,
he up.

679
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.660
He got paid back.
You know,
when,
when Anderson like beat up,

680
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.690
you should have copies.
Like you should know Cami is a beast.
He's a tough,

681
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.400
tough guy.
Yeah.
And Anderson just lit him up.
But you know,

682
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:31.500
if he's coming from another place,
just another place.

683
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:36.220
And really that was actually part of understanding.
That was my third question

684
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:36.671
<v 3>on this,</v>

685
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:41.560
on this [inaudible] trip and it was about belief and it was he Anderson to get

686
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:42.131
to that point,

687
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:46.660
you have just infallible belief that you are going to win and when it's within

688
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:49.150
your control.
I think Bruce Lipton said it well too.

689
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.050
We do live in cope participation,
but for something that you are in control of,

690
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.660
if your belief is infallible in something like that,

691
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.840
but you are going to fucking win like you're going to win,

692
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.430
there's no doubt should have infallible belief and get in there with Anderson

693
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.390
still get lit the fuck up.
I don't think that,

694
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:07.840
I mean if you have a little stubby arms shit,
well then you get a tiny,

695
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.860
tiny job for sure.
If had take a shot,
that person really haven't fallible.

696
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.430
They would may think,
they may pretend that they have available,

697
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.700
but some part of him,

698
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:20.110
some deeper part of them all the way through the layers would know,
oh shit.

699
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:24.310
But then when we're admitting that it's genetically related,
it's client.
Oh,
sure.

700
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.210
Oh,
sure.
Dot.
Infallible belief only comes with reality that comes with that.

701
00:39:28.211 --> 00:39:31.860
It's not just a state of mind.
That's impossible.
That's right.
But also,
you know,

702
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.070
if,
if Anderson Silva believed that he could lose,
I think he very well may lose,

703
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.700
even though he has the genetics,
I think belief still is a key.
But yeah,

704
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.800
you don't,
there's a natural defense there.

705
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:44.350
You don't believe things that are just not possible.

706
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.400
I think Anderson believes because of experience and because of slightly he's,

707
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.640
he's,
you know,
it's not,
not esoteric crazy mind game.
No,

708
00:39:51.641 --> 00:39:55.450
it's not massive belief in his abilities.
But you can't,

709
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.650
you can't deny that.

710
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.250
That having a strong belief in something,

711
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.040
it has a huge factor on things.
Even physical things,

712
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.700
even things that you would think would be like meet oriented,
you know,

713
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:12.820
wrestling and fighting and you know,
and things along those lines.
But no,

714
00:40:12.821 --> 00:40:15.730
you know,
this is a huge factor and belief.

715
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:19.360
Belief plays a gigantic factor in performance.
Absolutely.

716
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:23.650
Your ability to take risks,
your ability to believe in yourself and in scrambles.

717
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.800
You know that your,
your ability to make sure that you always come on top.

718
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.860
A lot of that is mind.
Absolutely on a percentage of it,

719
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:34.660
100% but a lot of it is also the real thing is the discipline to fucking get

720
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:38.140
your body into condition because you can't,
that's everything else.

721
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.800
That one piece,
that's just the tip of the iceberg,
that kind of mental state.

722
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.490
You have to have a solid pyramid underneath that and that pyramid is built from

723
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:49.850
practice,
training,
experience,
hammering day in,
day out,
or is,

724
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.490
you don't get to have that little,

725
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.020
your pyramids all fucking Janky and not correctly form.

726
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.620
You only get to that sharp tip.

727
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.320
You know that final point is if you have everything else built,

728
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.440
UFC fighters are like modern day Samurais is what you're trying to say.

729
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:06.670
That's it.
Some of them.
Some of them,
yeah.
Some of them for real.
Yeah.
That's,

730
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:08.350
I mean that's to me,

731
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:13.410
I mean there's no other sport that's even remotely in the same league as it for

732
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.071
that very reason.

733
00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:18.400
There's no other sport where everything is on the line like that.
Yeah.
You know,

734
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:21.150
you're getting to see these guys souls.
Yeah.

735
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.780
You're getting to see their conviction.
You're getting to see,
you know,

736
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.420
what they put put themselves through and conditioning and developing their

737
00:41:28.421 --> 00:41:32.470
skills.
And I heard the last Living Samurai lists here in Los Angeles.

738
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.790
What's his name?
I don't know.
[inaudible] he teaches like classes,

739
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:39.500
downs down downtown.
Seriously.
Yeah.
How can you be the last Living Samara?

740
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.720
I don't know when,
when did the Samurai days then?

741
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:45.180
I think they made that movie about some crews.

742
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.730
[inaudible]
name's Tom Cruise who teaches a class college.

743
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:55.950
You have to be a [inaudible] saying that he takes Sam right classes.

744
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:56.894
And he was like,

745
00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.730
well I think it ended with that last rebellion that they crushed with Mara Modo.

746
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.130
I mean that was based on a roughly loosely,

747
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:05.750
I don't even think there was an American involved,

748
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:09.380
but there was a Samurai rebellion of people who are kind of holding out for the

749
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.620
old way and they got crushed eventually by the imperial army.

750
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.580
So that story I think is,
is loosely,
loosely accurate.

751
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:18.660
And I think that was the late 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

752
00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.370
Japan went through all those civil war civil war,
Huh?
Yeah.

753
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.690
Like 150 plus years,
right?
Yeah.
They had some serious conflict.

754
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:31.610
God Damn.
What a fascinating,
fascinating culture.

755
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.480
And to think that when you go there and now they're ridiculously polite.

756
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.730
You know,
when people were saying that's only because where are you?

757
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.460
Where are you guys were in a nice spa and I don't know.

758
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:43.880
I mean pretty much everywhere we went people seem to have like really nice

759
00:42:43.881 --> 00:42:44.990
manners.
You know,

760
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:48.440
that was one thing I noticed like matters were like really at a very high

761
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:49.610
standard.
You know,

762
00:42:49.611 --> 00:42:52.940
even like amongst security there's like they had no douchey knows.

763
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.110
Even the security guards,

764
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.530
it's honor when you have to hold yourself to standards of honor.

765
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:00.170
I think it's something that we've largely forgotten.
I mean,

766
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:04.820
honoring this code of honor and chivalry,
you have to treat others with respect,

767
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.150
even your enemies.
I mean,
treating your enemies with respect right now.

768
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:11.810
I mean our culture is more like treating your enemy with the fuck you,

769
00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:14.130
you fucking Douche bag.
Uh,
you know,

770
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.930
instead of like [inaudible] but that's,

771
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.600
that's kind of the attitude.
But in Japan,
I mean everybody,
you know,

772
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.950
the more formidable your enemy the more you respect him.
He was a great,

773
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:28.310
we did this podcast we've seen with Sam Harris and Sam was talking about

774
00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:29.180
meditative states.

775
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:32.980
It can be reached where you can actually recreate the feeling of being on

776
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.833
ecstasy.

777
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.510
And he said that what you would do is you'd first start meditating on your

778
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:42.160
friends,
your loved ones and love and the idea of love that you took.

779
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.150
You got to this extreme state and then you would turn that love instead of on

780
00:43:47.151 --> 00:43:49.230
your friends.
You would turn it on,
anyone turn on any,

781
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.700
anyone that you could think of and then you turn it on your enemy.
Yup.

782
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.400
And that turning it on your enemy,

783
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:59.750
like turning all that love on your enemy is like the highest level of it.

784
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.780
Makes Sense.
Yeah.
I think,
uh,
you know,
that was,

785
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:05.330
I listened to that podcast and that,
that was really interesting.

786
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:09.110
But it was funny to me to hear that that same guy talking about being in the

787
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:10.550
zone,
which is,
you know,

788
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:14.120
I was a basketball player and I know the zone and it certainly isn't every time

789
00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:17.510
I make two jump shots.
So whatever tests they did for the zone,

790
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:20.840
it's not just you get in the zone for making two shots,
it just happens randomly.

791
00:44:20.841 --> 00:44:23.630
You do that all the time if you're worth,
you know,
if you're a decent player.

792
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:27.580
But when you are in the zone,
and I think you were kind of hitting at it,
that is,

793
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.980
that is a moment where your mind is removed and you're allowed to,
your body just

794
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.480
<v 5>does what it knows what to do and you can get there.</v>

795
00:44:34.481 --> 00:44:38.130
And every sport and when you do that,
usually a great result accompanies it.

796
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:42.360
But it's a certain way that you do things in which you're not fucking up and

797
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:46.530
sabotaging what your experience is capable of doing.
And that's a,

798
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.570
that is a phenomenon that exists.
I'm sure it's called dead stroke.

799
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.070
When you're playing pool,

800
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:56.640
you get in dead stroke or dead punch and you cannot miss.

801
00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.170
And it might only last for one rack,
but whatever it is for that moment,
man,

802
00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:04.950
you are fucking feeling it though.
The pocket may be a soccer goal.

803
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.110
You know where the cube walls going,
you have,
you have,

804
00:45:09.111 --> 00:45:11.670
and it usually happens when you've been playing for like eight hours.

805
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:17.130
You pay for so long that you get in some sort of a weird half retarded state.

806
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.980
Well you become one with all your movements of your mind is just removed.

807
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.660
The most maddening thing to me about cool is that that state,

808
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:28.410
that state can be achieved every now and again and that you're always constantly

809
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.100
chasing that dragon.
Yeah.

810
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.020
Chasing that when you could just know you can just get out.
You just run out,

811
00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.150
just run out and just keep running you.
I've heard it in pretty much everything.

812
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:37.500
Even non athletic things.

813
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:42.090
I think I did some little knickknacks stage acting in college and there was some

814
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:45.300
pretty good teachers there and the teacher was talking about another very good

815
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:48.990
stage actor just came out one night playing a fellow and just killed it.

816
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.410
Like had the most amazing performance ever and they went and talked to him in

817
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:54.810
the dressing room and they're like,
aren't you thrilled?
That was amazing.

818
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:55.321
He's like,
no,

819
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:59.670
I'm fucking pissed off because I have no idea how I got to that state.

820
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.140
Like he just found some groove where his mind wasn't thinking.

821
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.300
He wasn't analyzing what he was saying.
He was just being a fellow,
you know,

822
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:13.170
just really being,
so it applies to so many things beyond just athletics.

823
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.440
I know.
I know it exists because I needed to go on stage.
Yeah.
If I,

824
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:19.440
if I can't get into the zone when I'm on stage,
if I don't get in there,

825
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:22.830
if I'm not,
if feeling the material,
if I'm not like one with the whole thing,

826
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:25.860
then it's not the same show.
It's not,
it's not.
The audience knows it.

827
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.310
I can say the same words,
but if I'm not tuned into what I'm saying,

828
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.110
if you're not in that,
in that,
in that moment,
yeah,
it's,
it exists.

829
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:38.190
Man exists.
There's,
there's,
there's moments.
It's just,

830
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:42.000
you can't really measure them because they're so brief and you don't,
you don't,

831
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:44.760
even when they're happening though,
you know,
they're there.

832
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.760
Here's a perfect example.
There's a guy named Earl Strickland.

833
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.510
He's one of the greatest pool players of all time,
multiple time world champion,

834
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:56.400
just world world renowned pool player.
And uh,

835
00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.840
there was a professional tournament where they had gotten a big insurance
policy.

836
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:05.370
The insurance policy said if anybody runs 10 racks in a row,

837
00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:08.070
which is like virtually unfucking heard of,

838
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.170
there's only like a couple of guys who've ever done it,

839
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:14.610
ever nine or ten nine ball,
nine,
nine ball,
10 racks in a row is preposterous.

840
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.030
The idea that you break 10 times in a row and get a shot,

841
00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:18.600
the one is preposterous.

842
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.960
The idea that you mean it includes nine on the brakes and includes,
you know,
uh,

843
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.990
combinations,
but the idea that,
that you could get out 10 times in a row is,

844
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:30.940
is preposterous.
Especially on like a professional table.
Yeah.
Well,

845
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:35.941
they put up $1 million and Earl Strickland smashed in 11 in a row.

846
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.300
You can't tell me that guy didn't get in the fucking zone.

847
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:41.770
No one's ever done that.
Well,

848
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:45.280
the only other 10 pack that I've ever heard anybody ever running was Johnny

849
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:48.970
archer.
He broken,
it was a a gambling session,

850
00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:53.560
a famous gambling session with this fellow Filipino player,
Francisco Bustamante,

851
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:58.120
and he ran 10 racks in a row and then the Filipino tried to double the bet.

852
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:03.010
That's how,
that's how dangerous those guys gamble in the Philippines.

853
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:06.270
They know fuck made,
might've shook them out of the zone.
You know,

854
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.250
at that point he starts thinking about money.
He starts thinking about,

855
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.130
should I take it?
Should I make a deal?
Should I quit?
You know,

856
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:14.680
what about in my honor?
And then at that point,
you know,

857
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.650
that's when the fun thing about that you just rent 10 racks on a guy.

858
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.860
Now he wants to double up that.
I'm confident is this bitch,

859
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:24.130
you didn't even get there,
shoot for 10 whole fucking games.

860
00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:26.860
You didn't even get to shoot.
He's just begging on the faculty.

861
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:30.280
But you cannot keep that up.
You're going to fall apart and you're going to go,

862
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:32.470
what am I doing?
Yeah,
you're gonna miss a ball.

863
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.130
They might not ever make a ball again.
Yeah,
no doubt.

864
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.500
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is someone exists.
It's just,
it's just impossible to test.
I mean,

865
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:44.770
so you could go ahead and test and he was saying what he was saying was he was

866
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:49.090
coming from a point of cold hard science and he was like,

867
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:52.780
if you look at what it is,
if someone hits like jump shots,

868
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:57.130
are they more or less likely to hit their next shot and looking at that at

869
00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:01.600
numbers on paper.
I mean scientifically,
I see what he's saying.

870
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.230
I mean what he's doing I think is it's important to,

871
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.600
it's important to look at it from that angle as well.

872
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.040
The scientific method is good.

873
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:13.390
I just think the test is wrong because you could make three moments is unique.

874
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:16.150
How do you test those unique moment?
You could make five balls in a row.

875
00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:18.730
It doesn't mean you're in the zone.
Maybe it just means that you made five balls.

876
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:22.540
Maybe the sixth one is harder.
You know,
being in the zone is different.
You know,

877
00:49:22.541 --> 00:49:25.960
hitting two shots,
you hit two shots every fucking game.
Doesn't mean anything,

878
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.823
right?
But there's like,

879
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.430
there's a player like every now and then like you'll see in a basketball game.

880
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.290
Like you remember that kid?
There was a kid,

881
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:35.890
I believe that he was autistic and he was in a high school basketball game.

882
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:39.790
It just fucking sink in these jumps shots.
You remember this?
I remember that.

883
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.010
I mean you can't tell me something was going on there now.
[inaudible] zone.

884
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.800
Totally.
I mean that kid was like the zone a personified.

885
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.780
The audience is going Nazi just drain these flat three pointers like no,

886
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.380
no net or no,
no rim at all.
Just right through the net.

887
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.320
Every time to every amazing everything.

888
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:01.750
Even poker players just talking to this professional poker player,

889
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.300
Matt Van Grin and he was talking to him and he's like,
I know what.

890
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.850
I'm in the zone in poker.
I just know what to do.
I did.

891
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:10.630
My mind doesn't have to worry about it.
I know which way to go.
And you hit it.

892
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.990
You just existed.
And some almost impossible to test for.

893
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.760
And I think that's where you gotta be careful.

894
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:18.730
There's just because we haven't come up with the right test yet,

895
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.620
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
You know,

896
00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:23.170
it's like we're prying to apply tests that don't really work.

897
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:27.470
Like you could test a million grandma's and see if they can lift a car,
you know,

898
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:28.070
but unless

899
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.230
<v 3>you're going to put their child underneath it,
right.
You know,</v>

900
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:34.400
you can't see how much weight they can actually displace the test unless you're

901
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:38.900
some machiavellian evil sorcerer,
you know,
dictator.

902
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:42.830
You can't create tests that would put these people in these situations that

903
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:46.540
would create the moment,
that moment that defies,
you know,

904
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.640
statistical analysis.
Right.
Getting more zones.
I'm never in an zone.

905
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.480
It's like the only zones I'm in,
like school zones are phone zones,

906
00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:57.920
but I've never needed like anything that,
that big of a zone that's your,

907
00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:01.990
you live in a different life.
When was the last you got into?
Um,

908
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.330
I get in the zone.
When I do Jujitsu,
I get in the zone.
When I do comedy,

909
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.740
I get in the zone and I played pool.

910
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:09.770
If I played pool for like more than a couple of hours,
I can get into the zone.

911
00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.850
Who's a hard one though?
It's hard when you don't play that often.

912
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.860
It's hard to get that dead zone.
Yeah.
That's a fun one though.

913
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.160
You don't get zone Brian,

914
00:51:19.161 --> 00:51:21.170
because you're not out there doing anything with your body.

915
00:51:21.171 --> 00:51:24.620
You don't move around.
You don't play the dance of the body and the mind,

916
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.040
the mind controlling the body.
You don't,
you don't go to yoga class.

917
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.310
What I'm saying Brian,
you know if there will work in your Kundalini,

918
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.250
you know out there trying to keep your shock or strong,

919
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.890
you're not out there doing that.
Oh,
you know what are you doing?

920
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:41.060
Smoking cigarettes.
Sleep until noon now.
Sure.
Got like some Asian.

921
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.730
I still my crazy.
How does that,
what does that,

922
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.730
my alarm clock's still fucked up in Japan.

923
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:50.390
I'm still waking up at like 6:00 AM for no reason.
And you do use your phone?

924
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.650
Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
I mean I don't use my phone.
I just wake up and I can't go,
oh,

925
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.350
you're really your,
your biological clock fucked up.
Yeah.

926
00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.970
And I and I still go to bed around why s like 1112 which I'm used to going to

927
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:06.660
bed like at four you know,
so my whole thing,
I can't change.
It sucks.
Whoa.

928
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:10.710
That's a,
it's an issue called your circadian rhythms are a bit off the,

929
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:13.910
actually I thought it was called t.
T.
E.
H gay.

930
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.830
Is there an audit pillow that I can take for jet lag this bad?
Well,

931
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:20.810
Methylcobalamin is,

932
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:24.650
Methylcobalamin is supposed to help with circadian rhythms a bit,
so you can,

933
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.840
it's in that shroom tech sport.
You don't work out.

934
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:32.110
That's probably why you're getting screwed by Brian Steroids for hours pick up.

935
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.620
You can just pick up methyl B 12 at any,
any she'd be working.

936
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.950
He knows how to do you get your notes for now?
Huge right now.

937
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.900
I'm going to pick it until I have a six pack.
No steroids.

938
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.100
Just
pinch it.
Play.
I got,

939
00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:50.270
you know I get a big wheel from Brentley.
No,
Wilford Brimley.

940
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.220
Does he have a large homes?
I don't know.
It seems like it would.

941
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:55.430
It seems like you would with a name like Wilfred hiding it behind that mustache.

942
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:58.280
He probably has the biggest nose ever got her.
Yeah.

943
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.400
I mean that's why he's got this giant fucking tarpons tree underneath it to

944
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:04.650
distract from mind.
No.
So,

945
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.900
so I guess to go,
uh,
go on to question number four.

946
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:12.200
This is where it starts to get a little weird here.
Question four on.

947
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.840
So I'm lying on my back.
Things are pretty miserable,

948
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:18.110
but I still have that kind of blinking cursor of truth kind of pointing at

949
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:18.944
things.
Right,
right.

950
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:22.850
So everything to this point has been in words and I've kind of figured myself

951
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:27.510
out.
You know,
I talked,
I learned,
you know,
about differentiating fear from danger,

952
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.140
you know,
dangerous,
real dangerous,
something in pending.
It's about to happen.

953
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:35.550
It's a risk that you actually have and uh,
but and that's real.

954
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:40.170
But fear is an apparition.
It's false.
So you are poisoning yourself.

955
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.030
Poisoning myself,
most of the time.
I mean,

956
00:53:42.031 --> 00:53:45.240
there's very few situations where you're scared of something that's actual

957
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:49.710
danger.
It's usually just fear,
which is fear is something to be obliterated.

958
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:53.730
There's no reason for it.
You mean acknowledging danger is a different thing.

959
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.830
So that was kind of a lesson.
And then again,

960
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:59.190
kind of what we were talking about with belief and just the power of belief,

961
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:01.440
believing what you are capable of doing.

962
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:05.700
I think other shamans call it intent as well as some of the Mesoamerican shamans

963
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:10.210
would call it intent and the we teach tradition,
it's belief,
um,
and,

964
00:54:10.211 --> 00:54:13.380
and different things as well.
But whatever it is,

965
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:17.910
just believing and setting your intent for accomplishing something is one of the

966
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:21.720
most powerful forces acting within your control in the universe.

967
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.670
And it applies to a lot of things.
So I was pretty skillful.
Supernovas yeah,

968
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.450
I don't even need a lot of belief for that,
but I mean,
I think that isn't,

969
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:34.020
it is an active force in the universe.
And I think it's,
you know,
again,

970
00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:35.940
difficult to quantify,
but you know,

971
00:54:35.941 --> 00:54:39.120
you talk to the people who have achieved many things.

972
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:43.830
I think that belief component is,
uh,
is an invaluable component.
Yeah.

973
00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.600
I mean,
if you want to make something happen,

974
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:50.460
you've got to believe in it and whatever it is,
whatever it becomes,
it,
you know,

975
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:55.440
might not have,
might not have been what you initially visualize.
Sure.

976
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.420
And what you initially were hoping for,

977
00:54:57.421 --> 00:55:00.870
but you can steer it into a direction with intent and focus,

978
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:04.770
whatever it is that you choose to focus your energy on it.
Yeah.
It's just,
um,

979
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.200
for some people it's hard to find something they like.

980
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:11.190
For some people it's hard to find something that they're into.
You know,
it's a,

981
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:14.480
it's a difficult little,
uh,
yeah.
You know,
to say like you can,

982
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.240
you can choose to focus on something and you could be successful for some people

983
00:55:18.241 --> 00:55:22.800
like,
and what,
you know,
there's a lot of people that,
yeah,
I agree.
And I think,

984
00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:25.140
I think the key there,
I think there's a quote from,

985
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.330
from Cyrano de Bergerac and it's one of my favorite,
cause I'll do the,

986
00:55:28.331 --> 00:55:32.830
would like he had the big deal.
He's a fictional character.
He was right.
Yeah.

987
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.750
Handsome man.
It was,
but it was,
it was a play by Edmund Rostam.

988
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.270
And so one of his characters quote,
so it's really an Edmund Ross Stan quote.

989
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.520
I use the original Milli Vanilli got to be healthy.
Um,

990
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.420
well he was actually writing speeches for,
for the other familiar middle.
Yeah.

991
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.770
Familiar with it.
But anyways,
he said,
you know,

992
00:55:49.771 --> 00:55:53.760
I was puzzled with all of the many options that I had in life and I'm

993
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:57.270
paraphrasing because it written in French and then I decided to be admirable and

994
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:58.104
everything.

995
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.350
And so we really [inaudible].

996
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:06.090
So the idea,
the idea that is just maybe you don't know,

997
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:10.860
but maybe just be the best you can.
Whatever you're doing.
Yeah.

998
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.290
I think,
well,
it gives you satisfaction.
You know,

999
00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:17.310
my happiness is always come from doing things well.
Yup.
Uh,
doing anything well,

1000
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:18.530
whether it's playing pool,

1001
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.390
whether it's doing a set of comedy or whether it's writing something that I
like,

1002
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.130
whether it's,
you know,
whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.
So

1003
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.900
<v 0>if you can't figure it out yet,
that's okay.
Yeah.</v>

1004
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.850
Just be admirable at what you're doing.

1005
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:32.851
Practice doing things in a way that results in success and probably practicing

1006
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:36.880
that by the time you find that channel that you want to tune into and kickass
on,

1007
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.210
you'll have the experience.
Yeah,
maybe it's not in that same vein,

1008
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.860
but you have experience in trying to be excellent and striving to be admirable

1009
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:47.580
in whatever you're doing.
So I think that would be,
you know,

1010
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.440
kind of the best advice for those people who haven't figured it out.
That's okay.

1011
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.380
But just practice how to do it.
Once you figure it out.

1012
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:58.620
I think people would like to take just a happy pill and just to sort of skate by

1013
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:00.700
with a smile all day.

1014
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.880
If you could give someone a pill and they'd be happy all day.

1015
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:09.150
But I think you need to at least battle the lows to really truly appreciate the

1016
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:12.880
highs.
You know what?
I really enjoy California when it rains.

1017
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.080
That's what I really enjoy,
California cause it never fucking rains here.

1018
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:22.060
It's garbage.
Never fucking raise.
So when it does rain,
I go,
Oh yeah,

1019
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:26.650
we're lucky.
Oh yeah,
this is nature.
Nature just come down and dumps water on.

1020
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:31.651
Everything from the fucking sky at is at its own discretion for as long as it

1021
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:34.240
likes,
it pours fucking water on your head.

1022
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.970
Like that's important to know that that exists.

1023
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.040
And that's when I really appreciate California when I left spirit.

1024
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.430
Anything you know remotely,

1025
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:45.640
like whether that's the heart of Dallas philosophy without bad weather,

1026
00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:46.940
there is no good weather know.

1027
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:51.250
I mean you have to experience both sides in order to appreciate the ones.

1028
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:55.570
That's why Milwaukee has Summerfest.
Yeah,
cause they're fuck,
it's cold as fuck.

1029
00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:59.800
They're in the winter dude.
Yeah.
That's why it is.
They're so happy in the summer.

1030
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.200
Yeah.
I did stand up there once a summer fest.
It was,

1031
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:06.430
I felt so bad cause I gotta do my act.
You know I'm doing what I'm doing,

1032
00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:08.110
but I'm seeing people holding their babies.

1033
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.690
People were in the background walking around holding their babies and I'm

1034
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:15.370
talking about blow jobs.
I'm like,
wow,
this is wrong.
This is sad.

1035
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.560
At one point in time that baby could have fit in that woman's mouth.

1036
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:22.900
So don't feel bad.
You can't ever have a summer fest in California.

1037
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.701
People were like,
bitch,

1038
00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:27.400
bitches somewhere on your own here when you talk to them about what we're going

1039
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:31.630
to celebrate,
the fact that it's hot as fuck.
Same and same in Scandinavia.

1040
00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:35.460
I was there during summer where it's light 22 hours a day.
That's ridiculous.

1041
00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:38.650
Stoke cause it was dark for 22 hours a day for parking.
That's ridiculous too.

1042
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:41.200
That's a shitty spot.
You people need to move.
Go to Burg.

1043
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.420
I was out there and it was when it's dark all the time.

1044
00:58:43.421 --> 00:58:47.230
People lose their marbles,
right?
Yeah,
they'll go crazy.
What happens?

1045
00:58:47.231 --> 00:58:50.040
It's only like light for like three hours a day.
Yep.
And it's really,

1046
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.300
it's just barely,
it's like,
it's not even real light.

1047
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:54.700
Sun doesn't pass anywhere close to the top of this guy.

1048
00:58:54.701 --> 00:58:58.330
So it's just this little crescent or while you live in there.

1049
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.570
But some people that need to realize that is not getting any better.

1050
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:05.320
I'm really praying for global warming's what they're doing to like holding out

1051
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.370
with hairspray cans blowing in the air.
I've got charts and graphs and shit.

1052
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:10.660
Well as far as we've concerned,

1053
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:15.010
like now we only have three or four more years before global warming becomes a

1054
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:19.540
huge,
huge problem.
Look,
here's a chart,
here's the graphs.
Norway's looking good.

1055
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.130
Just buy it up.
Coastal property.

1056
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.800
While most of those places just fucking sink underwater anyway.
I mean that's,

1057
00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.920
that's what happened before.
That's what happened before.
Yeah.

1058
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.300
Case it's a band aquanet cans.
Yeah.

1059
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.230
They said there's thousands of cities that people have never discovered that are

1060
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:37.010
just off shore somewhere.
Just sunk in when the,
when the uh,

1061
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.550
the earth sea levels rose roles and felt were always like living right,

1062
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:41.570
right next to the water.

1063
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.500
And it's like whenever I drive by Malibu I think two things like wow,

1064
00:59:45.501 --> 00:59:48.450
how bad ass supposed to be to have a house like on the water.
Yeah.

1065
00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:49.460
That's pretty bad ass.

1066
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.570
I have a friend who has a house in the water and we go over his house sometimes

1067
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:55.700
and check them out and be like,
wow,
this is crazy.
Like he's got a house.

1068
00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:58.250
It's like right on the water.
I would want two houses though.

1069
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.660
Cause that's also scary as fuck.
Don't you think?
Yeah.
Well it's his second house.

1070
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:07.100
He's a wealthy man,
but his house on the water is like,

1071
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.790
it's a tiny little house and it's like 4 million bucks.
I mean it's crazy.

1072
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:14.690
You got to pay a lot of fucking money to get a house like on the water in
Malibu.

1073
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:19.490
But Tim is so damn,
is it dope you seen on that back porch?

1074
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.650
It's like you might,
this might be worth it.

1075
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.730
This might be worth it to just sit there like

1076
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.130
right there.
You're bed is right there by the ocean.
Are you kidding me?

1077
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.820
That's bad ass.
What's our friend like?
Our one friend that owns the Comedy Cup,

1078
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.820
Sal,
he has a boat and he just sleeps in the middle of the ocean.

1079
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:41.010
He just drops his anchor the same.
I don't think.
No,

1080
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.800
that's [inaudible].
I'm on the fucking read Pinocchio.

1081
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:49.250
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be crazy though?
Just [inaudible] you feel a little funny.

1082
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:52.070
That's a terrible off the boat flip over.

1083
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:56.450
Drone houses can get jacked by tsunamis.

1084
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.500
That absolutely can happen.
I totally look.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1085
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:03.470
we're probably do,
I mean,
I hate to jinx everybody,

1086
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:07.910
but you know the idea that it's been so god damn long since a significant

1087
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:11.630
natural disaster wiped out of giant chunk of,
of life on this planet.

1088
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:16.300
It's almost like a,
it's a little ticking time bomb.
Yeah.
Malibu House has bitch,

1089
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:20.910
are you crazy?
You got a house right on the water.
How confident are you?
Did you,

1090
01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:25.640
did you not like go to school?
You'd see like pants barrier,
you know the whole,

1091
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.610
the whole fucking continent used to be one thing and they're all separated.

1092
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.490
Why you buy Pangea?
Yeah.
Why you bet Pennsbury is a meteors and carry life,
right?

1093
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.340
Well,
I'm like,

1094
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.370
why are you banking all your money on this one spot stand right there.

1095
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.140
He's spent 4 million bucks hoping the door,
the ocean doesn't move in.

1096
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:45.350
What does the ocean moves in?
You're out.
You just know more for 1 million bucks.

1097
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:50.770
What happens there?
For real flood insurance underneath that water,

1098
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.830
that section of water there was,
there was one beach in Malibu that was,

1099
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.390
I think it was broad beach.
It's a like a very expensive,
it's all expensive.

1100
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.850
The whole beach,
no Malibu beaches for expensive,

1101
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:05.630
but this one broad beach area is particularly expensive because they have a

1102
01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:08.750
large section of sand.
So from their backyard,

1103
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:12.440
it's a long piece of sandy beach and the ocean.

1104
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:14.750
While someone did something apparently,

1105
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:17.390
and this is all anecdotal conversational evidence,

1106
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:20.270
I don't know exactly how this works.
Something changed

1107
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:23.510
<v 5>that they did like up up ocean or uptight or up current,</v>

1108
01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:25.080
like up in like Santa Barbara.

1109
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:30.380
There was something that was done and now all of a sudden it changed the way the

1110
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:34.710
ocean comes in and the ocean now comes in deep into their beach and it's,

1111
01:02:34.711 --> 01:02:37.860
they've lost like most of their sand.
That's the bummer.
Yeah.

1112
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.600
And that that can happen.
Yeah.

1113
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:44.810
That's all [inaudible] to do is go up there and dig some shit and put up a

1114
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:50.370
fucking wall somewhere and do something wacky that somehow or another changes

1115
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:54.390
the current of the ocean coming down and now it takes a little steep left turn

1116
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.180
and now you don't have a beach anymore.
Well,
yeah,
your house is gone.

1117
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.070
If the polls shifted,

1118
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.950
you know like they say that they may or something like that.
I don't know.

1119
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:03.870
I'm not an expert in that.
But if the polls shifted,

1120
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:08.120
is there a pull shifting expert out there?
I can help you out.

1121
01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.000
It's a real science,
right?
I think so.
I'm sorry if the poll shifted.

1122
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:15.180
I think they have shifted before.
Yeah,
that's,
that's definitely,

1123
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:19.050
I think they believe happened before.
You think it can happen again,

1124
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.970
but then at that point,
I mean everything goes into,

1125
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.830
most of the shit goes underwater cause all the glaciers melt and then it takes a

1126
01:03:25.831 --> 01:03:26.910
while for the new glaciers,

1127
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:31.911
the form so that ice hasn't been buying bounded up and the egg are temporary.

1128
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.750
The Poles,
the God damn thick,
thick as fuck.
They drilled into that Russian link,

1129
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:42.120
Russian,
those,
those Russian science or the Antarctic Lake under miles of ice.

1130
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.630
These Russian guys have been working for years and they finally just broke

1131
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:48.250
through and drilled into this lake that got,

1132
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.220
I forget the number of millions of years.

1133
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.110
That was the last time this was exposed to light,

1134
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.360
but there's a liquid water lake miles animal.
They don't know yet.

1135
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:02.220
They don't know yet.
Hm.
Interesting.
Expensive fish.
It can be anything into there,

1136
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:05.730
man.
You know,
who knows?
Buried under the,

1137
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.050
people keep sending me this lake,
400 million year old fossil.

1138
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.430
It's a machine.
It's 400 million years old.
The scientists and you look at it,

1139
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:15.240
you're like,
that looks like,

1140
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.990
like life looks like a fossil of like the bottom of some sort of like a jelly

1141
01:04:18.991 --> 01:04:21.400
fish or something like that.
Or you know,
or uh,
you know,

1142
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.860
around cephalopod or what are those?
Uh,
those um,

1143
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.390
sea urchins or something like that.
Like that's what it looks like.

1144
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:30.590
Let's look like it doesn't look like a machine,
but people,

1145
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:35.190
<v 1>400 million year old machine.
Holy Shit Man.
Like,
whoa.</v>

1146
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:36.120
What are you trying to say?

1147
01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:39.870
It's funny that people get so stoked about some possible machine,

1148
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:44.460
but really the most amazing machine possible was around 400 million years ago.

1149
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:49.260
It's called fucking DNA.
DNA is 10 Adam's wine.
It's in every cell,

1150
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:50.460
10 atoms wide.

1151
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.540
And it would stretch for 125 billion miles,

1152
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.600
25 billion miles.
That's in our DNA.

1153
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.130
And so what they've identified is there's only somewhere between three to 10%

1154
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:05.700
most bets are on 3% of your DNA that controls your genes.

1155
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.480
And so they've isolated that and they figured a lot of shit about out about what

1156
01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:12.690
the DNA,
you know what parts of DNA control the genes?
Well,

1157
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.930
90% maybe 97% of it,

1158
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.000
they called junk DNA right now.

1159
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.960
That to me is a pretty ridiculous thought and in and of itself,

1160
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:27.430
because how would this survive through billions of years of natural selection?

1161
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:31.300
If it was just junk,
don't you think you would kind of unraveling just the same?

1162
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.060
It's just the same,
but they don't know when they have no idea.
Yeah,

1163
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:35.740
but they don't really,
really think it's junk.

1164
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.690
I think that's just like a [inaudible].
That's the saying.
Well,

1165
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:40.270
they have because they haven't figured it out yet.
But they do call it that.
Yeah,

1166
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:43.510
they call him John a colloquial term.
I think it's just,
they're being silly.

1167
01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.040
I think it's,
I don't know.
Maybe I may,
um,

1168
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.620
I might be giving them too much credit apologists.

1169
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.840
I think that's what they're doing,
but in any case,

1170
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:52.930
they haven't quite figured out what it is.
And I,
and I was,
I think in a,

1171
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:56.470
it was Graham Hancock's book to kind of shed light on some of the other theories

1172
01:05:56.471 --> 01:06:00.520
about when you apply that to,
uh,
to some linguistic theories,

1173
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:02.920
basically saying that,
um,

1174
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:06.460
there's a theory called zip or a phenomena called zip theory.

1175
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:10.960
And that's basically that the word rank and the word frequency or directly

1176
01:06:10.961 --> 01:06:15.250
inversely proportional.
So that means like the word the has,
you know,

1177
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.200
has a word rank of number one.
All right,
the second bit,

1178
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:22.480
the second word that shows up the most is the word of,
or something like that.

1179
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.250
And that will have half amount of occurrences in the language.

1180
01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:30.940
And if you stretch out enough books together as the word,
the,

1181
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.030
and then the third one,
we'll have a third as many occurrences.

1182
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:36.700
And this works not just for English,
obviously it's different words,

1183
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.630
but it works for every single language.
It's called zip theory is zip,

1184
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.010
Zip,
f theory here,
Zip,
zip phenomena.
It's not,

1185
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:47.380
it's beyond a theory because they've demonstrated a variety of ways.

1186
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.770
And then so the DNA when they,
when they analyzed,

1187
01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.140
so the DNA that controls our genes,
the,

1188
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.590
the part that controls our genes does not follow zip through it's way off the

1189
01:06:56.591 --> 01:06:58.660
charts because you a form of a straight line.

1190
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.570
If you graph it by rank and frequency of the different codes,

1191
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:04.600
there's these different dif,
different codes of the different um,

1192
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.300
molecules that form up DNA,
nucleic acids.

1193
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:11.200
But if you apply it to the 90%,
you know,
that's there,

1194
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:15.580
then it follows linguistic zip theory phenomenon.

1195
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:20.140
So basically the theory is that this is this some ancient and coding process.

1196
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:24.220
It's an encoding process,
encoding and storing massive amounts of information,

1197
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:27.520
more information than any machine could ever possibly record.

1198
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:32.521
This 125 billion miles of 10 Adam wide language that's in all of ourselves.

1199
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.820
And that kind of applies to a bit of what,
um,
you know,

1200
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:39.370
there's some of these different shotguns and some of the theories are saying

1201
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:43.180
that we're actually accessing knowledge that was previously hidden,

1202
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:48.110
that's encoded in our DNA,
in this language,
the junk DNA part of our,
uh,

1203
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.940
the language that's in the junk DNA part of ourselves that's encoding a lot more

1204
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:56.140
really interesting theory.
But the point of all of that is,
yeah,
maybe that's,

1205
01:07:56.141 --> 01:08:00.220
maybe that's exactly what it is.
Maybe it's not,
but we are unbelievable.

1206
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.960
Biotechnical miracle,
you know,
I mean,
the champions of technology.
Yeah,

1207
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:07.120
technology is cool and we're doing some cool stuff,

1208
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.560
but what's already in our body that we have no fucking idea how powerful and

1209
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:16.390
what it's capable of.
I mean,
I think that will be the next true revolution in,
uh,

1210
01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.181
in technology.

1211
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:21.560
After we figure out how to go faster and farther and whatever other nonsense

1212
01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:23.570
we're going to do,
we're going to eventually figure out,

1213
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:27.130
we got to start unlocking what we're capable of and,
you know,

1214
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:31.880
accessing those areas of the brain that we think don't do anything.
You know,

1215
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:35.540
being able to uncode the DNA that we haven't figured out yet.

1216
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:39.290
Do you think that places like this place you went to Costa Rica could exist if

1217
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:42.080
they made I began legal in America.
I mean,

1218
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:44.900
it sounds to me like there's a lot of legality.

1219
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.470
I mean a lot of people would go nuts.
A lot of people would,
you know,

1220
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.260
they would want to leave.
There would be like physical issues.

1221
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.020
They'd be fucked up on this drug running around like maniacs.

1222
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:58.850
You'd have to contain them.
You can't run.
Okay.
That's not a,
no one can run.

1223
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:02.120
You can't get like one crazy dude.
He's got a weird times.
Let me tell you.

1224
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.710
So I'm sitting there,
I'm asking all these questions.

1225
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:06.260
I'm going to go back to soccer tops for the questions.
But let's say,

1226
01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:09.350
so at a certain point,
you know,
this was after I started thinking,

1227
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.800
thinking about the earth and it was,
I was getting really nauseous this point.

1228
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:16.160
So I pop up,
I pop up and I'm like,

1229
01:09:16.161 --> 01:09:18.830
I gotta Puke like this and this nausea was horrible.
Like,

1230
01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:23.831
Iowasca comes in a short wave and you go and it's out and you feel good,

1231
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:27.050
you feel cleanse,
like ah,
that was a lovely vomit.

1232
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:31.190
Or you take a good diarrhea shit and it's gone,
you know?
And no worries.

1233
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.090
This was just like nausea,
like the worst food poisoning he ever.

1234
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:39.560
So I sit up and I vomit and I take the blindfold off and lights are kind of

1235
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:40.760
blinding my eyes.

1236
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.960
I can't hardly see anything and I'm puking and it's just terrible.

1237
01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:49.961
I'm just retching up this acidic bile and it was awful and dry heaving and like,

1238
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:54.470
do you do the worst spokesperson for this experience I have.
They're like,
well,

1239
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:59.210
I learned a lot about myself.
[inaudible]

1240
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:04.430
to the end.
Right.
Okay.
So then,
so then,
but it gets,
yeah,
this part is bad.
I mean,

1241
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:08.090
this is not easy stuff.
So then I stand up,
I gotta take a Piss at this point too.

1242
01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:10.820
So I was like,
I stand up.
Why don't I just piss all over yourself?

1243
01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:15.170
[inaudible] man.
So,
so I go in,

1244
01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:19.130
I'm just tumbling and staggering to the bathroom.
Made a horrible,

1245
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:22.100
like I can usually control,
and I'll ask you,
you could walk a tight rope,

1246
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.800
you know,
you'd see funny shit,
but you're balance is not fucked up.

1247
01:10:24.801 --> 01:10:27.680
Like being super stoned right now,
like your balances and fucked up.

1248
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.950
You've blasted to the moon.
Like you can sort of navigate,

1249
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.440
I couldn't navigate shit like the world was spinning.

1250
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:37.400
It looked like I was viewing through those old TVs channels that had the s the

1251
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:41.050
horizontal lines of,
of static,
you know,
like,
yeah,

1252
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.950
like all across the division.
And so I get to the bathroom,

1253
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:50.130
I'm like stumbling around holding the walls and I'm going to take a piss and

1254
01:10:50.131 --> 01:10:54.590
then,
and I,
and I go and I'm like,
oh fuck,
what's going on here?

1255
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:56.000
Cause I gotta take a Piss.

1256
01:10:56.270 --> 01:11:01.270
And I looked down and I have like the hardest Boehner I've ever had,

1257
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.670
except it's just the opposite way,

1258
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.700
just shrunk to it's miniaturist densest form of the tiniest.

1259
01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.920
And I was like,
what the fuck smalls?

1260
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:16.650
You have your solid dick like pulled up inside just like fucking machine down to

1261
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:19.930
the [inaudible] how small my Dick and look sometimes.
Oh yeah,
left.

1262
01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.740
It's really shocked.
Yeah.
Like I wouldn't want people to say,

1263
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.190
even people that know it.
I know.
I mean this was like,

1264
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.730
this was like unreal and I think maybe from the stimulant effect,
who knows?

1265
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:31.530
But whatever.
I was like,
fuck,
this is bad.

1266
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.140
So then I started to think at that point I was like,
all right,

1267
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.160
maybe I should pick about pussy or something like that to you get to get

1268
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.480
something working right now.

1269
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:42.170
That's hilarious because you're scared because you dig so small.

1270
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.620
[inaudible]
that was an even huger mistake.

1271
01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:50.010
That was a real truth rampaging in my head.

1272
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.230
The minute the idea of pussy came in my head,

1273
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.280
I started to try to understand pussy.
Oh,
and that is a disaster.

1274
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.450
Nobody wants to understand pussy.

1275
01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:03.470
Like it's good to be admired from afar without seeing like the bio logical uses

1276
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.320
of every different part of it.
So anyways,
that was a fucking,

1277
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.950
that was a fucking nightmare that luckily I got that out of my head before I

1278
01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:14.880
ruin things for for awhile,
but then crash back to bed.
But the physical,

1279
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.900
what did that experience smelling smelled like?
The fucking,

1280
01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:22.950
probably the vomit that was coming out of my mouth,
but the physical experience,

1281
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:26.460
the whole point of that being the physical experiences.
Brutal.

1282
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:30.990
I mean your body is going through some serious,
some serious work,
but your mind,

1283
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:35.340
your mind is just on this fucking beautiful channel that you can access things

1284
01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:36.870
that are really remarkable.

1285
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.870
Do you think that this interface that you saw where it was almost like a cursor

1286
01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:40.291
and you move it,

1287
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:43.680
was that influenced by your own experience with computers and he think that it

1288
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:46.470
was like implanted like,
well this is an easy way to describe it to him.

1289
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.870
Let's just show it to him.
Like totally.
I think,

1290
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:53.280
I think a lot of this stuff is just coming from what's best to explain to you

1291
01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:57.600
how does the most familiar way he's used to as a computer's total click on this.

1292
01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.420
Totally.
And that's how,
and that's,
and that's how it comes to you.

1293
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.730
And that was very evident to cause everything else up,

1294
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:05.670
up to three first three questions were,
were voice,
like I said.

1295
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:08.850
And then I was like,
all right,
I want to focus beyond myself and you know,

1296
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.080
really kind of get out there.

1297
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.110
And so I started asking questions about other phenomenon.
So I was like,

1298
01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:16.860
all right,
why not go for the fucking,
the Big One?
What's the nature of God,

1299
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:19.140
the universe and infinity,
you know?

1300
01:13:19.141 --> 01:13:23.400
And so immediately I started getting this image of the universe and planets and

1301
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:27.810
these planets,
we're like bursting out like the big bang.
And I could see him,

1302
01:13:27.811 --> 01:13:31.560
I could see him coming from a point and then differentiating Bam out.

1303
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.700
And I saw him pushing out into this nether,

1304
01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:36.960
into this void that was like dark matter and the dark matter,
you know,

1305
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:41.940
it seemed like nothing but it had just the mildest resistance,
you know,

1306
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:44.260
to it.
And eventually this burst,

1307
01:13:44.261 --> 01:13:46.770
this big bang goes out and it runs out of energy.

1308
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:50.880
And when that runs out of energy,
everything starts to suck back in.
Slowly,

1309
01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:54.750
slowly,
slowly,
boom,
and goes back into another,
into another point,

1310
01:13:54.751 --> 01:13:58.710
which is another big bang.
So it's like,
and so I saw that and I was like,
whoa.

1311
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:03.330
So this is like,
you know,
this happens on a cycle.
And then I was like,

1312
01:14:03.331 --> 01:14:06.660
I got it.
I got it.
That makes sense.
So this infinite big bang,

1313
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.240
like a heartbeat of the universe.
And then that,

1314
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:14.300
then that clicked and then when I saw was this giant kind of electronic tighten

1315
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.310
that was like running in,
the Titan was running and the universe was like,

1316
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:21.970
it's heart inside.
And I was visualizing,
it's like crystal fucking clear,

1317
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:25.780
you know,
no words this time.
This is just the images and the Titan is running.

1318
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.230
And his act of running was what was keeping the heart pumping.

1319
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.980
And that is what it told me.
That was the nature of God was this Titan.

1320
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:36.790
And the reason all that God is doing basically is running,
you know,

1321
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:40.870
he's running so that life can exist so that the heartbeat of the universe will

1322
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:43.720
continue.
You know,
he's,
no,
he's not making decisions.

1323
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:47.470
He's not deciding whether the Denver Broncos beat the fucking colts or whoever

1324
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:50.680
else.
You know,
people think that this got up there is trying to do,
no,

1325
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:55.090
he's doing the important thing which is continuing to run and continuing to let

1326
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:58.720
that heartbeat of the universe go and allow there to be life.

1327
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:00.790
And that was a force behind it.
And so that,

1328
01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:03.970
I mean this is getting kind of really out there,
but it's it show,

1329
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:07.000
it just comes to you.
These,
these answers come to you in these questions.

1330
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.320
And then at the point and I was like,
all right,
well what do they need?

1331
01:15:09.321 --> 01:15:13.330
This is like stuff you already knew from school age maybe may sort of certainly

1332
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.520
certainly created by your imagination.

1333
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:19.780
Loyal to the staff saying that this isn't anything but the best thinking I've

1334
01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:24.310
ever done on uh,
on topic.
I don't think there has to be any,

1335
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:27.190
even when I'm going to,
I'm going to talk about talking to other people.

1336
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.370
I don't think it necessarily means that I have to be actually talking to them.

1337
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:32.140
What is getting an understanding?

1338
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:34.330
Is it a mechanism for you and understanding things?

1339
01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:36.910
I feel like a Bogo is now with Iowasca.

1340
01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:38.860
I really felt like there was something other,

1341
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.080
like I was going to something with a Boga.

1342
01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:43.660
I can explain all of it by just the very,

1343
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:48.690
my very best thinking on any topic that I pointed you thinking that I would not

1344
01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:53.200
be capable of without,
without it in a bogus situation.
So,
you know,

1345
01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:55.510
so sort of finish that.
And then the nature,
I was like,

1346
01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:58.180
what about the nature of infinity?
And then boom,
like,

1347
01:15:58.181 --> 01:16:02.470
and I think you even have a comedy bit on this and,
and it's about the infinite,

1348
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.490
you know,
parts of the universe.
There wasn't just one titan,
you know,

1349
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.400
there was thousands of titans and they were all running around on a circular

1350
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:11.260
track.
And that's the nature of infinity,

1351
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:14.530
this heartbeat in as many universes as you can imagine.

1352
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.560
And as many heartbeats as you can imagine running forever.

1353
01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.350
<v 5>Well,
if you just think of how big the fucking solar system is,</v>

1354
01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:24.440
just the solar system,
just to shit that we know,

1355
01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:27.320
just what we have pictures of it.

1356
01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:30.800
You can't even wrap your head around how many miles that is,

1357
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.880
how far away it is.
You get to fucking Neptune in your car,
you know,

1358
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.700
you can't even wrap your head around it.

1359
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:40.710
It's beyond belief that anything can truly be that far.
Yeah.

1360
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:46.030
Now realize that that is a fraction of a galaxy and then not even a very bad

1361
01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:49.440
galaxy.
A normal size galaxy.
Yeah,

1362
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.550
and then even in the center of every galaxy,

1363
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:56.900
there's a supermassive black hole that is one half of 1% of the mass of the

1364
01:16:56.901 --> 01:16:59.720
entire galaxy.
The bigger the galaxy,
the bigger the black hole.

1365
01:16:59.721 --> 01:17:03.080
And they believe inside every one of those supermassive black holes may very

1366
01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:07.820
likely be a whole nother universe with hundreds of billions of new galaxies,

1367
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.580
each with black holes and that.
That's how the universe is structured,

1368
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:12.710
that the universe is massive,

1369
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.800
impossibly large things that are inside of massive impossibly and he'd just goes

1370
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:22.120
on and on and on and that fractally forever.
Yeah,
that's an that.

1371
01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:26.450
But it sounds,
when people say,
that's crazy,
that's not,
how is that possible?

1372
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:28.670
That sounds like nonsense,
but what are you talking about?

1373
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:31.340
It all sounds like nonsense space sounds like nonsense.

1374
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:33.050
The God damn moon sounds like nonsense.

1375
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:37.670
There's a giant fucking rock that could fall on us and smashes to bits and it's

1376
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:41.780
flying over our fucking heads every day and we're like,
oh,
look,
the moon,

1377
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:45.140
if that fucking thing fell out of the sky,
it just dropped on us.

1378
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:50.120
It is a fucking miracle.
It's floating in the air above us.

1379
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:53.210
It's gigantic.
It's made out a rock.

1380
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:57.200
It's 260,000 miles away and it's fucking huge.

1381
01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.520
It's one quarter the size of us and it's just floating above us.

1382
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.760
Just flying through fucking space right above us.

1383
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:09.470
If that alone doesn't give you a little wake up,

1384
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:10.730
this is all crazy.

1385
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.550
You think there couldn't be a universe inside every black hole?

1386
01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.600
How is there a black hole?
How is there a universe?
It's all fucking nuts.

1387
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.510
Of course there could be stupid.
It could be nuttier than that.
It could be.

1388
01:18:21.511 --> 01:18:24.530
It goes the opposite way deep down into your own cells,

1389
01:18:24.531 --> 01:18:28.040
into your fucking string theory.
It could be anything.

1390
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:32.540
It could be massive,
massively small or massively large,

1391
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.280
impossibly large or impossible.

1392
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.210
<v 3>The small and that was this.
So,</v>

1393
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:39.750
so how this came to me I think is interesting because everything else before was

1394
01:18:39.751 --> 01:18:42.930
words.
It was,
it was not so much like something was speaking to me,

1395
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:47.370
but I was cognizant of it in words.
Everything else that Kinda came,

1396
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.600
this was pure pictures.

1397
01:18:48.601 --> 01:18:51.540
It was almost like words are not going to fucking help you out here buddy.

1398
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:55.620
Like so I'm going to give you straight images on this question and that was this

1399
01:18:55.621 --> 01:18:59.820
kind of work.
What kind of images?
That was the image of the heartbeat of God,

1400
01:18:59.821 --> 01:19:03.720
the Blue Titan running around this track.
You know,
that was the only way,

1401
01:19:03.721 --> 01:19:07.290
I guess from my mind to be able to grasp it.
Sounds like an awesome movie.
Yeah,

1402
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.770
that sounds like a really cool episode of the watch.
Sweet.

1403
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:14.160
I would really love to get it like animated by a cool cause I have it perfectly

1404
01:19:14.161 --> 01:19:16.560
visually.
Really bad dude.
I bet somebody to be willing to do it.

1405
01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:20.040
[inaudible] circus guy.
Explain it.
Explain again.
What does that look like?

1406
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:23.400
So what is the vision?
Giant Blue Titan.
It's kind of a little bit,

1407
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.500
it's almost like it's made up of limited picks.

1408
01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:29.250
Like it's not very well to see a tight like a giant,
like a just a giant,

1409
01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:33.510
like an old giant,
giant,
giant Greek mythology,
green color.

1410
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:38.810
But it's blue going cloths are no blocks blocks like pixelated.

1411
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.650
Exactly like large translucent pixels and you could see through its body just to

1412
01:19:43.651 --> 01:19:45.300
the heart doesn't have anything else but the,

1413
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:49.530
but the prison and the art and the heartbeat of the universe is boom is pumping

1414
01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.730
and flowing out and all the planets are going out and then coming back in big

1415
01:19:53.731 --> 01:19:56.780
bang retraction,
big bang retraction and it's,

1416
01:19:56.850 --> 01:19:59.610
and it's running just steadily.
Same.

1417
01:19:59.611 --> 01:20:02.700
CBD to money is some mind fuck of all time.

1418
01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:06.910
The nuttiest mind fuck of all time is that,
you know,
even though we,

1419
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.040
we understand this

1420
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.220
<v 5>concept of the universe being infinite and we understand this concept of,</v>

1421
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:14.940
of each individual black hall having universes inside of it,

1422
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.950
what if all of that,

1423
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:22.730
all of that is just a part of something that's going on inside the atom of a

1424
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:25.500
much larger bullying.
Yeah.

1425
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:31.310
And that really does go on above that as well to this much larger being being in

1426
01:20:31.591 --> 01:20:35.130
a galaxy,
being a part of another universe that's above.
I mean,

1427
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:39.210
if this exists,
why not that as well?
Why not infinite,

1428
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.420
infinite progressions of it and where do we just can't be aware of it.

1429
01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.040
We know we could barely deal with life and being aware of what we are aware of

1430
01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:48.860
currently.
Right.
It's too much,

1431
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.480
too much that you kind of mentioned that tuned in to all the other dimensions.

1432
01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.710
So all of a sudden the scientists have this new fucking television set cause a

1433
01:20:54.711 --> 01:20:58.890
giant Sony TV and they're fucking just cranking this dial and tuning into next

1434
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:01.710
dimensions and you get to watch the impossible.

1435
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.060
You do watch a world where physics doesn't work the same in a world where

1436
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.940
everyone's made of light.
Yeah.

1437
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.420
You know what if the government always lied about how far space was really like

1438
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:16.530
NASA and like all that shit was bullshit and that we would go there all the time

1439
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:20.820
but only select few would go onto the other side.
Like spaces only like I dunno,

1440
01:21:20.821 --> 01:21:24.690
like two hours up in the air and the whole time they just lied about how far the

1441
01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:27.000
sun was,
how far that the moon was.

1442
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.640
Cal [inaudible] knows how far the Moodle because you're told by the government

1443
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:37.890
scientists black helicopters.
Okay,
interesting.
Crazy.

1444
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.000
Seriously Sherry,
I don't know.
I don't know if I could ride with you on that.

1445
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.590
He's getting back my ride shotgun.

1446
01:21:43.591 --> 01:21:46.110
I'm now getting back at me from my intelligent kangaroo theory.

1447
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:47.940
That's what he's doing.
I know what the fuck he's doing.

1448
01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.990
He says this is revenge tree yesterday.
Yeah.
Yesterday I was saying we'll,

1449
01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:53.400
we allowed Kangaroos to get like super smart,

1450
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:56.010
like kangaroos started eating some leaf and all of a sudden they started

1451
01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:59.520
figuring out the world and using tools and we drove by the kangaroo colony and

1452
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:02.850
they're fucking welding and shit and putting together armor and what would we

1453
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:07.380
allow that the fuck no would have kangaroos made swords and came into town.

1454
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:09.330
We would never allow that.
Now we don't,

1455
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:12.780
we don't allow other intelligent life forms to,
to exist and to be running shit.

1456
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:15.990
What if you could talk and this other side and that they work for those people

1457
01:22:15.991 --> 01:22:17.100
that get to live on the other side.

1458
01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:20.490
And they sent the cats as like a security guard to watch what we're doing like

1459
01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:23.160
and like I really like high end video camera.

1460
01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:28.270
What size is 24 hours on a bug?
I couldn't follow that.

1461
01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.860
What's up with the Egyptians?
Loving cats.
Why do they love cats?

1462
01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.550
<v 1>Exactly.
That Graham Hancock goes into that a little bit.</v>

1463
01:22:34.551 --> 01:22:36.080
These theory in theory and Morphs,

1464
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:39.590
I believe he calls them these half few line half,
um,

1465
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.940
half people basically gods that come out as a spirit teachers.

1466
01:22:43.941 --> 01:22:48.620
And I think it's related to the God.
Um,
oh,
what was it?
Um,
you,

1467
01:22:48.621 --> 01:22:50.990
Boston [inaudible] was the Greek cat got,

1468
01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:55.730
I mean the Egyptian cat got name was Boston and it was one of those figures that

1469
01:22:55.731 --> 01:22:57.320
would,
uh,
that would appear to them.
You know,

1470
01:22:57.321 --> 01:23:01.790
actually I started thinking about Egypt when I was,
when I was on this,
uh,

1471
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.490
on this ship.
This is one of my later,
very later questions.
I was like,

1472
01:23:04.491 --> 01:23:05.860
how the fuck did they build the pyramids?

1473
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.540
<v 5>And,
and really good fuck yeah,
I was honestly just like at the end,</v>

1474
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:12.010
I mean you're under so long,

1475
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:14.590
you're just trying to think of shit to think of it as.
I was like,

1476
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:16.570
all right and then what I really,

1477
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:19.060
what it's when it started to tell me was it was like,

1478
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:23.020
well you underestimate how much,
you know,

1479
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:26.200
an unlimited multitude of people linked together,

1480
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.970
unified to trying to do something as if their life depended on it can

1481
01:23:30.971 --> 01:23:33.850
accomplish,
you know,
like how do they move?
There's 10 ton block.

1482
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.530
Well there was fucking 20,000 of them who would be killed if they didn't move
it,

1483
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.710
you know,
so they just fucking put enough ropes,
you know,

1484
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:45.880
kind of this Gulliver's travels type of thing and they put enough ropes and link

1485
01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:49.870
them enough together and have enough people playing tug of war and pulleys and

1486
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.870
whatever it is.
You have these ropes that extent.

1487
01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:56.320
I saw this image of these ropes that extended for,
you know,
like a mile.

1488
01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:58.210
I don't know how long it really was.
It was a vision,

1489
01:23:58.211 --> 01:24:02.500
but it's a p everybody kind of pulling together unified as if their life

1490
01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:06.250
depended on it.
And that's how a lot of this shit got got done.

1491
01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:10.000
It wasn't as esoteric as maybe a,
we want to think.
It was just,

1492
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.290
just underestimating that many people working together with that kind of intent.

1493
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.350
Yeah.
But then I'll have to understand what was going on.
They'd all have to be,

1494
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:20.200
uh,
some of them,
some of them,
some of them would.

1495
01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:24.280
So there was like the supervisors that knew how to set up the pulleys and how to

1496
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.450
attach the right knots that could support a string of 40,
you know,

1497
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.130
150 slaves.
Well,
obviously someone did it somehow.
Yeah.
I mean,

1498
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:33.810
my,

1499
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:38.200
my thought has always been that they probably had some technology back then that

1500
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.670
white was wiped out with their civilization.
You know what I mean?
Essentially,

1501
01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:46.810
at one point in time,
the,
uh,
adoption pyramids and when you would,
uh,
you know,

1502
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:50.320
there's the Sphinx,
like when I believe when a Napoleon found it,

1503
01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:51.660
it was like covered it.

1504
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:54.310
It was the sphinx covered again and it was covered by sand.

1505
01:24:54.311 --> 01:24:57.160
There was nobody living there.
Yeah,
right.
Wasn't that what was going on?

1506
01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:02.730
Not sure on the details possible that the people that built those things knew

1507
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.700
more than we think.
They knew.

1508
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:08.560
A lot of that information was lost in the burning of the library of Alexandria.

1509
01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:11.740
I think they probably had some machines that we don't give them credit for.

1510
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.300
But the most interesting thing that I've read recently is about pyramids is that

1511
01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:20.760
they believe that the stones were actually cast.
And this guy,
um,

1512
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:25.630
he links the water profile of these stones,
um,
to,
uh,

1513
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.930
the difference between,
um,

1514
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:31.850
straight limestone and straight a granite and you know,
whatever different,
what,

1515
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:34.210
what do they make,
what does most of the pyramid made out of,

1516
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.180
I know the outside was like a smooth limestone,
but what are the most of the,

1517
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.630
whatever,
whatever they're made out of,
whatever the fuck they made out of.
Um,

1518
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.670
this guy has demonstrated that this can easily be made as a cement and they

1519
01:25:45.671 --> 01:25:49.510
could cast it,
which makes a lot more sense.
Like bricks.
Yeah.
And then the,

1520
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.050
you know,
that's how it was made so perfectly.
That's how these molds,
I mean,

1521
01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:55.960
there was one mole surgery.
They certainly were doing some unique things.

1522
01:25:55.961 --> 01:25:58.750
I mean in in the mega list,
in the mega list and Peru,
you know,

1523
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:01.240
the way that they are creating these,
cutting these stones out,

1524
01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:04.220
they had some tricks up their sleeve.
I'm not,
they had a me

1525
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.890
<v 3>amazing tricks up their sleeves.
Yeah.
Just the,
the fact that they,</v>

1526
01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:10.880
the Great Pyramid of Giza is a marvel.
I mean,
there's no one,

1527
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.210
no one today has recreated that.
I mean,
not to say that they couldn't,

1528
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.240
I mean my possible,
but God damn wood,

1529
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.740
we'll pick a piece of work that is 2 million,

1530
01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.710
300,000 stones and some of them,
they're weird.

1531
01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:24.770
Like I think it was the big ones in the king's chamber.

1532
01:26:24.771 --> 01:26:28.700
They get up to like 80 tons or something.
Fucking crazy.
Jesus Christ.

1533
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:30.170
A lot of slaves that,
a lot of slaves.

1534
01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:35.300
[inaudible] what a bad ass civilization.
They were amazing.

1535
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:35.601
You know,

1536
01:26:35.601 --> 01:26:40.160
when you really stop and think about these people were living like 2,500 BC,

1537
01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:43.910
they were rocking it like this.
That's just incredible man.
You know what I was,

1538
01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:47.720
another cool thing I got out of the supernatural was that usually we think of

1539
01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:50.920
King Tooton comments to is unmuted.
Completely on looted,
right?

1540
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.520
It was don alluded in modern times,

1541
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:56.120
but in antiquity it was looted once and the only thing they still,

1542
01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:59.750
there's mad gold in there.
Like we've covered everything from their gold,
riches,

1543
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:00.480
whatever,

1544
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:05.330
but they had 400 liters of a special liquid that was buried along with it and

1545
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:07.870
common.
And they found that,
um,

1546
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:10.670
the residue that makes them believe that it was a common,

1547
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:15.200
it was their potent psychedelic combination of mandrake water,
lily and poppy.

1548
01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:16.470
And uh,

1549
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:20.210
the residue that they found on some of these urns leads them to believe that.

1550
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:23.320
And that's the only thing that was jack from and comments to him.

1551
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:27.870
So that was like the magical feral elixir that allowed them to see all these

1552
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.820
area morphs and have,
have these visions of people crossing the other side.

1553
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:35.450
And even on King Ramses to them there's a most fucking mind blowing thing ever.

1554
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:39.740
It looks like it's called the men with the twisted chords and it's like these

1555
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:43.970
dudes holding a DNA strand and they're like part of the gateway between life and

1556
01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:47.300
death.
And you look at that and you're like,
that's fucking DNA.

1557
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:50.330
Like men holding like in a line,

1558
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:54.110
like just holding these twisted cores that look exactly like a double helix.

1559
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:58.700
I've seen very Egyptian style things on DMT.

1560
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:03.620
I've seen very Egyptian style,
like a physical imagery.
You know,

1561
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.330
I think the,
uh,
there,

1562
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.360
there may be something to these visual experience that people have while they're

1563
01:28:11.031 --> 01:28:15.830
on these visionary plans that it gets etched into the experience.

1564
01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.520
And so like when you're taking mushrooms and you close your eyes and you see

1565
01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:21.390
like Mayan temples and shit like that.
Yeah,

1566
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.770
it might be because you're absorbing the experiences of these fucking people

1567
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:28.120
that lived in the Mayan temples,
to be honest.
Show your,
your,

1568
01:28:28.121 --> 01:28:31.410
your house does look like in Egypt,
a ride at Disneyland.
So

1569
01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.100
I think you would definitely have to think about Egypt shit here.
Yeah.

1570
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:42.050
Here for sure.
That does well more Tibet really in and do stuff.
Yeah,

1571
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:44.830
I dunno.
Fascinated by all that stuff.
Now I think a lot of the,

1572
01:28:44.831 --> 01:28:49.730
the visions that these people,
uh,
have had to create certain things,
certain,
uh,

1573
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:52.850
you know,
like different,
these,
these,

1574
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.410
this common atory creature that exists in so many different psychological or a

1575
01:28:57.411 --> 01:29:01.340
psychedelic states rather,
um,
where it's an animal and a person combined.

1576
01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:02.070
And there's like

1577
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.220
<v 0>so many of those,
there's a,
you know,
from the old caves,
it's Uva.
Yeah.</v>

1578
01:29:06.221 --> 01:29:07.054
And is the month,

1579
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:11.910
<v 1>years ago,
yeah.
All took to,
you know,
more recent cultures.
Yeah.</v>

1580
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:14.700
There's all of these myths.
Yeah.
Oh,
I just,

1581
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.870
what is it something the fuck is that all about?
So whether,
whether,

1582
01:29:18.871 --> 01:29:22.110
so there's a couple of different ways you can look at it.
Either,
you know,

1583
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:23.760
and Graham Hancock posits this,

1584
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:27.870
either these supernatural entities actually exist,
you know,

1585
01:29:27.871 --> 01:29:30.420
out there and you're actually accessing your communicating with them.

1586
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.910
That's certainly one possibility.
One hypothesis.

1587
01:29:32.911 --> 01:29:36.840
They exist in a dimension that you're tuning into that frequency,
that dimension,

1588
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:39.120
and they're really there.
That's why people keep seeing them.

1589
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.640
The other thing would be that,
and,

1590
01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:44.820
and this is kind of a little bit more where I'm starting to fall into,

1591
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:49.980
is that you're trying to translate information and that information is coming

1592
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:53.490
through something that's very difficult for your cognition to understand.

1593
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.080
So teachers,

1594
01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:58.200
patterns of different teachers that are trying to tell you something,

1595
01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:01.560
appear to you,
you know,
and they appear to you to kind of tell you things,

1596
01:30:01.561 --> 01:30:03.000
guide you,
things,
show you things.

1597
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.740
And there's some commonality into what we see and manifest from these truths

1598
01:30:07.741 --> 01:30:10.620
that we're trying to get from the other side.
And it's just kind of,
uh,
uh,

1599
01:30:10.621 --> 01:30:15.240
translation technique that showed that knowledge comes into us and slams against

1600
01:30:15.241 --> 01:30:19.290
our filter and creates these area.
Morris,
he's half people,
half,
half.

1601
01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:19.600
<v 0>Gotcha.</v>

1602
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.990
So it's almost like it's a different language and this is how we're discipling

1603
01:30:22.991 --> 01:30:25.890
it.
It's like when you go to Google translate and you throw in something,

1604
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.800
somebody says,
like,

1605
01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:29.590
somebody will say something to me in Portuguese from Brazil and I go,

1606
01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:32.330
I don't know what they do.
Just said,
let me go check this out.
And I'll go.

1607
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.040
And it's always like the translations crazy.
It's always wonky,
you know?

1608
01:30:36.041 --> 01:30:36.770
Because it's never,

1609
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:40.180
it never comes across like an English sentence because the language is

1610
01:30:40.181 --> 01:30:43.120
completely different.
Yeah.
It's like so that's probably what we're doing.

1611
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.580
So the like the,
the,

1612
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:49.510
the experience and the information and the knowledge is real.

1613
01:30:49.630 --> 01:30:54.610
It's just being presented to you through a way that the universe believes you'll

1614
01:30:54.611 --> 01:30:57.830
understand and that way is created by your imagination.
Right?

1615
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:59.050
I think it's hitting your own,

1616
01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.070
hitting your own filter and so that's why you don't care if you're talking to

1617
01:31:03.071 --> 01:31:06.070
people in your psychedelic experience,
if they're real or not real,

1618
01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.420
what you care is that you are getting something out of the experience the way

1619
01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:14.140
you would if you were having a conversation with a real person and that the real

1620
01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:17.800
benefits are there,
whether it's some sort of a mechanism that this,

1621
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:20.320
this higher intelligence has plant based,

1622
01:31:20.321 --> 01:31:23.950
higher intelligence is using to transfer information to you or whether or not

1623
01:31:23.951 --> 01:31:27.130
you're really fucking talking to dead people,
that that doesn't matter.

1624
01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.100
What matters is that you're getting out of this,

1625
01:31:30.101 --> 01:31:33.460
what you would get out of this if you were talking to a wise dead person.

1626
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:36.550
Totally.
And then why is this the key?
Cause Terence Mckenna once said,

1627
01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.970
just because someone's dead doesn't mean they were smart to never listen to

1628
01:31:39.971 --> 01:31:40.804
ghosts.

1629
01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.730
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1630
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.380
<v 0>I always thought that was great because I fucking would hate it when people</v>

1631
01:31:46.381 --> 01:31:50.150
would sit around and fucking hold hands and channel and you know,
and then some,

1632
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.750
some voice from beyond would give you advice and just cause your dad.

1633
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.830
Does he imagine if you're talking to some dead person that was just really

1634
01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.930
stupid,
they were dead and they just had these run on sentences,

1635
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.620
but there was so happy that anybody was listening to them because now all of a

1636
01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:08.890
sudden they're special in the real world that would tell boring fucking

1637
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:12.940
sentences.
He,
their,
their conversations were deaf.
Like people come over all here,

1638
01:32:12.941 --> 01:32:16.270
this motherfucker comes and people would rub.
But as a ghost,

1639
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.940
like now he's the shit,
you know,
as a ghost.

1640
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:21.970
Like you could show up and fucking TV shows will be written around this asshole

1641
01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:23.170
talking.
You know,

1642
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.350
if he showed up on ghost hunter and start talking to people in the basement and

1643
01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:30.730
they're like,
holy fuck,
this is a head.
There's a real ghost ghost hunter.
Like,

1644
01:32:30.731 --> 01:32:34.060
Yo man,
I'm cute now.
You know,
people love to hear me talk.

1645
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:36.940
You guys said I was a run on and then fuck you.
Okay.

1646
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.070
Because a lot of people think would have to say is very interesting.

1647
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:42.250
Imagine if that was a ghost.
Every ghost,

1648
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.160
the only goes through allowed his people that were so annoying that they didn't

1649
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:48.100
want them in the afterlife.
So they got to the door and they got kicked out.

1650
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:51.400
So that would go so far as people that are hanging out on the front lawn of the

1651
01:32:51.401 --> 01:32:55.150
afterlife when if his name is kangaroo Jack Kangaroo Jack,
what is that?

1652
01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.430
It's a movie

1653
01:32:56.430 --> 01:33:00.180
<v 3>knowing kangaroo Ian movie from the 80s I remember that.
What do I remember that?</v>

1654
01:33:00.181 --> 01:33:03.450
I don't know.
It's really annoying.
I go,
what if George,
our banks wiser guys?

1655
01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.790
You know it's,
it's,
it's man,

1656
01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:08.640
it's a tough call when you start trying to figure out what's real and what's

1657
01:33:08.641 --> 01:33:11.040
just these tools and information,
but you know,

1658
01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:15.150
emote it Boga Bogo definitely points you in and the other stuff though,
man,

1659
01:33:15.151 --> 01:33:18.150
it gets hard.
That's why when you're doing I WASC and things,

1660
01:33:18.151 --> 01:33:22.710
it's hard not to really truly believe that there are other dimensions out there.

1661
01:33:22.711 --> 01:33:24.990
At least the DMT experience,

1662
01:33:24.991 --> 01:33:27.070
which is essentially the same as the I lost keeps parents,

1663
01:33:27.071 --> 01:33:28.410
although more intense and short,

1664
01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:33.580
it is the hallmark of the experience to one almost universal description of it

1665
01:33:34.381 --> 01:33:36.390
is that you are encountering someone,

1666
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.660
you are encountering something you encountering,
you are,

1667
01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:42.300
you are encountering an incredible intelligence.

1668
01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:46.110
You're encountering something that thinks everything's funny,
you know,

1669
01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.080
and they're all,
you know,
really across the board though when you're on these,

1670
01:33:49.081 --> 01:33:52.890
one of the truths that comes through that's very almost impossible to,

1671
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.390
to debate once you're under,

1672
01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:58.170
underneath and you've been enough of these trips is the existence of an infinite

1673
01:33:58.171 --> 01:34:00.210
soul of something that transcends the body,

1674
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:04.620
that the body is just really truly a vessel.
And so if there is that thing,

1675
01:34:04.621 --> 01:34:05.740
which is,
you know,

1676
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:09.360
impossible for me to escape from an experiential things on a variety of

1677
01:34:09.361 --> 01:34:12.180
different,
different ways,
um,
you know,

1678
01:34:12.181 --> 01:34:16.470
then that has to have some kind of other dimensional dimension,

1679
01:34:16.471 --> 01:34:19.440
if you want to call it,
uh,
certainly where that,
you know,

1680
01:34:19.441 --> 01:34:21.570
kind of where it operates.
So,
you know,

1681
01:34:21.571 --> 01:34:24.840
I think it's hard to imagine there not being another dimension,

1682
01:34:24.841 --> 01:34:29.430
but are there half lion,
half man,
you know,
apparitions or half dog,

1683
01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:33.260
half man,
like a new bus,
you know,
are these real or are these,
you know,

1684
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.680
translation tools.
You know,

1685
01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:37.480
maybe there's just us and then their souls because I know I,

1686
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:41.250
I really feel like I know that,
you know,
cause I've seen it too many times.

1687
01:34:41.251 --> 01:34:45.510
I've seen souls.
Have you seen souls?
Well,
I've seen my own,

1688
01:34:45.570 --> 01:34:47.580
I've see all my own very early on,

1689
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.430
which kind of started me on this whole journey very early on.

1690
01:34:50.431 --> 01:34:55.290
I saw my own lift out of my body.
That dream.
No,
under a psychedelic experience.

1691
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:58.400
We won.
I was on mushrooms

1692
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.770
<v 1>and Syrian room.
I believe in a,</v>

1693
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.090
<v 0>what is someone who isn't Syrian Rue and Mao inhibitor that Jesus Christ is an</v>

1694
01:35:05.091 --> 01:35:07.610
intense,
oh my God,
you're not supposed to do that.

1695
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.710
I'm not recommending any elicit from folks at home.
Mckenna had this,
uh,

1696
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:14.540
this,
this,
uh,

1697
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:18.950
talk once where he was describing what happened when he combined mushrooms and

1698
01:35:18.951 --> 01:35:21.320
Iowasca then he fucked up.
Cause you know,

1699
01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:25.670
Iowasca also has an Mao inhibitor and Mao inhibitor apparently makes mushroom

1700
01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.480
the mushroom experience much stronger.
And then with the Iowasca as well,

1701
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.560
all this together like literally was losing his mind like was watching his

1702
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.830
memory getting eaten up in front of a destroyed.
That's a bad,

1703
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.120
that's a bad experience.
Those I,
I dunno,
whatever,

1704
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.910
what has happened to work synergistically?

1705
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:43.100
So I watched my dad worked like in what way?

1706
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:48.110
[inaudible] son it completely eradicated fear of death.

1707
01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.850
Well eradicated for your desk.
I mean,

1708
01:35:49.851 --> 01:35:53.410
and that's a huge obstacle for a lot of people.
[inaudible] UFC,

1709
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:58.280
bro [inaudible] injury.
Are you having any side effects from all this shit?

1710
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.460
Like are you looking at like a blank laws that looked like a blank wall or is it

1711
01:36:01.461 --> 01:36:03.300
looked like a floor more,

1712
01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.590
<v 1>more,
more happy?
It really is the only side effects that I've,</v>

1713
01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:09.810
that I've encountered.
But this one,
this one,

1714
01:36:09.811 --> 01:36:14.100
early on being able to see my body distinct from my,
from my spirit,

1715
01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:16.620
that was something that I,
and I've reinforced,

1716
01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.880
reinforced that and further further experiences.
But that was something,
uh,

1717
01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.960
that was something pretty unique.
And then,
uh,
and then from there,
you know,

1718
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:26.880
I learned different things.
I made some,

1719
01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.480
that was a pretty powerful trip for me actually to,
not to digress from my,

1720
01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:35.400
at Boga trip when at that point I realize some synergies between the heaven and

1721
01:36:35.401 --> 01:36:39.090
helmet because I realized that once the soul leaves the body at that point you

1722
01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:42.000
have really perfect clarity on looking back at your own life.

1723
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.730
<v 0>I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying when I,
when you,</v>

1724
01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.450
when you were what,
what were you on the path of saying,
well,

1725
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.120
you were talking about the Syrian root.

1726
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.710
That was an early experience with a shaman in Mexico actually.

1727
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.420
And how old were you?
2012.
So that was easy.
That was 11 years ago.

1728
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.180
<v 1>I mean,
a lot of these initiates shit bogus.
Sharman I went to,</v>

1729
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.290
he started doing a Bogut

1730
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.410
<v 0>nine oh Jesus.
Nine [inaudible] it'd be upset.</v>

1731
01:37:10.411 --> 01:37:14.080
You've still got to kind of remember when you stole that candy.

1732
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:18.140
His grandfather know nine years old.
But for me it was

1733
01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.740
<v 1>first one was 20 and that experience was invaluable.</v>

1734
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:25.310
And then I was able to separate my body from my soul and realize that this is

1735
01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:28.820
just a temporary thing and then make some synergies to about what heaven and

1736
01:37:28.821 --> 01:37:29.654
hell really was.

1737
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:33.200
Heaven is when you leave your body and you can look back on your life and say,

1738
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:36.140
God damn,
I did a good job.
I did the best I fucking could.
Yeah,

1739
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:38.510
I fucked up sometimes,
but I lived a good life.

1740
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:42.140
I treated people well and the earth and the people in it were better for my

1741
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:44.650
existence and that feeling of kind of,
you know,

1742
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:48.320
love and gratitude as you're being kind of sent back to the spirit world.

1743
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:50.360
That's a blissful,
ecstatic feeling.

1744
01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.480
<v 0>Just feeling,
just expressing them when you said just now,
right now,</v>

1745
01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.770
to just plant that thought into the ideas of,
into the minds of people.

1746
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:00.780
Plant that idea into,
into your,

1747
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:05.781
into your everyday view of life that the best way to live life is just to do

1748
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:11.481
your best and be cool to people and be nice and get through this as easy as you

1749
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:15.180
can and it can be done by all of us can't.
That's the one thing,

1750
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:17.880
if you're not some fucking serial killer right now that needs to turn yourself

1751
01:38:17.881 --> 01:38:21.030
in.
You know,
almost virtually anybody can turn their shit around.

1752
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:23.430
Virtually anybody can put themselves on a positive path.

1753
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.930
It's just so fuck that were denied the use of the psychedelic compounds and

1754
01:38:27.931 --> 01:38:31.530
denied their use in this sort of clinical setting.
I mean,

1755
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:34.230
they can have you and bring you to fucking rehab and you know,

1756
01:38:34.231 --> 01:38:36.150
take you a Malibu and you know,
you,
you,

1757
01:38:36.151 --> 01:38:38.400
you're hanging out on some fucking place and they give you,
uh,

1758
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.400
a spring tea with lemon juice in it and you know,

1759
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:45.390
and you detox yourself and you try to talk about your feelings and why you are

1760
01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:47.670
really getting down with cocaine.
I mean,
but,

1761
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.730
and then you have a 10% success rate in your,
you know,

1762
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:54.010
not going to really fix you.
Okay.
The sitting around and just,

1763
01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.460
it just not being on the drugs.
That's not really gonna fix you.

1764
01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.730
It's gonna like make you relax and then you get this point of instability and

1765
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:02.130
you're going to get the itch again and you're going to look to fill up a void,

1766
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.660
whatever the fuck it is.
It's your childhood,
it's your genetics,
it's whatever,

1767
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.451
whatever it is.

1768
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:09.810
Whether it's a physiological addiction or psychological addiction,

1769
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.440
you're going to run and try to stuff that whole.
Right,
and that's that,

1770
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:15.030
that that's,
it's a sad,

1771
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:19.620
sad thing that we know this now for essentially for a fact that John Hopkins

1772
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:22.260
University study on Psilocybin and the proof,

1773
01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:25.160
or at least the demonstration that it changed people's personalities.

1774
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:29.880
Just one trip 20 years ago changed their personalities.
I mean,
come on,
man.

1775
01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.210
Isn't that what we want?
Don't we want a better world?

1776
01:39:32.211 --> 01:39:34.520
I'm on nicer people want it,
need it.

1777
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:39.210
We need a goddamn president to come on television and say,

1778
01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:44.330
we need to incorporate the psychedelic experience back into our people in order

1779
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:48.990
to foster the ideas of love and kindness and compassion and community,

1780
01:39:48.991 --> 01:39:51.930
the true feeling of community,
not just as an esoteric idea,

1781
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:55.890
not just as an abstract notion that you sort of pay credence to,

1782
01:39:56.070 --> 01:40:00.150
but as a real community,
a community of,
of loved ones,

1783
01:40:00.151 --> 01:40:01.620
people who have shared the same experience,

1784
01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:03.960
people who feel the same way that you do,

1785
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:07.980
the agreement that they'll be just as cool to you as you are to them.
You know,

1786
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:12.030
because we really are one crazy fucking super organism that can be achieved.

1787
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.810
It's just,
I don't,
I mean,
look,
you look back on what's,
you know,

1788
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:18.260
what's taken place just in the last couple of hundred years,

1789
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:20.760
a couple of hundred years is nothing,
but you know,
there was slavery,

1790
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:21.780
there was crazy.

1791
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.870
There's civil war and there's all kinds of nutty shit a couple hundred a couple

1792
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:25.110
hundred years from now.

1793
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:30.110
It's not outside the realm of possibility that some bad motherfucker introduces

1794
01:40:30.121 --> 01:40:32.850
the concept of psychedelics back into culture.

1795
01:40:32.851 --> 01:40:37.440
And a completely eradicates this whole system of corporate influence and ruining

1796
01:40:37.441 --> 01:40:40.080
the environment and everything is done ethically from then on out.

1797
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:45.110
Everything is all energy is focused in a way that can never be greedy,

1798
01:40:45.211 --> 01:40:47.050
that can never be monopolistic.

1799
01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.080
That it is entirely possible if we keep psychedelics around and keep the open

1800
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.540
exchange of information around on the Internet and you know,

1801
01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:58.650
we don't blow ourselves up.
If we can pull that all together.
It's only a,

1802
01:40:58.651 --> 01:41:02.440
it's a matter of,
it's a matter of how deep it gets into the culture.
I mean,

1803
01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:04.000
it's already been introduced into the youth.

1804
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:09.030
Youth of today are a completely different animal than the use of just 10 20

1805
01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:12.900
years ago.
They're completely informed.
They're bad motherfuckers.

1806
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:15.720
A 20 year old kid today.
You can't sleep on a 20 year old kid today.

1807
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:17.830
They know way more than I did when I was 20.

1808
01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:20.500
I've had some conversations with 20 year old kids and go,
what the fuck dude?

1809
01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.810
You really 20,
what's real legal sleep with a 20 year old kid?
How dare you?

1810
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.840
How dare you Brian?
Um,
you threw me off,
but not,

1811
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:31.940
but not doing things.

1812
01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.400
Not allowing this to happen is worse than it's worth than just preventing people

1813
01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:40.270
from their best.
It's actually preventing.
It's condemn it evolution.

1814
01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:44.680
It's really condemning them to a certain hell is what I realized in this first

1815
01:41:44.681 --> 01:41:47.420
one.
It's condemning them to the hell of they're going to,

1816
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.950
they're going to die at one point and all these misconceptions and all of the,

1817
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.060
all of the bullshit excuses and rationalizations that they've been using to beat

1818
01:41:55.061 --> 01:41:57.970
their wife or whatever fucked up thing they'd been doing.
Oh,
she's,

1819
01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:00.430
she's a fucking stupid.
She needs to learn whatever.

1820
01:42:00.431 --> 01:42:04.900
I'm just using a bad example maybe,
but whatever bad thing,
bad,
he's a dick.
Yeah,

1821
01:42:04.930 --> 01:42:07.450
well that,
well,
whatever bad thing that,
that,

1822
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:11.140
that person has allowed himself to do has rationalized himself to do.

1823
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:16.300
When he dies,
he's going to look back and go,
oh,
fuck,
oh fuck,
I was a dick.

1824
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:20.290
I hurt this person and they're going to relive every single moment of their

1825
01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:23.800
wickedness with God's gods.
I clarity,
you know,

1826
01:42:23.801 --> 01:42:27.640
that perfect infinite clarity back on their life.
And that's how,

1827
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.580
that's how having to think,
I did this me,

1828
01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:34.480
stupid fucking me did this and that takes a long time to forgive.
Well,

1829
01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:38.260
I think that's that that held concept that's actually based in something real.

1830
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:42.070
I think the use of,
in the lessons learned from humbling experiences,

1831
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.580
whether they're physical experiences like rights of manhood,
you know,

1832
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:49.960
rights of manhood,
uh,
things,
uh,
challenges that people have to go through,

1833
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:52.540
like the real passages where they feel real,

1834
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:54.280
but then there's a reason why they're engineered.

1835
01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.070
I think a lot of religions and a lot of tribal societies,

1836
01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:01.120
these rites of passage and you know,
they're not always,
they're not always sane.

1837
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.560
Like some of them are fucking crazy,

1838
01:43:02.561 --> 01:43:05.620
like the new Guinea ones where they have to drink loads of,
you've heard of this?

1839
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.200
No.
Oh,
did you pull this up on Google?

1840
01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:12.830
Because it's the most ridiculous thing ever.
And a new Guinea men have to,
uh,
to,

1841
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:17.740
to become a man.
They have to give fucking blowjobs new Guinea tribe.
Hold on.

1842
01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.580
Oh,
it's the most disgusting thing ever.
It doesn't even make sense.
Hold on,

1843
01:43:21.581 --> 01:43:24.310
I'm pulling it up on me,
but that's just the gay dude try.

1844
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.520
But it's a whole fucking community of Gab.
But I've,
I've heard of,

1845
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.090
I've heard of fraternities who have some similar stupid shit,

1846
01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:34.690
but that's really just like a couple of gay people in the right position at the

1847
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:37.630
right time that decide,
that make this the ritual.

1848
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:40.840
Like you could have chose something that,
and this is,
this is real shit man,

1849
01:43:40.841 --> 01:43:43.780
and this is a freak,
this,
this really freaky,
but it's real.

1850
01:43:43.781 --> 01:43:47.230
This is going on right now today.
Bazaar,
homosexual rights.

1851
01:43:47.231 --> 01:43:52.231
Our practice extents extensively by numerous Melanesian in New Guinea and

1852
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:57.410
adjacent islands.
Young boys must accumulate semen for several years,

1853
01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.680
either by regularly receiving anal penetration or by swallowing the ejaculations

1854
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:04.940
of older males.

1855
01:44:04.941 --> 01:44:09.941
They pholate this ancient custom springs from a religious belief system that

1856
01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:14.900
regard sperm as the essential conduit of masculine energy.

1857
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:15.921
Puny Boys,

1858
01:44:15.921 --> 01:44:20.630
they believe are only transformed into virile warriors if they ingest large

1859
01:44:20.631 --> 01:44:22.100
quantities of sperm.

1860
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.830
<v 1>Oh my God,
Christ sat culture,</v>

1861
01:44:27.831 --> 01:44:32.690
I'd be willing to bet does not have a psychedelic component to their belief

1862
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:35.340
system.
By the way,
these guys are all so fucking head hunters,

1863
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:39.380
the roofless sparkly outfits living with the truth.

1864
01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:44.810
But I think that just goes to show how if someone gets in early and sets up some

1865
01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.910
kind of tradition,
like a lot of these world religions,

1866
01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:51.200
they just got in early and they got some momentum early and that momentum will

1867
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:56.030
perpetuate itself in ridiculous hours for thousands of years.

1868
01:44:56.031 --> 01:44:57.950
It'll just go on because they got it early.

1869
01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.380
They convince people and those people tell their kid,

1870
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.440
go on what most people tell the kid.
And at a certain point,
after you've blown,

1871
01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.490
you know,
505 minutes,
you know,
when you're an old man,
you're like,

1872
01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:09.590
where's my blow jobs?
You know it's going to happen.

1873
01:45:09.591 --> 01:45:11.090
You're going to impose that on the other.

1874
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:14.600
So it's this bad kind of karmic momentum that gets developed.

1875
01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.610
<v 0>Listen to how crazy this is.
It's not just one tribe.
Okay.</v>

1876
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.880
This is 10 to 20% of all tribes and Melanesia and Osha and Oceana region

1877
01:45:25.351 --> 01:45:29.700
stretching 3000 miles from Iranian Jarrod,

1878
01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:32.550
Jarrod to Fiji,
have mandatory.

1879
01:45:32.730 --> 01:45:37.730
This is fucking 10 to 20% have mandatory boy inseminating practices.

1880
01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:43.470
Boys are separated from their mothers when they're seven to 14 years old and

1881
01:45:43.471 --> 01:45:47.550
installed in bachelor houses in quotes.
And,
uh,
the,

1882
01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:52.551
the merind anem of southwest New Guinea who were ruthless headhunters.

1883
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.420
Also.
These guys are fucking head hunters are savages are crazy.

1884
01:45:57.421 --> 01:45:58.254
And they're fucking boy.

1885
01:45:58.470 --> 01:46:03.450
They give the boys to maternal uncles who topped them in anal intercourse for

1886
01:46:03.451 --> 01:46:08.440
six years.
So they bang him in the ass for six years.
The nearby Jack Jack.

1887
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:12.070
Why try refers to the adult penetrator as the moe?

1888
01:46:12.090 --> 01:46:14.820
He Anus father is what it means.

1889
01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.480
And the receiving child as the MOH Mog anus son Jesus fucking Christ.

1890
01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:24.630
<v 1>What sizes on playgirl.com or on one [inaudible].</v>

1891
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.930
This is a letter to the editor or something.
Oh,
this is a big,
this is,
this is a,

1892
01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:33.500
<v 0>um,
a study on these people in New Guinea.
This is crazy.</v>

1893
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:36.040
It was by an anthropologist of Gilbert hurt.
Uh,

1894
01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:39.440
the editor of ritualized homosexuality in Melanesia.

1895
01:46:39.610 --> 01:46:40.900
<v 1>Do you know,
like Afghanistan,</v>

1896
01:46:40.901 --> 01:46:43.630
they have like a day of gayness where you're allowed to have gay sex.

1897
01:46:43.631 --> 01:46:47.120
I think it's like every third hole.
Every day there's a lot of gain is going.

1898
01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:50.100
It's accepted well,
there's a lot fun gave,
stays

1899
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.860
<v 0>in the cave.
Well,
there's a lot of that.
Um,
you know,</v>

1900
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.150
that weird thing that goes on in some of those ancient tribes where you,

1901
01:46:55.151 --> 01:46:58.630
you know,
you only go to the women for,
for intercourse,
for,
for,
you know,

1902
01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:02.940
for making babies.
That was boys and for pleasure.
Ancient Greek police will,

1903
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:05.460
they did this.
A lot of cultures went down that road.

1904
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:08.190
It's really interesting when you stop and think about how many cultures went
gay.

1905
01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:10.750
It's like,
what was it a lack of understanding?
Was that,

1906
01:47:10.751 --> 01:47:14.690
I mean w w what is it that led everybody to go get it?
Was it more natural?
Is it,

1907
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:18.000
where are we more restricted now in our behaviors because we have too much

1908
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:21.120
access to information that's more advanced than as does that.
What is,

1909
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:22.860
how would they,

1910
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:25.410
how would they tricking everybody in the bone and I mean it's gay.

1911
01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:28.610
People must be so mad that like back then God damn everybody was gay.

1912
01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:32.100
I think they've shown that there is a biological advantage for the species for a

1913
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:33.960
certain portion of people to be gay.

1914
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:38.870
It's kind of like some kind of for decorating.
Ah,
no,
I think it's just for,

1915
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:41.100
just for flavor.
I don't know exactly what it is,

1916
01:47:41.101 --> 01:47:44.490
but I don't think bring a certain whole entire culture to turn that way.

1917
01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:48.390
I don't think there's been really a good amount of understanding on that as far

1918
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:51.210
as,
because I've studied ancient Greece quite,
you know,

1919
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.220
quite a lot and Rome was funny to Rome.
If you took it in the ass,
you are,

1920
01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:58.490
you are what's called a faggot.
There was a slur that was called like a Faggot,

1921
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.870
basically did the apprentice.
That was a slur if you took it,

1922
01:48:00.871 --> 01:48:04.800
but if you gave it whatever that sells how it is in Mexico,
no big deal.

1923
01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.850
Yeah.
I mean that's kind of,
I guess what it's what it's like in prison as well.

1924
01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:12.680
Now is it to a certain code?
I think that's what I,
that's what I've,
uh,

1925
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:17.430
I've heard for some inmates it whatever.
But if you take it,
oh fuck yeah,

1926
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.870
that's not good.
But yeah.
I don't know.
Uh,

1927
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:22.140
I don't know what if you're a prisoner in New Guinea,

1928
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:25.590
they're straight trying to get big inch throat.
Come on.

1929
01:48:25.591 --> 01:48:28.950
Who wants to fuck me straight as fuck,
I'm on month.
Who wants to fuck me?

1930
01:48:28.951 --> 01:48:32.310
I'm trying to get big and strong.
I will take in so much semen.

1931
01:48:32.311 --> 01:48:35.700
I will break down these walls.
They cannot stop me.
Imagine if that really works.

1932
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:38.840
If you shoot loads in the guys asking me becomes a hulk,
can imagine,

1933
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:42.480
it's like just a certain amount.
Like you can just keep pumping loads in there.

1934
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.130
It's not like you can't back off.
It's not like,
you know,

1935
01:48:45.131 --> 01:48:48.690
uh Oh I tried to do a trend,
transcendental meditation,

1936
01:48:48.691 --> 01:48:50.110
but it got boring after the first hour.
No,

1937
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:52.200
you've got to really get into it for months and months and months before you

1938
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:53.790
really achieve any sort of success.

1939
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.520
But if one guy is just taking loads in the ass all day,

1940
01:48:56.521 --> 01:49:00.300
like a factory line and there's a scientific study that has shown that if your

1941
01:49:00.301 --> 01:49:02.850
body and Jess a certain amount of semen,

1942
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:05.130
it realizes that it's continually getting raped.

1943
01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:09.450
So it grows ridiculously strong to fight off the attacker as long as your body

1944
01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:09.781
is alive.

1945
01:49:09.781 --> 01:49:12.900
It's like your body produces super steroids and this is like a new study that

1946
01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:13.470
they find.

1947
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:17.280
So one guy just fucking volunteers to take one for the team as a scientific

1948
01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:18.370
adventure and they,
they,

1949
01:49:18.371 --> 01:49:21.900
they shackle him into a fucking thing and it's just like in Captain America,

1950
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:24.690
we blows up,
he gets all huge.

1951
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:29.160
This guy has just taken dick in the ass all day and after the first month is

1952
01:49:29.161 --> 01:49:31.830
just tired and he wants to quit and they're like,
hang in there.

1953
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.760
But I think we think we are recent McNulty would be talking to them on the

1954
01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:39.930
recent tests have shown success.
We need a couple more days out of your kid.

1955
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:41.700
You do it for America.

1956
01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:45.080
I think that there'd be people wearing a button that you got here.
Sure.

1957
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:50.070
And then the aliens maybe.
Maybe four minute.
You love gay humor,
man.

1958
01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.670
It's so funny.

1959
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:57.390
Like everything is [inaudible] if you get tricked into doing gay.

1960
01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:01.540
It's so funny though.
I love when gay people trick people into Intersex.

1961
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.840
I got a I if you've ever been propositioned by guy,
uh,
not,
not seriously.

1962
01:50:07.841 --> 01:50:09.280
Like never where I was like,
all right.

1963
01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:14.080
It was more jokingly propositioned by gay comic was we thought he was being
cute.

1964
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.260
It was really uncomfortable.
It wouldn't,
I wouldn't say his name.
Say his name.

1965
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:19.410
He's a loser.
Is that right away is calling for,

1966
01:50:19.450 --> 01:50:21.640
I don't even know his name anymore.
I really wouldn't know his name,

1967
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.880
but he was a really like aggressive with it.
I was like,
come on dude,
you know,

1968
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:29.290
not gay.
Stop.
It stuck in.
Then I had to go,
dude,
get the fuck outta here.

1969
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:31.230
You creepy cont like this is,

1970
01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:34.020
this is like what a woman feels like when some guy wants to fuck.
I'm like,
Yo,

1971
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:37.660
how gross.
And I was like,
how dare you think he could fuck me.

1972
01:50:37.661 --> 01:50:41.400
Even if I did go get silly bitch.
Yeah.

1973
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:43.480
That's more like you wouldn't have to so high.

1974
01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:46.520
I mean if someone like if I'm going to give up my ass for the first time,

1975
01:50:46.521 --> 01:50:48.880
I was going to be like Elton John.
You know what I'm saying?

1976
01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:52.210
George Michael's or something,
man,

1977
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:54.430
I want to go with someone famous and game with a lot of,

1978
01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.180
a lot of power that like talked me into it.
I don't want to some shit comedian,

1979
01:50:58.181 --> 01:50:59.080
they can't even open for me.

1980
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.560
I wouldn't even take you with me on the road and you're going to fuck me out.

1981
01:51:01.561 --> 01:51:03.010
Dare you.
All right Brian.

1982
01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.930
<v 1>Yeah.
That was a,
that I think that was,</v>

1983
01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:10.960
that was the main aphrodisiac in ancient Greece was not necessarily physical

1984
01:51:10.971 --> 01:51:14.240
appearance,
but like,
uh,
like Socrates for example,
ugly mother Fucker,

1985
01:51:14.241 --> 01:51:18.730
but he fucked everybody had a lot of gay sex.
Right.
And you have a lot of games,

1986
01:51:18.731 --> 01:51:21.890
a lot tons.
Everybody wanted to fuck soccer cause you're so brilliant.

1987
01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:25.610
It'd be funny like that was,
that was what a,
that's what got him going.

1988
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:27.620
<v 0>That was on,
it was a government mandate.</v>

1989
01:51:27.621 --> 01:51:31.490
The Dad be included on every Socrates quote that you put on Twitter.
By the way,

1990
01:51:31.491 --> 01:51:36.170
he had tons of gay sex.
So like Socrates is super wise.

1991
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:38.750
What the soul and the spirit and the transcended journey.

1992
01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:43.850
And then underneath that Socrates,
by the way,
he had tons of gay sex.
Tons.

1993
01:51:43.851 --> 01:51:46.630
Oh,
gay sex and caught me pink.
He's

1994
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.230
<v 1>gay.
But sex.
Yeah.
All of those people,</v>

1995
01:51:49.231 --> 01:51:54.231
even the most incredible warrior leaders like Alexander the great conquered the

1996
01:51:54.481 --> 01:51:59.090
known world at 25 also had a lot of times about sex.
Right?

1997
01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:01.380
He was a great leader.
By the way.

1998
01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:05.550
I've been reading some of Pressfield's work and I'm talking about him.

1999
01:52:05.551 --> 01:52:09.540
Some of his research,
some of his stories on leadership are pretty,
pretty epic.

2000
01:52:09.541 --> 01:52:10.410
Like for example,

2001
01:52:10.411 --> 01:52:14.700
at some point they were deep and into India and the troops were fucking tired

2002
01:52:14.701 --> 01:52:15.451
and pissed off.

2003
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:17.790
They're getting mosquito bit and they're in swamps and they're fighting

2004
01:52:17.791 --> 01:52:21.510
elephants and it's terrifying and it sucks and they are about to mutiny.

2005
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:25.890
And so Alexander who always led from the front on his horse be selfless with

2006
01:52:25.891 --> 01:52:26.724
this,
you know,

2007
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:31.440
big red plume on his helmet and had been at the forefront of every one of these

2008
01:52:31.441 --> 01:52:36.441
scuffles just starts taking off all his armor and strips like completely down to

2009
01:52:36.781 --> 01:52:39.600
nothing.
And he shows all the scars on his body.
He says,

2010
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:42.150
who amongst you has more scars than me?

2011
01:52:42.151 --> 01:52:44.760
That man comes forward and I'll take you home.

2012
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.140
And everybody looks at each other and they realized nobody had and they started

2013
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:48.951
cheering.
They're like,

2014
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:51.950
we're going to follow you to the end of the world was that never happened
though.

2015
01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:55.940
So passwords wrote it later.
That was the real problem with history,
man.
Right.

2016
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:58.910
Something that someone said really cool.
Meanwhile they were like a little funny.

2017
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.560
He had to fucking done some crazy shit.
Pushes troops that far.
Unquestionably.

2018
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:06.380
But you know when you attribute quotes to someone from that far back,

2019
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.310
like good luck with chat history.
Yeah.
You know how that goes,

2020
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:13.120
but some good stories about me that weren't true.
You know,
you ever,

2021
01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.610
you ever talked to someone from high school and they go,

2022
01:53:15.611 --> 01:53:16.610
oh remember that time he did that?

2023
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:18.860
You broken into the firehouse and you set everything on fire on you.

2024
01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.950
Like what are you talking about?
I didn't do anything like that.

2025
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:23.360
I didn't do anything like that.

2026
01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.780
Oh come you don't remember that person was the person who probably been telling

2027
01:53:26.781 --> 01:53:30.230
the story about you,
how you set a fucking house on fire or something,
you know?

2028
01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:32.840
I mean,
any makeup,
fill in the blank with whatever the fuck craziness.

2029
01:53:32.890 --> 01:53:35.540
The weird stuff with history is being reported in ancient China.

2030
01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:38.510
Some of the histories get really fucked up cause you couldn't tell the emperor

2031
01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:41.330
when he was doing something wrong.
Dot.
You'd get killed.

2032
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:45.560
So what they used to do is they used to tell histories of weird things happening

2033
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:49.310
in nature,
like wheat.
And this day we saw the geese flying backwards.

2034
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:52.760
And that's what they would say to the emperor because he was the center of the

2035
01:53:52.761 --> 01:53:56.270
universe.
So when he was fucking up,
the universe would start fucking up.

2036
01:53:56.271 --> 01:54:00.410
So that was their way,
telling the emperor that he was doing something wrong.

2037
01:54:00.411 --> 01:54:05.411
As it was like this day a horse gave birth to a pig and the emperor would be

2038
01:54:05.541 --> 01:54:08.390
like,
hmm,
I must be doing something wrong.
Really,

2039
01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:12.950
if horses are giving birth to pigs,
so you have these influence the emperor,

2040
01:54:12.951 --> 01:54:15.380
that's how they influenced the emperor.
So they've got like two cocky,

2041
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:16.970
did they ever get too cocky?

2042
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.230
The fact stupid pig led the empire in the wrong direction.

2043
01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:25.030
But there's this bitch that mother for being so obvious.
Yeah,

2044
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:28.820
hack was the game game.
You had to phone man abide by that.

2045
01:54:28.821 --> 01:54:32.120
So definitely dragged that pitch.
You don't have to work on your storylines.

2046
01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:38.790
That's craziness with him.
So then I guess to finish off this,
uh,

2047
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.320
finish off this trip here.
So,
um,
how do you remember all this?

2048
01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:46.790
It was incredibly lucid.
Try to video notes or audio notes or anything.

2049
01:54:46.791 --> 01:54:50.450
I wrote it down after I was done,
but you know,
here's the,
here's the deal.

2050
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:53.840
That's really something like you do Iowasca right?
You started at night,
you know,

2051
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:56.390
you take it maybe eight o'clock,
it's usually around dusk.

2052
01:54:56.391 --> 01:54:59.360
It seems to be kind of consistent.
You never take it like right in the noon,

2053
01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:01.680
you know,
it's very rare that you'll do a day ceremony.

2054
01:55:01.681 --> 01:55:05.750
So you do it at night and so you go through and you finish around three o'clock

2055
01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:06.710
cause I have WASC uh,
you know,

2056
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:09.990
gets out of your system by about eight hours and it's this very dreamlike,

2057
01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.240
magical experience.

2058
01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.540
And then you go to sleep and have a very dream like dream experience.

2059
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:19.190
So you wake up already and you're like,
weird.
That was weird,
you know.

2060
01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:23.390
But at Boga you're up for so fucking long.
Are you eating at all?

2061
01:55:23.391 --> 01:55:26.050
You can hardly eat.
It's like being under an intense stimulants.

2062
01:55:26.051 --> 01:55:30.350
So you're like barely like sipping like a tiny bit of water to keep your mouth,

2063
01:55:30.650 --> 01:55:33.920
you know,
keep your mouth horrible.
Yeah.

2064
01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:36.450
Cause everybody ever died of dehydration or he's,

2065
01:55:36.451 --> 01:55:40.340
he's been a 10th generation Shalman and no one's died and his whole fuck down

2066
01:55:40.341 --> 01:55:43.260
there too.
His whole thing swat along.
It's not too bad.
Not too bad.

2067
01:55:43.261 --> 01:55:45.120
It's the kind of the,
it's a good time of year though,

2068
01:55:45.121 --> 01:55:46.560
I guess to be out there in Costa Rica.

2069
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:51.300
But does he have summertime ones when you go crazy apocalyptic now Martin Sheen

2070
01:55:51.301 --> 01:55:53.490
in the hotel room,
you remember that shit.

2071
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.520
Here's your wet sponge to wipe your head with mean the we call from it is is I

2072
01:55:59.581 --> 01:56:01.020
guess if you go too deep,

2073
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:03.480
you can't recall anything like Graham Hancock in his report.

2074
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:07.350
He has a lot of the same start but then at a certain point he blacked out

2075
01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:11.190
because you just went to like the vibrations and whatever happened,

2076
01:56:11.191 --> 01:56:13.350
got too intense where he didn't remember it.
Well,
whatever.

2077
01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:16.980
My dose was allowed me to maintain a pretty lucid consciousness.

2078
01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:21.330
And then the fact that I didn't go to sleep for like 30 hours after I took it,

2079
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.920
I got to really think about it and let it set in and there was no confusion with

2080
01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:26.910
having to go to sleep.

2081
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.220
So that's why I was able to recall all of these things and you know,

2082
01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:33.750
kind of great detail.
You also,
they encourage you to bring a voice recorder,

2083
01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.230
which I remember,
you know,
mumbled some random things,
but I ended up remembering,

2084
01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:41.610
you know,
pretty much what I mumbled anyways into that wow.
Voice recorder.
But,
um,

2085
01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:45.450
do you have a voice activated one or just picked it up?
No,
you don't have to.

2086
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.690
That would have been cool as some technology that I would highly recommend.

2087
01:56:48.691 --> 01:56:52.980
I didn't even know that existed,
but can do had those forever.
That's sweet.

2088
01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:55.320
If you,
if anybody decides to go do this,

2089
01:56:55.321 --> 01:56:58.710
I would recommend that because it does get tough to remember stuff and you
can't,

2090
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:01.770
right.
I mean,
trying to look at a page or a screen with your eyes.

2091
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:05.670
It just forget about it.
Your eyes are fucking blowing out any sounds at all.

2092
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:10.320
Were you just laying there or we'd like moaning?
No,
no,
I wasn't.
I was,

2093
01:57:10.321 --> 01:57:13.850
I make a habit of not trying to moan.
Yeah.
That's the moment experience.

2094
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:18.870
The beginning of love to love you baby.
But,
uh,

2095
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:21.970
well it sounds like can you can talk so you can talk to the,

2096
01:57:21.971 --> 01:57:24.750
a Chaman encourages you to talk openly if you want.

2097
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:27.270
And there was some times where I'd go to ask them questions,

2098
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.900
but the moment you form a question,
you get the answer.
So it was funny,

2099
01:57:30.901 --> 01:57:35.130
it became like a funny thing.
Like I would ask them like,
what,
how long,
you know,

2100
01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:37.010
blah,
blah,
Blah till I'm able to do it.
And the,

2101
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:40.170
I would get the answer and be like,
oh,
that'll be about five or six hours.

2102
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:44.520
And I would just kind of laugh because I was getting my questions answered by

2103
01:57:44.521 --> 01:57:49.290
the [inaudible] I did.
You asked about alien.
I asked about aliens.

2104
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:51.060
And this gets really kind of,

2105
01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:55.530
this gets really weird here when we're asking about aliens.
So,
so I asked,

2106
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:58.680
I asked about aliens.
I was like,
what's,
you know,
what's going on with aliens?

2107
01:57:59.250 --> 01:58:00.083
And um,

2108
01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:04.260
basically what they had told me is that aliens have been,

2109
01:58:04.261 --> 01:58:09.261
had a direct interest in the fostering and development of life on earth and

2110
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:14.640
bringing us to a point of sentience.
Um,
and they've had an active role in that.

2111
01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:19.170
But the reason that they've been doing that is not too much to affect our

2112
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:22.560
physical bodies or effect our minds.
But this is where it gets weird.

2113
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:25.640
And I'm going to couch the saying,
this is just a theory.
I don't know if I like,

2114
01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:30.390
I'm not going to assign by psychedelic trip and balls and you get this idea and

2115
01:58:30.391 --> 01:58:33.840
you run with it.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,
so what they're doing is they're,

2116
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:38.500
they're tweaking our DNA to allow a different type of soul,

2117
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.630
the more advanced soul to allow to enter the human body and be able to direct

2118
01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:44.464
our decisions.

2119
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:47.650
So basically they're saying like there's different types of souls that can

2120
01:58:47.651 --> 01:58:51.820
access certain DNA.
So like a chimp DNA,
like a chimp,
like a human soul.

2121
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:52.780
Once it's been human,

2122
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:56.740
you can never go back to chimp because just what the chimp is able to do,

2123
01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:00.850
what he's able to think about,
the soldiers wouldn't fit in that DNA life form.

2124
01:59:01.150 --> 01:59:04.720
Right?
But there's other souls more advanced than humans,
right?

2125
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:09.370
So they've been modifying slightly the DNA of humans to allow these more

2126
01:59:09.371 --> 01:59:13.750
advanced souls to be able to enter these human bodies.
And that's,
that was like,

2127
01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:17.620
I was,
I was not expecting that at all.
And that's what it was just like boom,

2128
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.370
just straight up told me,
I was like,
really?
It's like really bitch.

2129
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:24.460
Like this is what's going on there.
Allowing,
you know,

2130
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.500
that different access to a whole new level of souls to help take us to the point

2131
01:59:29.501 --> 01:59:34.230
where we can not blow ourselves up and create,
you know,
fully sentience being,

2132
01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.760
<v 0>did they express it?</v>

2133
01:59:35.761 --> 01:59:40.740
This would be an evolutionary thing or a progressive thing or would it just be,

2134
01:59:40.741 --> 01:59:44.880
they would come down and metal spaceships and been doing it is what is what the

2135
01:59:44.881 --> 01:59:47.010
men,
do you feel you have an advanced soul?
Yes or no?

2136
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:51.710
<v 1>You know,
I mean there was,
I do feel like I have some,
you know,</v>

2137
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:55.380
some advantages that,
that or that I feel very blessed to have.
You know,

2138
01:59:55.381 --> 02:00:00.300
I feel like I can handle the psychedelic experience very well and I think that's

2139
02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:02.940
certainly,
you know,
I don't give myself credit for that.

2140
02:00:02.941 --> 02:00:04.800
Like I kicked ass and that's why I got,

2141
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:07.620
I think I was something that was innate and I was blessed to have.

2142
02:00:07.621 --> 02:00:10.050
So you think you are blessed to be good at taking psychedelics?

2143
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:15.080
I think the way that I think the w the way that I can get information from it,

2144
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:19.950
I feel like,
you know,
if I have one,
you know,
one innate talent,
you know,

2145
02:00:19.951 --> 02:00:22.440
and in this arena,
you know,
that would be it.

2146
02:00:22.441 --> 02:00:25.670
I don't think I'm any genius or how many,
you know,
magical.

2147
02:00:26.010 --> 02:00:27.430
<v 0>He was a thoughtful guy.</v>

2148
02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:30.400
I think a thoughtful person who has an intense experience is going to be able to

2149
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:32.560
withdraw something from it.
Why would you have that?

2150
02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:36.970
And also you've got your mind and your,
your eyes on progress.
You,

2151
02:00:36.971 --> 02:00:39.390
you were trying to improve as a human being as well.

2152
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:41.040
One of the most important things for everybody when,

2153
02:00:41.041 --> 02:00:43.420
when people get old and they fall apart,

2154
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:46.780
one of the reasons why they really fall apart is because they don't have

2155
02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:50.020
anything to try to do anymore than any of the thing they're trying to accomplish

2156
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:51.910
it.
Even though they don't have a passion anymore.
It's true.

2157
02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:55.360
There's things that stimulate you.
[inaudible] you know,
whatever it is.

2158
02:00:55.361 --> 02:00:57.040
We are craftsmen or uh,
you know,

2159
02:00:57.041 --> 02:01:00.870
I went to visit this guy that makes a pool cues when I was in Chicago was got

2160
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.930
Joe Gold and uh,
he's uh,
he's makes us pull cute.

2161
02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:09.930
It's very famous called the cognizant and it's one of the most sought after cues

2162
02:01:09.941 --> 02:01:10.361
in the world.

2163
02:01:10.361 --> 02:01:12.940
Cause he was like a really high level player when he was younger too.

2164
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.160
And this dude's,
you know,
he's in his sixties,

2165
02:01:15.161 --> 02:01:17.980
he smokes like fucking three packs of cigarettes a day.
You know,

2166
02:01:17.981 --> 02:01:20.260
he's not eating healthy.
Yeah.
And he's,
and he'll tell you like,

2167
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:23.740
you talked to them about a cancer and he's like,
Hey,
get it.
You don't get it.

2168
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.830
I'm not going to get it.
You know,
like some people can just smoke cigarettes.

2169
02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:30.010
You don't get it.
That's heavy Chicago accent.
But this dude,

2170
02:01:30.011 --> 02:01:33.670
like you talked to him about his cues and you know like you could like you see

2171
02:01:33.671 --> 02:01:36.510
the passion in what he does,
like the,
the,
the,
the,

2172
02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:39.360
the pride that he has for what he's created.
That,
you know,
the,

2173
02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.400
this is a very few people that are like known in the world to make great

2174
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:45.560
instruments in,
in any sort of a,

2175
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:48.680
whether it's musical insurance or a game tool,

2176
02:01:48.681 --> 02:01:50.330
like a pool cue or something like that.

2177
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.970
And when there's a guy who was like a real master craftsmen,

2178
02:01:53.110 --> 02:01:57.080
but the one thing that you find inevitably always and all these guys is this

2179
02:01:57.081 --> 02:02:00.140
passion for what they do.
Totally.
You know,
this,
this,

2180
02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:04.210
this desire to create something that they really feel proud of.
You know,
the,

2181
02:02:04.211 --> 02:02:07.010
the creative force inside of us is the most,

2182
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.780
the thing that gives you the most happiness,
the things that give you the,

2183
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:14.150
the biggest feeling of reward.
You know,
like this.
I mean this is not,

2184
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:17.540
it doesn't seem like it's creative cause it's kind of just this free full fuck

2185
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:19.070
fest,
this podcast that we do.

2186
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.570
But this is the most rewarding thing that either me or Brian,

2187
02:02:23.571 --> 02:02:24.440
I think he's ever done.

2188
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:26.900
Have you done anything that's more rewarding than this now

2189
02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:32.160
<v 1>except close together?
I don't think it works that way.
So rewarding.
Yeah,
it's,</v>

2190
02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:35.360
I again,
I agree with that,
but you know,

2191
02:02:35.610 --> 02:02:37.790
<v 0>what is it?
It's because you're putting out a lot of creativity.</v>

2192
02:02:37.791 --> 02:02:38.870
You're putting on a lot of stuff.

2193
02:02:38.871 --> 02:02:41.330
Like people are getting something out of it and the more you put out,

2194
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.230
the more people get out of it and then it becomes like a super rewarding like

2195
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:46.610
happy,
good feeling thing

2196
02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.460
<v 1>keeps you out while you're creating a positive feedback loop.
Exactly.</v>

2197
02:02:50.490 --> 02:02:53.490
Which is really cool.
And even some everybody getting the cues,
you know,

2198
02:02:53.491 --> 02:02:54.900
you create a masterful piece.

2199
02:02:54.901 --> 02:02:59.610
Every time someone strikes the ball with that que you're creating this positive

2200
02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.120
feedback loop,
which is some people don't have anything new like doing.

2201
02:03:03.570 --> 02:03:06.960
That's just really what,
what's fucked up?
Is it true that we need a queen?

2202
02:03:06.961 --> 02:03:08.480
And we also need workers.
Is it,

2203
02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:12.690
do we have worker be humans that are just out there just fucking barely,

2204
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:17.630
barely able to figure out how to like walk to the car,
hit the button?

2205
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:21.450
No,
but do I really,
I think they're,
I think there are certain people who have,

2206
02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:24.780
you know,
different gifts than other people.
Maybe different proclivities,

2207
02:03:24.781 --> 02:03:28.200
different talents.
You know,
I don't think the talent level is the same,

2208
02:03:28.201 --> 02:03:30.960
but I think even if it's the most menial tasks,

2209
02:03:30.961 --> 02:03:34.440
you can do that task with your eye on,
with your eye on something else.

2210
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:39.070
The trash man can have it be a trash man with the idea that,
you know,

2211
02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.080
this must happen for society to function and be good and this has to happen.

2212
02:03:43.081 --> 02:03:46.860
Or we'll have like France was during the riots and fucking garbage everywhere.

2213
02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:51.390
Like I am doing my part in that.
But meanwhile their eye is on a different prize.

2214
02:03:51.391 --> 02:03:54.720
Maybe they want to master,
you know,
whatever else it is.

2215
02:03:54.721 --> 02:03:57.180
There's very little crafts and things.
Everything's kind of mass produced.

2216
02:03:57.181 --> 02:03:58.980
So that's tough too because some of these people,

2217
02:03:58.981 --> 02:04:02.550
some of these trashman might've been great fucking blacksmiths or something like

2218
02:04:02.551 --> 02:04:04.530
that.
But those skills,
yeah.
You know,

2219
02:04:04.531 --> 02:04:06.480
it's very hard to make something or do something.

2220
02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:09.840
So they put themselves into Budweiser and football or whatever and they're super

2221
02:04:09.841 --> 02:04:14.400
kind of not happy.
So it's a challenging time.
[inaudible] horseshoe stupid.

2222
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:17.490
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
There's not those kind of skills.

2223
02:04:17.491 --> 02:04:21.060
And that would be super rewarding to make like a sword.
There are now four shoe,

2224
02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:23.190
even to this day,
you're hammering something.

2225
02:04:23.191 --> 02:04:26.530
There's fire or watched this special job on um,

2226
02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:28.380
one of the history channel or something like that.

2227
02:04:28.381 --> 02:04:31.380
It was a thing with mark to Costco.
You remember that guy?

2228
02:04:31.890 --> 02:04:35.930
He was a martial arts guy from it did a bunch of movies,
like a Capoeira movie,

2229
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:38.550
a bunch of things.
Was He,
um,
he went to Japan

2230
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.440
<v 0>and went to Wa,
it was,
a lot of,</v>

2231
02:04:40.441 --> 02:04:43.890
it was on Musashi and a lot of it was also on the construction of the Samurai

2232
02:04:43.891 --> 02:04:44.400
swords.

2233
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.390
And they went to this dude who still make Samurai swords the old way and they

2234
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:53.310
were hammering this whole deal and folding it.
Oh,
it's fucking bad ass,

2235
02:04:53.311 --> 02:04:57.780
man.
It makes you want to see a Samurai movie.
Like,
come on bitch.
You know,

2236
02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.720
they're hammering your train.
I mean,

2237
02:05:00.721 --> 02:05:05.220
and then they show the blade after this guy's done with countless hours of

2238
02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:08.400
perfecting this and slicing it into water when it's red hot and,

2239
02:05:08.410 --> 02:05:13.090
and hammering on it.
I mean,
it's fucking an amazing craft.
You know,
the,

2240
02:05:13.091 --> 02:05:16.110
the creation of Samurai swords that afterwards the blade,

2241
02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:19.080
you see the etchings than the line looks like would grab on it.

2242
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:20.790
It's been folded so many times.

2243
02:05:21.250 --> 02:05:24.810
What people don't understand is they flatten out a piece of steel and then they

2244
02:05:24.811 --> 02:05:27.930
folded over the heat it up and they slam it together somehow with a hammer.

2245
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.660
And then they keep doing that over and over and over and over and over.

2246
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:35.010
And it makes sense go insanely strong steel,
just insanely strong.

2247
02:05:35.130 --> 02:05:38.190
And then after this guy does that,
he steps outside and chops this,
uh,

2248
02:05:38.191 --> 02:05:42.780
this bamboo stock and half.
It's so fucking bad ass.
Yeah.

2249
02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:45.870
That's just so bad ass oh comic to Tom People.

2250
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:48.810
It's so nice that people still know how that guy does that.

2251
02:05:48.811 --> 02:05:52.650
It's so important because that's got to go away,
right?
I mean,
we,
we,
we,
we're,

2252
02:05:52.670 --> 02:05:57.150
we're lucky that we have a window into the Japanese Samurai Sword.
Make totally,

2253
02:05:57.151 --> 02:06:00.120
you know,
because that,
that could easily a hundred years from now,

2254
02:06:00.121 --> 02:06:03.360
that could be like dust in the wind.
You know,
nobody knows how to do it anymore.

2255
02:06:03.361 --> 02:06:06.680
You can't watch it anymore.
There's no video.
You know,
we lost it all.
It's all,

2256
02:06:06.690 --> 02:06:10.080
it's all on DVDs and now everything's in the clouds and so there's no more

2257
02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:13.740
Samurai shit.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
we could,
we could forget that,

2258
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.770
that critical part of history where people have figured out this insane,

2259
02:06:16.930 --> 02:06:19.230
you know,
way to construct a sword.
Yeah.
Those sorts,

2260
02:06:19.231 --> 02:06:21.720
I've actually been looking at some of the,
some of them go for,

2261
02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:23.160
they're called knee Honcho.

2262
02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:26.790
The blades that are authentic made by Japanese craftsmen signed on the bottom

2263
02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:31.550
underneath.
Then they'll go for like a hundred grand,
a hundred grand.

2264
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.080
You look up in the Honcho blades and she's like,
that.
There's some,

2265
02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:37.260
actually there's some pretty good us sword makers apparently doing stuff.

2266
02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:40.390
One guy named Howard Clark making some pretty cool swords.
Really?

2267
02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:41.940
There's actually polishers too.

2268
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:44.340
So if you're going to buy a store that's custom made,

2269
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:49.050
he spent like 5,000 for the blade and then you can spend like 3,500 on jump do

2270
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:52.890
just polishing it,
giving it that,
you know that uh,
I forget what it's called,

2271
02:06:52.891 --> 02:06:56.430
but on the blade,
that kind of mirror frosting that looks like the uh,

2272
02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.730
it looks like how it is and you'll spend 3,500 just getting it properly.

2273
02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:00.630
The Ham on,

2274
02:07:00.630 --> 02:07:04.950
they call h and you get 3,500 getting it polished and then you get it mounted.

2275
02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:08.690
You put the suit on,
you wrap it up,
you do all the things that you're,
you know,

2276
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:12.510
handmade sword.
You're still in it for about 10 grand these many years.

2277
02:07:12.511 --> 02:07:15.150
Was it where people just fought with swords?

2278
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:19.290
How many years was that before they figured out like arrows and then arrows were

2279
02:07:19.291 --> 02:07:23.690
pretty early before they figured out swords had to come before ours.
You know,

2280
02:07:24.490 --> 02:07:29.430
you think clubs with spikes and shit.
Yes,
but swords and spears,

2281
02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:32.460
Spears Beers were around pretty early,
but arrows,

2282
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:36.130
arrows were around pretty fucking bad cause they had slings,

2283
02:07:36.131 --> 02:07:37.840
so they had that concept of that sling.

2284
02:07:37.841 --> 02:07:41.140
The slings here was the one of the first ones where you put the spear and the

2285
02:07:41.141 --> 02:07:42.870
little notch.
Yeah,
it's like a man,

2286
02:07:42.871 --> 02:07:45.470
a handle thing in the momentum kind of hawks it.

2287
02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:47.320
Then figuring out the arrows from there,

2288
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:49.010
but the motto amazing that they figured that out.

2289
02:07:49.190 --> 02:07:52.030
That was caveman fucking figured that out.
That was pretty cool.

2290
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:55.750
Then the Mongols were the ones who really advanced the boat because the English,

2291
02:07:55.751 --> 02:08:00.130
both the Longbow was nowhere near the range of the Mongol recurve bow.

2292
02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:03.910
Real Mongols were the ones that invented the recurve bow and that gave them some

2293
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:04.930
insane range,

2294
02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:09.970
smaller bow and the way that it's bent back double allowed them to have way out,

2295
02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:10.990
shoot the other archer's,

2296
02:08:10.991 --> 02:08:15.160
which is one of the technological advancements that allowed them to conquer so

2297
02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.030
they know that they would come up with some Ted Nugent type shit in the future.

2298
02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:22.270
You know I have a compound bone of rubber pig and I shoot that fucker my

2299
02:08:22.271 --> 02:08:26.170
backyard sometimes.
God Damn,
those arrows go fast.
They do.
That's,

2300
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:29.660
I got a 60 pound pull one cause I'm fucking man.
Shit.

2301
02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.350
I'll check that shit out there.
But um,

2302
02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:36.400
did the arrows fly off that ball man,
it's scary.

2303
02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.030
You know there like some serious projectiles.
You remember Bo and Luke Duke,

2304
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:43.450
they had to use bows and arrows because they were felons and they weren't

2305
02:08:43.451 --> 02:08:46.940
allowed to have guns with that and the dukes of Hazzard rails,

2306
02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:50.440
that's why they had boats.
That's how I first found out about compound bows.

2307
02:08:50.441 --> 02:08:53.140
Watching the Dukes of hazard.
You have one in few,
you have one of those.

2308
02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.500
Do you have one of the new ones?
So it's like really small shit.

2309
02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.810
There are some that were long.
They look like regular bows,

2310
02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:01.390
but now they've like compressed them.
It's not very big.

2311
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:05.190
It's not like that's one of the new ones,
like an English or anything.
Yeah,

2312
02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.690
it's crazy.
The newer ones are smaller because Amazon Bose,

2313
02:09:07.691 --> 02:09:11.260
they're like fucking nine feet long.
Yeah.
Or the old Japanese bows.

2314
02:09:11.261 --> 02:09:15.010
It's like a giant piece of bamboo.
Yes.
Do you ever seen that photo of a,

2315
02:09:15.011 --> 02:09:17.050
there's people flying over in a plane.

2316
02:09:17.051 --> 02:09:21.280
There's a tribe and they got their arrows pointed,
uh,
at the,
uh,
cameras now.

2317
02:09:21.281 --> 02:09:24.100
I have never seen it.
I've seen that picture.
Apparently it's fake,

2318
02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:28.590
but it was super bummed.
Like,
cause it was like an outlet.
Yeah,
it was a,
a,

2319
02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:31.390
you know,
a tribe,
a undiscovered tribe found.

2320
02:09:31.391 --> 02:09:35.030
They're like [inaudible] going to exactly flying and point your email.

2321
02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.960
They just dressed all these assholes off and put fucking red paint on them and

2322
02:09:37.961 --> 02:09:39.670
shit.
And they made him look really crazy.

2323
02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:43.120
Like the cover their whole body in red paint.
And one of them was like all blue.

2324
02:09:43.210 --> 02:09:44.110
You know,
it was pretty nutty.

2325
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.560
When you were talking about earlier about the vision that you had about stars

2326
02:09:47.561 --> 02:09:52.120
exploding and shit like that.
I asked Brian to pull this video up,
Neil Tyson,

2327
02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:56.170
cause it's one of the most Badass and inspirational things.

2328
02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.080
It's a Neil degrasse Tyson if you've never heard of them.

2329
02:09:59.081 --> 02:10:03.490
It's just really fucking cool guy who is not just uh,

2330
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:07.600
an astrophysicist.
What,
what is his,
his exact credentials,

2331
02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.790
whatever it is.
He's a super genius,
fucking astro physicists,
astrophysicists.

2332
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:14.830
But what he's really,
he also is,

2333
02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.640
is a great personality and the way he explains things,
she's like a really,

2334
02:10:18.641 --> 02:10:20.350
really likable guy.

2335
02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:25.510
And the way he explains things is so smooth and so brilliant that,

2336
02:10:25.511 --> 02:10:28.060
you know,
it really like makes you absorb these,

2337
02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:31.030
these ideas and these images because you'll like him so much because he seemed

2338
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:35.270
like such a likable guy.
And He,
uh,
had this one that,
uh,

2339
02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:38.480
was somebody tweeted it to me and it's something that I knew,

2340
02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:40.730
but it's something that when you hear it again,

2341
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:45.731
especially hearing it from him makes it sound so crazy when you think about how,

2342
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:49.760
what is the most human is constructed tomato you can share with us about the

2343
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:54.430
universe.
The most astounding fact,

2344
02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:58.030
the most astounding fact is the knowledge

2345
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:04.150
<v 2>that the atoms that comprise life on earth,</v>

2346
02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:09.690
the atoms that make up the human body are traceable to the crucibles that cooked

2347
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:18.930
light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and

2348
02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:24.250
pressures.
These stars,
the high mass ones among them,

2349
02:11:25.150 --> 02:11:27.010
when unstable in their later years,

2350
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.320
they collapsed and then exploded,

2351
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:35.000
scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy.

2352
02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:39.170
Guts made of carbon,
nitrogen,
oxygen,

2353
02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:44.140
and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself.

2354
02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:49.150
These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense,
collapse,

2355
02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:52.810
form the next generation of solar systems,

2356
02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:58.270
stars with orbiting planets.
And those planets now have ingredients for life.

2357
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:59.203
So,

2358
02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:05.200
so that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes,

2359
02:12:05.201 --> 02:12:08.170
we are part of this universe,

2360
02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:10.510
we are in this universe,

2361
02:12:12.070 --> 02:12:17.070
but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in

2362
02:12:17.321 --> 02:12:21.070
us.
When I reflect on that fact,

2363
02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:26.110
I look up,
many people feel small cause they're small and the universe is big.

2364
02:12:26.230 --> 02:12:27.063
But I feel big

2365
02:12:28.810 --> 02:12:33.220
because my atoms came from those stars.

2366
02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:38.080
There's a level of connectivity that's really what you want in life.

2367
02:12:38.081 --> 02:12:42.100
You want to feel connected.
I want to feel relevant.
What a few like

2368
02:12:43.730 --> 02:12:48.160
your participant,
the goings on of activities and events around you.

2369
02:12:48.610 --> 02:12:51.730
That's precisely what we are just by being alive.

2370
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.740
<v 6>Hm.</v>

2371
02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:56.380
<v 0>God Damn.
That dude's a bad mother fucker.
Yeah,
yes.</v>

2372
02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:01.810
That's amazing that I came off a question to.
Beautiful.
It's so beautiful.

2373
02:13:01.811 --> 02:13:04.630
He does have left and right all day.
That's what he does.

2374
02:13:04.631 --> 02:13:06.550
Go on the Internet and Neil degrasse Tyson all day.

2375
02:13:06.551 --> 02:13:10.180
He's got just all these amazing videos of him breaking down things in such an

2376
02:13:10.181 --> 02:13:12.850
entertaining way.
I mean,
and he's such a nice guy.

2377
02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:16.270
He was even on Bill Maher show and he was in debating with some guy from GM was

2378
02:13:16.271 --> 02:13:19.390
trying to say that climate change is not manmade.
And,
and,

2379
02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:23.500
and he was like really being polite about when the guy was like talking about

2380
02:13:23.501 --> 02:13:25.560
the science behind.
He was like,
that's not true.
Like,
well,

2381
02:13:25.561 --> 02:13:30.040
he was really being very nice and he shut the guy down like a master fighter

2382
02:13:30.041 --> 02:13:32.130
when he spars with an he doesn't shine.

2383
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.100
<v 1>Yeah,
he was Bobby pizza man,
this guy's a fucking,
uh,
a gigantic corporate,</v>

2384
02:13:37.110 --> 02:13:38.610
you know,
a monster,

2385
02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:42.420
a guy who's a in charge of a huge company that probably does a fuck load of

2386
02:13:42.421 --> 02:13:45.420
polluting the environment and doesn't want anything to change as far as

2387
02:13:45.421 --> 02:13:49.230
regulations,
concerns.
So he's spouting out a bunch of bullshit.
And a genius,

2388
02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:54.230
you know,
but the idea that we are actually made of stardust,
I had such a fuck.

2389
02:13:54.730 --> 02:13:59.610
It's such a complete mind.
Fuck it is.
You know,
it's such a
what?

2390
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:03.350
Wrapping your head around that.
Fuck.
Yeah.
You asked in La,

2391
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:07.710
you accidentally said the,
you know,
an interesting term that directed Panspermia,

2392
02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.440
which was also a theory of a,
of Francis Crick.

2393
02:14:10.441 --> 02:14:13.080
Basically what he was saying is that the DNA,

2394
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:16.500
that the life forms are so complex that a lot of the Bible,

2395
02:14:16.501 --> 02:14:20.640
a lot of science right now talks about this like prebiotic soup of all of these

2396
02:14:20.641 --> 02:14:24.300
molecules kind of just rummaging around all crazy,
bumping into each other,

2397
02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.700
eventually creating proteins.
Well,

2398
02:14:26.701 --> 02:14:30.260
some of these proteins are like 200 atoms long and,

2399
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:35.350
and the probability of even one of these proteins in life is comprised of many

2400
02:14:35.491 --> 02:14:35.971
proteins.

2401
02:14:35.971 --> 02:14:40.920
Remember to create one of these specific proteins necessary for life.

2402
02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:45.540
The odds of that happening at random,
our one over the,

2403
02:14:45.810 --> 02:14:50.810
over the number one with 260 zeros after it won over one with 260 zeroes.

2404
02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:53.700
That's the,

2405
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:58.700
just the pure probability of those atoms bumping together for primordial.

2406
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:03.330
So we can't even fathom a number like that.
I mean it goes across the room.

2407
02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.990
So that's the probabilities of life,
of,
of just one protein.

2408
02:15:06.991 --> 02:15:11.190
And then you got to figure these proteins have to come together and create,

2409
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:11.850
you know,

2410
02:15:11.850 --> 02:15:15.540
and bump into each other and then form these complex proteins where they're

2411
02:15:15.541 --> 02:15:18.210
working together to create life.
So that's why,
you know,

2412
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:21.240
Francis Crick was an esoteric,
didn't really believe in God,

2413
02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:26.400
but he couldn't wrap his head around the statistical improbability that had

2414
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:27.210
happened like that.

2415
02:15:27.210 --> 02:15:32.040
That's why he came up with the theory of directed panspermia either his theory

2416
02:15:32.041 --> 02:15:34.410
was that directed actual beings,

2417
02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:37.890
his theory was that being seeded the planet Francis Crick,

2418
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:39.310
that's what he believed.
Really.

2419
02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:42.750
He believed that being seated at now another Panspermia cheery this,

2420
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:46.530
this was in Graham Hancock's and it's pretty well,
pretty well referenced to,

2421
02:15:46.531 --> 02:15:49.980
I went and checked some of the references that he had,
but um,

2422
02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:52.140
but another theory was that the comments,

2423
02:15:52.141 --> 02:15:56.400
and this is non-directed Panspermia the comments delivered this bacteria,

2424
02:15:56.610 --> 02:15:58.230
but it's a really interesting thought.
I mean,

2425
02:15:58.231 --> 02:16:01.920
there were saying basically the chances of this happening was like a hurricane

2426
02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:05.610
assembling a seven 37 in a junkyard.

2427
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.960
That was the chances of life for me.
Life on earth,
life on earth,
a hurricane,

2428
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:14.550
assembling a seven 37 in a junk yard,
just a junk yard.
And then boom,

2429
02:16:14.551 --> 02:16:16.920
the wind goes,
oh shit,
there's a plane.
Holy Fuck.

2430
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:21.030
What's really amazing is that we had a complete reboot 65 million years ago.

2431
02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.590
Yeah.
That the most amazing thing about earth today is it 65 million years ago,

2432
02:16:25.591 --> 02:16:30.190
none of this shit was around 65 million years ago.
We got hit by a giant

2433
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:32.590
<v 0>rock that killed off all the dinosaurs and you know,</v>

2434
02:16:32.591 --> 02:16:36.700
left a huge fucking crater in the Yucatan.
And from that,

2435
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:39.760
everything has got to this point,
just 65 million years.

2436
02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:42.700
Imagine if the earth was only 65 million years old.
I mean,

2437
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:45.430
it's a really an incredible amount of time.
Don't get me wrong,

2438
02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:48.670
but it has nothing on 4.6 billion was the earth really is or whatever it is.

2439
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:52.120
So if you wanted to see the planet and have it actually work,
you know,

2440
02:16:52.121 --> 02:16:55.240
let's just go along with,
with cricks theory that it was some Intel,

2441
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:59.830
it directed Panspermia you just find the toughest little bastard of life form,

2442
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:03.010
which is bacteria and then just let natural selection work.

2443
02:17:03.011 --> 02:17:04.570
You just splashed that on there.

2444
02:17:04.571 --> 02:17:08.290
And then from there you realize that the forces at work of natural selection are

2445
02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:13.120
going to create myriad lifeforms that are going to be optimal for living in

2446
02:17:13.121 --> 02:17:14.440
whatever climate develops.

2447
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:17.950
And so I think that was his theory that has just had to have come from somewhere

2448
02:17:17.951 --> 02:17:20.650
else.
But then you run into the fucking problem of,
you know,

2449
02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:21.550
the chicken and the egg.

2450
02:17:21.551 --> 02:17:25.840
Some point at some point some primordial soup had to form the first life.

2451
02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:29.050
So it doesn't really get you around the problem to begin with.

2452
02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:32.590
He's just saying that on earth there wasn't enough time for that to have been

2453
02:17:32.591 --> 02:17:35.320
for this to have been the first one.
I imagine if that's what the,
uh,

2454
02:17:35.321 --> 02:17:39.490
the asteroid 65 million years ago was like a correction.
Like,
look,

2455
02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:41.020
there's nothing is ever going to get done.

2456
02:17:41.021 --> 02:17:43.390
We have giant fucking lizard on the wrong way.

2457
02:17:43.391 --> 02:17:47.980
Somehow under the old giant predatory lizards with a softball sized brains.

2458
02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:52.210
Bigger and bigger.
Yeah.
They eat everything.
You can't.

2459
02:17:52.211 --> 02:17:53.950
You can't even grow past like a mole.

2460
02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:57.730
You're like a little mole running around in the dirt,
hiding from giant feet.

2461
02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.350
What a shit bag life.

2462
02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:05.770
It must have been back then when the dinosaurs were fucking roaming everywhere.

2463
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:10.690
You imagine everywhere you look,
dinosaurs,
t rex,
t rex,

2464
02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:14.020
wandering around your neighborhood and it was either by chance or by some

2465
02:18:14.350 --> 02:18:17.950
intelligence.
That's what it is.
They just control.
They just control z.
That bitch,

2466
02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.910
nope,
let's try it out and do it again.
Do and went back a few steps.

2467
02:18:21.970 --> 02:18:25.150
Let's do a rag wipe.
The hard drive.
Yeah.
Kill off everything.

2468
02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.220
Everything bigger than a chicken's got to go.

2469
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:30.400
What do you think was like the biggest thing that lit a lot of birds apparently

2470
02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:34.290
and so crocodiles and stuff like that.
Red Ocean stuff.
There's some stuff.
Yeah.

2471
02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:39.090
Stuff.
Yeah,
but like Sila cancer,
shit like that.
It's Wa much longer.
Yeah,

2472
02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.870
they were super old.
Yeah.
They still have like appendages,
like the,
the,
the,

2473
02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:46.540
the transitionary fossil between like walking and swimming that the Christians

2474
02:18:46.541 --> 02:18:50.530
are over screaming for.
Where's your transitionary fossils?
You tell me.

2475
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.190
You tell me that the Lord created me out of a monkey.

2476
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:59.950
See Monkey still.
They're still around.
That is a true thing,
man.

2477
02:18:59.951 --> 02:19:02.440
Imagine monkeys.
Like,
how the fuck did these assholes figure it out?

2478
02:19:02.650 --> 02:19:06.370
Like monkeys were monkeys,
you know,
million years ago,
2 million years ago.

2479
02:19:06.490 --> 02:19:10.630
There was the sane,
not us.
We figured some shit out and rocketed,

2480
02:19:10.631 --> 02:19:15.140
passed all those bitches or alien intervention or we go,

2481
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:19.090
Francis Crick says,
Yep.
Are we got help?
It's a,
it's an interesting theory.

2482
02:19:19.091 --> 02:19:22.810
You know,
it's tough.
I mean maybe shit,
maybe tough.
We'll get bad enough in our,

2483
02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:26.410
in our lifetime that we'll find definitively.
You know that the fucking,

2484
02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:28.040
the Oz behind the curtain is just

2485
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.410
<v 3>going to have to say,
all right bitches,
I'm here for reals.</v>

2486
02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:34.390
You guys are blowing it.
But I think that's,
it doesn't seem like that's there.

2487
02:19:34.391 --> 02:19:36.980
It seems like if they are there,
they're trying to avoid that at all.

2488
02:19:36.981 --> 02:19:38.840
Fucking costs,
but I don't know.

2489
02:19:38.841 --> 02:19:42.920
I think maybe if shit got fucking total Armageddon enough,
you know,

2490
02:19:42.921 --> 02:19:44.870
maybe it'd be like,
all right,
you guys are going to kill each other.

2491
02:19:44.871 --> 02:19:47.390
We've been waiting for this for four and a half billion years,

2492
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:52.280
so here's the plan.
You know,
don't you tell me that?
Was that clear?

2493
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:56.630
You know?
Yeah.
Dad did that.
So it probably would psychedelics,
are there tools,

2494
02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.710
tools to try to get through this?
Absolutely.
I mean,

2495
02:19:58.711 --> 02:20:00.890
all of them seem to be about self reflection.

2496
02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:04.610
All of them seem to offer besides good times and besides using them as a

2497
02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:06.560
recreation,
and a lot of people say,
man,

2498
02:20:06.561 --> 02:20:08.360
you shouldn't use psychedelics as a recreation.

2499
02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:12.830
They're very intense and powerful medicine to which I reply,
yeah,

2500
02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:17.690
but they're fun and recreation,
so yes,
you should fuck you.
You're so serious.

2501
02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:19.880
Like people get so serious psychedelic drugs,

2502
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:21.950
man or not to be taken for recreation.

2503
02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:25.610
They are important learning tools or they're great to take a little bit and

2504
02:20:25.611 --> 02:20:28.640
giggle.
Guess what?
That's good too.
You can't tell me it's bad.

2505
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:29.810
You can't tell me it's bad.

2506
02:20:29.811 --> 02:20:33.620
If I ate a little bit of mushrooms and laugh my ass off,
that's not bad.
You know,

2507
02:20:33.621 --> 02:20:36.560
you can't tell me I'm abusing it,
the fuck them abusing it.
I'm so happy.

2508
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.310
I'm so happy.
I've got some mushrooms and it made me laugh.
Made a movie better,

2509
02:20:40.311 --> 02:20:43.970
made a conversation better.
It's important to demystify him to a certain degree.

2510
02:20:43.971 --> 02:20:46.340
I mean there are certain settings where you should take them seriously.

2511
02:20:46.341 --> 02:20:49.220
Like don't fucking take a Bogo Willy Nilly with your buddies.

2512
02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:50.840
Like that's a nightmare.
You're just,

2513
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:54.350
you're setting yourself up for a bad situation.
But at the same time,

2514
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:58.220
you know it's not magic.
You know,
there are plants that are here designed,

2515
02:20:58.221 --> 02:20:59.900
I believe is tools.
Like you said,

2516
02:20:59.901 --> 02:21:03.590
they're part of what should be in everybody's tool bag,
which was able to die.

2517
02:21:03.591 --> 02:21:07.670
Man.
It's obvious.
I mean there's a reason why bees pollinate flowers,
you know,

2518
02:21:07.671 --> 02:21:10.190
there's a,
there's a reason why this whole thing goes down.

2519
02:21:10.191 --> 02:21:13.700
They make honey create hives and it's all,
that's what they do.

2520
02:21:13.701 --> 02:21:14.960
It's what they've always done.

2521
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:18.770
There's clearly some sort of a system in place and I think that all of these

2522
02:21:18.771 --> 02:21:22.910
plants are a part of this system and they're all aiding us all these psychedelic

2523
02:21:22.911 --> 02:21:25.640
experiences over there to show us different experiences,

2524
02:21:25.641 --> 02:21:28.350
different perspectives and aid us along the way there.

2525
02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.190
Self-Improvement devices and I think the,
you know,

2526
02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:35.210
kind of the making them forbid and both by the church and by the state because

2527
02:21:35.211 --> 02:21:39.020
the church has done a hell of a lot of damage to making and they're behind a lot

2528
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:40.190
of these,
you know,

2529
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:43.130
kind of destruction on the last thing they want is people high making up their

2530
02:21:43.131 --> 02:21:44.510
own religions.
Right,
exactly.

2531
02:21:44.511 --> 02:21:46.850
Having direct access without having to go through them,

2532
02:21:46.851 --> 02:21:50.390
it takes away their power base.
So that I think is the main factor.

2533
02:21:50.391 --> 02:21:53.180
That's really retarded.
Our growth as,

2534
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:56.480
as humanity and in what's put us in this situation where,
you know,

2535
02:21:56.481 --> 02:21:59.390
we're pretty out of touch in general now that not everybody,

2536
02:21:59.391 --> 02:22:02.690
certainly there's a whole wave of consciousness that we're seeing developed.

2537
02:22:02.691 --> 02:22:05.660
But having that absent for so many years,

2538
02:22:05.661 --> 02:22:08.810
these puritans and pilgrims and all of this,
you know,

2539
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:11.300
religious bullshit and Islam and everything,

2540
02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.880
if they were able to really get back to the truth,

2541
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:18.020
they've eliminated the access to self correction.
You know,
there's been like,

2542
02:22:18.021 --> 02:22:21.020
all right,
we got this bullshit path and what's going to stop us?

2543
02:22:21.021 --> 02:22:24.590
What's going to stop this juggernaut?
Well,
truth and self correction.
Well,

2544
02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.040
how do find that while all the

2545
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.460
<v 0>psychedelics boom done make a mil legal,
you know that the,
uh,</v>

2546
02:22:29.461 --> 02:22:34.410
the Supreme Court upheld the churches use of a eyewash SCA in New Mexico.

2547
02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:38.400
You know about all that,
that whole situation,
right?
Yeah.
2006,
you know,

2548
02:22:38.401 --> 02:22:41.820
they're still doing it.
There's a,
apparently there's a church that you can go to.

2549
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.800
It's a Oh,
Centro,
a spirit,
a bed,
a fishy NTA,

2550
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:51.090
une out dough,
veggie towel,
and we're here.

2551
02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:54.730
Maybe I'll dove vegetal the vegetables.
Like the idea is that the vegetable,

2552
02:22:54.731 --> 02:22:58.350
you're drinking their drink and IOWASCA and it's a part of their,
their church,

2553
02:22:58.351 --> 02:23:01.430
they're allowed to drink it by the fucking supreme court.
They,

2554
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:05.160
they treat it as a true religious sacrament because they're a Christian Church,

2555
02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:08.670
even though it's a schedule one substance.
So they're,
they're allowed to do it.

2556
02:23:08.930 --> 02:23:12.300
We just got to get that church to really fucking kick ass and expand the roots.

2557
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:15.960
And maybe that's,
maybe that's the way I might be the way yet.
I mean,

2558
02:23:15.961 --> 02:23:18.060
they already got their fucking green light.
You know,

2559
02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:20.310
it's a small congregation right now in New Mexico.

2560
02:23:20.311 --> 02:23:22.560
I'm sure that they'd be interested in branching out,
forming,

2561
02:23:22.890 --> 02:23:24.950
forming some affiliates.
Yeah.

2562
02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:29.280
Maybe that's what we should hop on on it,
on it.

2563
02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:34.620
Audit Maboga labs and vegetal image tile and DMT labs.
Yeah.
On it.

2564
02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:37.380
Um,
uh,
IOWASCA spiritual centers.

2565
02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:41.970
You Imagine Jesus Christ.
Imagine that actually became a real thing.

2566
02:23:41.971 --> 02:23:45.360
And that's something we got into.
Whoa,
that's a,

2567
02:23:45.370 --> 02:23:47.400
that's a way to really have an impact on society.

2568
02:23:47.401 --> 02:23:50.010
It's really too bad you can't do that or even think about doing it.
Now,

2569
02:23:50.011 --> 02:23:53.670
one of my questions was,
all right,
what,
what should society do to self correct?

2570
02:23:53.671 --> 02:23:56.310
And I got two answers and one of the answers was,
you know,

2571
02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:57.970
you're doing one of them now.
You know,

2572
02:23:57.971 --> 02:24:01.800
this is one of the tools to show you truth.
This is going to take people back.

2573
02:24:01.801 --> 02:24:03.480
It's going to eliminate their addictions,

2574
02:24:03.481 --> 02:24:07.260
all the things that are fucked up about themselves,
you know,
self correct them.

2575
02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:09.240
And then by self correcting themselves,

2576
02:24:09.450 --> 02:24:12.180
it's gonna self correct society as a whole.
This is a great way back.

2577
02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:14.910
But then the other thing it said was,

2578
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:17.940
which was pretty funny and it and more humorous than anything,
but it just said,

2579
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:22.860
it showed me a picture of congress and everybody just being completely naked,

2580
02:24:23.430 --> 02:24:28.410
like no clothes,
no nothing.
And it was like,
you know,
people are hiding so much,

2581
02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:31.090
even behind the very clothes that we're wearing,
you know,

2582
02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:34.590
that's just allowing them to be this different person.
You know,

2583
02:24:34.591 --> 02:24:38.460
this transparency that would be around if we lived,
you know,
kind of tribally it,

2584
02:24:38.470 --> 02:24:42.450
it's almost like the symbolism of wearing these suits in allows,
you know,

2585
02:24:42.451 --> 02:24:46.410
Newt Gingrich to be all suited up and he would be a person you would never

2586
02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.430
fucking listen to.
[inaudible]

2587
02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:53.880
his body naked and he's just being all gnarly and nasty and his normal newt cell

2588
02:24:54.450 --> 02:24:57.480
naked people will be like,
come on man.
But you know,

2589
02:24:57.481 --> 02:25:01.860
it just allows this kind of falsehood to covering up as disgusting body.

2590
02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:02.670
But does that,

2591
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:05.580
does that preclude someone from having a great and brilliant idea if they would

2592
02:25:05.581 --> 02:25:07.670
discuss?
No,
I don't think so.
If Michael Moore was,

2593
02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:11.310
I think you had translated him at protests when you try and send it,

2594
02:25:11.370 --> 02:25:13.290
I think people would be like,
that's a brilliant fucking,

2595
02:25:13.291 --> 02:25:16.350
cause everybody would see everybody naked.
So you got used to the whole gamut,

2596
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:20.160
be like go on and do a one of those nude beaches,
which is mostly the worst,

2597
02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.040
you know,
physically a terrible sites.
You terribly.
But you know,

2598
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.200
<v 3>at a certain point you just look past it and like,
oh these people are cool,</v>

2599
02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:31.050
cool people start getting creepy witch.
Right?
Yeah.
I could have it to it.

2600
02:25:31.051 --> 02:25:33.070
That's like,
yeah,
I think Congress should totally be naked.

2601
02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:34.600
That's exactly what they should do.

2602
02:25:34.601 --> 02:25:37.450
They should make those fucks come out there naked and say,
listen,
look,

2603
02:25:37.451 --> 02:25:41.110
it totally makes sense.
You know,
you,
I should want,
I don't want to see you.

2604
02:25:41.111 --> 02:25:44.050
I don't want to look.
Imagine if you take the clothes off as Nazi swastikas,

2605
02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:48.370
you shit.
And like there's a tattooed dick goes here with straight up their ass.

2606
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.060
You can imagine you find that all kinds of nutty shit about these people that

2607
02:25:52.061 --> 02:25:52.894
are in Congress,

2608
02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:56.230
but the idea that I'm being completely naked is a great idea because they would,

2609
02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.760
they would feel vulnerable.
They would,
they would be less likely to,
uh,

2610
02:25:59.970 --> 02:26:04.750
to feel strong and empowered and willing to do crazy shit and on behalf of their

2611
02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:08.050
special interest groups that have got him into office.
Yeah.
You know,

2612
02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:11.020
and I'm more likely to face the wrath of America.
Yeah.

2613
02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:14.580
Looking at your saggy tents,
some crazy bills,
man.

2614
02:26:14.581 --> 02:26:17.040
Ted solemnly and all of this crazy,
you know,

2615
02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:20.800
there's so much that comes from these frustrations that people have,
you know,

2616
02:26:20.801 --> 02:26:24.730
maybe they have a fucking,
you know,
they're not confident sexually and they get,

2617
02:26:24.930 --> 02:26:27.880
you know,
kind of rejected by women and they get all worked up.
Well,

2618
02:26:27.890 --> 02:26:30.310
what do they do?
They seek power ruthlessly,
you know,

2619
02:26:30.311 --> 02:26:33.810
and find this kind of position where they can wheel,
you know,

2620
02:26:33.850 --> 02:26:37.900
wield this power over people and demand their affections and we have no evidence

2621
02:26:37.930 --> 02:26:42.190
of their enlightenment,
you know?
Yup.
So I mean that was,

2622
02:26:42.191 --> 02:26:46.300
that was a bit humorous but there was some truth to it and,
and certainly how,

2623
02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:49.660
you know,
people are just not fucking transparent.
You know,
it's,

2624
02:26:49.661 --> 02:26:52.330
it's worth being led and all of these people,
you know,

2625
02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:56.740
to use my first analogy of what the bogus said they are being run purely as the

2626
02:26:56.741 --> 02:26:58.570
mind boy part of themselves,

2627
02:26:58.571 --> 02:27:03.571
that juvenile brain centric part that's just fucking crank and shit out with no

2628
02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:07.500
kind of real connection to the eternal into,

2629
02:27:07.501 --> 02:27:10.540
to all of us as you know,
robust human beings.

2630
02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:14.170
And the idea that somehow just because things are written down,

2631
02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:19.660
written down on paper and that they'd been lived this way for x amount of years,

2632
02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:24.720
that that makes all this nonsense and this ridiculous pageantry that goes on in

2633
02:27:24.911 --> 02:27:28.660
our government,
that that makes it normal and it makes it real.
Makes it okay.

2634
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.580
It's become a game.
And what apps are,
I'm in the middle of coffin

2635
02:27:34.210 --> 02:27:38.470
and it for sure game people find ways to circumvent the game is exactly what it

2636
02:27:38.471 --> 02:27:41.950
is.
Yeah.
And then they ended up just playing a game.

2637
02:27:41.951 --> 02:27:45.640
They've lost touch with what it was really meant to be a democracy to help lead

2638
02:27:45.641 --> 02:27:47.110
people to an optimal life.

2639
02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:51.520
They are gentlemen will yield the floor and a gentleman will yield the floor.

2640
02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:53.411
The fuck are you?

2641
02:27:53.411 --> 02:27:57.190
What kind of ridiculous rules are you calling out and filibusters and things.

2642
02:27:57.191 --> 02:27:59.900
I mean people read that nonsense.

2643
02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:02.350
This is what we're preaching here on the Joe Rogan experience.

2644
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:06.070
Which preaching and Internet based government ceiling.
What to do it.

2645
02:28:06.071 --> 02:28:09.550
No more representative kind of no representative government?
No,
no,

2646
02:28:09.551 --> 02:28:10.770
no congressmen or senators.

2647
02:28:10.930 --> 02:28:15.670
No people that act solely on the will of the people that vote online.

2648
02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:20.080
You know the,
the really the,
the only way that I could see it happening is,

2649
02:28:20.170 --> 02:28:22.220
is we need more states

2650
02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:22.701
<v 0>rights.</v>

2651
02:28:22.701 --> 02:28:26.990
Like someone needs to go whack down the federal government's kind of authority.

2652
02:28:27.010 --> 02:28:30.600
The federal government should be responsible only with national security and

2653
02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:32.720
they should have way more fucking check points on it than that.

2654
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:36.110
Maybe some national federal crimes that they're pursuing.
Shit like that.

2655
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.940
Basically keep us safe,
keep these big major things from happening to everybody.

2656
02:28:40.941 --> 02:28:42.980
But other than that,
the states should decide shit.

2657
02:28:42.981 --> 02:28:45.440
And you know what would happen?
The states that made cool laws,

2658
02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:46.490
laws that make sense,

2659
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:51.050
what fucking get overrun with people and they'd be thriving and their GDP per

2660
02:28:51.051 --> 02:28:55.790
state would be kicking ass.
And then other states was stuck in stupid idiots,

2661
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:57.470
you know,
stuck in their old ways.

2662
02:28:57.471 --> 02:29:01.580
Running was shit laws and putting people in jail for doing things that are

2663
02:29:01.581 --> 02:29:03.650
completely have their own prerogative.
You know,

2664
02:29:03.651 --> 02:29:06.620
those states would slowly start to depopulate.
You know,
people would be like,

2665
02:29:06.621 --> 02:29:09.200
fuck this state.
I'm not going Outta here.
I'm going over to this state,

2666
02:29:09.201 --> 02:29:13.250
the state suite.
And that would be at least some level of correction,

2667
02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:17.690
some motivation to find a balance that,
you know,
shows actually what people want.

2668
02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:19.550
A state could elect a cool leader.

2669
02:29:19.551 --> 02:29:22.250
I don't think it's possible for the federal government to elect the Cooley.

2670
02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:24.280
I thought Obama was cool.
I thought he was one of them.

2671
02:29:24.310 --> 02:29:26.950
I thought he was going to be fucking great,
but he didn't turn out,
you know,

2672
02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:30.230
nearly as I'd hoped in that regard.
And I think because of that,

2673
02:29:30.231 --> 02:29:34.220
I really feel like that system is fucking rigged.
But a state governor,
you know,

2674
02:29:34.221 --> 02:29:35.900
you could get a cool one in state government,

2675
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:38.110
they should come together and make it.

2676
02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:40.130
If they really had autonomy to make those laws,

2677
02:29:40.131 --> 02:29:42.680
that can make a fucking huge difference.
Yeah,
I agree.

2678
02:29:42.681 --> 02:29:45.920
But the real problem is the federal government always wants to take power over

2679
02:29:45.921 --> 02:29:48.530
the state government and things,
especially like marijuana.

2680
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:50.630
That's where the big issue is that the state wise,

2681
02:29:50.631 --> 02:29:52.490
it's legal in California for medical marijuana,

2682
02:29:52.491 --> 02:29:55.330
but federally it's always illegal.
So when these people get arrested,

2683
02:29:55.331 --> 02:29:59.480
they go to federal trial and they're not even allowed to use the phrase medical

2684
02:29:59.481 --> 02:30:02.240
marijuana because it doesn't exist on a federal level.

2685
02:30:02.241 --> 02:30:05.960
There is no such term as medical marijuana,
even though there's,
you know,

2686
02:30:06.350 --> 02:30:08.030
thousands of doctors that a spouse,

2687
02:30:08.031 --> 02:30:11.090
the use of marijuana for a variety of ailments,
it doesn't matter.

2688
02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:14.990
And the federal trial,
this fucking cunt bag,
corrupt government,

2689
02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:16.670
you're not even allowed to say it.
Now,

2690
02:30:16.671 --> 02:30:21.350
how could that possibly be a government that's looking out for the interest of

2691
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:21.950
the people?

2692
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:26.330
You would prevent someone from using terminology that would accurately explain

2693
02:30:26.331 --> 02:30:29.750
their position on the subject just to make it easier for you to win.

2694
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:33.230
And all they could do is say,
are you selling drugs?
You sold drugs.
Thank you.

2695
02:30:33.231 --> 02:30:36.560
He sold drugs,
which would be four years in jail.
Whatever the fuck it is.

2696
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:38.330
And that's what these people have to go through.

2697
02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.280
That's the kind of bullshit these people have to go through.

2698
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:42.380
That is not a government,

2699
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:46.430
that is a bunch of cunts that are running people into the ground and holding

2700
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:51.290
them down with their boots and anybody that has ever done that or or petition

2701
02:30:51.291 --> 02:30:54.740
for that to be in position should be removed from society.

2702
02:30:54.741 --> 02:30:58.460
They should throw them in a fucking volcano.
You're an asshole period.

2703
02:30:58.461 --> 02:31:01.880
You want to lock people up because they're selling medical marijuana and then

2704
02:31:01.881 --> 02:31:06.110
when you would been trial,
they can't even say medical marijuana.
Really wheelie.

2705
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:07.460
What kind of piece of shit are you?

2706
02:31:07.461 --> 02:31:12.380
What kind of weird black socks wearing scotch drinking cunt bag or you,

2707
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:17.590
you old cryptic fuckhead with your idea that the universe and and logic and law,

2708
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:20.070
that makes sense.
You.
Well,
you're not a good

2709
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.830
<v 1>representative.
You're not a good person.
That should be in power.</v>

2710
02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:25.020
You're a cunt bag period.

2711
02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:28.530
That's the only type of people that would ever be in that situation or cons.

2712
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:32.690
It would be,
you know,
it's impossible to count even hope for this,
but if you,

2713
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:36.330
I can only imagine taking some of these people and then let's say you assembled

2714
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:38.970
the best shamans from the different traditions and was like,

2715
02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:42.870
you got to run the fucking gauntlet now and what?
I've got to show the same show,

2716
02:31:42.890 --> 02:31:47.340
same idea,
Douche bags on mushrooms.
It's my show.
I'm trying to pitch it to Fox.

2717
02:31:47.341 --> 02:31:49.620
I have a meeting there this Thursday about another show.
Nice.

2718
02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:53.550
It seems like a fun show,
but I mean I got a better idea guys.
What do you say?

2719
02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:54.690
You guys want to get crazy.

2720
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:57.900
They were the people that came up with who wants to marry a millionaire,
right?

2721
02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:00.990
That we think this is the next level.
Shit.
Douche bags.

2722
02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:03.020
You could do it legally and uh,
you know,

2723
02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:07.180
Peru could be Iowasca Costa Rica would be a bogus,
you know,
take these weeks ago.

2724
02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:10.070
Give me anything that can be anything.
Yeah.
And need to have solid.

2725
02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:13.020
Take the challenge,
you know,
have these people who are so fixed in their beliefs,

2726
02:32:13.021 --> 02:32:16.130
take the chance and see what happens when you go 24 hours with truth looks.

2727
02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:18.590
That's too deep,
bro.
How about to smoke a joint?

2728
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:22.740
How about just give them a little bit of DMT.
That's only 15 minutes about that.

2729
02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:25.930
Let's get baby steps before you leap them into some crazy of boating.

2730
02:32:25.970 --> 02:32:28.620
Camping experience.
So did your,

2731
02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:33.030
your chicken not enjoy as much as you enjoyed it?
She had a very hard experience,

2732
02:32:33.031 --> 02:32:36.440
was way more challenging.
She was struggling with a lot of,
you know,

2733
02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:40.970
deeper issues.
Who's very visual.
She had like a,
a physical representation of a,

2734
02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:45.600
of a part of herself that was almost like a,
like a demon that she had to slay.

2735
02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.790
You know,
you ever see that Bruce Lee Movie Dragon?

2736
02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:49.770
You know where he has that demon that's kind of,

2737
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:51.660
it was kind of hovering over them,
hovering over him,

2738
02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:52.980
and eventually he has to fight it.

2739
02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:56.100
Like she lived that through vision and eventually a Bruce Lee movie.

2740
02:32:56.390 --> 02:33:00.600
I know he wasn't in it.
It was about Bruce Lee was with,
um,
oh yeah,
some dude,

2741
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:05.550
I don't know.
They'll do different to a jogger.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So anyways,
so she had,

2742
02:33:05.551 --> 02:33:06.840
she like lived that experience,

2743
02:33:06.841 --> 02:33:10.490
saw this like part of herself that was just this kind of,
you know,

2744
02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:12.750
demonic kind of feed part of herself.

2745
02:33:12.751 --> 02:33:16.950
And this is just kind of visually visualizations that allow you to manifest,

2746
02:33:16.951 --> 02:33:21.660
change the,
she had to take that and like fight it,
bring it out into the lawn,

2747
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:25.300
kill it and bury it,
and then take a sword and like put it.

2748
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:29.280
So it was like this intense fucking,
well,
she woke up on the counselor was dead.

2749
02:33:29.730 --> 02:33:32.850
She's gonna fucking kitchen knife.
She thought the counselor was a dragon.

2750
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:37.080
You know,
you're sowing.
Capacitive is insane.

2751
02:33:37.090 --> 02:33:38.400
When you're fighting someone with a sword.

2752
02:33:38.401 --> 02:33:39.540
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

2753
02:33:39.570 --> 02:33:44.310
What was she doing dealing during this [inaudible] it feels like at a certain

2754
02:33:44.311 --> 02:33:46.740
point,
the only thing I could say,
you know when you're not,

2755
02:33:46.741 --> 02:33:49.980
you're nauseous and you're fucked up and it feels like there's like a 500 pound

2756
02:33:49.981 --> 02:33:53.090
pancake on your body,
you almost feel completely immobilized.

2757
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.940
Like you can't get up.
Wow.
You know,

2758
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:58.230
you really can't do anything at this point when you're in the kind of the heat

2759
02:33:58.231 --> 02:34:01.650
of it.
It's just the buzz around your body and you're just pancake.

2760
02:34:01.850 --> 02:34:04.860
I backtracked to do,
I think I distracted you and you never finish.

2761
02:34:04.861 --> 02:34:09.270
What happened when you were trying to get a boner?
I abandoned that.

2762
02:34:09.271 --> 02:34:10.830
I abandoned that quickly.
I mean,

2763
02:34:10.831 --> 02:34:13.940
it was like kind of going through your mind or you tried?
I was blown out,

2764
02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:17.240
so I really tried.
That's where I really encountered here.

2765
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.740
<v 0>What's,
what I was going to the bathroom.
No,
I mean it was,
it was Kinda,</v>

2766
02:34:20.741 --> 02:34:23.920
it was kinda silly.
I mean,
I just,
at that point,
you know,

2767
02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:26.680
your body is under such duress.
Like the penis is like,

2768
02:34:26.681 --> 02:34:29.680
I have no fucking business to do here.
You know,
let's,

2769
02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:33.310
let's take this blood and mobilize it somewhere else.
Yeah.
Isn't it amazing?

2770
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:36.910
The body is like,
I've always said this,
it's weird.

2771
02:34:36.911 --> 02:34:41.230
Did the penis is like so volatile,
like the erection,

2772
02:34:41.350 --> 02:34:43.330
the erection is so elusive.
I mean,
when you,

2773
02:34:43.331 --> 02:34:46.060
when you're in the right mood and everything's cool and you went to a woman and

2774
02:34:46.061 --> 02:34:49.450
you make an APP,
boom,
you get an erection,
but you can't get an erection.

2775
02:34:49.451 --> 02:34:53.390
Why plane is crashing.
You know,
people are like,
Ooh,
do the bleeding was crazy.

2776
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:58.420
I read pairs right next.
Please stop fucking,
no,
you wouldn't,

2777
02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:01.690
man.
No Way.
You're going to get a boner when the plane is crashing.

2778
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:03.460
If you get a boner where the plane is crashing,

2779
02:35:03.461 --> 02:35:06.490
you might be the biggest freak on earth fucks.
Fuck Rick James.

2780
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.410
He wasn't a super freak.
You're a super freak.

2781
02:35:08.411 --> 02:35:11.650
You got a bone or while the fuck while you're riding the plane going down and

2782
02:35:11.651 --> 02:35:15.730
you're shooting giant bucket loads everywhere.
I mean,
no,
the,
the,

2783
02:35:15.731 --> 02:35:19.900
the is not like a Rhino Horn that's on duty 24 seven.

2784
02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:22.210
The boner is a very elusive sort of a,

2785
02:35:22.211 --> 02:35:24.940
a chemical reaction that has to take place.

2786
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.800
There's a lot of things have to be in line.

2787
02:35:26.830 --> 02:35:30.400
Is a lot of switches to have to be going off before a boner happens.
Yeah.

2788
02:35:30.401 --> 02:35:34.570
This is the Boga is not one of those switches.
It is the anti switch.

2789
02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.880
That's what a fucking terrible idea.

2790
02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:40.300
You don't think nature knows when you should be breathing when you dick doesn't

2791
02:35:40.301 --> 02:35:42.670
work anymore.
It's because you're on your way to dying stupid.
Right.
Okay.

2792
02:35:42.671 --> 02:35:44.230
There's a lot of shit going down.
You know,

2793
02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:48.510
don't fix that by just shooting out whatever loads you're,

2794
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:52.240
you're dusty machinery can create you loads of cracking.

2795
02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:56.350
I'd fucking week old bagels can clue [inaudible] when you're shooting these

2796
02:35:56.351 --> 02:36:00.220
dusty loads because you've gotten some sort of an erection because some guy came

2797
02:36:00.221 --> 02:36:03.550
with some crazy chemicals.
It gives you a boner when the wind blows,

2798
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:07.600
like whatever.
Riddick I mean our PR,
our priorities are so funny.

2799
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:10.420
I mean I know that they didn't plan on coming out with Viagra for,

2800
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:13.810
for penis enlargement cause it's just something else.
Right.
Or for penis.

2801
02:36:13.811 --> 02:36:15.830
A hardening.
I'm sure.
I mean I think it was your,

2802
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:17.910
to have their eye on that forever.
That's the fine.

2803
02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:22.110
They knew that was a huge market.
Something else happened and I'm,

2804
02:36:22.111 --> 02:36:24.750
I might be wrong cause I know there's a bunch of drugs that happens like,

2805
02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.920
like broke.
Sure.
Yeah.
Cause Rogaine was rationally.
Yeah.

2806
02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:33.060
Or Proskauer was like a prostate enlargement drug and they found it.

2807
02:36:33.251 --> 02:36:35.890
It makes people grow hair back.
And that's where they came out with Propecia.

2808
02:36:36.130 --> 02:36:38.170
It's like a bunch of different drugs that do things like that.

2809
02:36:38.171 --> 02:36:42.760
I thought that was the case with that,
but I'm not sure.
Could be.
Yeah,

2810
02:36:42.761 --> 02:36:46.270
it's a funny,
it's a funny situation.
But the,
that whole,

2811
02:36:46.271 --> 02:36:47.770
I mean the physical body on it,

2812
02:36:47.771 --> 02:36:50.080
Bogut takes a fucking beating and that's just kind of what,

2813
02:36:50.081 --> 02:36:53.800
imagine just in a no water and no food for 24 hours.
So fucking terrible.

2814
02:36:53.801 --> 02:36:56.260
So we make it through.
It was a pretty crazy night.
I mean,

2815
02:36:56.530 --> 02:36:57.820
I didn't unbenounced to me,

2816
02:36:57.821 --> 02:37:02.410
I was getting bitten by ants as this was going on too,
which was even worse.
