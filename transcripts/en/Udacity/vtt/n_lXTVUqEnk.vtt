00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. So we've looked at all 5 sources of error.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Some we've determined were negligible, some had quite an effect,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and you've really learned a lot in this unit.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You've learned not only how to do basic trigonometry, which itself is a powerful tool,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you know how to go outside on a sunny day, ideally near the solstice,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and calculate the circumference of the Earth.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's such an amazing tool.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It may not be a skill you use every day, but certainly impressive.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For doing that, I say congratulations.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, I recommend you get started on the homework

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because one of the homework questions has you do this exact same experiment at home.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're going to enter your data online,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and together as a class we'll amass a gigantic data set.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the next unit, we'll be able to analyze that data set

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and calculate as a class the circumference of the Earth.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In the next unit, we're going to be on location in Pisa,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
where we're going to look at the Galileo motion experiments

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and learn a little bit about how objects move. Stay tuned.
