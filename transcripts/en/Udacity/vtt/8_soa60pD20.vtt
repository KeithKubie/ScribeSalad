00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.750
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Eric Durand. I'm a

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.920
computational biologist here at 23andMe. I've been with

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.770
the company for about two years now and

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.420
I'm mostly working on their ancestry products which

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.600
run from a variety of different problems. Before

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.010
that I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.110
for another two years, and even before that I was a PhD student in France. And

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.630
yeah, that's who I am.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.140
&gt;&gt; Great, well, at this point in the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770
lesson, we've been learning a lot about how to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
connect the dots in our genome to figure out

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.070
ancestry. And we've learned a little bit about identity

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.260
by state, where we can sort of match

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.610
snvs to four comparisons. And we've just learned a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.000
little bit about identity by descent. or IBD. And,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.840
what we really want to know from a, a computational

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.580
biologist is, how do you determine IBD or identity by descent?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first maybe we should define exactly what IBD, or identity

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.730
by descent is. So IBD is something that refers to a chunk of continuous

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.490
DNA. And we say that two individuals share a chunk of DNA identical

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.850
by descent if this chunk has been

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.150
inherited through a common ancestor without recombination.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.350
It means that you inherited these segments from

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.390
the common ancestor however far back it was in

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.710
the past and it was never broken by a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.953
recombination event. During meiosis. So if you want the

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:35.307
simplest example of, of identity by descent maybe

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:38.661
is between the parent and his child, where because

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:40.767
of the way, if I refer you back to

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.355
a high school biology, because of the way chromosomes

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:49.113
are inherited, a child will inherit one chromosome exactly from each of

00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:53.580
his parents. And so, a child is 50% identical by descent with

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.840
his parent. And in this, in this case, a common ancestor is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.830
a parent, himself. And the child is 50% IBD with, with the parent.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.010
&gt;&gt; And so, it doesn't matter how big the segment is. The segment

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.100
could be the whole length of the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.900
chromosome, itself, or anything shorter than that?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.710
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.040
if you only look one generation back in time,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.780
the, the segment will cover a full chromosome in

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.076
the child. The full chromosome in the child would

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.474
be identical by descent with this parent. If you go

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.400
one more generation with, with a, a child is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.500
about 25% IBD with each of his four grandparents. But

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.095
there already, the 25% is only approximate. And it

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:34.796
can vary, you can be more IBD, you can share

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:37.205
more IBD with one grandparent than with

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.410
another. Just because of the way recombination occurs.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.790
&gt;&gt; I see. So there may be an average, re-, an average IBD. But it doesn't have

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.600
to be exact. Because, like you said, the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
recombination doesn't happen in the same place every time.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.422
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And also because of our ability to detect it, there is some error,

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:06.264
some statistical error around the estimation of IBD,

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:11.852
which in the end, will lead to slightly differences

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:12.487
[SOUND]

00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:18.456
time and the more variation between this person changes

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:19.091
[SOUND]

00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.869
segments become

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:21.504
[SOUND]

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:23.409
relate IBD and IBS

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.044
[SOUND]

00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:30.146
serves the reccomendation process. It would be great if

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:31.235
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:36.801
tells us where this is where recommendation occurs but

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:37.406
[SOUND]

00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:42.972
even worse, we don't even know the genealogy at least

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.061
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:52.289
things that are closely related, their second cousin, most people just ignore

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:53.688
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.533
We don't know how

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:57.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.901
[SOUND].

00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:05.663
Which is IDS, identity by states.

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:11.658
You can definitely detect segments between individuals that are

00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:12.639
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.511
so this is

00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.056
[SOUND]

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:16.834
IDB algorithm works. We start by

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.036
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:25.635
long segments of IBS, and that gives us some kind of candidate pool of IDB

00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:29.520
segments, and then we apply vice filters.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.780
From these sets to extract the IBD segments

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.550
&gt;&gt; hmm

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.780
&gt;&gt; And those filters are varied. They depend

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.580
on the length of the segments meaning that it's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.820
pretty unlikely to have a very long IBS

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.060
segment that was not generated by a common ancestor.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.370
We have we also have an applied filter for the frequency of the segment that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.410
was. Inherited. If the segment is very,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.780
very frequent in the population, maybe it's not

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.490
IBD, it's just IBS and that arose to, to being fixed in the population because

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.040
maybe of natural selection or other reasons. So

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.190
frequency, quality of the segment. If it contains

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.680
many mutations, then it's unlikely to be IBD. We have a lot of filters.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like you really have to think a lot around how

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.130
to make sure that it's a true identity by descent, and not, like you

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.640
say, either coincidental or something else. So

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.500
let me make sure I even understand

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.410
this. The smaller the segment that, the

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.000
smaller the segment that appears to be commonly

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.720
shared the more likely it could be that it's just, you know,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.840
a match of identity by say, by chance with someone random in the population.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.750
&gt;&gt; That's correct. So maybe I should clarify the definition of IBD

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.035
a little bit, because under the definition I gave, actually everyone is

00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:58.190
IBD everywhere. Just because we all have a common ancestor if we

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.440
go back far enough back in time. So when we talk about IBD,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.260
we usually restrict ourself to the recent past. Say, I don't know, a few tens of

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.030
generations, maybe 1,000 years. And what, what's beyond this point we,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.830
we're, we just don't have the power to decide anymore if it's IBD or

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.260
not. But if you go, if you look small enough everyone is IBD everywhere.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.760
&gt;&gt;

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.810
how difficult are these algorithms to write

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.110
actually you know essentially predict or infer IBD?

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:39.590
&gt;&gt; So they're pretty sophisticated now, and difficulty comes mostly

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.250
from the fact that these algorithms need to be fast.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.420
So the main computational challenge with IBD is that the

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.700
problem is fundamentally quadratic, meaning that we want to compare

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.200
all pairs of individuals within our data set. It's fine

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.770
probably if you're in an academic setting and you study,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.592
you have your one-off analysis and you have one or

00:06:59.592 --> 00:07:03.970
2,000 individuals and you just want to computer IBD once.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.310
You're okay with letting your computers run for months and

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.874
then you have your result and you'll have it. But

00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:12.655
in a setting like the one we have here at

00:07:12.655 --> 00:07:15.850
23andMe, first we have others of my age and more

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.880
of individuals. We have more than 300,000 individuals now

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.260
in the database. And we need to recompute IBD

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.310
every time we have new customer who come in.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.440
So every day, we have new customers coming in,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.560
and we need to compute IBD permanently on the

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.200
fly with them. So we really need to think

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.370
a lot of how to make this algorithm faster.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.380
So that is as far as difficulties, that's purely computational.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.540
And the second difficulty is more, I would

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.650
say, algorithmic, where we need to find ways

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.880
without compromising the speed of the algorithm to

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.690
make it as accurate as possible. And the

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.850
good thing for the second point is that

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.030
we have pretty sophisticated way now of testing

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.048
the algorithm. So, of course and algorithm is

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:06.050
going to make mistakes, that's guaranteed. But we can

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.576
assess the rate at which it makes mistakes. Pretty,

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:13.194
pretty well now through either simulations in which we simulate

00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:16.008
the pedigree, and so we know we know exactly which

00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:18.822
segments are IBD because that's the way we run the

00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:22.507
simulations, or through pedigrees that our customers report to

00:08:22.507 --> 00:08:25.670
us. So customers can tell us who their parents are

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.180
in the database, who their first cousins are in the

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.750
database. And so we can compare the prediction of our

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.230
algorithm to the known truth, and that gives us

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.350
a good sense of how accurate the algorithms are.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.020
&gt;&gt; That's amazing, and it does sound sophisticated. what about Mis, user

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.560
mistakes that if someone thinks they know who their father is and.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.150
&gt;&gt; That.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.470
&gt;&gt; It turns out not to be true.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.700
&gt;&gt; Yes. That definitely happens. we trust the law of large

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.760
number I guess. And so because we have lots of people reporting

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.030
their, their pedigrees and we guess that you know, not everything is wrong,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.600
and we can still extract a lot of, it's still a very powerful dataset.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.980
We have other ways of checking whether someone is really the kin of

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.210
someone without doing IBDs. There is some more obvious stuff that you can do.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.500
&gt;&gt; So this isn't just a static feature that you work

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.900
on. I mean, its constantly changing, you're always having to work on

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.420
it or update it?

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.980
&gt;&gt; We do, we're updating it now, but we definitely try to minimize the number

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.030
of times we need to update the features. Not because it's not fun to develop new

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.390
algorithm, but because of the cost of recomputing.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.960
Every time we change the algorithm, we don't

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.880
have just to do this incremental update for

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.280
new customers, but we have to recompute everything.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.830
&gt;&gt; All 300,000.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.470
&gt;&gt; All three, and it's still,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.900
even with fast algorithm, we're still talking about

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.060
months. And months and months after that sometime.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.630
&gt;&gt; Where do you get your computing power? I

00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.720
mean, as a non-computer science or coding or statistical or

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.786
math person. How much, I mean can you relate

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:05.070
to me how much computing power we're talking about here?

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.230
&gt;&gt; So, in production they have their own

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.530
cluster that computes for new customers, and I'm

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.824
not too sure how big it is. In research we also have our, our own cluster,

00:10:17.824 --> 00:10:23.040
it's about 120 CPU's, so

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.070
it's not huge it is definitely challenging to run very,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.240
very large scale experiments on this cluster.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.760
And my guess is that soon we'll have

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.020
to go to the cloud to where we're

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.530
actually talking to Google compute engineers to be

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:43.875
able to compute IBD on their machines. Just because it will scale much better.

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.050
&gt;&gt; What happens if you get, I don't know, three

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.290
million people? Will you break the, the system, will it,

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.940
do you foresee it getting a point where so many

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.978
people participate that the computational power isn't, isn't high enough?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.760
&gt;&gt; It's definitely hard to keep up with the growth

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.660
of the database, but it's doable. And the fact

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.840
that we build our algorithms to be incremental means that

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.030
it's pretty easy for us to separate. The customers

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.070
into smaller batches and run, and run on each batch.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.263
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:16.263 --> 00:11:19.940
&gt;&gt; And, and get the job done but, yeah.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.860
&gt;&gt; Well you know, speaking sort of more on the computational side of things

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.010
I want you to talk to us for

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.790
a minute about what, what computational biology is sort of

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.950
all about, I mean, you have a particular a

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.450
job at 23andMe, which you seem to really like.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.466
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:41.740
&gt;&gt; but to, let's say budding geneticists, young, young,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.290
middle or old people you know, interested in genetics

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.140
and looking for maybe a job or career change.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.200
What is it about computational biology that's appealing or useful?

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.342
&gt;&gt; Well, so, a computational biologist, I

00:11:56.342 --> 00:11:59.048
think is always someone who is trying to

00:11:59.048 --> 00:12:03.066
develop or at least who implements computational methods

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:06.600
to analyze biological data. So in, in my

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.410
field, in genetics, even in my field, there is a wide variety of different data.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.380
And a wide variety of different applications. So,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.980
a computational biologist could be someone developing pipeline

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.360
to analyze whole genome sequences, for example. Just from the raw data to the

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.890
alignment to culling the SNVs from the raw data and

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:35.410
just process the data so it's ready for statisticians, for example, to try to.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:35.513
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:35.513 --> 00:12:40.450
&gt;&gt; Further process it. Could be someone like me, who's, for me a

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.130
very bad, very big part of my job is machine learning. So it

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.492
could be someone who's really interested in

00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:48.470
machine learning and trying to extract sense from

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:54.080
the data indirectly. it comes from the, from

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.260
the realization I think that the amount of

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.760
genetic data is huge and growing really fast.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.090
And even maybe more problematic is the complexity

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.250
of the data, like any single phenotype is

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.490
going to be influenced by, not any single

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.210
but many many phenotypes, is going to be influenced by a lot of different

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.736
genes. It's very, very hard to find exactly the structure in the data. So

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:19.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.790
is, is one way to, to tackle the problem. I,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.502
and I think it's a way that's proved successful already.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.160
So, yeah.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.440
&gt;&gt; And it sounds, you know? Based on what you're saying that, you know?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.140
The information age is just growing bigger

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.150
and bigger, especially in the world of genetics.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.390
&gt;&gt; hm.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.740
&gt;&gt; So the need for understanding and the need for people

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.160
who can actually use this information and this data is really important.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.550
&gt;&gt; how many, hm, how often do you

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.990
find the biologists, the trained geneticists or biologists understand

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.060
enough coding or computer science to move forward

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.080
versus how often is it that it's the math

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.100
and computer science people who are learning the

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.316
biology to help out, which direction is it normally?

00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:07.850
&gt;&gt; So, here at 23andMe, I think it's safe

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.180
to say that all the computational biologists came from

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.510
the computer side of things. They have training either

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.850
in computer science, or in math, or in statistics.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.814
And they learn biology later as

00:14:21.814 --> 00:14:28.810
fascinating application field for data scientist basically.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.895
&gt;&gt; And so as you know, biology in genetics

00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:34.410
grows, you will think there will be a an opportunity

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.740
for many more computational individuals who are interested to

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.630
sort of learn genetics and biology and, and apply that?

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely. I think,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.280
I honestly think that biology is a

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.880
science of the 21st century, nothing less. And

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.830
it will change everything for most people.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.530
It will revolutionize medicine. Being preventive or, or

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.903
personalized. It will yeah it will basically

00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:04.104
change the daily life of, of everyone I

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:09.762
guess. And we need more people, and I think many, many more jobs are going

00:15:09.762 --> 00:15:14.490
to be created around, around you know computational biology.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.380
&gt;&gt; can you talk to us maybe a bit about

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.640
just in general the type of coding you've done while you

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.780
worked for 23andMe, even beyond 23andMe? you mentioned that you've worked on

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.950
the ancestry. And specifically IBD, are there other aspects that

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:35.810
you've worked on as well?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.454
&gt;&gt; So I developed another feature of 23andMe called

00:15:40.454 --> 00:15:45.530
Ancestry Composition which goal is to find the origin of

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:51.260
segments. Not as precise of finding who you share it with, but

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.910
where does it come from, so it could come from some part Europe, it could come

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.960
from some part of East Asia, or some part of Africa. So here it's, we apply

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:05.778
very, very different methods. The type of coding there was very

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:11.830
much the machine learning type of coding. So it's a lot of numerical

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:17.710
analysis where you're trying to predict classes for your data.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:26.480
So it's a lot of, you, you end up developing a lot of optimization problems.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.555
A lot of dynamic programming is involved in

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:32.630
these kind of, of problems. For example, when

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.783
you code a hidden markov model to

00:16:35.783 --> 00:16:40.490
relate adjacent adjacent chunks of DNA, then there

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.520
is some very well-known dynamic program that you

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.239
need to implement to make this thing fast.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.602
And to be able to optimize it to fit your data as well as possible.

00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:56.560
&gt;&gt; hm. How do you think the future of biology and genetics looks with regards

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.820
to computer science and computational biology? Do you think there's going to be

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:07.990
a big need for geneticists in general and people who study biology to learn

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.349
these skills as they go along, or do you think they're just going to need

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.329
to partner up with other people who know them?

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:13.829
&gt;&gt;

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.530
I think you could defend both point, point

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.950
of view obviously. I think there is still

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.859
a lot of value for being a specialist

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.510
in your field. Obviously, you cannot be good

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.740
at everything and, I think good biologists and good geneticists can

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:35.240
give people with a strong computational background, you know, hints

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.560
at what they should be looking at, and advice on what

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.230
is important in field, what is the problems

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.728
we need to solve first is definitely very

00:17:45.728 --> 00:17:48.080
vaulable. So I think there is room for,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.970
there is still room for pure biologists, definately.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.766
&gt;&gt; Well, tell us a bit more about in your background,

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:56.060
I mean how did you get interested, I mean, well first,

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.720
I should ask, how did you get here, what did you

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.320
study in school and how did you get interested in it?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.408
&gt;&gt; so my undergrad was in applied math and computer science,

00:18:05.408 --> 00:18:11.520
and then I went on to do a PhD in statistics. And because the way, that was

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.650
in France, and because the way it works in

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.850
France, I had to choose a field of application

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.680
for statistics. And that's, only then that I began

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.890
to think about genetics. Because my PI was very

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.720
interested in population genetics which is this field in

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.636
genetics where we try to learn about human evolution,

00:18:30.636 --> 00:18:35.170
so natural selection, demography, ancestry, identity

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.620
by descent so then I became interested

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.360
as well, and I developed statistical learning

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.290
method to learn about the genetic structures

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:50.175
of populations. After my PhD, I decided to do a postdoc here at UC

00:18:50.175 --> 00:18:55.690
Berkeley because I had a very good opportunity with someone very famous in

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.400
the field of population genetics. And there I was lucky

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.450
enough to work on the first draft of the neanderthal genome.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.170
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.400
&gt;&gt; So I actually had the first fully enacted genome sitting on my

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.300
hard drive, and I could just do my stuff with it, anything I wanted.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.430
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.995
&gt;&gt; And I contributed to develop methods that,

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:21.010
that estimated the amount of neanderthal DNA that modern

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:26.110
humans have today so that was a pretty fascinating project.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.455
&gt;&gt; So, no big deal, right? No big deal.

00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:28.662
[LAUGH]

00:19:28.662 --> 00:19:32.410
&gt;&gt; It was. I think it was a pretty big deal because it changed the view

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.110
of people in the fields like before, before

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.450
2010 most people would, including me probably would have

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.130
said no, neanderthal is a strictly distinct species.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.420
It never contributed any DNA to modern humans. Just

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.820
was extinct for some reason. And didn't give

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.800
any trace. And now we know that's probably not

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.450
true and that left few percent.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.060
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty exciting project to work on.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then, I always knew about 23andMe, I've known about them

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:11.650
since it started almost in 2008. And so, when I

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.130
was there, I was local, and so I knew it was

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.900
a good opportunity to apply. And so there was this job opening,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.640
they were advertising for a computational biologist position.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.540
At first, I didn't know exactly what it implied.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.110
And so I sent my CV, was interviewed

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.410
and got the job. since then, it's been amazing.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.890
&gt;&gt; And here you are.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.980
&gt;&gt; so it sounds like you had a major interest in You know, basic

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.980
math, a love for math and computation, you know which sort of blossomed

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.480
into you know an applied, or an

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.550
application in biology. If there was somebody watching

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.880
this interview right now, and they're really intrigued

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.640
about how biology, and computer science and math,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.060
statistics work together in an a particular job.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.000
What advice would you give them to, to

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.040
study in school? What would you recommend that

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.350
they do? Or maybe where would you recommend

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.810
that they seek, you know career advice or, or, or work?

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:20.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah so as I said, I do believe there is needs for specialists.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.030
So I do recommend they keep studying math and computer science and statistics

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:31.030
a lot. But they still need to take some biology. At the very least

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.250
to figure what are the problems that we need to solve today in biology.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.040
And how to relate. You know, it's not enough

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.770
to get out of school, and know list of

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.500
the ten fastest algorithm for each specific problem that

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.280
you learned in school. You also need to be able

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.470
to relate those great class of algorithms to different

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.280
problems in biology. How you will need to adapt them.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.150
How sometimes you have to realize there is nothing

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.670
that exists already and you need to develop something that's

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.340
not going to be optimal, probably, but you need to do the first part

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.370
of the problem. So you do need to know enough biology, at the very

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.872
least, to understand the problems. Otherwise, for

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:13.018
example, for ancestry, if you don't have

00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:15.396
a very clear understanding of the recombination

00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:17.328
process, there is nothing you can do.

00:22:17.328 --> 00:22:18.328
&gt;&gt;

00:22:17.328 --> 00:22:17.914
[LAUGH]

00:22:17.914 --> 00:22:22.470
. You need, you need to understand exactly what probabilistic model you can put

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.240
behind meiosis. How often it's going to break

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.230
a chromosome, or these things. So you

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.240
do need to know enough biology to

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.690
understand the problems, definitely. So you need

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.770
to take at least an intro to biology class or something at the very least.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.350
&gt;&gt; So for someone who is interested you know,

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.410
kindle that passion for computer science and math but

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.280
you know, also pay attention on biology class

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.740
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Yeah, and yeah, and just, I guess just

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.320
do it. I think it's, I think it's the most exciting

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.250
field for data scientist to be in now. It's just

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.320
growing amazingly fast, and it's already changed a lot of things.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.710
&gt;&gt; I want to ask you two more questions. We'll edit these

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.460
back a little bit, because I want that to be sort of

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.084
how we close. I want to know, what's probably, what's

00:23:13.084 --> 00:23:16.380
one of the best moments of being you and

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.140
having your job. Like, what's one of the, the

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.200
most positive parts or most exciting moments you've had?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.210
&gt;&gt; so I'm lucky at 23andMe, because I have both a foot in research and a foot

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.650
in product. And I think the most satisfying moment is when you pool your

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.520
research to make a product out of it, and

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.930
when you see customers start to use it. And then

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.400
you know, if you're interested in science, and you publish

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.650
a very good paper, you're super lucky, you get a

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.250
thousand citations, its already, you can have a lifetime achievement.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.200
But here, if you put, if you make a product

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.180
out of your research it's going to be seen by

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.730
hundreds of thousand of people instantly, and they're going to react

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.050
about it, they're going to talk about it, they're going to give

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.810
you new ideas about it, they're going to find bugs you never

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.670
thought you had in the first place. Because 300,000 pairs of eyes,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:14.010
you know, it's much more than yours. So that's definitely very satisfying.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.530
&gt;&gt; And what would you say is probably one of

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.980
the most difficult or challenging aspects of what you do?

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.600
&gt;&gt; that's a good question.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.960
I guess, testing is probably the hardest.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.700
Yeah, everyone believes they are write good code,

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.652
everyone believes their code is fast. But

00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:40.130
not everyone tests enough, especially when you're in

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.868
a production setting where you're going to

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:45.236
put a lot of stress on your algorithm,

00:24:45.236 --> 00:24:50.290
so the most difficult part I think is to make sure everything works as intended.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.798
There is no, it's going to stay fast,

00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:55.610
you're going to, you need to have very good

00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:00.474
understanding of you know, the algorithm complexities, the algorithmic

00:25:00.474 --> 00:25:03.438
complexities of what you code just to make sure

00:25:03.438 --> 00:25:05.946
you're not going to receive an email on

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.986
Sunday saying oh you broke the website or we're

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:14.869
losing a lot of money, fix it. So, yeah, you need to test a lot, I would say.

00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:15.338
&gt;&gt; Great,

00:25:15.338 --> 00:25:17.357
well thank you Eric for joining us.

00:25:17.357 --> 00:25:17.757
&gt;&gt; Thanks Matt.
