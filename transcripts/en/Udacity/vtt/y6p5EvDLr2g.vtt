00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.120
So, this is the solution set for our compound inequality. If you got it right,

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:08.485
nice work. If we stack the number lines on top of each other, like this, we can

00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:12.880
see that there's a region of intersection. These are the numbers that are shared

00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:17.215
between the inequalities. They make both of the inequalities true. And this is

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:21.585
why we learned about intersections, and really helps us figure out what numbers

00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:25.853
make both inequalities true. We can see this region of intersection on one

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:29.965
number line. This is the solution set. We can also write it in interval

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:34.781
notation. So, notice that an and compound inequality makes an intersection, or a

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:39.419
region between points. And any of these numbers would work in both inequalities.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.015
Let's check that out real quick. Let's check 6. We're going to let x equal 6 and

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:47.830
check the solution. So, plugging in 6, I get 7 less than or equal to 9 and

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:51.615
plugging in 6 over here, I get negative 8 is less than or equal to negative 7.

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:55.580
Both of these statements are true. So, that means 6 is a solution to this

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:59.815
compound inequality. Notice that for equations and inequalities, we've always

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.925
been able to check our answer. This is what so great, we can know that we're

00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:08.150
right. Checking your answer can build your confidence in knowing that you're

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:12.455
right. Or it means, hey, maybe I should go back and check my work.
