00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:07.529
There is no more ridiculed literary genre
than the self-help book. Intellectually-minded

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.349
people universally scorn the idea of them.
Self-help books don’t appear on reading

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.890
lists at any prestigious university, they’re
not reviewed by highbrow journals and it’s

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.670
inconceivable that a major literary prize
could ever be awarded to one of their authors.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.840
This concerted attack on the entire genre
of self help is a symptom of a Romantic prejudice

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.190
against the idea of Emotional Education. Offering
explicit Emotional Education is regarded as

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.379
beneath the dignity of any serious writer.
We should - if we are at all intelligent - know

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.840
how to live already.
Unsurprisingly therefore, the quality of all

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.490
self-help books is at present highly degraded.
The most accomplished stylists and sharpest

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.730
thinkers would feel ashamed to put their name
to a work which would be destined to end up

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.590
on the most ludicrous shelves of any book
shop.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.040
Yet not all eras have shared this dismissive
attitude. In the classical culture of ancient

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.120
Greece and Rome, it was taken for granted
that the highest ambition of any author was

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.390
to offer the reader an Emotional Education
that could guide them towards fulfilment (Eudaimonia).

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.700
Self-help books were at the pinnacle of literature.
The most admired thinkers - Plato, Aristotle,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.460
Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius
- all wrote self-help books, whose aim was

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.210
to teach us to live and die well. Furthermore,
they deployed every resource of intelligence,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.860
wit and style in writing their manuals so
as to ensure that their messages would delight

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.130
the intellectual as well as the emotional
faculties. Seneca’s On Anger and Marcus

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.020
Aurelius’s Meditations are among the greatest
works of literature of any nation or era.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.410
They are also, undeniably, self-help books.
It can look as if humans stopped writing good

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.890
self-help after the Fall of Rome. But once
we view Culture as a tool for Emotional Education,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.150
many more works emerge as, in fact, belonging
to the currently much maligned genre of self-help.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.190
For example, Tolstoy’s War and Peace explicitly
aims to teach compassion, calm and forgiveness;

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.360
it offers guidance around money, manners,
relationships and career development; it seeks

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.310
to show us how to be a good friend and how
to be a better parent. It clearly is a self-help

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.480
book - it just doesn’t happen to be officially
described this way by the current guardians

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.460
of Culture. Marcel Proust’s In Search of
Lost Time is, similarly, also a self-help

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.450
book, teaching us how to surrender our attachment
to romantic love and social status in favour

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.730
of a focus on art and thought.
It’s not an insult to describe such masterpieces

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.990
as self-help books. It’s a way of correctly
identifying their ambitions, which are to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:22.150
guide us away from folly towards more sincere
and authentic lives. Such works show us that

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.850
self-help shouldn’t be a low-grade marginal
undertaking: the desire to guide and teach

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.321
wisdom is at the core of all ambitious writing.
In the bookstores of the utopia, the self-help

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.370
shelves would be the most prestigious of them
all and on them would sit many of the most

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.720
distinguished works of world literature - returned,
at last, to their true home.
