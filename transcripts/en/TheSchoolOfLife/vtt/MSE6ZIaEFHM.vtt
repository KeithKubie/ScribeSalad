00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.210
Very many of us suffer from a peculiar-sounding
problem: an inability properly to inhabit

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.070
the stretch of time we call ‘the present’.
Maybe we’re on a beautiful beach on a sunny

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.660
day, the sky is azure and the palm trees slender
and implausibly delicate, but most of ‘us’

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.950
isn’t actually here at all, it’s somewhere
at work or in imaginary discussion with a

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.800
rival or plotting a new enterprise. Or maybe
we’re at the birthday of a child: it’s

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.170
enormously significant for her and we love
her dearly, but we are elsewhere; our body

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.879
is rooted in the now, but our minds are skipping
to points in both the future and in the past.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.519
What is it that makes the present, especially
the nicer moments of the present, so difficult

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.350
to experience properly? And why, conversely,
can so many events feel easier to enjoy, appreciate

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.220
and perceive, when they are firmly over? One
benefit of the past is that it is a dramatically

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.250
foreshortened edited version of the present.
Even the best days of our lives contain a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.640
range of dull and uncomfortable moments. But
in memory, like skilled editors of hours of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.960
raw and often uninspired footage, we lock
on to the most consequential moments; and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.990
therefore construct sequences that feel a
great deal more meaningful and interesting

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.860
than the settings that generated them. Hours
of mediocrity can be reduced to five or six perfect

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.690
images. Nostalgia is the present enhanced
by an editing machine. Much of what ruins

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.050
the present is sheer anxiety. The present
always contains an enormous number of possibilities,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.340
some hugely gruesome, which we are constantly
aware of in the background. Anything could

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.000
theoretically happen, an earthquake, an aneurysm,
a rejection – which gives rise to the non-specific

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.900
anxiety that trails most of us around all
the time; the simple dread at the unknownness

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.530
of what is to come. But then, of course, only
a very limited range of awful things do ever

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.750
come to pass and we forget the anxiety at
once (or rather shift it to the new present).

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.890
So when we remember an event, what we leave
out of it is how much of that event we actually

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.650
spent anticipating an appalling future that
never came. Our bodies further contribute

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.671
to our distraction from the present. They
have their own moods and itineraries. They

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:39.510
might feel tired and timid at just the moment
when the landscape around us would demand

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.790
grandeur and confidence. But these dissonant
moods also get edited out of memory; we’ll

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.870
remember the view over the ocean longer than
the slight queasiness which turned us in on

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.350
ourselves at the time. Our minds are cavernous,
chaotic places. So much courses through them

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.010
that has little to do with what is right in
front of our eyes. We can end up seeming ungrateful

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.290
to where are. Someone is telling us an important
story, and not from any evil, just from the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.849
difficulty of having to manage the entity
called ‘I’, we digest some regret or other

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.910
instead. We are at a beautiful location, but
we can barely take in the vegetation and the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.520
extraordinary views, so fixated are we on
an event that will occur in six months time.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.550
We need to be prepared for the weird way in
which we align with the world and not berate

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.090
ourselves unduly for our difficulties at doing
justice to where our bodies and minds happen

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.300
to be. We should be ready for this disloyalty
in other people too – at moments when they

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.989
look strangely worried at a party we’ve
laid on or don’t seem to be listening to

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.740
a story we are telling them. They too may
just be experiencing some of the major difficulties

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.550
of being in the present. Like us, they’ll
probably enjoy our encounter with us so much

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.879
more when the present has safely given way
to memory.
