00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.060
We all have habits we'd like to break,

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.500
whether it's biting your fingernails,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.960
smoking, or eating late at night.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.320
But why are these habits so hard to break?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.680
Perhaps you think your day is made up of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.500
deliberate, conscious decisions, but

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.640
in reality, a University of Duke study found that 45% of your

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.835
everyday behaviors are actions that you repeat every day

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.200
and tend to do in the same location.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.780
These are your habits.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.960
Habits are attributed to one of the most primitive structures in your brain, the Basal Ganglia, the same

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.820
region that helps control processes such as breathing and swallowing.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.865
In an MIT expiriment, a mouse sits behind a gate

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.885
of a T shaped maze where to the left is a piece of chocolate.

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:42.655
When the door clicks the mouse explores the maze, sniffing

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.475
and scratching at the walls. First it explores to the right

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:48.315
and then to the left, eventually finding the chocolate.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.315
A scan of their basal ganglia shows it's working furiously

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.325
throughout the whole processes. However after a week of training,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.355
the mouse runs immediately towards the chocolate once the gate clicks.

00:00:57.355 --> 00:00:59.535
At this point, there's

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.695
very little brain activity once the gate clicks, and the brain doesn't fire

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.245
back up again until it reaches the chocolate.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.285
Our brain seems to minimize effort and space, and this

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.955
kind of automatic brain behavior is referred to as

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:13.945
"chunking." Chunking aids in creating a new habit

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:16.965
pattern in cells of the brain. It's like a task you do

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.095
everyday that you no longer have to really think about, brushing

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.740
your teeth or backing out of your driveway, skills

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.960
that were once difficult to master, but now become automatic.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.940
This process is a three step loop. Step 1 is the cue

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.820
which for the mouse is the click of the gate;

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.440
Step 2 is routine, run through the maze,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.060
and Step 3 is the reward, in this case, chocolate.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.860
Cue and reward eventually intertwine, creating anticipation and cravings,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.640
another essential part of habits.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.440
Because we go into automatic mode during routines,

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.765
our brains stop fully participating in decision making.

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.095
Our habits will automatically unfold every time there is a cue.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.065
these habits can be so entrenched that the reward doesn't

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:59.200
even have to be good. A study of habitual popcorn eaters

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:02.055
at the movies found that they were minimally impacted by

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.740
hunger or how much they like the food, and they ate

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.360
the cinema popcorn regardless of

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.120
whether it was stale or fresh. Our habits often

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.480
overrule what we know is good for us

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.500
for example,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.980
a study of America, "Take 5" campaign encouraging citizens to take

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.755
 

00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:22.795
 

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:25.665
 

00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:28.375
 

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.315
 

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:34.295
 

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.025
 

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:39.965
 

00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.365
 

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.205
 

00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.565
 

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:50.405
 

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.085
 

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:56.165
 

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:59.115
 

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:02.235
 

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:04.835
 

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:07.945
 

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:10.795
 

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:13.885
 

00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:16.955
 

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:20.075
 

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:23.255
 

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.935
 

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.825
 

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.565
 

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:33.965
 

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:36.395
 

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:37.775
 

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:40.845
 

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.995
 

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:46.995
 

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.335
 

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.385
 

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:55.485
 

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.345
 

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:01.425
 

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:04.775
 

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.725
 

00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:10.685
 

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:13.375
 

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:16.445
 

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.825
 

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.915
 

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:24.695
 

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.585
 

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.175
 

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:32.975
 

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:36.025
 

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.295
 

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:41.025
 

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:43.925
 

00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:46.795
 

00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.365
 

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:52.355
