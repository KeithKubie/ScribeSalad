1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,090
The general Hogan experience. So
you're, you're 100% in on ghosts.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,740
I am now.

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:11,030
Tell me about why you're 100% in on
Sasquatch cause that that one is a,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,560
that's more puzzling to me.
Well, just, uh, that it's,

5
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:19,970
it's a, again, a Gabriel Reese's,
uh, story was quite convincing.

6
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:21,830
Jeff Meldrum his research like in missing,

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,830
I would have talked to
her about [inaudible].

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,390
Belgium told me he cut his finger off.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,230
He said if he could find out if Sasquatch
is really take a pinky off. I said,

10
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,440
if you cut your finger off to know that
Sasquatch is real, would you do it?

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,430
He goes, which finger? I'm like,
your pinky. Well, he's got casts.

12
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:41,450
He's got hair. I'm going
to Jamie, Jeff Meldrum,

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,990
M. E. L. D. R. U. N. D. he used to
be, it's in my room. He was a, he's a,

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,190
you know, he's a paleontological scientist
at the university of South Dakota,

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,180
but he can also be a silly man sometimes
you study things, you memorize them,

16
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:57,530
you pass a test, but you still silly
well lit. But you talked to him.

17
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:00,320
Did you think? Did you
feel he was a w? You know,

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,510
I open up my finger for nobody, man.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,040
I ain't giving up a finger to find out
if Sasquatch is real. That's crazy.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,630
You know, he's pretty
devoted to it. But, um,

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,411
it's been, you know,

22
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:17,411
Yeti the yak and Yeti story and all the
Yeti story and just the round the world.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,860
Uh, just the, um, the sightings
that that people have had. Um,

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,810
I read a book, well, it was a book
called a diary in Alaska, housewife.

25
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:30,080
It was about a woman. She
wrote it, she, uh, left, uh,

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,170
in the 70s to move from Kansas to Alaska.

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,730
And her husband worked on the pipeline
and she tells a story one afternoon when

28
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,320
she was at her, you know, uh,

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,970
her window in the kitchen and
she went outside into the garden.

30
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,081
So she felt,

31
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:49,430
saw something went outside and
she smelled this really strong,

32
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,750
strong musky, musky odor.
And she saw this big,

33
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,600
huge shape at the corner of her garden.
Kind of disappear into the woods.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,640
And I dunno, bear grizzly
[inaudible], who knows. Sure. Yeah.

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,700
How about town? Where are you
on trooper Cobre? Not at all.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,230
I think it's nonsense. I think it's a
coyotes with mange. Yeah, I'm convinced.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,860
Yeah. Okay. I mean, they've,
they've captured coyotes with mains.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,820
It look like demons. How about moth?
Man, that's a neat story. Listen,

39
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,440
let's go back to big foot. Let's not,

40
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,720
you don't believe that these
kids think they're full of shit.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,770
Let's go back to the moth man. Prophecies.
The, the bridge collapsing holes.

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,630
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm not,

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm not gonna sit here and
argue on behalf of moth man,

44
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:33,380
but it's an intriguing story because
when you have multiple witnesses,

45
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,520
like as far as the UFO, I will
go back to a good foot. But the,

46
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:41,440
the aerial encounter, the, the school
children at the aerial, a school in,

47
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,930
in Zimbabwe, in the, uh, in
the 90s. You know the story,

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,243
John Mack was working on it.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,400
No two beings landed in two different
craft and they encountered these

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,380
schoolchildren all in elementary school
and now they've come back and they're

51
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,090
interviewing them now in their adult time.

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,340
And it's amazing how
their stories synchronize.

53
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:00,640
Why would all of them inspire
to make something up? Okay.

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,040
We deal with two different
things and the moth mountain,

55
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,440
there were four really
credible kids there that

56
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,683
man,

57
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,070
the UFO thing is less preposterous
than anything because we are currently

58
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,870
sending spaceships into orbit.

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,400
We are currently sending probes
to Mars. We are, we're involved,

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,010
deeply involved in the
exploration of our solar system,

61
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,070
at least with these robots and drones
and things that we can control that that

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,220
all, all that makes 100% sense to me.

63
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,660
Big foot is interesting to me because
there was a creature called gigantic

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,400
[inaudible]. It was an
enormous primate that was a,

65
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,330
without a doubt lived
it. It's a real thing.

66
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,250
It was a bipedal hominid.

67
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,280
They think it was between eight
and perhaps even 10 feet tall.

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,290
It was a huge apelike creature and it
went extinct and the reason why they found

69
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,390
it is because there
was an apothecary shop,

70
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:03,040
I believe it was in the
1920s an anthropologist found
a tooth in its apothecary

71
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,800
shop in China. He talked to the
people. Where'd you find this?

72
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,420
He recognized it as a primate tooth.

73
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,480
They brought him to the site where they
found it and then they started finding

74
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,081
other pieces.

75
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:15,190
They found bones that re that seemed to
indicate that this thing was by Peatal.

76
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,670
And this is something that's accepted
in the paleontological paleontological

77
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,430
record.

78
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,230
This is like when anthropologists
look at the history of primates,

79
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,270
when they look at the, they think
this is a widely accepted real animal.

80
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,140
So

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,790
why? Why wouldn't it was real? Why? What's
the, why did it, why do you say that?

82
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,620
It couldn't have survived and uh,
and, and beyond extinction and, and,

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,370
and exist today in some
form. We don't know.

84
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,020
There's no evidence that's compelling.
Just like there's no illness fake.

85
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,470
They think they pretty much the film
is fake. The Patterson footage. Yeah.

86
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,210
That's for shit. I say it's
fake. Here's the thing.

87
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:59,050
If it looks like a man in a suit, no
animal looks like a man in a suit.

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,630
There's not a fucking single
current kangaroo out there.

89
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,520
Does that kinda person kangaroo suit?
I just, I just think Gabriel story,

90
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,480
Belle drums research, the book
that I read of the woman's

91
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,720
Gabrielle Risa story,

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,790
she was in the camping up there in one
of those Northern States, Washington,

93
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,310
and I believe she has video footage
of him shaking, shaking, shaking,

94
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,580
the shaking, the shaking, the
motor home that they were in. Yeah.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,620
She was quite excited to tell me the
story and, and uh, quite vivid about it.

96
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,470
She said that it was, it
was scary. It was scary.

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,660
If there was a small popular look,
try finding a Wolverine, you know,

98
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,370
try finding RA RA or a super one of
these super sloths and the South American

99
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:45,270
jungle. Now these big slots, well,

100
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,050
there's one,

101
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,190
there's one scientist that has literally
risked his reputation and he's,

102
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,430
his whole fucking credibility is in demise
because he decided that he was going

103
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,010
to spend his life
looking for giant sloths.

104
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,540
And these indigenous people have pointed
them in the right direction and they've

105
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,230
recognized that there's, you know,
there's dung that seems to be sloppy,

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,620
dung that they've found and they're
trying to point him towards where these

107
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,950
things are. And the giant
sloths was a real creature,

108
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,390
but there's no real evidence that the
giant swath is currently alive. But the,

109
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,400
the thing is the vast wilderness of the
Amazon rain forest is so impenetrable.

110
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,000
It will be like trying to walk across the
earth and make a good audit of all the

111
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,270
creatures that are on it. You're not
going to run into them. And you know,

112
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:36,140
we many species are dying on this planet
right now for dirt, various reasons,

113
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,140
but there are many that are
being discovered, we never
even knew about before.

114
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:39,891
And you know,

115
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:44,240
the Northwestern forests
are pretty impeditive triple
to the Washington for us.

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,750
Interesting.

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,370
You said the location of the area where
if the thing crossed the Bering land

118
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:54,080
bridge and it came into the United
States, that's exactly where it would be.

119
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,710
It would be in that Pacific
Northwest because that's, you know,

120
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,160
as you walked down from Alaska and we've
heard the stories of loggers going in

121
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,150
there and seeing them more,

122
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:05,330
sensing them or because they're being
driven out of their environment,

123
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,700
hostile accident logging companies that
they think have been perpetrated by, uh,

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
by, you know, those, uh, by the Sasquatch.

125
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,150
Nobody wants to believe in Bigfoot more
than me. I work, I worked up in, uh,

126
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,760
in the Northwest territories.
I was a flex track, uh,

127
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:23,930
assistant mechanic on crawlers and I
was a road surveyor when I was a kid.

128
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,770
I worked for the department of public
works and we were up there and along the

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,400
[inaudible] river I had less river where
explorers would go in and they'd find

130
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,540
their heads and then never come back.
That can of big foot heads. No, no,

131
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,180
no good though. Human heads,
human hair, the headless Valley,

132
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,240
the headless river, no
honey river in a H and I,

133
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,180
but when I went up there and
was with the survey people,

134
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,610
there had been guys who've been
up there, you know, uh, you know,

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,020
years before me. And they,

136
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:51,620
and they said that Sasquatch was a common
thing that was spoken about among the

137
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,420
natives and among the
survey crews up there.

138
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,190
Do you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait
movie Willow Creek? No. Outstanding movie.

139
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,240
Cat Goldthwait made a horror movie
about Bigfoot Bobcat Goldthwait.

140
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:07,220
The comedian made excellent
horror movies that, Oh my God,

141
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:11,300
that's like fire in the sky. Thought
good depiction. You would love it. Oh,

142
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,140
I will love it.

143
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:15,200
It's about a bunch of people that go up
there to try to replicate the Patterson

144
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,210
Bigfoot film sort of as a Lark. Oh,

145
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,630
they go up there for fun
and they encounter a real
Sasquatch. So Willow Creek,

146
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,780
it's called. Yes, it's really
good. I love that. I love that.

147
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,930
That spread is a 100% believer.

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,910
He believes he and I've had some
ridiculous conversations about it.

149
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,580
It'd be nice to go and and go into the
intense woods up there and maybe camp for

150
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,150
a weekend look, man DOE,
to see something like that,

151
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,720
a bipedal hominid that is
avoided detection for hundreds,

152
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,520
if not thousands of
years. It'd be amazing.

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,050
But they spoke from native Americans as
native Americans had more than a hundred

154
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,420
different names between
all the various tribes.

155
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:54,680
100 different names for Sasquatch.
I really, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh,

156
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,040
ma was one of them.

157
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,230
You know that you saw that American
werewolf in London thing that is, uh, the,

158
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,530
the guy who created that
Pat, uh, Rob Baker? No, no,

159
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,380
that's Rick Baker. Baker.
I'm sorry. Yeah. Pat McGee,

160
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,320
who's the special effects
guy, created the one for me,

161
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,320
but Rick Baker designed it
originally, but he made a,

162
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,080
Pat McGee made a movie called OMOP, what
was it called? Omar primal scream CV.

163
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,890
But it's basically a horror movie
about Sasquatch and you know,

164
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,810
it's, it's incredibly compelling
to people. This is enormous.

165
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,470
Primates,

166
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,220
it's been avoiding detection living in
the forest among the indigenous people

167
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,770
say that they, they sometimes
grab children and take them.

168
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,370
I think that's because it used to be
a real thing. That's what I think.

169
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,430
I think that's because if,

170
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,460
if we all agree in scientists agree that
this gigantic Pythius was a real thing,

171
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,740
if that is the case,

172
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,540
then it's entirely possible that
one point at one point in time,

173
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,870
human beings were in direct contact
with them on a regular basis,

174
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:57,630
and those stories been passed down
through generation after generation.

175
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,580
The real question is, are they still here?

176
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,850
Because the people that are telling you
these stories, like when we talk about,

177
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,650
uh, people in North America,

178
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,990
it's widely accepted that
most native Americans,

179
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,970
they share a lot of genetics with people
from Siberia because Siberia is what's

180
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:18,840
close to the Bering land bridge. They
come down, these people eventually, many,

181
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:22,920
many, many, many, many thousands of years
migrated into America and they have,

182
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,160
so those are people that would
have been in contact 100,000,

183
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,270
whatever years ago if they don't know.

184
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,420
They know that these teeth that they
found from judge [inaudible] indicate that

185
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,390
at the, at least a hundred thousand
years ago, they were alive.

186
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,240
Does that mean they were
alive 50,000 years ago?

187
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,780
Very possibly fit like
a homo floresiensis.

188
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,810
You know that the Hobbit person that
you found this tiny little thing on the

189
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,720
Flores Island,

190
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,920
that thing they didn't even know that
was real until the two thousands and that

191
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,840
thing existed as recently as, I
think it was 13 or 14,000 years ago,

192
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,430
which is incredibly recent.

193
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,630
And this is a completely new discovery
that people found that there was a

194
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,570
totally different species of human
being that was very small, Lou,

195
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,130
the Chimp size brain, but it was human.

196
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,550
It used tools and it lived amongst humans.

197
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,560
So this thing, if they know it
lived a hundred thousand years ago,

198
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,990
it could have easily live
50, it might have lived 20,

199
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,910
so it lived 20,000 years ago. Today.
We just know way they're going fine.

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,060
Yeah. But there's, there's no
evidence of mammoths either, right?

201
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,210
We know they were real, but there's no,
like if someone said I saw a mammoth,

202
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,390
you'd be like, where do you
have a picture? No, no, no.

203
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,450
But I sensed it the fuck out of here
with your sensing mammas I think if you

204
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,540
did, if you put an Mt. Mt.

205
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,810
At a horrible avatar style military. Uh,

206
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,070
uh, let's say incursion into
some of the deep woods of

207
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,880
Northwest America. You might, you
might get traces, but coming down,

208
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,950
what a horrible thing that would beat it
to do. Excellent thing. We get footage.

209
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,260
I know, but then you're destroying.

210
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,410
That's a Pat McGee's
version of a great, yeah,

211
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,520
it's like kind of look grouped and yeah.
Wow. That's just a weird picture. No,

212
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:17,230
that's beautiful. It's
called primal rage. A neat,

213
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,610
neat look at the um, the
animatronics. Yeah. You see the,

214
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,330
that face right there, Jim? Yeah. When's
that coming out or is it that out?

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,420
Okay. Now for quite a while, primal
rage and, and from Willow Creek,

216
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,430
the Creek is really interesting cause
Willow Creek is like Blair witch style.

217
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,420
It's all like found footage. Like the
whole thing, like the, okay, here we are,

218
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,340
we're in the woods. You
know, like that kind of shit.

219
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,960
It's really Bobcat's a genius
is, he did a great job with it.

220
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,070
He's really good. It's like
compelling. It's exciting.

221
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,100
And even if I don't believe
in Bigfoot or don't,

222
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,510
don't believe it's currently alive,

223
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,620
just I know too many people that
are in the woods all the time.

224
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,260
I know too many people that are
hunters that are in the woods,

225
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,230
that haven't seen weeks and weeks in the
woods. And none of them I've seen shit.

226
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,140
They see bears walking on two
feet though. That's really normal.

227
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,510
And when you're in thick, dense forests,

228
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,380
bears walking on two feet and you
see him in the dusk. Oh my God,

229
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,380
I saw big foot. I'm convinced.
And then you really are convinced.

230
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,110
So then you go back and tell
everybody. Yeah, I think, you know,

231
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:22,030
basically just each individual as to
make their own minds up about all of this

232
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:26,620
stuff. And if you want to believe
it's just like your religion,

233
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,930
you know, I believe in mediumship.

234
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,370
I believe in the afterlife I have of
our consciousness and that's kind of my

235
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,420
religion. And who's to say, why should
I be disputed on that? You know,

236
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,460
I'm glad you believe. I'm
glad there's people I don't,

237
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:43,060
I'm glad there's intelligent people that
believe in silly shit. Well, you know,

238
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:43,990
look, uh, you know,

239
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,810
many people live in the Virgin Mary
cause Kathlyn and that's quite a myth and

240
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,340
many believe in the angel Moroni and the
golden plates and the magic spectacles

241
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,930
and, and many believe in Zeno, you
know, the Scientologists believe.

242
00:13:55,931 --> 00:14:00,370
So I'm not going to go and say,
Hey, Oh, I dispute your belief.

243
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:04,000
There were no golden spectacles or there
were no gold and no, there was no Zeno,

244
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,590
no, there was no Virgin Mary. No.

245
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,700
I respect people's belief and they
realize that's what you believe and that's

246
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:14,320
what helps you, you know? And I, I would
never dispute that. And likewise, I,

247
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,330
I want to be respected for my belief
in spiritualism and mediumship.

248
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,320
And so there's a religion and skepticism
as well. I think there's this,

249
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,590
there's a, and I respect that
Gulf war. Yeah. But there's,

250
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,191
you know what I'm saying?

251
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,480
That there's a tendency to just
try to dismiss everything as being,

252
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,920
as believe the official
story of every single thing.

253
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:36,790
I know why that's good.

254
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:40,330
Because that empirical view will
be able to sort out the fake stuff,

255
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,740
the Hoke stuff from the real stuff.

256
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,370
If people have real scientific
minds and real, you know,

257
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,460
inquests they're going into
it. That's what's gonna.

258
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,220
That's what's gonna sort out
what's real and what isn't.

259
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,150
[inaudible].
