00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.160
In other words we can use the binary code,
the computer language,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.710
to code for any sort of information.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.680
And it's also useful for transmission of information.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.120
If we send a sound wave or any sort of wave
by a train of digits

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.940
it uses a very much wider bandwidth.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.720
As you can see the information that has to
go there to transmit those digits

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.660
has to be very, very much faster than the
wave itself.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.860
Much faster even then had we coded it in frequency
modulation form.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.580
But it carries a number of advantages.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.360
For one thing, if you send the ordinary wave,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.640
then anything that gets added to it in the
form of interference,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.960
cannot be separated from the wave at the far
end.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.300
And if you transmit it far enough by radio
or via cable, by any means,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.940
it gets worse the further it gets.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.880
With a binary train however, provided you
can recognise

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.840
whether it is meant to be a nought or a one.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.480
Then as long as you can make that recognition

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.220
it doesn't matter how much they've degraded.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.300
So every so often you can have a repeater
that does the recognition,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.300
makes brand new smart pulses and sends it
on completely unaffected.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.920
There is no degradation with distance.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.960
So what can you do then if you have a processor
of this sort?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.520
It can handle information, provided it knows
the code, of a very wide variety.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580
You can have access to data banks.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.720
You can call them up and pull the information
maybe down the telephone line.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.420
Did you know for instance that it is possible
to call down pictures from satellites

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.200
so that you can see the weather picture

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.740
without waiting for it to come up on the television.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.560
In fact you can do better than that.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.509
There is a satellite called NOAA-9.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.900
N O A A 9.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.559
Which is in polar orbit. It passes over this
country twice each day.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.290
Once going North, one South.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.340
But in fact we can see it on three orbits
each time.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.300
So that's six times altogether.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.060
And for a couple of hundred pounds you can
buy a system consisting of an aerial like

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.560
that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.840
which you stick up on the roof, in the loft.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.180
Connect it to a receiver.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.100
At a more convenient point.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.660
And a decoder.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.279
And that can be connected in turn to a tape
recorder so that when the satellite goes over

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.650
it turns the tape recorder on and gathers
the picture.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.840
Here is a stored picture that was brought
up from...

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.840
There we are. We see the Earth. We can see
Africa there.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.440
Fine weather over Spain, but the rest of Europe
looking a bit cloudy.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.680
We go from Saudi Arabia and Madagascar on
the right

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.380
over to South America on the left.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.500
You can pull that down yourself.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.040
You can also get a closer up picture of Europe.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.919
Which is really amazing.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.409
Look how much fine weather there is over the
whole of the British Isles

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.560
and Northern Europe.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.320
That must have been chosen on a very, very
clear day.
