LAURENCE MORONEY:
So anybody who's

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.083
been to any developer event
in the last couple of years,

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:08.220
usually Android or Android
Studios in the keynote,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.790
Stephanie, you're the
person that we get to see.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.430
You get to make all
the cool announcements.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.606
And this year at I/O was a
particularly special one.

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:14.730
Could you tell us about it?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.771
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: It
was an incredible year.

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.830
Android had a whole ton
of developer announcements

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.550
that we were super
excited about.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.150
And I think probably
everybody knows

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.830
Kotlin was at the
top of our list

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.610
and at the top of a
lot of people's lists.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.350
You did a great job
keeping that a secret.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.504
It was such a big surprise
and a great reveal.

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:34.378
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
That was really tough.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:36.450
It was something the
community had been asking us

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.490
for again and again.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.540
And in fact, one of the funniest
moments behind the scenes

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
was about three weeks,
I think, before I/O, we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.600
had O Labs, which is
one of the events where

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740
we bring a ton of apps--

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.240
we bring a ton of apps in just
to help them get ready for O.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.090
So there are probably like
250 apps there, maybe 300,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.580
or representatives from
the various top apps.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.610
And somebody in the
audience asked Mike Claron,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.099
who's the director of
the framework, Mike,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.390
what do you think about Kotlin?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.223
And when are you guys
going to adopt Kotlin?

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:10.440
And of course, we had
made the decision.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.450
And we were just
spooling up for I/O.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.950
Mike had actually
helped me co-write

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.010
the keynote speech, which
we were rehearsing by then.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.210
And Mike, you could see his
face just kind of light up.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.210
And he turns to the person,
and he says, you know,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.010
there's a lot going
on with Kotlin.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.740
And I'm sure you're
seeing a lot.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.360
We're seeing everything
you're seeing.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.985
And we just want
you to know that.

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:34.610
And I thought as soon
as he said that--

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.990
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's a great answer.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.800
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: I know.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.300
I thought he'd actually
blown the whole surprise.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.966
So I immediately went
and checked reddit

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.852
the next afternoon
because I thought,

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:43.060
someone's going to be able
to read between the lines.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.170
But nobody did, and
it was a surprise.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's good.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.442
And social media lit up
after it was announced.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.275
It was overwhelming.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:50.990
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yeah.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.948
Well, I think it was just
what everyone wanted.

00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:54.497
And it was the right decision.

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:56.330
And everyone knew it
was the right decision.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.840
So I think it was really
a credit to the community

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.090
that they were so clear with
us about like, look, this

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.860
is the right thing to adopt.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.490
In fact, the way we've talked
about it is entirely accurate.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.600
I think Kotlin's this incredible
fit for the Android platform

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.400
because it's so
rare that you get

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.924
a language that's so mature.

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:15.340
And it's a
five-year-old language.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.131
It's highly mature.

00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.740
It's gone through a 1.0 stage.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.700
And yet you can adopt it into
apps completely integrated.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.590
So you can have an app that
has Java code and Kotlin

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.120
code completely integrated.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.070
So at the point of
announce, most languages

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.278
are still in a developmental
stage or an early stage.

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:35.500
And Kotlin is really in a very
mature state on a platform that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.610
is very widely scaled.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.710
So it was super unusual.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.350
And to have that
plus the IDE support

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.266
because the same people
designing the language

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.040
built the IDE was just amazing.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.470
And so I think we were
really excited about it.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: It was just
perfect serendipity as well,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.000
right?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.410
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
It was the right time,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.940
the right stuff, and all that.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.830
Now you work on Android
Studio primarily.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.220
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: I do.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: You talk
a lot about Android Studio.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.760
So how are things going
with Android Studio?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.530
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: They're
going really well, yes.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.540
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
just released version 3?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.665
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yes.

00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:01.657
Version 3 is
currently in Canary.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:03.490
The next I'd trust after
that would be beta.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.435
And version 3 is the
one that supports

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.940
the current release of Android.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.730
Now for a developer like
me, an Android developer,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.789
I started cutting my
Android teeth with Eclipse.

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:13.580
It was interesting.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.920
It had its moments.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.630
But it was still great
to have that power

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.830
to be able to develop and
deploy onto something.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.440
So Android Studio was
the next logical step.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.170
And I came from a world with
Visual Studio beforehand,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.921
so Android Studio felt
much more familiar.

00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:26.753
And it was exciting.

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:28.940
But it's come a long way
in the couple years, right?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.190
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: It has.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.725
And I think that really reflects
the investment in the IDE.

00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:34.600
One of the things that
happened for us was we

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.724
realized several years ago that
Android had scaled massively.

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:39.640
And as Android scaled,
the developer community

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.310
was also scaling massively.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.779
People think about a
US-based community,

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:45.820
people who are in the US.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.195
But really if you
think about it,

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.970
the European
community is enormous.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.924
The Chinese developer
community on Android is huge.

00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:54.340
The Indian community
is exploding.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.470
Brazil, there's so
many different places.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.440
And I think what had happened is
we really outstripped the IDE.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.150
And we needed to
invest very deeply

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.401
to give developers
what they needed.

00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.650
And developers were very
articulate about the features

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.941
they needed, which was awesome.

00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.770
And so what you're
seeing really is

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.270
a reflection of increasing
investment in Android Studio.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.570
And that investment is
continuing to increase.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.457
And so there are a
number of features

00:04:15.457 --> 00:04:17.290
that have come out in
the past several years

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.149
that I think are
super exciting, and I

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.579
think you should expect
to see that continue.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.120
So yeah, it's been
a really fun time.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I have a
couple of favorite features.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.430
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Tell me.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I absolutely love

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.140
the new assistants, particularly
the Firebase assistant.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.260
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
That is so cool.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.759
The original design
for that feature

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.040
was one where you
came in, and there

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.350
was just all this stuff you
had to connect here, and do

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.980
this, and do that.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.550
And we looked at it.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.290
And we thought, even
we can't figure out

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.990
how to get through that.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.823
Why don't we make it a
step-by-step process?

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:43.155
And I think the result
is so useful because it's

00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:44.280
relatively straightforward.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.410
In fact, we're using that
same assistant concept now

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.671
with other types of guided
journeys through the IDE.

00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:51.920
And I think that's going to
be a really good baseline.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.820
I can't wait to see
some of the others.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.440
I've been writing
a book on Firebase.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.000
And it used to be-- you made
me rewrite all my chapters,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.070
by the way.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.940
It used to be that.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.300
It was like, go to the console.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.020
Turn this on.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.584
Turn that on.

00:05:02.584 --> 00:05:04.000
Get the Google
services JSON file.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.570
Download it.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.430
Find the right
folder in your app.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.107
Put it in.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:08.440
Now it's the Firebase assistant.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.259
Click a button.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.800
Even the dependencies are added
to the build up [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.470
It's beautiful.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.928
I'm looking forward
to seeing more.

00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:15.760
And then my other
favorite is the Emulator.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.320
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yes.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.665
The Emulator is amazing.

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: It used to
be that the scenarios you'd

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.978
get in the Emulator
were kind of limited.

00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:22.480
You needed a real
device to do it.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.896
But now there's
just so much stuff

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:25.044
happening in the Emulator.

00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:26.710
You've even added the
Google Play Store,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.168
so things like
Google Play Services

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:30.640
will update automagically as
I'm building my apps for it.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.390
So thank you.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.010
Great work.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.040
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
I'm so glad you like it.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.680
Yeah, I feel like the
Emulator itself particularly

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.070
has come so far in
terms of performance

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.820
because it's so snappy
and responsive now.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.970
It's actually much faster for
me to deploy under the Emulator

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.553
than a device.

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:44.364
And I typically do
development on both.

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.030
But also the feature
set is really nice,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.821
like being able to turn
network on and off.

00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.140
And mocking maps is one of my
favorite and things like that.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.900
So I think there's
still a lot more

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.150
we could do with the Emulator.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.170
I personally think
it'd be great to have

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.610
it boot incredibly fast.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.610
I think it would be wonderful
to see the Emulator have

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.580
more features.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.790
Especially things like
different types of network

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.248
connectivity are things that
developers in emerging markets

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:09.210
talk about, even developers
in the US and Europe

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.370
targeting those markets.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.994
So there's so much
more that we can do.

00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:13.600
But I think it
really is one where

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.980
it's now a mainline
part of the workflow.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.690
We don't release adoption
stats, but it's just

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.290
going through the roof.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.920
People are using it.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.450
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Stephanie's smiling now,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.324
but I gave her a hard
time about the Emulator

00:06:21.324 --> 00:06:23.945
and Google Play Services for
a long time, but not anymore.

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:24.510
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yes.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.820
That is true.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.510
That is true.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.820
That was-- yeah,
that was a good--

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.446
you were right.

00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:30.986
LAURENCE MORONEY: Do you have
any favorite features yourself?

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.440
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: I do.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.580
You mentioned one of them.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.538
The Emulator is definitely
one of my favorites.

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:37.660
I personally really
like ConstraintLayout.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.910
When the initial version of
ConstraintLayout came out,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.451
I was playing with
different layouts.

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.280
And I find it super useful,
especially in the new world

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.590
where you're seeing a lot
of dynamic form factors.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.200
It's really useful to be able
to define things in relation

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.370
to each other as
opposed to having those

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.280
static definitions.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.070
So that's a huge
favorite for me.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.480
There are little things
that are my favorite.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.521
So I have big things like
that, ConstraintLayout,

00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.950
which obviously was
a huge investment.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.070
The build time improvements--
especially if you've tried 3.0

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.010
and you have a huge project,
you will find the build

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.510
and sync improvements
are amazing.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.790
And I, probably like
you and other folks

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.040
who are building big projects,
I have some pretty big,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.510
complex apps.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.210
And the incremental build
times are just so much better.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.342
I feel like that will
probably be something

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:20.800
we'll be working
on for a long time

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.174
because developers
always tell us

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:23.470
we just can't make it too fast.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: It
can never be too fast.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.100
Actually a funny story
with that is that for me,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.920
for a lot of the small test
apps that I've been building,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.520
so many times I thought the app
hasn't deployed to the Emulator

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.285
yet.

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:36.410
And it's like so I have a
previous version running.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.872
And then I compile and get
it to run the next version.

00:07:38.872 --> 00:07:40.330
And then I go away
and do something

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
for a couple of minutes.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.755
And then I come
back, and I think

00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:44.380
it's my old version
that's still there.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.744
But the new one is on there.

00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:46.660
And I'm like, come on.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.070
Hurry up.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.580
And I don't realize
the new one is there.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.020
It's having been used to it
being a little bit slower.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.540
And it's like now that it's
getting faster and faster,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.130
I have to change the way I do
things, which is kind of cool.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.296
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yeah.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:58.176
I think we want it
to just be instant.

00:07:58.176 --> 00:07:59.550
The other one I'd
mentioned too--

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.440
and this is kind of one of
the smaller but cool ones.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.190
I think Lint is really
useful because it's

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.630
like your extra
brain, all of it.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.770
It's like the Rumsfeld quadrant.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.310
Things you don't know you don't
know it tells you to look for.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:08.890
So I find that really useful.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.770
Because you can end up
writing some pretty ugly code

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.789
without realizing it.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:14.330
And other people
have to maintain it.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.380
So the Linting tool
is really neat.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.505
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yes.

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:18.742
I definitely make mistakes
I didn't know I made.

00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:19.450
So they're great.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
I'm a developer getting

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.230
started with Android Studio,
or with Android in general,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.060
or mobile development
in general,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.385
what would you tell me?

00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:28.600
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: I
would tell you two things.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.100
I would tell you
download Android Studio.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.140
And I would recommend
taking a look at Kotlin.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.480
Again, the inside
story of how we adopted

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.960
Kotlin is essentially that one
person after another person

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.190
tried it and convinced the
next person down the line

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.190
that they had to try it,
and they had to try it.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.898
It's one of those
languages that you just

00:08:46.898 --> 00:08:49.730
fall in love with because
the more you use it,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.469
the more delightful
you realize it is.

00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:54.010
So I think I would
probably recommend

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.770
doing those two things.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.210
And with Kotlin, for example,
just a funny story for me

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.300
was that a week before
I/O, I was doing some talks

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.040
at a conference in the UK.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.020
And they were doing a
round of lightning talks.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.460
And I did a talk on Google Maps.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.900
And the idea was they wanted
to get an applause-o-meter.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.450
And the Google Maps
applause-o-meter

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.319
was really good.

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:13.360
And I was like, yay, I'm
going to win this thing.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.860
And then a guy came
on after me and spoke

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.235
about this thing called Kotlin
that I had never heard of.

00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:18.332
And the crowd went wild.

00:09:18.332 --> 00:09:20.290
And I'm like, OK, I have
to learn about Kotlin.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.877
And then the next week, I'm
sitting in the audience at I/O,

00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:24.460
and you go do the
whole thing K thing.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.810
We've got Kotlin
in Android Studio.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.684
So I was like, score.

00:09:26.684 --> 00:09:27.640
I was excited.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.715
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
So awesome.

00:09:27.715 --> 00:09:30.048
I'll never forget because the
same thing happened to me.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:32.127
So I was in London,
and someone told me

00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:33.460
you've got to try this language.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.320
And it was kind of working its
way through the engineering

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.920
team.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.910
And I got on the plane.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.570
I had two books on Kotlin,
and my laptop, and 10 hours.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.797
And I got on the plane, and
I thought, wow, you know,

00:09:43.797 --> 00:09:45.880
I'm not sure we can really
put another programming

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.510
language on Android.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.620
And by the time I landed,
I was thinking to myself,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.140
OK, we have to figure out
how we're going to do this.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.140
This is just so awesome.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.389
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I think
one of the neat things--

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:56.434
and it was something-- we did an
episode with Jeffrey van Gogh.

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:57.850
What he shared
with us is the fact

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.244
that how it interrupts
with existing Java code.

00:10:00.244 --> 00:10:02.410
It's not like if you've got
existing Java libraries,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.701
you have to throw them away
and rewrite them in Kotlin.

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:07.096
It's like you can start
consuming and vice versa.

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:08.470
And then also the
tooling, you've

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.261
got your [INAUDIBLE]
new Kotlin experience.

00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.971
So you don't feel that you
have to start from ground zero

00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:15.220
to be able to build in Kotlin
because you can actually

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.450
reuse your existing stuff.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:16.472
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yeah.

00:10:16.472 --> 00:10:17.888
I think that's the
one thing, too,

00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:22.477
that was also very
eye-opening for me

00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:24.310
when I used the language,
because you think,

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.240
oh, a new language.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.600
I'm going to have to learn all
this new stuff and start over.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.840
And what you really want
to know is, wouldn't it

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.080
be cool if I could be able
to write all of my code

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.510
and write it many times faster--

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.110
but do it in a
way where learning

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.860
the new syntax, learning
the new language,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.760
is going to be
really easy for me

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.299
and where I can just take
little pieces of it at a time?

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:49.090
And in fact, that's
exactly what Kotlin is.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.590
Because I think for
most people, they'd

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.390
say when they learned
Kotlin for anyone who

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.080
knows the Java program language
already, it's really not

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.190
difficult. There's so many
concepts and paradigms that

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.330
are really familiar.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.000
So it's not like you're
moving in some huge direction.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.830
Like you started with Java, and
now you're going to learn C++--

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.996
which I remember when I
learned that, and I thought,

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:09.850
OK, this is hard.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.290
So it's quite seamless.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.880
And that, plus the
fact that you can

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.699
take an app that's already
completely working in Java

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.740
and then just try a little
piece of it in Kotlin,

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.200
means it's so easy to just
dip your toe in and get

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.067
really comfortable.

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:22.900
And the IDE makes it
so seamless because you

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.026
can literally just drop a class
and it'll convert for you.

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.897
The [INAUDIBLE] team is amazing.

00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:28.730
They're really good.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.682
So for somebody to get
started in Android Studio,

00:11:31.682 --> 00:11:33.140
we'll put the link
in the comments.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.000
We'll put the link in the
description of the video here,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.560
so people can go download it.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.100
So thank you so much, Stephanie.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.492
It's been a real blast having
so much fun geeking out

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.700
over Android Studio with you.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.070
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
It's really cool.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
thanks, everybody,

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.260
for watching this episode
of Coffee with a Googler.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.926
If you have any questions for me
or any questions for Stephanie,

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:49.860
just please leave them
in the comments below.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.270
Thanks again.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:50.980
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Thank you.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cheers.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.290
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Thank you so much.
