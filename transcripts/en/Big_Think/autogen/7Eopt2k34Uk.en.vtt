a lot of good things did same thing with

personal genomics we need to figure out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
personal genomics we need to figure out
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420
personal genomics we need to figure out
how you're going to actually make it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
how you're going to actually make it
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920
how you're going to actually make it
useful which means you need to be able

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
useful which means you need to be able
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800
useful which means you need to be able
people need to think about how they're

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
people need to think about how they're
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240
people need to think about how they're
going to share the information with

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
going to share the information with
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.740
going to share the information with
other people are they going to be scared

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
other people are they going to be scared
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630
other people are they going to be scared
of it not not want to know it themselves

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
of it not not want to know it themselves
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429
of it not not want to know it themselves
are they going to be want to know it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
are they going to be want to know it
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109
are they going to be want to know it
themselves but not share it with anybody

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
themselves but not share it with anybody
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.640
themselves but not share it with anybody
and therefore not really know it they

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
and therefore not really know it they
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440
and therefore not really know it they
have this big pile of Jesus season

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
have this big pile of Jesus season
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999
have this big pile of Jesus season
season if they don't share it with

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
season if they don't share it with
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800
season if they don't share it with
anybody they won't learn about it and so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
anybody they won't learn about it and so
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.749
anybody they won't learn about it and so
you need we need to pursue this this

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
you need we need to pursue this this
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.560
you need we need to pursue this this
this this minefield and find ways that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
this this minefield and find ways that
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420
this this minefield and find ways that
people can feel safe about sharing at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
people can feel safe about sharing at
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399
people can feel safe about sharing at
least in a research sense so that's one

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
least in a research sense so that's one
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289
least in a research sense so that's one
thing that was kind of an ethical legal

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
thing that was kind of an ethical legal
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.649
thing that was kind of an ethical legal
social issue that we've been we've been

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
social issue that we've been we've been
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.880
social issue that we've been we've been
working with in the Personal Genome

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
working with in the Personal Genome
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.340
working with in the Personal Genome
Project very proactively and then

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
Project very proactively and then
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.660
Project very proactively and then
synthetic biology our technology and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
synthetic biology our technology and
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.990
synthetic biology our technology and
others create a situation where people

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
others create a situation where people
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.450
others create a situation where people
could synthesize

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460
could synthesize
 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.180
could synthesize
organisms either new or old old things

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
organisms either new or old old things
 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.920
organisms either new or old old things
like smallpox which we thought was

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
like smallpox which we thought was
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.600
like smallpox which we thought was
extinct and not available to anybody

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610
extinct and not available to anybody
 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.060
extinct and not available to anybody
because it's available informations

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070
because it's available informations
 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.130
because it's available informations
available they can recreate it it's not

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
available they can recreate it it's not
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.960
available they can recreate it it's not
sufficient for all the good guys to say

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970
sufficient for all the good guys to say
 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.460
sufficient for all the good guys to say
we will be good guys you need to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
we will be good guys you need to
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.160
we will be good guys you need to
actually have an active surveillance

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
actually have an active surveillance
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530
actually have an active surveillance
mechanism where you're looking to see

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540
mechanism where you're looking to see
 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.780
mechanism where you're looking to see
people they're doing things that we're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
people they're doing things that we're
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.770
people they're doing things that we're
either they don't know what they're

either they don't know what they're
 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.390
either they don't know what they're
doing don't fully appreciate what

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
doing don't fully appreciate what
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.010
doing don't fully appreciate what
they're doing where they're actively

they're doing where they're actively
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.640
they're doing where they're actively
being terrorists type
