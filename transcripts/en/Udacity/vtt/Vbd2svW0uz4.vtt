00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I had to write some code to fix up the goal if it wasn't specified. Then it's just a single call.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We call shortest&lt;u&gt;path&lt;u&gt;search with the start state we were given,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with the csuccessors function that we've already defined,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then with a goal test.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The goal test is that everybody is gone from the start side of the river.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That we define this way.
