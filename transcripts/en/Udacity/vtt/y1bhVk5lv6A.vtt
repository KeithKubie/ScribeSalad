00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.275
When I'm searching for
a new place to live,

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:04.698
I want to make sure it's within
a reasonable distance from my office.

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:08.029
Obviously, I don't want to travel
50 miles every day to work.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.732
Especially in the Big Apple, a few miles
can quickly turn in to a few hours.

00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:14.859
Maybe it's also important to me
that I can get to work via public

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:15.804
transportation.

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:20.133
Within our site, we want to give users
the option to enter their work location,

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.348
daycare, mom's house, or
other important places, and

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:27.497
only show real estate listings within
a certain distance of those places.

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:29.004
How can we do this?

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.743
We'll use a magical service
called the Distance Matrix API.

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:36.960
Google's Distance Matrix Service
computes travel distance and journey

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.666
duration, between multiple origins and
destinations, given a mode of travel.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:46.459
Once again, we'll use an HTTP
request to talk about the input and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.170
output for the Distance Matrix API.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.823
The request has the same format
as the geocoding request.

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:59.821
We'll specify the service and the output
format, which can be either JSON or XML.

00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.669
Then, we'll define the input parameters.

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:08.186
For the distance matrix API, the only
required parameters are the key,

00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:11.723
and at least one origin and
destination pair.

00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:16.717
Here, I'm calculating the distance and
duration of travel between New York,

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:19.413
New York and San Francisco, California.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.274
Let's take a look at the output.

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:25.272
Again, we see the status and
then we see the distance and

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:27.153
duration of the journey.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.276
We can see here that we
only have one element.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:34.169
An element is an origin and
destination pair.

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:39.212
Since we only have one origin and one
destination, we only have one element.

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.591
If we specify, let's say,
two origins and two destinations,

00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:46.591
we'd have four elements
with a distance and

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.257
duration between each origin and
each destination.

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:55.757
Since we didn't specify any travel mode
in this request, it defaults to driving.

00:01:55.757 --> 00:02:00.624
It's telling me that it's
a 4,676 km drive which will

00:02:00.624 --> 00:02:03.166
take me one day and 18 hours.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:07.457
Note that the distance value
defaults to meters and

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:10.961
the duration value defaults to seconds.

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.559
Let's add in some optional parameters.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.543
I'm adding in a mode here.

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:20.753
We can use driving walking,
bicycling, or transit.

00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:22.837
Let's see how long will
take me to bike there.

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:26.161
Also, I probably want to avoid
biking on a freeway, so,

00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:30.069
I will include the avoid parameter and
tell it to avoid highways.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.007
Specifying bicycling should you do
that though, as it favors bike pass or

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:35.161
preferred streets.

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:35.778
All right,

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:39.616
it would take me over 11 days to bike
from New York City to San Francisco.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:42.719
Actually, it would probably take me
several weeks and I might not make it.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.608
We're Googlers and we love biking and
all that, but that's a long way for

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:47.686
me to go to visit RJ.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:50.367
Probably more realistic would be for
me to take transit.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:56.753
For transit, I can even specify transit
mode such as rail, bus, subway etc.

00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:59.551
Let's avoid long bus rides and
specify rail.

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:02.662
Okay so three days, that's not that bad.

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:04.455
I think I'll stick to flying though.
