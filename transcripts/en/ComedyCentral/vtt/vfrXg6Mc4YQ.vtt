00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:00.800
You're getting married.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.402
Why are you getting married?

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.436
So people think I'm straight?

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.871
Yeah!
My girlfriend's half Greek,

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.373
there's a chance our kid maybe
born a block of feta cheese.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.674
A hundred percent.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.410
Absolutely, but definitely
gonna have one eyebrow.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.644
I'm going to your wedding.
You are?

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.046
Yeah I'm gonna go
to your wedding bad.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.480
You cannot wear a baseball
jersey, you gotta buy a suit.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.849
I really, the thing is,
I don't have any suits.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:17.450
No.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.020
What's up? Back at the bar here,
I'm still with my boy here

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:23.489
Yannis Pappas,
aka Freddy Feta Cheese.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:28.761
What do you think is the most
childish thing people as adults?

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:32.165
Everything that adults do now,
is childish? Right? Yeah.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.699
Everybody wants to
have a kid now.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:34.967
Nobody can believe
I have a child.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.269
They're like what? You're 33!

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.770
You just threw
your whole life away.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.072
It's like, if this was
a hundred years ago,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.506
I'd almost be dead right now.
Absolutely!

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.341
I'd have tuberculosis!
My kid would be 28.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:43.609
Remember when we were kids,

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.011
you saw your daddy
was wearing a suit?

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.913
Yup.
He was 15 years old?

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.347
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.950
My dad had fought in four wars
by the time he was 24.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:52.318
I mean look at you, you're 42.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.986
Can you imagine if your dad
saw you like this?

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.222
I imagine if my grandfather
saw me, oh my god!

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.590
Doing skits.
Doing skits!

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:58.958
He'd be like you're getting
paid to do this?

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.226
This is a job?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.627
Yeah.
Yeah, no.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.362
I want you to look into that
camera and apologize to him.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.564
I'm sorry!
You piece of shit!

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.299
I'm sorry!

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.637
Would you rather accidentally
sext your mom or sext your dad?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.773
I'd like to sext my dad cause
it would be funny yeah.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.008
My mom, I already
do sext her so.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.178
I don't think I've sext my mom,
but I, I sent a dick pic.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.446
You know I sent it to a girl,

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.348
and I accidentally
I tagged my mom,

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.083
like I, I attached my mom.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.852
That's right, yeah,
she never responded.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.253
It was a remote?
Was it a remote thing?

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.821
It was when I stuffed a remote
control in my sweat pants.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.056
Yeah I don't show
my actual penis.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.791
Yeah, I mean, I'm half Irish.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.161
All right, next stupid question.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.462
Would you rather be known

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.798
as the crying guy
or the lotion guy?

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.099
I'd rather be known
as the lotion guy.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.334
Why?

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.635
Cause it sounds
like a better time.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:43.870
Yeah, I cry a lot.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.738
I am known as the lotion guy
to myself.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.106
We all got secrets Gus.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.509
When I was a young kid,
I wasn't the brightest kid.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.477
I stuck my dick in a vapor rub
just to see if it burned.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.712
That's what happens.
It does a lot.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.980
True story, not a joke.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.281
Yeah, I'm the crying kid.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:56.549
You are?

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.317
Yeah, I cry, how many times
have I cried to you?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.054
Fifteen, I counted them
because they were so jarring.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.261
Would you rather go on a hot air
balloon blindfolded

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.896
or go to a ballet
with earplugs in?

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.164
Hot air ballon blindfolded.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.498
You rather do that?

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.467
Yeah, because I'll get
the butterflies in my stomach.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.735
Yeah.
So it's a little bit of a high.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.570
If I go to a ballet,

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:18.971
I'll close my eyes
and fall asleep.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.439
I like to go on
the hot air balloon,

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.674
ride with you
and blindfold you

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.042
and then push you
right overboard.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.510
That's a good way to go.

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:25.978
I like to watch you fall, and
explode into feather crumble.

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.180
Is that what you like?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.581
Yup, that's what I want
to do to you.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.082
Well, I'd like to walk you up
to a hill in Poughkeepsie,

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.384
Yeah

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.618
Make you dig your own hole,
yeah,

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:33.920
And shoot you into it.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.655
Yeah! Yeah.

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.157
All right so,
did you have a good time?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.358
I had a great time.

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.693
Gus, you know
you're my best friend,

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:41.894
and I got you a gift.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.129
Wow!
Yeah.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.363
I didn't get you anything.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.565
All right, cause you're Greek,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.066
I wanted to get you
a bag of Feta crumble.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.434
Wow!

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.769
Yeah, it's kinda,
it's also a wedding gift

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.070
Oh my god!

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.271
For you and your fiancee.

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:53.472
It's too much man!

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:54.774
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:55.975
Cool.
I love you man.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.643
Yeah, yeah,
you smell like olive oil.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.945
It's organic.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.680
Dude, that stinks.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.948
That is organic huh?

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.216
Yeah.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.184
That comes, that came right
from a Greek's woman.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.520
(Laughs)
