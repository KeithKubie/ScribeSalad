STEPHANIE HANNON: Woo!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.780
OK, we are super excited
to have you here today.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.530
We are the panel, the Bay Area
Impact Challenge Finalists.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.531
And we'll talk in a minute
about what that means.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.780
But first, we really want
to get to know our audience.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.446
It helps the panelists
know a little bit

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:22.690
about who's in the room.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.590
So if you can raise
your hand if you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.860
live within 1,000 miles
of the Moscone Center.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.443
Wait, 1,000 was too big.

00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:33.710
100 miles.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.690
OK, great.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.046
How many came from
somewhere outside of the US?

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:38.546
Great.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:41.880
How many currently
work at a nonprofit?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.840
OK, great.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.340
We have, it looks like,
three plus the panelists.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.464
How many volunteer
at a nonprofit?

00:00:50.464 --> 00:00:52.430
OK, cool.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.820
How many people
think their team's

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.211
going to win the World Cup?

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:57.711
Really?

00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:59.202
Shout out your country.

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:00.693
What are you guys?

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.681
AUDIENCE: America.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.160
STEPHANIE HANNON: Anyone else?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.885
OK, we don't have enthusiastic--

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.760
ERIC LUKOFF: I don't
even know who's playing.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.634
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:12.218
Did you know the US
lost this morning?

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:13.008
SUSAN MERNIT: Yeah.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:14.152
ERIC LUKOFF: I had no idea.

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:14.610
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.026
Well, my name is
Stephanie Hannon.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:17.970
And I'm very proud
to be here hosting

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.020
the discussion with the Bay
Area Impact Challenge Finalists.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.890
If some of you were
here this morning,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.540
you might have heard
my intro already.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.935
I'm the Director of Product for
a team called Social Impact.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.560
And it's a really
unique, awesome place

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.850
to work at Google.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.830
We get to apply our
engineering talent

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.340
to social and
humanitarian problems,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.350
like how do you
improve democracy?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.510
How do you get people
engaged with their community?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.740
How do you make the
nonprofit ecosystem work

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.470
more efficiently?

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.830
How do you help
keep people safe?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.930
And how do you end
repressive censorship?

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.542
So incredibly high
magnitude of challenges.

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:54.500
But it's really amazing
to be at a company that

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.920
invests their resources
and people in this.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.454
From the talk this
morning, you're

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.120
going to see some
themes that carry over

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.550
into this panel about how you
think about scaling your impact

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.330
as you're a nonprofit, and also
how, when you try to address

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.080
underserved communities,
they might use technology

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.270
different than we expect.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.640
So the Google Impact
Challenge, it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.600
a challenge that finds and
funds the best nonprofits

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.890
for a country and region
that are using technology

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.650
to create change
in our community.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.020
We've hosted them in
the UK, India, Brazil,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.970
and most recently, the Bay Area.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.560
In March, we launched
the Bay Area one here,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.800
asking local nonprofits to share
their most innovative idea.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.460
Over 1,000 applied.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.570
And we selected 25 finalists.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.140
And we're going to talk to
three of them here today.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.620
Across the program, we
gave away $5 million.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.077
So lots of opportunity
for funding here.

00:02:50.077 --> 00:02:52.160
I'm joined on this panel
by these three finalists.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.060
The first is Eric.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.520
Eric is the co-founding CTO of
One Degree, a nonprofit working

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.620
to revolutionize
the way low income

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.560
families access social services.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.925
He has been a former
product manager and engineer

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:06.240
at Change.org.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.940
He has worked for nonprofits
for campaigns and fundraising

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.140
efforts.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.960
And he's been programming
since he was six years old.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.020
He loves dogs and has a
15-year-old dog named Barkley.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.510
I made them all
give me fun facts.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.250
Fun facts, dogs,
if you guys want

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.480
to talk about that in the Q&amp;A.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.020
Susan is the CEO and Founder
of Hack the Hood, a nonprofit

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
addressing digital equity
by training low income

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.630
kids to create websites
for local small businesses,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.090
actively supporting them to
launch their tech careers.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.550
She is a former tech executive.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.580
She was a VP at Netscape and AOL
and a senior product director

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.690
at Yahoo.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.220
And her fun fact is that she's
an active permaculturist.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.640
And it took me a while
to learn how to say that.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.110
Permaculturist.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.180
OK, Stefan is a founding member
of the Technology Advisory

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.210
Board for Beyond 12,
a nonprofit created

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.450
to increase the number of
traditionally underserved

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.210
students who earn
a college degree.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.800
He's our international panelist.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.780
He's from Sweden.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.770
He moved here in '99.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.400
He's been leading teams that
build software and design

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.280
systems for 20 years,
including at Dell.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.450
And he's launched several
companies himself.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.070
His fun fact is that he
loves pickled herring.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.940
And I can tell you,
it is terrible.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.960
Because I have had it.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.835
So we're going to start
with an introduction.

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:24.511
Then I'm going to
ask a few questions.

00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:26.510
And then we're going to
turn it over to you guys

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.968
to see what you
want to talk about.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.780
So you can always have questions
percolating in your mind.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.640
So to begin with,
if you can talk

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.292
about your organization,
the mission, what you're

00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:36.750
trying to address,
and some of what

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.295
inspired you to work in this
area, starting with Eric.

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:40.300
ERIC LUKOFF: Great.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.630
Thank you, Stephanie.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.730
So I'm Eric.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.180
I'm the CTO of One Degree.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.280
And let's start with a little
background about something

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.770
you already probably know about.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.600
It's really easy to find the
best burrito in the Mission.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.910
It's really easy to make a
reservation on Open Table.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.020
But low income families don't
have the same sorts of tools

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.470
to easily and quickly
find the services

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.370
that they need that can help
them improve their lives.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.470
And so for example, we've
built One Degree for Angela.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.430
Angela is a low income teenager
living in San Francisco's Outer

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.430
Sunset neighborhood.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.410
And Angela's family
is low income.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.100
Her parents didn't
go to college.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.574
And they just don't
know where to send her,

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.490
or they don't have any
recommendations for her

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.630
in terms of gaining
valuable college experience.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.250
So Angela used One Degree to
find a summer program that

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.230
is specifically
geared towards her,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.680
under-resourced teenagers
living in the Bay Area,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.400
to help them gain work
experience to make

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.390
them more competitive
for college.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.700
And so we're helping Angela.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.410
But we're also helping
lots of families

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.490
with lots of different sorts of
needs, in health, in housing,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.050
in food, and all kinds
of social services.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.020
And the reason it's so difficult
to navigate the social safety

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.135
net is because
there's over 6,000

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:03.200
in the Bay Area,
6,000 nonprofits

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.776
doing social service work.

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.900
And just doing a Google
search doesn't really work.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.464
Because it just gives you
back thousands of links.

00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:11.130
You don't know what
you're eligible for.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.340
You don't know what's
actually a good fit for you.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.777
You don't know actually
what each organization does.

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:17.860
STEPHANIE HANNON: We know.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.068
ERIC LUKOFF: You know-- yeah.

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:21.090
STEPHANIE HANNON: Search
quality is challenging.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.610
ERIC LUKOFF: Right.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.735
And I'm not sure that just
improving search quality

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:25.850
would even get at the issue.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.340
We have online directories
of social services.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.070
Even if you limit it down to
a pool of organizations that

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.390
is somewhat finite, you still
are stuck with this issue of,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.020
OK, what am I eligible for?

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.130
What do organizations do?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.750
Getting at the heart of
that issue is the key.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.830
And so with One Degree, for
example, I've illustrated here,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.480
nonprofit social
work professionals

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.370
have been using paper
binders for generations.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.520
And in some cases,
we've put those online.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.370
But those are just basically
glorified paper binders online.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.420
And so we can do better.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.070
And so here's what we've
done with One Degree.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.890
We've created a website
that helps you find really

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.456
specific, actionable information
that we call opportunities.

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:11.830
So when you search
on One Degree,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.390
we don't just give you
back the organization.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.680
We give you back the
thing that you can do.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.940
So for instance, get
job training for adults,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.990
or get a free hot meal
on Thursday evenings

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.266
at this location at this time.

00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:26.640
And then the second
thing that we

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.820
do with One Degree
is we help you manage

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.220
those resources, the things
that you think will help you.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.580
And so we keep track
of those in a list.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.620
We send you personalized
recommendations.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.840
And then we're extremely
metrics driven.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.140
And we are able to track
what's relevant to you

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.202
and what you take action on.

00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:46.660
And the final thing
we do is share.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.100
We share.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.620
We help people share
the experiences

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.500
that they have with
social services.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.294
So that the community
can improve overall,

00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.710
and other people can know,
what are the best resources out

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.209
there?

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.000
And what are the
best services that

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.520
might help them improve
their lives, as well?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.600
So that, in a nutshell,
is what One Degree is.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.612
And I look forward to
answering questions.

00:08:04.612 --> 00:08:05.540
STEPHANIE HANNON:
I just am really

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.800
curious about the
eligibility thing.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.620
You might have said this.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.300
But do you work directly with
nonprofits to figure that out?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.420
Because it's not published in
a clear way a lot of times.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.670
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.490
So we do work with
a lot of nonprofits.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.270
And I can get to that a little
bit more in terms of as a way

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.550
to do outreach to people.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.720
But we've taken a
really specific approach

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.850
to working with
individuals directly.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.469
So we do work with
nonprofits in some cases

00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:31.760
to make sure their information
is correct on One Degree

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.100
to really surface and highlight
that eligibility information.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.250
But nonprofits are
not necessarily--

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.250
solving the enrollment
and intake process is not

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.216
necessarily where
we're starting from.

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:42.799
Maybe one day.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.110
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.100
Thanks, Eric.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.110
So Susan, tell us
about Hack the Hood.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.370
SUSAN MERNIT: Sure.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.460
Hi, everybody.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.790
I moved to Oakland from
Silicon Valley in 2008.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.420
And in the past couple
of years, the number

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.140
of tech buses going
through the streets,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.598
picking up people to take them
to San Francisco or Mountain

00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.860
View has really risen.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.770
And one of the things
that I came to realize

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.145
is that there are
a lot of people

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.910
who live in cities like Oakland
who feel like they're never

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.940
going to be able to
get on those buses.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.120
They feel very shut out.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.350
They don't have the education
or the relationships

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.299
to get them jobs in technology.

00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:19.090
And they don't really
know how to get them.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.585
And there's a lot
of hopelessness

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:22.780
and a lot of frustration.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.010
We started Hack the
Hood as a program that

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.850
could work with low income
youth of color in Oakland

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.920
and cities like it,
teach them really

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.340
basic web development skills,
search engine optimization,

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.560
how to list businesses in
Google, local places, maps,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.060
and directories.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.020
And we take those
skills, and the kids

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.520
go out and get local
businesses online.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.680
And help bridge
the economic divide

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.672
by making people who might not
show up in a search on a map

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.130
suddenly appear
when you're looking

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.192
for them on your mobile phone.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:56.000
The kids are doing real
world, hands on learning.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.570
And once they kind of have
some of that under their belt,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.955
we take them to companies
like Google and Facebook

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.750
and to small
startups, where they

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.690
can meet people of color who
are working in tech careers

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.360
and understand that there are
so many different kinds of jobs

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.990
that they could train
to be qualified for.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.030
It's a pretty impactful program.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.310
But it's also a
very young program.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.284
And it's a program that's
very much made in partnership.

00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:22.950
We collaborate with
the City of Oakland,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.550
who was our first funder.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.160
We work with all
kinds of chambers

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.710
of commerce and business
improvement districts,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.400
neighborhood associations,
merchant groups.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.390
Volunteers block walked,
help collect merchant data

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.400
from people who don't
have easy web access.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.160
And it's really
kind of, you know,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.870
the village trying to come
together and change both

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.260
the prospects for these youth
of color, a real diversity play,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.550
but also really help these
low income businesses.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.180
So as a winner of the
Google Impact Challenge,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.420
this was a very
exciting time for us.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.430
Because we now have the
capability to expand.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.700
And we want to expand
into the greater Bay Area,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.840
and over the next
two years, reach

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.920
5,000 youth and as many
as 25,000 businesses

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.460
through our program.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.750
So if you're interested
in learning more,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.119
I'd love to talk to you more.

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:15.160
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thanks.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.450
Susan, you clearly have
such a passion for Oakland.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.180
But I know you're not
a Bay Area native.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.702
Can I ask how you
made it your home?

00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:23.410
SUSAN MERNIT: I'm one
of those people who

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.490
moved to Oakland because
I came from Brooklyn.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.980
I moved from New York
to Silicon Valley

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.894
to work at AOL/Netscape
back in 2000.

00:11:31.894 --> 00:11:33.560
And always thought I
would like Oakland,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.380
but didn't want to
make the commute.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.338
And then when I started
doing my own startups--

00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:39.520
I had a Tech Stars
company that crashed--

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.360
I moved to Oakland
because it was cheap

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.610
and I thought I would like it.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.319
And I kind of fell in
love with the city.

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.485
STEPHANIE HANNON: Wonderful.

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.417
Thank you.

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:47.730
Stefan?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.390
STEFAN NILSSON: Yeah, thanks.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.422
It's great being here.

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:51.630
Thanks everybody for joining.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.410
I know it's late in the day.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.030
So by way of
introduction, I want

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.810
to share with you
a statistic that I

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.220
think is pretty startling.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.010
When you look at the
US today, only 8%

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.270
of kids from a low
income background

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.200
can be expected
to earn a college

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.750
degree by their mid-20s.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:13.090
That's in stark contrast to 82%
of kids from a higher income

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.755
background.

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:15.630
So if we just think of
that gap for a second,

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.676
think of the loss potential
that that represents,

00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:21.050
that's the issue that we're
trying to solve at Beyond 12.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.150
And that's the space
that we work in.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.280
Obviously, graduating
or not graduating

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.760
has a huge impact
for the students

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.700
and for the students' family.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.580
But in addition to
that impact, that

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.370
has a tremendous
impact on our economy.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.152
In California alone,
by 2025, if we

00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:42.610
continue on the
current trajectory,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.260
we're expected to be 2.3
million degrees short

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.200
of what our economy
is expected to need.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.930
So there's a tremendous impact
not only on a personal level,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.860
but for our economy, as well.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.340
So what Beyond 12 does is that
we've created a set of services

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:04.970
and a set of tools that we
use to try to bridge this gap.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.100
And when we look at the data
and the service gap that

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.100
exists, what we find is that
we really have a broken system.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.980
We have an educational
pipeline where

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.840
high schools don't
talk to colleges.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.380
And we have no way
to actually track

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.745
what's happening to our
kids through that pipeline.

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:24.370
And the impact of
that is that our kids

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.661
are falling through the cracks.

00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:28.150
The impact is that our
kids aren't graduating,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.720
as the data clearly tells us.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.250
And what we're trying
to do is kind of bridge

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.090
that gap and help high
schools and colleges

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.735
provide the academic, the
social, the emotional support

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.360
to these kids to make
sure that they're

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.920
able to actually graduate.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.060
And fundamentally, what we do at
Beyond 12, we do three things.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.480
We track kids.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.029
So when kids get into college,
we track their performance,

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:54.820
and we feed that data
back to high schools.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.486
And what that does
for the high schools,

00:13:56.486 --> 00:13:59.090
that allows them to understand
how efficiently they're

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.500
actually preparing
kids for college.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.720
What we're seeing today is
that we're seeing high schools

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.080
graduating kids that
are college eligible

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.630
but not actually college ready.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.750
So we track kids.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.880
We connect kids.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.920
We connect kids to other
students on campus,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.760
to important campus
resources that's

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.720
going to help them
be successful.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.550
And then last but not
least, we coach kids.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.630
So for our low
income freshmen, we

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.900
provide a personal coach for
the first two years of college,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.650
allowing them the
support system that they

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.567
need to be able
to be successful.

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:35.900
We believe, obviously, that
this has a tremendous impact

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.130
and potential for a
tremendous impact on the kids

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.270
that we are able to
work with directly.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.480
But equally as important, we're
able to have a systemic impact,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.930
both on the high schools from
which our kids are coming

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.360
and the colleges that
they're enrolling in,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.180
and that they're
currently attending.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.062
So in a nutshell,
that's Beyond 12.

00:14:53.062 --> 00:14:55.020
STEPHANIE HANNON: I know
you're Bay Area based.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.090
But I don't know if your
students or users are mostly

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.770
in the Bay Area?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.620
Or are you trying to solve this
nationally, internationally?

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.161
STEFAN NILSSON:
Yeah, great question.

00:15:02.161 --> 00:15:06.280
So Beyond 12 is a Bay Area
based and founded organization.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.960
We do operate on a
national level today.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.324
So we actually have a minimal
office in Atlanta, as well.

00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:13.740
But we're a national
organization.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.364
So we support kids
who come from school

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:16.830
systems across the country.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.140
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.950
Thank you.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.160
Does anyone know what
that clapping is outside?

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.566
There's a comedy show next door?

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:28.460
And you guys chose
to be here with us?

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.362
Yeah, that deserves
a round of applause.

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:32.915
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:33.540
That's amazing.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.915
We're going to
make them jealous.

00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:36.640
That's what's about
to happen here.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.560
OK, so we are at a
developer conference.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.969
And these people in the room are
probably amazing technologists.

00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:44.010
So I'd like to talk a
little bit about how you're

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.020
using technology to
address your issue,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.330
and maybe talk about what's
unique in your approach,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.990
starting with Susan.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.380
SUSAN MERNIT: Sure.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.120
Does anybody know
teenagers in big cities

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.260
who don't have smartphones?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.980
Everybody who comes into our
program has a smartphone.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.200
But most of the youth
that we work with

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.110
think of themselves as
consumers of technology,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.790
not as producers of technology.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.830
To them, the kind of apps
that we look at every day

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.030
are kind of a black box.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.870
And they're the audience for it.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.490
So part of what we're trying
to do is change the equation

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.740
and teach kids how
they can use basic web

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.920
tools to become producers.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.360
So what we start off
with is very simple.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.330
It's really the Google Apps
suite and tools like Weebly

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.060
that are drag and
drop website builders.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.460
But we use that as a gateway
to make them feel successful,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.284
make them interested in
other kinds of programming.

00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:40.450
So we have a mentor program.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.920
We have a lot of local
programmers from Oakland

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.697
and the Bay Area who really
want to help our kids understand

00:16:45.697 --> 00:16:47.280
all the different
kinds of programming

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.330
languages, the different kinds
of assistants you can work

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:56.120
with, what APIs are,
what's a code review.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.210
And help them get from our
program, which is a feeder,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.660
into deeper kinds of involvement
with other kinds of tech.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.844
So we look at ourselves
as a great place to start.

00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:08.510
We want to help move
them along the way,

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.470
whether it's to a certificate
in project management,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.640
or it's actually starting to
study a serious programming

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.230
language and get the skills
to work in the industry.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.230
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.011
Thank you.

00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:22.760
I'm going to ask the
same question of Eric

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.750
about One Degree.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.500
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.210
It's a great question.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.359
There are online
directories that exist.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.140
Google exists as
a search engine.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.587
There's also a pretty well
known directory called 2-1-1.

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:35.420
I don't know if anyone
here has heard of it.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.670
It's basically an online
directory of social services.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.530
There are other
directories out there.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.417
And they're mostly geared
towards social work

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:42.000
professionals.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.440
I sort of alluded to
this in the intro.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.860
But they're geared
towards people

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.240
who already know
how to navigate.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.170
They can see an
organization and already

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.540
tell you a little bit
about what that might be,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.310
how that might benefit you.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.740
And so what we did
with One Degree

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.490
was take a very
unique approach, which

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.270
was to create a user aligned,
consumer web product,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.280
and eventually smartphone apps,
for help seekers themselves,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.700
not for the intermediary,
not for the caseworker

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.430
or the social worker.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.760
And so that's the
big differentiator.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.940
And the way we do that
is, or one of the ways

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.780
in which we get at
that, is besides just

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.770
having very high quality,
we hope high quality,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.250
engaging experiences, it's
also a part of the content

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.360
that we serve.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.630
And so we sort of saw
that in the intro slide.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.490
But we get at that through,
instead of showing you

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.000
information, like if
you were searching

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.580
for help with a pregnancy
or a pregnancy test,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.280
rather than giving you back
the organization, Saint Anthony

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.060
Foundation, we would give you
back, get a pregnancy test.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.500
And here's where to go.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.870
And here's when to do
it, and in this case,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.590
what the next steps to take are.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.630
And in this case, it would
be to go to the clinic

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.380
during office hours.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.400
So we give you really
specific information

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.214
that's geared towards consumers
and not professionals.

00:19:03.214 --> 00:19:04.630
STEPHANIE HANNON:
It's really nice

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.005
to hear you
articulate who you're

00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:07.970
trying to help so
clearly, the help seeker.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.470
Because I think that's
something we all struggle with,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.641
is defining the user.

00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:11.890
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.200
And that isn't to
say that there's not

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.231
a place at One Degree for
nonprofit professionals

00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:19.480
and social work professionals.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.390
And there absolutely is.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.680
And in fact, we have
a large user base

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.206
of people in local
nonprofits using One Degree.

00:19:28.206 --> 00:19:29.330
And it's hopefully growing.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.390
But they're using
it as something

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.060
that they can use along
with their clients.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.150
Because the content is so
ready for their clients.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.525
It doesn't need
to be translated,

00:19:40.525 --> 00:19:45.590
doesn't need to be put
into layman's terms.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.830
It's already ready
for help seekers.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:48.830
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.530
And Susan, I, this morning,
just whapped my microphone

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.490
like 1,000 times.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.710
I try not to do it
anymore, but it's amazing.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.865
Stefan, I'd like to ask
you a different question.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.615
Now I can see that I might
have screwed that up.

00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:06.990
STEFAN NILSSON:
That's all right.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.220
STEPHANIE HANNON: But
Eric did a great answer.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.690
So I'm just going to ask
you the same question.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.190
Can you talk about how
you're using technology

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.150
to address your issue?

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.290
STEFAN NILSSON: Sure, yeah.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.610
I'll stick to the script, right?

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.290
So I think--

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.873
STEPHANIE HANNON: I
only have one job.

00:20:17.873 --> 00:20:19.579
So far, so good, right?

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:21.620
STEFAN NILSSON: No, I
think Eric did a great job.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.960
So when we look at, if we
think back to our model,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.290
one of the key components of
our model is the coaching model.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.790
So the coach that we provide
to our low income freshmen

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.149
for the first two years of
their college experience,

00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.940
it's a great model.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.640
We know that it works.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.960
Data tells us that it works.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.580
But by definition, it's
a high touch model.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.590
And so therefore, it
doesn't scale very well.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.230
So even if we would like to,
it's not really realistic

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.900
for us to try to provide
that model or that coach

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.080
to every kid in the US who
might actually need it.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:59.220
So the kids that we work
with, by way of background,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.430
oftentimes, they're the
first kids in their family

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.930
or their circle of friends or
sometimes even their community

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.840
that go to college.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.070
So they don't have that
kind of social network

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.940
and social support network and
support system that maybe you

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.332
enjoyed or I enjoyed or you
guys in the audience enjoyed,

00:21:15.332 --> 00:21:17.290
parents who went to
college and can prepare you

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.415
for what that experience
is going to be like.

00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:21.540
And there's a lot of stuff
they need to understand.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.640
There's a stark difference
in the academic requirements,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.390
academic deadlines, things to
think about from the skills

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.860
and behaviors that
you need to pick up.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.870
So it's this big hairy problem.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.270
So what we're doing,
with help from Google,

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.116
is that we're creating
the My Coach app.

00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:45.490
And what that does, or what
we're trying to do with that,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.340
is take this big hairy
problem and synthesize it down

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.730
into actionable items, things
that students can take action

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.310
on, deadlines that
they can work towards,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.930
skills that they can
acquire, behaviors

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.280
that they can learn that's
going to ultimately allow

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.980
them to be successful
in college.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.020
And by doing that,
what we're doing is

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.130
we're centrally creating
a virtual coach.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.710
And we're able to provide
that proven coaching

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.600
model to a scale of students,
so a critical mass of students

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.140
that really need it.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.840
So super excited about that.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.347
And then of course,
on the back end,

00:22:23.347 --> 00:22:24.930
we have an analytic
system that allows

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.730
us to track how well those
kids are doing compared

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.360
to the kids who were receiving
the personal coaching model,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.970
and also what parts of the
application or that experience

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.060
actually works, what we
need to double down on

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.380
and what we need to maybe
jettison on and get better at.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.380
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.180
Thank you so much.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.120
STEFAN NILSSON: No problem.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.660
STEPHANIE HANNON:
So Eric, I would

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.670
love to share some of your
learnings with this audience.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.860
What are some
misconceptions developers

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.094
might have when they develop
for users like yours?

00:22:52.094 --> 00:22:53.510
ERIC LUKOFF: It's
a great question

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.990
that we've amply prepared for.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.990
STEPHANIE HANNON: Right.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.987
I just thought of that.

00:22:56.987 --> 00:22:59.320
ERIC LUKOFF: So we actually
have a lot of misconceptions

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.600
that we face.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.050
And one of the
biggest is, and I'll

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.850
let you in on a little bit
of a secret in the tech

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.520
industry, which is that poor
people use the internet.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.890
And we actually have these
slides that I have prepared.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.760
And you can see that about
50% of low income families

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.100
access the internet somewhere.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.430
So that's already a
pretty high volume

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.080
of people who we know
are in this market.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.340
And then we also know that a
large percentage of low income

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.000
families or low income
individuals have smartphones.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.910
So I think it's about
47% of individuals

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.160
under 49 years of age
have a smartphone.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.750
And then that
number jumps to 77%

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.270
when we talk about
under 29 years old.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.770
So we're talking
about a huge market

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.080
of people who are low income,
who have smartphones, who

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.510
are digital ready, and who
don't have tech products that

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.250
are built for them, in a sense.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.290
And so I think those are
two major misconceptions

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.080
about access.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.660
Another misconception
that we face a lot,

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.840
or maybe it's a judgment, is
technology really something

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.500
that a low income
individual should invest in?

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.070
I mean, if you
can't find food, why

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.770
would you need a smartphone?

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.770
And I think that's something
that we face a lot.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.820
And I think we should be
really clear here in this room

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.740
that technology is not a luxury.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.869
It's a necessity.

00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:28.785
We use our smartphone.

00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:31.860
We use the internet to
access government services,

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.150
to apply for jobs, to manage
our bank accounts, to pay bills,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.460
to learn.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.900
It's a necessity
in today's world.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.660
And so I think that's
another big thing

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.262
that we face a lot in
terms of misconceptions.

00:24:44.262 --> 00:24:46.470
STEPHANIE HANNON: So how do
you apply these learnings

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.890
as you're developing One Degree?

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:48.640
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.200
These are great questions.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.850
I would say we start
from a perspective

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.540
that technology is a
really important tool.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.590
And we want to build first class
technology, first class web

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.320
experiences.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.730
Because it's so critical.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.820
It's not nice to have.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.820
It's not like a, let's
build a cool user experience

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.390
for user experience sake.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.150
It's a necessity, because
it's already really difficult

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:23.880
to find help.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.180
It's already really difficult
to get the resources

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.700
that some families need.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.960
And so it's a
requirement that we

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.595
build excellent
experiences for them.

00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:36.790
Not only is it
because they should

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.800
be excellent for everybody
regardless of your income

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.320
level, but also because it makes
it easier to actually get help.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.550
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thank you.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.222
So Stefan, I'd like to ask
you about the major pitfalls

00:25:50.222 --> 00:25:52.055
with regard to technology
and social change.

00:25:52.055 --> 00:25:54.270
I'm sure it's something
we can all comment on.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.965
But how have you experienced it?

00:25:55.965 --> 00:25:56.840
STEFAN NILSSON: Yeah.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.965
It's an important question.

00:25:57.965 --> 00:25:59.940
I think if you ask
everybody in the audience,

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.690
I'm sure everybody has
a different answer.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.827
But I think one
thing that I see,

00:26:03.827 --> 00:26:05.410
or a couple of things
that I see often

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.850
is, particularly with
technology changing so fast,

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.220
we have a tendency to
believe that the new device

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.847
or the new app or the new
solution or the new paradigm,

00:26:15.847 --> 00:26:17.430
big data, whatever
it may be, is going

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.030
to solve the things that
we're struggling with today.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:25.000
They're going to be able to
affect the change that we

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.370
want in the social arena.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.632
And I think by and large,
that's not really true.

00:26:29.632 --> 00:26:31.090
To have systemic
change, you really

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.010
need to be able to change human
behavior and human practices.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.990
And in order to do that, we
need to bring to the table

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.440
the folks who we're
trying to solve for.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.580
So similar to what
Eric is doing, really

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.970
understand what their
lives are about, and really

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.840
understand how they're
using technology

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.790
or they're using devices
or apps, et cetera,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.740
and kind of get
at their problems

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.000
through those channels.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.910
And too often, we work
around these groups.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.850
Too often, we're
not putting them

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.340
at the center of
what we're creating.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.610
And we kind of sit and
we congratulate ourselves

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.641
on how smart we
are and how nice we

00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.640
are to help all these
wonderful people out there

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.599
who need our help.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:12.890
But we're not bringing them in.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.610
And we're not putting
them at the center

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.370
of what we're creating.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.850
And I think that's
super important.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.720
And that's the
only way that we're

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.690
going to be able to
get systemic change,

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.850
if they're part of
the process, if they

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.174
have a voice, a
strong voice that

00:27:25.174 --> 00:27:26.590
allows them to
feel like they have

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.866
agency in what we're creating.

00:27:27.866 --> 00:27:29.490
So I think those are
some of the things

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.600
that I see as challenges
with technology

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.174
affecting social change.

00:27:33.174 --> 00:27:35.840
SUSAN MERNIT: I just want to add
that I think that user centered

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.910
design is a principle that's
really important to work

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.190
with with low
income communities.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.080
And that the best apps
and the best tools

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.340
are developed in
partnership with the people

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.290
that they serve.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.660
And we've learned some
really funny things.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.009
When we first started working
on this project, we were like,

00:27:53.009 --> 00:27:54.800
we can just do everything
through our phone

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.760
and our tablets and computers.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.880
And we actually
had to use paper.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.849
There were people who
wanted to fill out a form,

00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:03.890
and like, that's what they
were comfortable with.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.890
And we ended up
saying, well, if that's

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.549
what a certain segment
of our audience wants,

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:09.840
I guess we're going to do that.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.580
It seemed very archaic.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.210
But they were much
more comfortable

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.690
filling out a piece of
paper than having somebody

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.910
enter information into a tablet.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.160
STEPHANIE HANNON: Eric, did
you want to add something?

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.480
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah, I just
wanted to add something.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.970
I think this idea that if
we built it, they will come.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.250
This phenomenal
technology is that we've

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.051
solved some amazing world
problem, just doesn't really

00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:34.550
happen.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.010
And I think we're all sort
of saying the same thing,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.620
that it's this user
aligned approach

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.578
that's really critical.

00:28:39.578 --> 00:28:41.690
We're on the ground every
day talking to people,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.290
recruiting people and asking
them questions and asking them

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.135
how we could be helpful, and
what's actually useful to you

00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:48.502
and what's not.

00:28:48.502 --> 00:28:49.460
STEPHANIE HANNON: Yeah.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.000
I think we're
working or struggling

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.940
with some of the same
things at Google.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.481
One of our areas is
civic engagement.

00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:56.190
So how do you get people to
be interested in the things

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.279
happening around them on
their block, their bike

00:28:58.279 --> 00:28:59.570
lane, their school, their park?

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.550
And the data is
really hard to get,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.317
to even try to expose
that information to users.

00:29:05.317 --> 00:29:07.650
But then I don't know if
they're going to be interested.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.440
Like, what if we go to all that
trouble and get all that data?

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.685
And I think there's sometimes a
little bit of, if we build it,

00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:13.385
they will come mentality.

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:15.218
People are trying to
figure out aggressively

00:29:15.218 --> 00:29:16.650
how to test those assumptions.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.969
Sounds like that's a big part
of whatever all of us are doing.

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:22.760
Susan, I would love it
if you could walk us

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.430
through a particular challenge
you faced at Hack the Hood.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.430
SUSAN MERNIT: Sure.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.770
One of the challenges
we face at Hack the Hood

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:34.830
is just how thin the margin is
that a lot of our young people

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.730
are on financially.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.465
We were very proud
of the idea that we

00:29:38.465 --> 00:29:40.160
were building this
virtuous circle where

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.850
we could train kids, the
kids work with businesses.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.100
And then we would help them
get more training and more

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.010
education.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.690
But our first full
program was last year.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.500
And I had a very sobering
moment about January

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.490
when I discovered that of three
of the youth who had enrolled

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.080
in college who hadn't
planned to go, two of them

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.880
had dropped out.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.270
One was a girl who got pregnant.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.110
And the other dropped out to
support a family member who

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.820
needed help, because she was
the only person in her family

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.550
who could get a full time job.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.250
So here was one of the best
students in our program,

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.915
incredibly bright, working
as an assistant manager

00:30:14.915 --> 00:30:18.270
at McDonald's for $8.75 an hour.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.280
And I felt like we'd
really sort of failed her.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.300
Because we didn't
really understand

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.450
that getting her to
college and getting a loan

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.070
to pay for school
wasn't really enough.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.500
And it made us really
change our program.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.300
We kind of stepped back
and said, how do we

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:38.570
provide better support
beyond the actual boot camp

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.720
that we're doing?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.230
Not only to get them
internships and job placements,

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.600
but in general.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.240
And what we did is we reached
out to the community colleges.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.140
And now this year, we're
going to say things to kids

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.160
like, wow, you're really
good at logistics.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.690
You could go to
Samuel Merritt College

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.370
and get a degree in
project management.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.160
And there are
certificate programs

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.390
that we could get them into
where if they are working,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.790
they could make
$15 or $20 an hour

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.830
and be able to continue
their education.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:11.580
So that was hard to see that
the safety net was so thin

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.430
and that we really
needed to do a lot

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.956
more to make them successful.

00:31:15.956 --> 00:31:17.955
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thanks
for sharing that story.

00:31:17.955 --> 00:31:20.390
Eric, do you have a case
study you could share with us?

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:20.860
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah, I do.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.880
STEPHANIE HANNON: One
of your challenges?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.190
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.262
And this goes back to
actually what we were just

00:31:24.262 --> 00:31:27.140
talking about in terms
of user centered design.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:33.560
So before, this is something
that every product person faces

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.520
before you have anything off
the ground, is how complex

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.570
do you make the
minimum viable product?

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.680
And so before we
started, we did a bunch

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.720
of user interviews or
potential user interviews

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.053
with people who we thought
might be our target audience.

00:31:46.053 --> 00:31:49.350
So I remember really
distinctly talking to one mom

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.600
who really made me
realize something, which

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.360
was that a lot of low income
families or low income

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.001
individuals who
have smartphones,

00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:59.250
that segment that we were
talking about earlier, which

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.080
is quite sizable, use
smartphones, have them and use

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.960
them on a regular basis,
but don't use email.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.490
And so that made us realize that
to require email for signing up

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.315
for our service, that would be a
nonstarter for a lot of people.

00:32:13.315 --> 00:32:14.690
And it was really
important to us

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.430
to be able to serve
a wider market

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.610
and include these people into
our membership at One Degree.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.050
So we decided from the get
go, although it definitely

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:29.330
adds some complexity to
a site just starting out,

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.290
we decided to
accept registration

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.424
with either email
or a phone number.

00:32:33.424 --> 00:32:35.590
And then with those people,
we communicate with them

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.620
over SMS instead of email.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.690
And so that's just
like a decision

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.730
that you have to make when you
realize that the thing that you

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.650
have in your head is not quite
aligned with what everyone else

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.430
or what the people that
you actually want to serve

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.252
had in mind.

00:32:49.252 --> 00:32:51.460
STEPHANIE HANNON: And as we
talked about when we met,

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.924
as a Gmail PM,
it's hard to hear.

00:32:54.924 --> 00:32:57.390
But I understand
it's the reality.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.390
Susan, I'm going to go
back to you for a second.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.370
I think I didn't
give you a chance

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.550
to say what those learnings
with those three students,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.530
how did it impact you?

00:33:06.387 --> 00:33:08.720
SUSAN MERNIT: It was one of
those teachable moments when

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.540
you realize that as well
intentioned as you are,

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.530
you really need to do more.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:19.400
And I know a lot more about
certificates and continuing

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.350
education certification now than
I did at this time last year.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.350
And I realize how important
those kinds of relationships

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:30.750
are where we can really pass
these students to people

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:34.100
who will help them get
situated in a way where

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.190
they can be successful.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.160
So it takes an investment.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.440
But some of the kids we
worked with who I'm describing

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.780
are coming back to work
with us this summer.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.880
And I'm really
committed to making sure

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.124
that they don't end up
in this situation again.

00:33:49.124 --> 00:33:50.290
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thank you.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.740
And just a few more
questions from me.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.700
And then I want to
remind you, we're

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.450
going to invite you
guys to ask questions.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.490
It can be about the content
of their work, their careers,

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.990
why they do what they do, or
even being a part of the Bay

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.100
Area Impact Challenge, what
that experience was like.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.940
So be thinking.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.356
Stefan, I'd like
to go back to you

00:34:06.356 --> 00:34:08.481
and say, what can nonprofits
learn from developers?

00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:11.080
And what can developers
learn from nonprofits?

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.851
Seems appropriate
for this audience.

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:15.110
STEFAN NILSSON: Yeah.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.680
So I think when I look
at it from the experience

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.179
that we've had at
Beyond 12, I think

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.850
one of the things that we've
been able to kind of impart

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.880
on Beyond 12 is kind of what
we maybe think of as developers

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.790
on a day to day basis,
which is this quantifiable

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.080
and data driven approach
to problem solving.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.330
Something works or it doesn't.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.520
And it's valuable or it's not.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.228
And then you jettison
or you double down.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.132
Whereas in, at least
in our case, and I

00:34:42.132 --> 00:34:43.840
think in the nonprofit
sector in general,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.620
it's easy to kind of get focused
on an individual or a community

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.511
of individuals and
not think about,

00:34:48.511 --> 00:34:49.719
how do you bring it to scale?

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.670
How do you optimize?

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:55.000
How do you find ways to provide
the services and the help

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.710
that you want to provide
to a larger group of people

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.900
that really need it?

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.540
So I think that's
something that we've

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.900
been able to learn from
the developer community

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.950
at Beyond 12.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.390
And vice versa, I
think as I try to help

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.330
Beyond 12 scale their services,
we talked about the coaching

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.380
model and how we're trying to
scale that through the My Coach

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.030
application.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.460
I do a lot of things to try
to streamline and optimize

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.220
and make sure that
it kind of gets

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.970
to as many people as possible.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.634
And it's easy in that process
to make generalizations.

00:35:25.634 --> 00:35:27.550
It's easy to forget that
behind all the things

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.836
that you're working on,
there's a real person.

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.710
There's a young woman
trying to go to college

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:32.668
and trying to graduate.

00:35:32.668 --> 00:35:35.380
And they're trying to
navigate FAFSA applications

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.450
and drop or add deadlines
and so on and so forth.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.660
And you can't forget
that as you try your best

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.000
to optimize and bring to scale.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.580
You've got to remember that
there's somebody who's, maybe

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.720
even their entire family's hopes
and dreams are on that person's

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.219
shoulder.

00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:53.830
And they're just trying to
get through the next semester.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.350
And so I'd come
back to something

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.475
that I think has been a
recurring theme here, which

00:35:57.475 --> 00:35:59.980
is technology is not enough.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.190
It's not just about the app.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.870
It's not just about the coach.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.830
There's a human factor to all
of these things that really have

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.350
to be addressed and thought
about and considered

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.907
in everything that we do.

00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:12.490
STEPHANIE HANNON: I
was very impressed

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.360
across all of your stories, how
deeply you guys have invested

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.512
in understanding your users
and the human element.

00:36:18.512 --> 00:36:20.970
So Eric, I'd love to ask you,
how can developers be useful?

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.670
If people are sitting
here, they're inspired,

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:23.630
they want to get involved.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.129
How can they
contribute their skills

00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:26.640
in the current ecosystem?

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.556
ERIC LUKOFF: And just
to echo what Stefan just

00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:32.850
said that goes with this is
that apps are a dime a dozen.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.700
It's like, you can create
an app, that's great.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:41.650
But to answer your
question, we see

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.510
a lot of hackathons
and hack events.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.460
And I would say those
are not useful in terms

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.750
of creating systemic change.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.860
Think about it this way.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.600
You have a problem that you're
trying to solve at work.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.975
Think about the hardest problem
that you have at your job

00:36:56.975 --> 00:36:59.280
right now, intractable
problem that

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.480
will take you weeks, months,
maybe years to solve.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.250
And then having somebody come
in and say, you know what?

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.080
I'm going to spend 24
and 48 hours on it.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.538
And then I'm going to create
an app and solve your problem,

00:37:10.538 --> 00:37:11.870
and then walk away.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.770
You just wouldn't take
it that seriously.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.510
And I think that's what sort
of goes on at hackathons

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.740
when they're for social good.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.750
And I think the intention is
there, but the impact is not.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.240
And I think if you want
to help as a developer,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.260
the best thing to do is plug
into an existing organization

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.636
that is doing something, doing
something that you respect

00:37:29.636 --> 00:37:32.010
and you admire and you think
is a really important thing.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.440
And ask them how you can be
helpful in helping them build

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.030
an infrastructure that is
sustainable and maintainable.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.460
The worst thing to do is
create something and walk away.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.320
And no one's there
to maintain it.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.670
Thanks for sharing that insight.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.090
I think it's unique
since hacking,

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:51.050
especially civic
hacking, are very hot.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.030
Susan, the last
question to you, same.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.773
How can developers be
useful or get involved?

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:58.050
SUSAN MERNIT: I'm actually
a huge fan of civic hacking

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.420
and a big admirer
of organizations

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.220
like Code for America.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.790
And I think that there's an
incredible need for developers

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.820
to help with standardizing
APIs and with pulling data out

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.980
of government and a
lot of different kinds

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.451
of closed systems so that
people can work with them.

00:38:16.451 --> 00:38:17.200
I agree with Eric.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.480
It's kind of a black box.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.410
And if you move to
help in that direction,

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.590
people will embrace you.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.440
But I also think that there's
kind of an individual role

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.910
that developers can play
in organizations like Hack

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.870
the Hood and probably all
of these organizations.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.200
We need people to be mentors.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.820
We need people who made
the journey into tech

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.250
and who love what they do to
work with young people of color

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:44.730
who have no idea what it's like
to do those jobs, what it's

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.330
like to have the
kind of passion,

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.290
but who are really
hungry to find something

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.270
that they can do
that's interesting

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.160
and that's economically viable.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.290
So I would think about, to what
extent can you share yourself

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.830
in a limited way
with a demanding job

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:04.000
by being a mentor, by giving
a talk, by volunteering

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.070
at an event.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.620
Find a way that you
can share your passion

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.140
and your experience with
somebody for whom you might end

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.330
up being a giant influencer and
help really move them forward

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.441
into a new kind of career.

00:39:18.441 --> 00:39:19.441
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:20.430
Thank you.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.500
So I'd love to open
it up for questions.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.420
There are microphones.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.090
Matthew's going over there.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:25.690
I see him.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.790
I called on him.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.829
But this should
be a conversation.

00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:30.620
So think of the hardest,
toughest questions

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.953
you want to ask these panelists.

00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:33.334
Go for it.

00:39:33.334 --> 00:39:34.000
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.642
First, congratulations
on winning the challenge.

00:39:36.642 --> 00:39:38.100
My question's really
one I struggle

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.700
with a lot in this sector,
which is the trade off

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.955
between scalability and
impact on a personal level,

00:39:43.955 --> 00:39:45.174
a direct level.

00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:48.900
And I think it's something
where I think technology tends

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.200
to be tied up with scalability.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.616
The reason why we
think technology

00:39:51.616 --> 00:39:54.610
is a great way to enable, to
make more impact at scale,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.150
but it also sometimes is at
odds with that person to person

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.944
interact and the immediacy of
actually helping individuals.

00:40:00.944 --> 00:40:03.110
Like you say, sometimes
you're doing just some hacks

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.580
to make it happen and help
them out, versus some long term

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.600
sustainable, scalable
solution, which

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.410
it sounds like the holy grail
and often isn't possible.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.310
How do you deal with that
trade off in your process?

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.560
And if you put yourself
on a scale of 1 to 100,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.860
100% being 100% scalability.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.790
And if it's not scalable,
I don't touch it.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.240
And 0 is, all I care
about is helping people.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.700
And really, to be
honest, the technology

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.960
is very, very secondary,
or the scalability

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.206
is really secondary to me.

00:40:33.206 --> 00:40:35.576
STEPHANIE HANNON:
Anyone can answer.

00:40:35.576 --> 00:40:36.450
STEFAN NILSSON: Sure.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.260
I'll take a stab.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.812
I think we struggle
with scalability.

00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:41.270
And I talked about the My Coach
app and our coaching model,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.690
which is a very high touch model
that doesn't necessarily scale.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.920
And I think Alex, our
founder who is not here

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.760
today, we kind of bring
parity to that question.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.320
I'm always challenging
her to jettison things

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.860
that is going to not scale.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.740
Because it requires
personal interaction.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.900
Or it requires a people
heavy organizational model,

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.760
which is really hard to
sustain when you get to scale.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.910
So I challenge her on,
are areas particularly

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.270
and necessarily
need to be there?

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.220
Can we do it in a different way?

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.310
Can we support something
with technology?

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.515
So I kind of bring that
voice to the conversation.

00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:18.270
And she brings the voice that I
talked about earlier, which is,

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.900
guess what?

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.390
These kids come
from a background

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.310
where they don't have
the support system.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.820
And a lot of times, I'll
take a very specific example,

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.180
we had a student that was
trying to get to college.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.690
And that student's parents
was dissuading that person

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.150
from going to college.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.384
Because she was going to be
too far away from her family.

00:41:37.384 --> 00:41:39.550
It wasn't a financial issue,
although that certainly

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.460
was a struggle.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.200
It wasn't the fact that
they were concerned

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.065
about her being able
to be successful.

00:41:46.065 --> 00:41:47.440
It's like she was
literally going

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.620
to be too far away
from her family.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.975
And these are the kids
that we're trying to help.

00:41:51.975 --> 00:41:54.600
And there are kids, and they're
falling through the gaps today.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.770
So it's a constant clash.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.860
And I can't say that
we found a solution.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.540
But as technology
becomes better,

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:10.180
as it becomes more prevalent,
as kids are able to have access

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.500
to devices, data plans that
are affordable, et cetera,

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.590
we can provide better
services through technology.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.730
But the challenge, the tension
between being technology

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.551
centric and human
centric is always there.

00:42:23.551 --> 00:42:25.800
SUSAN MERNIT: We're super
interested in that question.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.450
Because we want to scale from
serving 20 kids in one summer

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.190
program to 5,000
kids around the area.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.570
So it's kind of the question
we're grappling with.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.490
And I think there's
no replacement

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.250
for human relationships
and human interaction.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.570
You can't just put somebody
in front of a machine

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.090
and think you're having the
same quality of experience.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.940
But we're also
talking about people

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.606
who are doing everything
on their phone,

00:42:48.606 --> 00:42:49.889
including watching videos.

00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:51.430
So we're very
interested in the whole

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.980
flip the classroom
model and the idea

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.770
that we can supplement
the real world

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.660
interaction we do
with more videos.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.970
And that things like
Hangouts and Skyping

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.530
can be supplements
and good additions

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.170
to real world exchange.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.400
So I think we're going
to very much look

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.160
at how we can use
those kinds of tools

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.330
to do a better job of
getting people ready,

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:16.240
even having to leave behind,
between the real world

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.952
human touch
programming that we do.

00:43:19.952 --> 00:43:21.410
ERIC LUKOFF: The
only thing I'd add

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.020
is that I don't necessarily
think there's a tension.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.620
I think, at least
in our organization,

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.190
we actually talk a lot
about the spectrum of users.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.680
So we talk about
people who are really

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.900
high need, who really
require a high touch,

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.650
personal interaction, and
maybe don't have a smartphone,

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.180
don't have a computer, wouldn't
be tech savvy even if they

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.826
had one.

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.450
And then the other
side of the spectrum

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.900
is a single mom working
a minimum wage job,

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.580
needs to find help,
but knows what

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.280
she's doing on her smartphone.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.820
So this is sort of the spectrum.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.120
And the ideal
member of One Degree

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.710
is sort of like over here.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.580
But this part of the population
or this part of our target

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.940
market, if you
will, is one we can

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.300
reach through intermediaries,
like with personal touch

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.610
and through social workers
and social work professionals.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.310
And we very specifically
say we're not

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.867
like an automated social worker.

00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:18.700
We're never going to
replace social workers.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.360
We're never going to replace
a friend or a person who

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.900
can help, or a case manager.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.990
So it's really, I
think we're getting

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.005
at that at different ways,
not necessarily in tension,

00:44:29.005 --> 00:44:29.880
at least in our case.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.360
STEPHANIE HANNON:
Thanks, Matthew.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.012
Question over here.

00:44:34.012 --> 00:44:36.980
AUDIENCE: Eric, when you were
talking about the discovery

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.262
you guys made of email itself
being kind of an impediment

00:44:40.262 --> 00:44:42.220
to some of the people
you were trying to serve,

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.800
signing up and
using your tools, it

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.850
was kind of surprising to me.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.030
As you know, the
organization I work with,

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:52.985
we build tools to try to bring
voting into the 21st century.

00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:55.440
And we're ostensibly trying
to build that for everyone.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.140
But our sign up requires email.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.309
So that occurred to me,
we have that impediment

00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:01.850
to low income people
using our tools.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.330
So my question
is, are any of you

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.250
aware of good resources
or organizations

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.400
or whatever to learn
about things like that?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.870
Either like a sort
of list of things

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.190
like that to keep in mind
when you're building tools

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.200
like this, or even organizations
that can come in and audit

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.574
the technology you're
building to make sure

00:45:21.574 --> 00:45:24.475
that it's accessible
to low income people?

00:45:24.475 --> 00:45:25.350
ERIC LUKOFF: I don't.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.750
But if you find
one, let me know.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.436
I mean, maybe, you know--

00:45:29.436 --> 00:45:30.686
STEPHANIE HANNON: Does anyone?

00:45:30.686 --> 00:45:33.074
AUDIENCE: Can I hire
you to come do that?

00:45:33.074 --> 00:45:34.490
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah,
I mean, I don't

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:37.230
think that having someone
from the outside come in

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.956
and necessarily do
an audit is going

00:45:38.956 --> 00:45:40.789
to solve the question
of being user aligned.

00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:42.880
I mean, you have to,
obviously you know this,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.710
but just to make
it clear, you have

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.695
to do that sort of interviewing
and research for yourself.

00:45:48.695 --> 00:45:50.820
Because it's going to be
different for your product

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.610
than for ours.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:56.204
So I think maybe
this is one case

00:45:56.204 --> 00:45:57.370
in which that would overlap.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.450
But there's going to
be other stuff that

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.200
is going to be really
different, I think.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.950
STEPHANIE HANNON: But maybe
one of the coolest things that

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.610
could come out of this
panel is you guys all

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.026
get together
afterwards and decide

00:46:05.026 --> 00:46:06.590
to put together a
set of resources.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.370
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah,
that'd be awesome.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.260
STEPHANIE HANNON:
You guys connect.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.582
Thank you for the question.

00:46:09.582 --> 00:46:10.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.320
STEPHANIE HANNON:
Question over here.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:11.861
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:11.861 --> 00:46:13.910
The first questioner had
an interesting question

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.504
about scalability of programs
versus personal touch.

00:46:17.504 --> 00:46:22.230
And I run, as a side project,
a community nonprofit

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.970
called the Obscure
Organization at obscure.org.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:28.620
And we have one program that's
kind of a public access Unix

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.450
system that is
deliberately not scalable.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.780
You have to ask
nicely for an account,

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.331
or write a letter on paper
with a self-addressed stamped

00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:38.830
envelope.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.900
There's no online sign up form.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.810
Because I can't maintain a
5,000 person online service

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.070
in my spare time.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.000
But we had one other program
that did end up scaling,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.670
where I write and then
conducted a series of classes

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:57.865
on MIT Scratch for a local
elementary school program

00:46:57.865 --> 00:46:59.720
and after school program.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.500
And I wrote up the lesson plans
for this and the classroom

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.870
experience reports,
and published these

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.970
under Wikipedia Compatible
Licensing Terms.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.840
And other parents
in the community

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.260
took those and ran other
classes in other schools

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.240
in the community.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:21.630
And there were people in the
STEM wing of the local county

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.060
public schools who took those
lesson plans and used those

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.510
as the basis for
building programs

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.980
that they've taught
for the last five years

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.480
as a supplementary program.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.620
So sometimes, you
can achieve scale

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.810
by just figuring out a template
for other people to do things,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.740
and planting the seed
or something like that.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.775
It's an option.

00:47:42.775 --> 00:47:45.400
Because you'd have to have high
touch in a lot of these things.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.270
You can't scale an after
school program for 10 kids

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.180
with one person.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.490
But you can, if you
do it right, come up

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.920
with ideas that will inspire
other people to continue

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.777
the work that you've done.

00:47:57.777 --> 00:47:58.860
STEPHANIE HANNON: Amazing.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.570
So just to make sure,
that was an answer

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.590
to Matthew's question.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.540
Perfect.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.990
I appreciation you sharing.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.802
That was really wonderful.

00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:11.839
I think this will be our
last question over here.

00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:12.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.929
I was actually
curious for Beyond 12,

00:48:13.929 --> 00:48:15.720
you said you were
feeding some of the data,

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.178
like on the students
you've tracked

00:48:17.178 --> 00:48:19.070
and stuff, back to
the schools, trying

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.370
to close that communication
gap between the colleges

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.010
and the primary education.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.310
Have you seen or
have you guys been

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:30.285
able to help drive policy
change in public education

00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:31.030
a little bit?

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.988
Have you seen schools
changing their curriculum

00:48:32.988 --> 00:48:35.135
or programs or
support structures

00:48:35.135 --> 00:48:37.260
based on the information
you've been providing them

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.926
and the success stories
that you've had?

00:48:38.926 --> 00:48:40.509
How is that going?

00:48:40.509 --> 00:48:42.050
STEFAN NILSSON:
Yeah, great question.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.800
So I guess the answer to
that would be not yet.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.560
So we're in Year Five
as an organization.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.500
Our first cohort of students
are about to graduate

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.040
and are graduating now.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.102
So for the high
school systems that we

00:48:55.102 --> 00:48:57.060
have been working with
for that period of time,

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.229
we've been feeding
this data back.

00:48:59.229 --> 00:49:01.770
One of the things that we don't
have a ton of visibility into

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.469
is how they're actually
using that data

00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:04.760
and how they're consuming that.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.360
And by extension,
what you're asking

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.830
is, how are they
taking that data

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.540
and then using that to actually
inform their curriculum

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.160
and making changes?

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.760
So what we're
focused on right now

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.660
is providing the tools for
them to consume the data easily

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.450
without having to learn
a lot about analytics

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.100
or learn a lot about reporting
and learn a lot about how

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.560
to read the statistics,
if you will.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.090
And then the next stage
is going to be, hopefully,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.980
for us to also provide
suggestions on where

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.060
are the areas where
they could improve.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.340
I kind of don't want to
speak for Alex, because this

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.860
is really her area of expertise.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.340
I don't think we want to be
in the business of telling

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.610
high schools how to make
changes and what changes they

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:49.109
should make.

00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:51.140
What we want to do is
provide them with the data

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.500
and help them
understand the data.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.960
And then let them
draw their conclusions

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.793
about what they need
to do from a curriculum

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:58.770
or process and a
model perspective.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:49:59.770
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.411
I think as the moderator, I
get to ask the last question.

00:50:02.411 --> 00:50:04.910
And you guys can choose to all
answer it, or just one of you

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:05.610
can answer it.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.200
But I think coming from
the Google mindset,

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.033
sometimes I'm obsessed
with data and metrics

00:50:09.033 --> 00:50:11.360
and what's measurable
in terms of our impact.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.550
But somebody really smart
I met here yesterday

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:17.490
said to me, not everything
that counts can be counted.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.240
Not everything that
counts can be counted.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.160
So I wonder if
you guys will talk

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.743
about how you think
about your impact,

00:50:21.743 --> 00:50:24.666
and does it need
to be measurable?

00:50:24.666 --> 00:50:26.290
STEFAN NILSSON: I'll
take a stab at it.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.660
From the Beyond
12 perspective, I

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.830
think one of the biggest
challenges that we have is,

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.030
there are very
difficult, or areas

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.370
that are non-quantifiable in
our interactions with our kids

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.880
that tells us, that are
kind of markers and signals

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.130
that tells us that maybe
they're not doing that great.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.880
Maybe they're not able
to find the support they

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.950
need to be successful
in college, for example.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.380
But they're
non-quantifiable data.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.120
They're not data
points that show up

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.280
on a report from a data feed.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.270
They're conversational.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.686
When our coaches
talk to the kids,

00:50:53.686 --> 00:50:56.462
and they're at home by
themselves on a Friday night,

00:50:56.462 --> 00:50:58.920
that tells us that they haven't
really created a community.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.270
They haven't found
that support system.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.940
You have non-quantifiable
data points.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.730
We do our best to
take those things

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.637
and put it into our model, that
allows us to kind of figure out

00:51:08.637 --> 00:51:10.220
where kids are and
what they're doing.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.186
But like you said, not
everything that counts

00:51:13.186 --> 00:51:13.810
can be counted.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:14.410
It's difficult.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.201
And that's one of the
challenges that we're

00:51:16.201 --> 00:51:18.590
facing as we're trying to
scale from a human high touch

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.822
model to a technology model.

00:51:20.822 --> 00:51:22.030
How do we catch those things?

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:26.019
How do we make sure that those
things are counted somehow?

00:51:26.019 --> 00:51:27.810
SUSAN MERNIT: We don't
think that the value

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.775
of human experiences
can all be measured.

00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:31.980
And we know how
important that is.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.370
But we're actually
very data driven.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:38.120
Because one of our
axioms is, if you

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.110
don't know how to measure it,
you may not be ready to do it.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.260
I think that it's
really true that you

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.730
can think about how to measure
a chart just about anything.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.180
So I hate the idea of
being a lean organization

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.330
and being busy, and feeling
like you're so busy.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.170
But what is the impact
you're really having?

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:59.199
So we think a lot about,
what's smart measurement?

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:00.740
And what are the
measurements that we

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.281
can measure that
actually are viable?

00:52:02.281 --> 00:52:06.960
So one of our goals for next
year is to have at least 50%

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.595
of our youth not
only in education

00:52:08.595 --> 00:52:11.300
but in some form of internship.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.040
And you know, that's not 100%.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.230
But it's a good number.

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.800
And I think it's
really important

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.380
to come up with measurements
that aren't only about what

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.082
people did, but ways
to measure the impact.

00:52:23.082 --> 00:52:24.540
How do you tell
what the impact is?

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.120
And that's where you get
into that human experience

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.000
or that values thing that
you can't necessarily

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.610
attach a hard number to.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.610
Yet you have to find
some, in my opinion,

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.420
you have to find
some equivalency.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.000
Or you run the risk that
maybe you're just being busy,

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.625
and you're not actually
doing everything you could.

00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:41.375
ERIC LUKOFF: Yeah.

00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:42.620
And I would just echo that.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.320
I mean, I think of
course, we can't

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.140
measure the whole
of human experience.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.962
But for us, it's critical.

00:52:48.962 --> 00:52:50.670
We have to measure
what we do, especially

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.960
as a very new organization.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.170
We won't get a second
chance to do it

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.820
if we can't measure our
results or our impact.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.210
We have very limited
funding, thankfully a bit

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.760
more, thanks to Google.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.680
But we're very new.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.910
And so we need to measure
everything that we do.

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:11.350
And if anything that
we're doing during the day

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:16.050
doesn't in some way
affect the core metrics

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.329
that we care about, then
we usually don't do it.

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.620
Not because it's not important,
not because it wouldn't

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.030
have some ancillary benefit,
but because as an organization,

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:27.300
you also have to approach
it with humility.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.885
We have one thing that we're
going to try to do really well.

00:53:29.885 --> 00:53:31.480
We're not going to try to do all
these other things really well,

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:31.893
too.

00:53:31.893 --> 00:53:32.893
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:35.090
Well, it's been my huge
honor to sit up here

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:38.760
with the best and brightest
of the Bay Area nonprofits.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.500
I am, I think, allowed to say,
give you guys a sneak peek,

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.250
that we're going to
be launching an Impact

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:45.390
Challenge in
Australia next week.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.930
We have one currently
under way in the UK.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.500
The application's
already closed.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.030
But voting will happen soon.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.470
And we hope to be able to
bring them to many more places.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.410
And it'd be wonderful,
amazing if we

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.785
saw some of your work
in there someday, too.

00:53:57.785 --> 00:54:00.330
So thanks for being here, and
enjoy the last few minutes

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.310
of I/O.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.860
[APPLAUSE]
