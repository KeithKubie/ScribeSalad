dramatic you don't need identical twins

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810
dramatic you don't need identical twins

so Xand and his brother Chris as you

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230
so Xand and his brother Chris as you
 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.680
so Xand and his brother Chris as you
know are identical twins and they're

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690
know are identical twins and they're
 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.180
know are identical twins and they're
actually more different physically than

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190
actually more different physically than
 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.010
actually more different physically than
a lot of identical twins and is the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020
a lot of identical twins and is the
 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.030

short chubby one he's he's a half-inch

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.010
short chubby one he's he's a half-inch
shorter than his brother Chris and yeah

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020
shorter than his brother Chris and yeah
 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.010
shorter than his brother Chris and yeah
and six kilos and Counting heavier but

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020
and six kilos and Counting heavier but
 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.390

de grâce so although they're reared

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400
de grâce so although they're reared
 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.910

together you can compare identical twins

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920
together you can compare identical twins
 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.610
together you can compare identical twins
to non identical twins one percent of

identical twins like any brother and

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150
identical twins like any brother and
 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.840
identical twins like any brother and
sister are 50% similar genetically so

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850
sister are 50% similar genetically so
 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.940
sister are 50% similar genetically so
that method the twin method has been

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950
that method the twin method has been
 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.600
that method the twin method has been
used to study hundreds of psychological

early development study so we studied a

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720
early development study so we studied a
 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.600
early development study so we studied a

to know it's about 70% heritable that
 

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.960
to know it's about 70% heritable that
means of the differences in weight in

this room about 70% of the differences
 

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.410
this room about 70% of the differences
are due to inherited DNA differences

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.420
are due to inherited DNA differences
 

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.100

even if it was a hundred percent
 

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.990
even if it was a hundred percent
heritable it doesn't mean you can't

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000
heritable it doesn't mean you can't
 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.330
heritable it doesn't mean you can't
change your weight if you stop eating

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:34.340
change your weight if you stop eating
 

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.550
change your weight if you stop eating
you lose weight so this is the

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560
you lose weight so this is the
 

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.200
you lose weight so this is the
difference between what is and what

other speakers is that we're talking
 

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.000
other speakers is that we're talking
about the normal range of environmental

to take on board in ten minutes but the
 

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.470
to take on board in ten minutes but the
first half of my book talks about all

first half of my book talks about all
 

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.650
first half of my book talks about all
these issues in detail so you know if

these sorts of conclusions it is

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.500
these sorts of conclusions it is
 

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.810
these sorts of conclusions it is
available there in summary what the book

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:22.820
available there in summary what the book
 

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.110
available there in summary what the book
is trying to say is that inherited DNA

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120
is trying to say is that inherited DNA

important but it's essentially random

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:35.570
important but it's essentially random

it's not systemic effects of very family

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440
it's not systemic effects of very family

variables like parenting and then

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:41.840
variables like parenting and then
 

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.740
variables like parenting and then
thirdly a third finding is we call the

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:44.750
thirdly a third finding is we call the
 

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.240
thirdly a third finding is we call the
nature of nurture

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.250
nature of nurture
 

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.170

that a lot of what looks like systemic

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.180
that a lot of what looks like systemic
 

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.780
that a lot of what looks like systemic
environmental effects is actually

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:52.790
environmental effects is actually
 

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.780
environmental effects is actually
reflecting genetic differences so we

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:55.790
reflecting genetic differences so we
 

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.870
reflecting genetic differences so we
find that hundreds of studies have

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880
find that hundreds of studies have
 

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.510
find that hundreds of studies have
looked at the correlation between

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:00.520
looked at the correlation between
 

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.860
looked at the correlation between
parenting aspects of parenting and

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:02.870
parenting aspects of parenting and
 

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.740
parenting aspects of parenting and
children's outcomes but you can't assume

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:05.750
children's outcomes but you can't assume
 

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.160
children's outcomes but you can't assume
that correlation is causal

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.170
that correlation is causal
 

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.480
that correlation is causal
environmentally because parents share

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.490
environmentally because parents share
 

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.640
environmentally because parents share
50% of their genes with their children

50% of their genes with their children
 

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.340
50% of their genes with their children
and furthermore we know that parents

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:15.350
and furthermore we know that parents
 

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.040
and furthermore we know that parents
respond to genetic differences in their

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.050
respond to genetic differences in their
 

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.110
respond to genetic differences in their
children unless you have a genetically

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.660
children unless you have a genetically
sensitive design you can't separate out

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:22.670
sensitive design you can't separate out
 

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.820
sensitive design you can't separate out
the effects of nature and nurture so

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:26.830
the effects of nature and nurture so
 

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.580
the effects of nature and nurture so
these three findings lead me to the

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:30.590
these three findings lead me to the
 

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.190
these three findings lead me to the
title of the book that DNA is the major

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200
title of the book that DNA is the major
 

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.820
title of the book that DNA is the major

systemic source of individual
differences between us and when you

differences between us and when you
 

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.740
differences between us and when you
think about it in terms of parenting

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:40.750
think about it in terms of parenting

I've done probably 20 interviews and the

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:44.930
I've done probably 20 interviews and the
 

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.740
I've done probably 20 interviews and the
phrase that gets most people's attention

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:47.750
phrase that gets most people's attention
 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.910
phrase that gets most people's attention
is relevant to tonight and that is that

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920
is relevant to tonight and that is that
 

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.980
is relevant to tonight and that is that
parents matter but they don't make a

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:53.990
parents matter but they don't make a
 

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.440
parents matter but they don't make a
difference so in although it's confusing

I think of parenting as a relationship
 

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760
I think of parenting as a relationship
and just as with our relationship with

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:33.770
and just as with our relationship with

our partners and our friends I think our
 

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.390
our partners and our friends I think our
relationship with our children should be

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:40.400
relationship with our children should be
 

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.160
relationship with our children should be
based on loving them rather than

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.170
based on loving them rather than
 

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.990
based on loving them rather than
changing them and instead of trying to

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000
changing them and instead of trying to
 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.060
changing them and instead of trying to
change children we can there's the

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.070
change children we can there's the
 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.230
change children we can there's the
difference between what is and what

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.810
difference between what is and what
could be we can change them but instead

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:52.820
could be we can change them but instead
 

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.150
could be we can change them but instead
of always trying to change them and

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160
of always trying to change them and
 

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.490
of always trying to change them and
molding them into what we want

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:57.500
molding them into what we want
 

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.370

to be doesn't it make sense to think

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:00.380

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.810
to be doesn't it make sense to think
about going with the genetic flow and

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:03.820
about going with the genetic flow and
 

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.370
about going with the genetic flow and
find out what they like to do and what

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:06.380
find out what they like to do and what
 

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.770
find out what they like to do and what
they're good at and help them to do that

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:08.780
they're good at and help them to do that
 

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.260
they're good at and help them to do that
because if you love them you want what's

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.270
because if you love them you want what's
 

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.170
because if you love them you want what's
best for them and I hope this is the

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.180
best for them and I hope this is the
 

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.310
best for them and I hope this is the

the interventions that teach parents to
be more responsive and set limits and so

be more responsive and set limits and so

of improving the outcomes of at-risk
 

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.180

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:00.980
thanks well there's plenty to say but um
 

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.100
thanks well there's plenty to say but um
I guess I would point to a couple of

I guess I would point to a couple of
 

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.810
I guess I would point to a couple of

in humans now it definitely does happen

in humans now it definitely does happen
 

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.010
in humans now it definitely does happen
in plants and i believe it happens in

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:06.020

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240
and and so um stacking that kind of
 

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.180
and and so um stacking that kind of

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.599
and I know and I'm working with mothers
in the postpartum and in pregnancy I

00:52:34.599 --> 00:52:34.609
in the postpartum and in pregnancy I
 

00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:37.789
in the postpartum and in pregnancy I
want to give one message that these are

00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799
want to give one message that these are
 

00:52:37.799 --> 00:52:41.210
want to give one message that these are
not outliers and although we talk about

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220
not outliers and although we talk about
 

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.599
not outliers and although we talk about
adverse childhood experiences actually I

00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:44.609
adverse childhood experiences actually I
 

00:52:44.609 --> 00:52:46.549
adverse childhood experiences actually I
think if I asked you to raise your hands

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559
think if I asked you to raise your hands
 

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:49.819
think if I asked you to raise your hands
and I gave you the list which I won't do

00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:49.829
and I gave you the list which I won't do
 

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:53.660
and I gave you the list which I won't do
but you can find it online I think that

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:53.670
but you can find it online I think that
 

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.730
but you can find it online I think that
as I said before most people will say

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740
as I said before most people will say
 

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.150
as I said before most people will say
that they have suffered at least one the

00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160
that they have suffered at least one the
 

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.910
that they have suffered at least one the
we are not outliers I'm not an outlier

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920
we are not outliers I'm not an outlier
 

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.140
we are not outliers I'm not an outlier
and working with women clinically has

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:06.150
and working with women clinically has
 

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.930
and working with women clinically has
shown me that we actually do need to

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940
shown me that we actually do need to
 

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.809
shown me that we actually do need to
support them and we can't leave it to

00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819
support them and we can't leave it to
 

00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:16.069
support them and we can't leave it to
their genetics and if I have one message

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079
their genetics and if I have one message
 

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:21.789
their genetics and if I have one message
to give to the government it's that we

00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799
to give to the government it's that we
 

00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:24.579
to give to the government it's that we
recognize the importance of the

00:53:24.579 --> 00:53:24.589
recognize the importance of the
 

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:27.799
recognize the importance of the
pregnancy period and that we give

00:53:27.799 --> 00:53:27.809
pregnancy period and that we give
 

00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:31.579
pregnancy period and that we give
mothers and fathers maternity and

00:53:31.579 --> 00:53:31.589
mothers and fathers maternity and
 

00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:36.079
mothers and fathers maternity and
paternity leave in pregnancy as well as

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:36.089
paternity leave in pregnancy as well as
 

00:53:36.089 --> 00:53:38.700
paternity leave in pregnancy as well as
postpartum Thank You Susan and

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:38.710
postpartum Thank You Susan and
 

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:43.040

I you know I guess I would just say that

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900
I you know I guess I would just say that
 

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.230
I you know I guess I would just say that
the idea that you're not saying that

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240
the idea that you're not saying that
 

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.590
the idea that you're not saying that
genes are deterministic is blyde by the

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:51.600
genes are deterministic is blyde by the
 

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.280
genes are deterministic is blyde by the
title of the book if DNA is a blueprint

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.290
title of the book if DNA is a blueprint
 

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:56.990
title of the book if DNA is a blueprint
it's then you know you're not going to

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000
it's then you know you're not going to
 

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.970
it's then you know you're not going to
don't have a blueprint for a house and

00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980
don't have a blueprint for a house and
 

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.660
don't have a blueprint for a house and
then end up with a boat the implication

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:02.670
then end up with a boat the implication
 

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:05.870
then end up with a boat the implication
is that genes do make us who we are

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880
is that genes do make us who we are
 

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.510
is that genes do make us who we are
that's why that's basically the message

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520
that's why that's basically the message
 

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.640
that's why that's basically the message
of your book and I think that what we

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:10.650
of your book and I think that what we
 

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.440
of your book and I think that what we
really have to keep in mind is that as

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:12.450
really have to keep in mind is that as
 

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:16.010
really have to keep in mind is that as
you showed on that graph that and I'm

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020
you showed on that graph that and I'm
 

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.620
you showed on that graph that and I'm
not a geneticist but you know what I did

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:18.630
not a geneticist but you know what I did
 

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.600
not a geneticist but you know what I did
learn from your book is that when we

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:20.610
learn from your book is that when we
 

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:22.640
learn from your book is that when we
talk about heritability we're talking

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:22.650
talk about heritability we're talking
 

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:25.030
talk about heritability we're talking
about populations we're describing

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040
about populations we're describing
 

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.870
about populations we're describing
populations and differences within

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880
populations and differences within
 

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.810
populations and differences within
populations is that right so we're not

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:29.820
populations is that right so we're not
 

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.030
populations is that right so we're not
really talking about individuals but

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040
really talking about individuals but
 

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.340
really talking about individuals but
parenting we don't parent variables we

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:34.350
parenting we don't parent variables we
 

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:37.609
parenting we don't parent variables we
parent people and there's just so much I

00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619
parent people and there's just so much I
 

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:40.190
parent people and there's just so much I
of course agree with you that we

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200
of course agree with you that we
 

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.620
of course agree with you that we
shouldn't force children to be something

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:42.630
shouldn't force children to be something
 

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.500
shouldn't force children to be something
they aren't but actually saying that

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:45.510
they aren't but actually saying that
 

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:48.500
they aren't but actually saying that
there's a 70% you know you can look at

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:48.510
there's a 70% you know you can look at
 

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:49.880
there's a 70% you know you can look at
their intelligence scores and it's a

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:49.890
their intelligence scores and it's a
 

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.010
their intelligence scores and it's a
point 7 that they're not let's say gonna

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:52.020
point 7 that they're not let's say gonna
 

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.109
point 7 that they're not let's say gonna
be as clever as you'd like and then

00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119
be as clever as you'd like and then
 

00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:57.140
be as clever as you'd like and then
actually labeling them not so clever is

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:57.150
actually labeling them not so clever is
 

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.240
actually labeling them not so clever is
really bad parenting and is going to

00:54:59.240 --> 00:54:59.250
really bad parenting and is going to
 

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.190
really bad parenting and is going to
have a very negative effect on children

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200
have a very negative effect on children
 

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.960
have a very negative effect on children
so that that's the difference yes

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:02.970
so that that's the difference yes
 

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.700
so that that's the difference yes
working with what's good about them is

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:04.710
working with what's good about them is
 

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.680
working with what's good about them is
great but I think it's naive to think

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:06.690
great but I think it's naive to think
 

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.380
great but I think it's naive to think
that being labeled in a family as the

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:09.390
that being labeled in a family as the
 

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.480
that being labeled in a family as the
not so clever one is not going to have a

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:11.490
not so clever one is not going to have a
 

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:14.300
not so clever one is not going to have a
really bad outcome for children perfect

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:14.310
really bad outcome for children perfect
 

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:19.500
really bad outcome for children perfect
thank you

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:19.510
 
 

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:22.330
 
so for me at least it's boiling down to

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:22.340
so for me at least it's boiling down to
 

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.310
so for me at least it's boiling down to
do I want the stress-free life of

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.320
do I want the stress-free life of
 

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.170
do I want the stress-free life of
someone who's been relegated to the role

someone who's been relegated to the role

am I prepared to sign up to the
 

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:33.250
am I prepared to sign up to the
overwhelming responsibility that what I

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:33.260
overwhelming responsibility that what I
 

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.920
overwhelming responsibility that what I
do day-to-day might actually have some

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:35.930
do day-to-day might actually have some
 

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:38.470
do day-to-day might actually have some
serious and profound consequences for my

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480
serious and profound consequences for my
 

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.260
serious and profound consequences for my
son the most important bit is your

questions I have loads of questions but
we're going to throw it open to the

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:43.790
we're going to throw it open to the
 

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:47.109
we're going to throw it open to the
floor um should have there we go

00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119
floor um should have there we go
 

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:50.920

you that's good um I just find it
interesting that both Joyce and Robert

00:55:59.440 --> 00:55:59.450
interesting that both Joyce and Robert
 

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.470
interesting that both Joyce and Robert
both ended their presentations by saying

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480
both ended their presentations by saying
 

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.420
both ended their presentations by saying
we should just enjoy our children and

we should just enjoy our children and

we should just enjoy our children and
not trying interfere with you know

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:09.080
not trying interfere with you know
 

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.599
not trying interfere with you know
putting on piano lessons and everything

00:56:10.599 --> 00:56:10.609
putting on piano lessons and everything
 

00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:13.420
putting on piano lessons and everything
else so my question is I think just what

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:13.430
else so my question is I think just what
 

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:16.000
else so my question is I think just what
I'm just touched on is what happens when

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.010
I'm just touched on is what happens when
 

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.280
I'm just touched on is what happens when
you do interfere and you try and box

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:18.290
you do interfere and you try and box
 

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:19.990
you do interfere and you try and box
them into something that they don't want

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000
them into something that they don't want
 

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.500
them into something that they don't want
to do

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:20.510
to do
 

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.540
to do
does that not have a negative effect on

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:22.550
does that not have a negative effect on
 

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.150
does that not have a negative effect on
them and to say that it's it's either

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160
them and to say that it's it's either
 

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.670
them and to say that it's it's either
nature or nurture it's genetics or its

nature or nurture it's genetics or its
 

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.770
nature or nurture it's genetics or its
environmental surely there are some

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:29.780
environmental surely there are some
 

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:33.430
environmental surely there are some
children for whom some can pass it off

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440
children for whom some can pass it off

conception we don't really have a
 

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.650
conception we don't really have a
control on the genes so shouldn't we

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:07.660
control on the genes so shouldn't we
 

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.410
control on the genes so shouldn't we
worry about parenting which is a bit

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:10.420
worry about parenting which is a bit
 

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.190

okay so we've got a question about what

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:29.800
okay so we've got a question about what
 

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.010
okay so we've got a question about what
happens when you do interfere is active

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.020
happens when you do interfere is active
 

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.290

parenting doing some harm I think you'd

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:34.300
parenting doing some harm I think you'd
 

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.730
parenting doing some harm I think you'd
like to respond to that question for

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:35.740
like to respond to that question for
 

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.110
like to respond to that question for
everyone are we creating a moral vacuum

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:37.120
everyone are we creating a moral vacuum
 

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.060
everyone are we creating a moral vacuum
are we even by raising this question are

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:39.070
are we even by raising this question are
 

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.070
are we even by raising this question are
we making people care less and maybe

00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:41.080
we making people care less and maybe
 

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.230
we making people care less and maybe
harming children and another question

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240
harming children and another question
 

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.960
harming children and another question
about the ethics pre-and ability to

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:45.970

can I start with you so I I just wanted

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:53.410
can I start with you so I I just wanted
 

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.580
can I start with you so I I just wanted
to the the question there about the the

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:56.590
to the the question there about the the
 

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.890
to the the question there about the the
brain chemistry and so on I think that

00:58:58.890 --> 00:58:58.900
brain chemistry and so on I think that
 

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.360
brain chemistry and so on I think that
research does suffer from the same

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:00.370
research does suffer from the same
 

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:03.180
research does suffer from the same
problems as the epigenetic stuff I have

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:03.190
problems as the epigenetic stuff I have
 

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:05.850
problems as the epigenetic stuff I have
I'm extremely skeptical of that kind of

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:05.860
I'm extremely skeptical of that kind of
 

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.300
I'm extremely skeptical of that kind of
research and and it really is based on

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:09.310
research and and it really is based on
 

00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:12.330
research and and it really is based on
on very very flimsy evidence and we're

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:12.340
on very very flimsy evidence and we're
 

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.220
on very very flimsy evidence and we're
sort of noticing that in science now and

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:14.230
sort of noticing that in science now and
 

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.710
sort of noticing that in science now and
I certainly didn't argue that we just

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720
I certainly didn't argue that we just
 

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.720
I certainly didn't argue that we just
shouldn't do piano lessons and so on in

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:18.730
shouldn't do piano lessons and so on in
 

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:19.890
shouldn't do piano lessons and so on in
fact I argue that we should it's just

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:19.900
fact I argue that we should it's just
 

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.780
fact I argue that we should it's just
that we shouldn't expect them to be

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:21.790
that we shouldn't expect them to be
 

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.090
that we shouldn't expect them to be

can be in some cases negative effects

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:30.190
can be in some cases negative effects
 

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.260
can be in some cases negative effects
but I think you would have to show that

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:31.270
but I think you would have to show that
 

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:32.220
but I think you would have to show that
right you would have to show me some

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:32.230
right you would have to show me some
 

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:34.770
right you would have to show me some
evidence that am not liking piano

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:34.780

been and I don't think there is any such

been and I don't think there is any such
 

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:44.400
been and I don't think there is any such
evidence and shouldn't we worry about

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:44.410
evidence and shouldn't we worry about
 

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:45.680
evidence and shouldn't we worry about
parenting because we can't or

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:45.690

we should be looking at not trying to

we should be looking at not trying to
 

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.650
we should be looking at not trying to
tell people to do free range parenting

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660
tell people to do free range parenting

that we're making is not genes matter so

that we're making is not genes matter so
 

01:00:07.619 --> 01:00:09.770

the environment you know we don't even
care about the environment it's that we

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980
care about the environment it's that we
 

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.779
care about the environment it's that we
need to find the things in the

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:11.789
need to find the things in the
 

01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:13.549

you can just kind of consider abuse or

as outliers that's not what we're
 

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.500
as outliers that's not what we're
considering here in the research I think

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:51.510
considering here in the research I think
 

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.599
considering here in the research I think
it's just you know I think that this is

it's just you know I think that this is
 

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.279
it's just you know I think that this is
really misleading because I actually

really misleading because I actually

these people aren't outliers and so on

these people aren't outliers and so on
do you mean that in a statistical sense

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520
do you mean that in a statistical sense

some point in their life and what does
 

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.690
some point in their life and what does
that show it's it's one of the adverse

that show it's it's one of the adverse

that show it's it's one of the adverse
childhood experiences yeah well but you

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099
childhood experiences yeah well but you
 

01:01:35.099 --> 01:01:36.349
childhood experiences yeah well but you
can ask people about all sorts of things

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359
can ask people about all sorts of things

can ask people about all sorts of things
the point is that the only the things

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:38.490
the point is that the only the things
 

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:40.339
the point is that the only the things
that people the things that people care

that scale right not where it's an
 

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.970
that scale right not where it's an

something we need to think about
 

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.300
something we need to think about

not help us that we have a parent who

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:21.600
not help us that we have a parent who
 

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.440
not help us that we have a parent who
can support us when we come home from

that can I cut the comical on Robert
 

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:39.050
that can I cut the comical on Robert
here I would just say that if 90% of the

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:39.060
here I would just say that if 90% of the
 

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.360
here I would just say that if 90% of the
people here had an adverse experience it

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:41.370
people here had an adverse experience it

goes against your argument in a way

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900
goes against your argument in a way
 

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.090
goes against your argument in a way
because these are obviously

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:44.100
because these are obviously

a lot of books okay can we get three

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:56.550
a lot of books okay can we get three

out what children like to do and
 

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.200
out what children like to do and

Stewart you said you know you need to

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:53.510
Stewart you said you know you need to
 

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:54.640
Stewart you said you know you need to
find out the things you're interested in

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:54.650
find out the things you're interested in
 

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:56.140
find out the things you're interested in
and and push down that path and

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:56.150
and and push down that path and
 

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.000
and and push down that path and
similarly I think and you said we

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.010
similarly I think and you said we
 

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.170
similarly I think and you said we
shouldn't force people to be something

01:03:59.170 --> 01:03:59.180
shouldn't force people to be something
 

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.400
shouldn't force people to be something
they're not so you've all agreed on this

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:00.410
they're not so you've all agreed on this
 

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.290
they're not so you've all agreed on this
idea that we have this intrinsic thing

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:02.300
idea that we have this intrinsic thing
 

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.270
idea that we have this intrinsic thing
with inner cities what we are but I just

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:04.280
with inner cities what we are but I just
 

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.530
with inner cities what we are but I just
want to explore that a bit more to a

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:05.540
want to explore that a bit more to a
 

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.600
want to explore that a bit more to a
certain extent I agree I totally accept

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.610
certain extent I agree I totally accept
 

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:08.859
certain extent I agree I totally accept
that you know maybe with 100-meter

01:04:08.859 --> 01:04:08.869
that you know maybe with 100-meter

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480
sprint a large part of your ability to
 

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.150
sprint a large part of your ability to
sprint 100 meters is going to be genetic

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160
sprint 100 meters is going to be genetic
 

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
sprint 100 meters is going to be genetic
but what about interests and interests

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:15.170
but what about interests and interests
 

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.480
but what about interests and interests
for me are just as important if not more

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:16.490
for me are just as important if not more
 

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:18.880
for me are just as important if not more
important than ability if I just take

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:18.890
important than ability if I just take
 

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:20.260
important than ability if I just take
you know much I'm not a trivial example

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:20.270
you know much I'm not a trivial example
 

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.390

the question is what about interests

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:39.560
the question is what about interests
 

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.000
the question is what about interests
interests really matter in life and

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.010
interests really matter in life and
 

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.630

surely our parents must determine our
 

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.430
surely our parents must determine our
interests it's why not put the

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440
interests it's why not put the
 

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.710
interests it's why not put the
interesting it's not so bad to put some

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720
interesting it's not so bad to put some
 

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.400
interesting it's not so bad to put some
interesting genetic module within us

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:54.410
interesting genetic module within us
 

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:55.990
interesting genetic module within us
they're gonna get to it they'll get to

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000
they're gonna get to it they'll get to
 

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.400

love no attention from in the womb to
until there were two but I think you can

01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:10.609
until there were two but I think you can
 

01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:12.430
until there were two but I think you can
expand this to other children

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440
expand this to other children
 

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.080
expand this to other children
unfortunately lots of children do not

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.090
unfortunately lots of children do not
 

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.150
unfortunately lots of children do not
receive love and attention in the first

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160
receive love and attention in the first
 

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.370
receive love and attention in the first
two years of their life so my question

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:18.380
two years of their life so my question
 

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.880
two years of their life so my question
for the panel is are they doomed because

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:21.890
for the panel is are they doomed because
 

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:24.310
for the panel is are they doomed because
they never got the nurturing love they

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.320
they never got the nurturing love they
 

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.640
they never got the nurturing love they
needed to get at the beginning or if I

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:27.650
needed to get at the beginning or if I
 

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:29.530
needed to get at the beginning or if I
got lucky with the lottery of their

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:29.540
got lucky with the lottery of their
 

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.720
got lucky with the lottery of their
biological children I'm just fine and I

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:31.730
biological children I'm just fine and I
 

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.550
biological children I'm just fine and I
can relax because if they got good

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:33.560
can relax because if they got good
 

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.340
can relax because if they got good
parents they're gonna be superstars

01:05:43.359 --> 01:05:45.880
 
an amazing range of questions there from

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:45.890
an amazing range of questions there from
 

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:47.470
an amazing range of questions there from
the deeply personal this is this is

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480
the deeply personal this is this is
 

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.020
the deeply personal this is this is
usually what there's a lot of stake to

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:50.030
usually what there's a lot of stake to
 

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.970
usually what there's a lot of stake to
the very specific scientific mechanisms

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:51.980
the very specific scientific mechanisms
 

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.160
the very specific scientific mechanisms
and the the intuitive role of what our

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:54.170
and the the intuitive role of what our
 

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.300
and the the intuitive role of what our
parents do for us

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:55.310
parents do for us
 

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:57.609
parents do for us
can I this time start with Susan and

01:05:57.609 --> 01:05:57.619
can I this time start with Susan and
 

01:05:57.619 --> 01:06:00.460
can I this time start with Susan and
Anna well actually two of us two really

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:00.470
Anna well actually two of us two really
 

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:02.620
Anna well actually two of us two really
important questions this issue of sort

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:02.630
important questions this issue of sort
 

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:04.660
important questions this issue of sort
of neural molding and how much after the

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:04.670
of neural molding and how much after the
 

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.340
of neural molding and how much after the
baby is born I mean the brain is

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:06.350
baby is born I mean the brain is
 

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.349
baby is born I mean the brain is
incredibly plastic and the first few

01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359
incredibly plastic and the first few
 

01:06:08.359 --> 01:06:10.390
incredibly plastic and the first few
years of life so I would say to you that

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400
years of life so I would say to you that
 

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.280
years of life so I would say to you that
actually what you are doing with the

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.290
actually what you are doing with the
 

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.920
actually what you are doing with the
babies no matter what kinds of early

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:14.930
babies no matter what kinds of early
 

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.900
babies no matter what kinds of early
experiences they had will make a huge

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:16.910
experiences they had will make a huge
 

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:18.820
experiences they had will make a huge
difference we see this from things like

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:18.830
difference we see this from things like
 

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.250
difference we see this from things like
the Romanian orphan studies and these

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:21.260
the Romanian orphan studies and these
 

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.750
the Romanian orphan studies and these
are controlled studies where the

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760
are controlled studies where the
 

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.430
are controlled studies where the
children who were put into foster care

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440
children who were put into foster care
 

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.830
children who were put into foster care
after they had been institutionalized

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:25.840
after they had been institutionalized
 

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.090
after they had been institutionalized
for a few years were almost

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:28.100
for a few years were almost
 

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.190
for a few years were almost
indistinguishable from children who had

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200
indistinguishable from children who had
 

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.480
indistinguishable from children who had
grown up in homes that had not been

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:31.490
grown up in homes that had not been
 

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:33.090
grown up in homes that had not been
adopted these are the kids who were

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:33.100
adopted these are the kids who were
 

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.660
adopted these are the kids who were
institutionalized at they'll you know

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:34.670
institutionalized at they'll you know
 

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:37.300
institutionalized at they'll you know
200,000 of them were in institutions in

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:37.310
200,000 of them were in institutions in
 

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.460
200,000 of them were in institutions in
Romania so there's lots of evidence that

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:39.470
Romania so there's lots of evidence that
 

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.890
Romania so there's lots of evidence that
shows that what you do as a parent makes

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:41.900
shows that what you do as a parent makes
 

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.930
shows that what you do as a parent makes
a big difference and I would say that

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:43.940
a big difference and I would say that
 

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.760
a big difference and I would say that
that's a response to your question

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:45.770
that's a response to your question
 

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:47.530
that's a response to your question
there's no question and I'm sure Robert

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:47.540
there's no question and I'm sure Robert
 

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.060
there's no question and I'm sure Robert
and Stewart would agree that there's

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.070
and Stewart would agree that there's
 

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.190
and Stewart would agree that there's
plenty of evidence that what we do as

01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200
plenty of evidence that what we do as
 

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.690
plenty of evidence that what we do as
parents makes a huge difference that's

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:52.700
parents makes a huge difference that's
 

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.210
parents makes a huge difference that's
really our point I would say that the

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:55.220
really our point I would say that the
 

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.190
really our point I would say that the
interest question is very important I

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200
interest question is very important I
 

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.070
interest question is very important I
think you know how you are raised what

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:00.080
think you know how you are raised what
 

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.109
think you know how you are raised what
God you worship doesn't that have an

01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119
God you worship doesn't that have an
 

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.849
God you worship doesn't that have an
effect on who we are that has nothing to

01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:03.859
effect on who we are that has nothing to
 

01:07:03.859 --> 01:07:05.950
effect on who we are that has nothing to
do with genes and there are lots of

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960
do with genes and there are lots of
 

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.990
do with genes and there are lots of
other things that make us who we are and

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000
other things that make us who we are and
 

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.870
other things that make us who we are and
you know that that have nothing again to

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880
you know that that have nothing again to
 

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.640
you know that that have nothing again to
do with our genetic propensity but

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:15.650
do with our genetic propensity but
 

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.010
do with our genetic propensity but
actually the issue of forcing children

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:18.020
actually the issue of forcing children
 

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.980
actually the issue of forcing children
to do things this is not good parenting

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:20.990
to do things this is not good parenting
 

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:24.640
to do things this is not good parenting
and we would all agree that we don't

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:24.650
and we would all agree that we don't
 

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.440
and we would all agree that we don't
want to force children into doing things

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:26.450
want to force children into doing things
 

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:31.650
want to force children into doing things
that they don't want to do well maybe

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:31.660
that they don't want to do well maybe
 

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.750
that they don't want to do well maybe
but the whole interest thing is that is

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760
but the whole interest thing is that is
 

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.470
but the whole interest thing is that is
is is really important and as pet as as

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480
is is really important and as pet as as
 

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.750
is is really important and as pet as as
parents we should look at our children

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760
parents we should look at our children
 

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.990
parents we should look at our children
and work with them in that relationship

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000
and work with them in that relationship
 

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.060
and work with them in that relationship
to determine what is in their best

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.070
to determine what is in their best
 

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.710
to determine what is in their best
interests

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720
interests
 

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.849
interests
and work together in that relationship

01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:50.859
and work together in that relationship
 

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:53.950
and work together in that relationship
so I feel like we're giving a very

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960
so I feel like we're giving a very
 

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.329
so I feel like we're giving a very
strong case that there is a sort of

01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:55.339
strong case that there is a sort of
 

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:58.809
strong case that there is a sort of
intuitive experience or belief that from

01:07:58.809 --> 01:07:58.819
intuitive experience or belief that from
 

01:07:58.819 --> 01:08:02.049
intuitive experience or belief that from
from what sports we play to to where we

01:08:02.049 --> 01:08:02.059
from what sports we play to to where we
 

01:08:02.059 --> 01:08:04.660
from what sports we play to to where we
were we where we worship is deeply

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:04.670
were we where we worship is deeply
 

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.069
were we where we worship is deeply
shaped by our parents and those are

01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079
shaped by our parents and those are
 

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:07.359
shaped by our parents and those are
things that we feel quite profoundly

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:07.369
things that we feel quite profoundly
 

01:08:07.369 --> 01:08:08.740
things that we feel quite profoundly
about can you can you respond to some of

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:08.750
about can you can you respond to some of
 

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.390
about can you can you respond to some of
those issues and and maybe also there's

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400
those issues and and maybe also there's
 

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.710
those issues and and maybe also there's
a scientific question I'd like to first

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720
a scientific question I'd like to first
 

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.120
a scientific question I'd like to first
speak to the Romanian study because

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:13.130
speak to the Romanian study because
 

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:14.470
speak to the Romanian study because
that's done by my colleague professor

01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480
that's done by my colleague professor
 

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.200
that's done by my colleague professor
Michael Rutter and that is way out of

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:17.210
Michael Rutter and that is way out of
 

01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:20.439
Michael Rutter and that is way out of
the normal range of deprivation I mean

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:20.449
the normal range of deprivation I mean
 

01:08:20.449 --> 01:08:22.390
the normal range of deprivation I mean
those kids weren't even touched by

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400
those kids weren't even touched by
 

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.550
those kids weren't even touched by
people they were left alone you know in

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560
people they were left alone you know in
 

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.950
people they were left alone you know in
soiled diapers it's the worst sort I

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960
soiled diapers it's the worst sort I
 

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.809
soiled diapers it's the worst sort I
mean you'd be arrested if you did that

01:08:28.809 --> 01:08:28.819
mean you'd be arrested if you did that
 

01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:30.640
mean you'd be arrested if you did that
as a parent but the point that he's made

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:30.650
as a parent but the point that he's made
 

01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:32.890
as a parent but the point that he's made
after all these years is those kids have

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:32.900
after all these years is those kids have
 

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.870
after all these years is those kids have
turned out pretty well despite that

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880
turned out pretty well despite that
 

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.570
turned out pretty well despite that
horrendous first two years of life so it

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:37.580
horrendous first two years of life so it
 

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.590
horrendous first two years of life so it
seems to me it goes against your

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600
seems to me it goes against your
 

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.630
seems to me it goes against your
argument but no but that's because of

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640
argument but no but that's because of
 

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.669
argument but no but that's because of
the the ones who've done pretty well are

01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679
the the ones who've done pretty well are
 

01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:44.590
the the ones who've done pretty well are
the ones who were given you know

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600
the ones who were given you know
 

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.539
the ones who were given you know
opportunities to be moved into foster

01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:46.549
opportunities to be moved into foster
 

01:08:46.549 --> 01:08:48.039
opportunities to be moved into foster
care are not the ones who stayed in the

01:08:48.039 --> 01:08:48.049
care are not the ones who stayed in the
 

01:08:48.049 --> 01:08:50.590
care are not the ones who stayed in the
institutions and in fact the input the

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600
institutions and in fact the input the
 

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.900
institutions and in fact the input the
point is that because they were you know

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:52.910
point is that because they were you know
 

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.539
point is that because they were you know
this was a natural experiment unformed

01:08:55.539 --> 01:08:55.549
this was a natural experiment unformed
 

01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:56.919
this was a natural experiment unformed
thank God we don't have too many of

01:08:56.919 --> 01:08:56.929
thank God we don't have too many of
 

01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:59.019
thank God we don't have too many of
those but the indications were that

01:08:59.019 --> 01:08:59.029
those but the indications were that
 

01:08:59.029 --> 01:09:00.640
those but the indications were that
these children because they weren't

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:00.650
these children because they weren't
 

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:02.320
these children because they weren't
loved they were fed many of them were

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:02.330
loved they were fed many of them were
 

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.479
loved they were fed many of them were
fed and clothed but what was missing was

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:04.489
fed and clothed but what was missing was
 

01:09:04.489 --> 01:09:08.140
fed and clothed but what was missing was
love and it caused major problems on all

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:08.150
love and it caused major problems on all
 

01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:10.289
love and it caused major problems on all
levels physical emotional psychological

01:09:10.289 --> 01:09:10.299
levels physical emotional psychological
 

01:09:10.299 --> 01:09:13.150
levels physical emotional psychological
and it does go against the idea though

01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:13.160
and it does go against the idea though
 

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.099
and it does go against the idea though
of the like the sensitive the very

01:09:15.099 --> 01:09:15.109
of the like the sensitive the very
 

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:16.689
of the like the sensitive the very
sensitive period in the first few years

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:16.699
sensitive period in the first few years
 

01:09:16.699 --> 01:09:18.519
sensitive period in the first few years
of life that everyone talks about if

01:09:18.519 --> 01:09:18.529
of life that everyone talks about if
 

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.499
of life that everyone talks about if
that's the case right why does it go

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:20.509
that's the case right why does it go
 

01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:22.419
that's the case right why does it go
against well because as Robert said if

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:22.429
against well because as Robert said if
 

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:25.689
against well because as Robert said if
these kids turned out they were not

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:25.699
these kids turned out they were not
 

01:09:25.699 --> 01:09:28.749
these kids turned out they were not
adopted out who's against the no they

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759
adopted out who's against the no they
 

01:09:28.759 --> 01:09:30.939
adopted out who's against the no they
were not okay unfortunately if it was

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:30.949
were not okay unfortunately if it was
 

01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:32.740
were not okay unfortunately if it was
after a certain period of time they

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:32.750
after a certain period of time they
 

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.950
after a certain period of time they
never recovered well we could probably

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960
never recovered well we could probably
 

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.879
never recovered well we could probably
disagree yeah

01:09:38.879 --> 01:09:38.889
disagree yeah
 

01:09:38.889 --> 01:09:41.269
disagree yeah
and can I can I just mention the

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279
and can I can I just mention the
 

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.349
and can I can I just mention the
epigenetics and microbiome thing um

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359
epigenetics and microbiome thing um
 

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.870
epigenetics and microbiome thing um
there are fads and parenting and there

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:45.880
there are fads and parenting and there
 

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.700
there are fads and parenting and there
are fines in science as well and and

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:47.710
are fines in science as well and and
 

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:50.160
are fines in science as well and and
those two are current fads in science I

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.170
those two are current fads in science I
 

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:53.220
those two are current fads in science I
think it's completely fine to look into

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:53.230
think it's completely fine to look into
 

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:55.459
think it's completely fine to look into
that stuff but it's really important but

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:55.469
that stuff but it's really important but
 

01:09:55.469 --> 01:09:58.560
that stuff but it's really important but
we do not have anything like the level

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:58.570
we do not have anything like the level
 

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:02.520
we do not have anything like the level
of clear data on on epigenetics

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:02.530
of clear data on on epigenetics
 

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.189
of clear data on on epigenetics
microbiome and all that stuff than we do

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199
microbiome and all that stuff than we do
 

01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:08.640
microbiome and all that stuff than we do
on on behavior genetics then the

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:08.650
on on behavior genetics then the
 

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.080
on on behavior genetics then the
question was then what is is there a

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.090
question was then what is is there a
 

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:13.800
question was then what is is there a
mechanism of post birth parenting you're

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:13.810
mechanism of post birth parenting you're
 

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.660
mechanism of post birth parenting you're
saying no it's not that it's not I'm

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:15.670
saying no it's not that it's not I'm
 

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.160
saying no it's not that it's not I'm
saying no it's them saying we don't know

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:17.170
saying no it's them saying we don't know
 

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.600
saying no it's them saying we don't know
yet and we shouldn't be afraid to say in

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:18.610
yet and we shouldn't be afraid to say in
 

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.220
yet and we shouldn't be afraid to say in
some scientific questions we don't know

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:20.230
some scientific questions we don't know
 

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:21.810
some scientific questions we don't know
I also don't think we should overstate

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:21.820
I also don't think we should overstate
 

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.700
I also don't think we should overstate
the case and hype up the case for things

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:23.710
the case and hype up the case for things
 

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.859
the case and hype up the case for things
like epigenetics because we really don't

01:10:25.859 --> 01:10:25.869
like epigenetics because we really don't
 

01:10:25.869 --> 01:10:27.419
like epigenetics because we really don't
know the answer yet and there's an awful

01:10:27.419 --> 01:10:27.429
know the answer yet and there's an awful
 

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:29.910
know the answer yet and there's an awful
lot of hype in science and we need to

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920
lot of hype in science and we need to
 

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.109
lot of hype in science and we need to
and we need to we need to we need to

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:31.119
and we need to we need to we need to
 

01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:32.040
and we need to we need to we need to
stop making things up

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.050
stop making things up
 

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.080
stop making things up
can we get can we get two more we've got

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:34.090
can we get can we get two more we've got
 

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:35.700
can we get can we get two more we've got
time for I think two let's get three

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:35.710
time for I think two let's get three
 

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:40.490
time for I think two let's get three
more questions go on in number one

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500
 
 

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.770
 
Stewart you mentioned about the studies

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:43.780
Stewart you mentioned about the studies
 

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.930
Stewart you mentioned about the studies
of children with conduct problems and

similar friends so there's flaws in the

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:32.350
similar friends so there's flaws in the
 

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.260
similar friends so there's flaws in the
research on that basis you can't really

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:34.270
research on that basis you can't really
 

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.150
research on that basis you can't really
compare them to families where they're

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:36.160
compare them to families where they're
 

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.220
compare them to families where they're
not when they're not identical twins

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:38.230
not when they're not identical twins
 

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:39.660
not when they're not identical twins
that's one thing the other thing is that

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:39.670
that's one thing the other thing is that
 

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:41.730
that's one thing the other thing is that
I mean I made a note here that most of

01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:41.740
I mean I made a note here that most of
 

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.110
I mean I made a note here that most of
the genetic research is done on

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120
the genetic research is done on
 

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.810
the genetic research is done on
so-called weird populations Western

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:45.820
so-called weird populations Western
 

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.330

democratic that to me also excused the

democratic that to me also excused the

democratic that to me also excused the
data yeah well I just might say that I

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:55.830
data yeah well I just might say that I
 

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.780

agree with the second point disagree

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:57.790
agree with the second point disagree
 

01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.010
agree with the second point disagree
with the first so the first point has

01:14:59.010 --> 01:14:59.020
with the first so the first point has
 

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.080
with the first so the first point has
been explicitly tested you can and there

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:01.090
been explicitly tested you can and there
 

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.610
been explicitly tested you can and there
are cases of mistaken identity when some

01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:02.620
are cases of mistaken identity when some
 

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.810
are cases of mistaken identity when some
parents think that they're identical

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:03.820
parents think that they're identical
 

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.970
parents think that they're identical
twins are actually fraternal twins and

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:05.980
twins are actually fraternal twins and
 

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:09.750
twins are actually fraternal twins and
vice versa and you still and you still

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760
vice versa and you still and you still
 

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.360
vice versa and you still and you still
well you deliberately you you you get

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:12.370
well you deliberately you you you get
 

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:13.380
well you deliberately you you you get
those feelings you experiment and you

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:13.390
those feelings you experiment and you
 

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.150
those feelings you experiment and you
find that once you're controlling for

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:15.160
find that once you're controlling for
 

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.470
find that once you're controlling for
that you basically find the same effects

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480
that you basically find the same effects
 

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.790
that you basically find the same effects
this would say so that's not really a

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800
this would say so that's not really a
 

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.060
this would say so that's not really a
problem

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:18.070
problem
 

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.340
problem
and the weird thing the way educated

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:20.350
and the weird thing the way educated
 

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.590
and the weird thing the way educated
industrialized stuff completely agreed

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600
industrialized stuff completely agreed
 

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.970
industrialized stuff completely agreed
but that's a problem that we have across

01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:23.980
but that's a problem that we have across
 

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.980
but that's a problem that we have across
all psychological research not just not

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:25.990
all psychological research not just not
 

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:30.300
all psychological research not just not
just in in twins so so it's a problem

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:30.310
just in in twins so so it's a problem
 

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:31.410
just in in twins so so it's a problem
that we have in psychological research

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:31.420
that we have in psychological research
 

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.700
that we have in psychological research
including the stuff that's been brought

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:32.710
including the stuff that's been brought
 

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:38.350
including the stuff that's been brought
up by the other side of the debate

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360
 
 

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.209
 
maybe I should just answer that but my

01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219
maybe I should just answer that but my
 

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:44.560
maybe I should just answer that but my
own research has actually taken a

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:44.570
own research has actually taken a
 

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:46.729
own research has actually taken a
cross-section of well it's a long

01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739
cross-section of well it's a long
 

01:15:46.739 --> 01:15:48.380
cross-section of well it's a long
attitudinal study but it's children

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:48.390
attitudinal study but it's children
 

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:51.950
attitudinal study but it's children

to inner-city GP surgeries and I don't

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:55.230
to inner-city GP surgeries and I don't
 

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:57.320
to inner-city GP surgeries and I don't
think that there's anything about those

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:57.330
think that there's anything about those
 

01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:00.470
think that there's anything about those
as outliers when you were born in

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480
as outliers when you were born in
 

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.350
as outliers when you were born in
Lambeth or in Thamesmead but maybe you

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360
Lambeth or in Thamesmead but maybe you
 

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.660
Lambeth or in Thamesmead but maybe you
think those are I don't think that I

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:05.670
think those are I don't think that I
 

01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:06.950
think those are I don't think that I
think it's not necessarily the rote

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960
think it's not necessarily the rote
 

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.150
think it's not necessarily the rote
layers but I think that's our study

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:08.160
layers but I think that's our study
 

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.310
layers but I think that's our study
that's genetically confounded right so

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320
that's genetically confounded right so
 

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.959
that's genetically confounded right so
we don't we can't if we find the

01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:11.969
we don't we can't if we find the
 

01:16:11.969 --> 01:16:13.700
we don't we can't if we find the
correlation between a parenting behavior

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:13.710
correlation between a parenting behavior
 

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:15.890
correlation between a parenting behavior
and a child outcome it's genetically

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900
and a child outcome it's genetically
 

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.150
and a child outcome it's genetically
confirmed so we can't actually tell

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:17.160
confirmed so we can't actually tell
 

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.170
confirmed so we can't actually tell
whether it was due to parenting or

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:18.180
whether it was due to parenting or
 

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.550
whether it was due to parenting or
genetics so that's the problem with that

01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560
genetics so that's the problem with that
 

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.400
genetics so that's the problem with that
kind of study we do have time for a

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:22.410
kind of study we do have time for a
 

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:23.360
kind of study we do have time for a
couple more questions

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:23.370
couple more questions
 

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.189
couple more questions
although the microphones that mic

friends are still out can we grab a

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:28.110
friends are still out can we grab a
 

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:30.709
friends are still out can we grab a
couple more number one have you got a

thing that'd be helpful is if you guys
 

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
thing that'd be helpful is if you guys
could each kind of tell us what you

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:37.410
could each kind of tell us what you
 

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.170
could each kind of tell us what you
define as parenting because it seems

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:39.180
define as parenting because it seems
 

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.020
define as parenting because it seems
like the fore side is saying parenting

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:42.030
like the fore side is saying parenting

fad parenting whereas the again side is

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020
fad parenting whereas the again side is
 

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.080
fad parenting whereas the again side is
saying don't neglect your children and I

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:51.090
saying don't neglect your children and I
 

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.090

think everybody might agree with that

01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100

you're just coming it'd be helpful to
say what are you talking about when

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980
say what are you talking about when
 

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.979
say what are you talking about when
you're saying parenting matters and it

01:16:57.979 --> 01:16:57.989
you're saying parenting matters and it
 

01:16:57.989 --> 01:16:58.670
you're saying parenting matters and it
doesn't matter

01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:58.680
doesn't matter
 

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.910

here thank you I had a question for and
Pleshette Murphy you said and I think

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:46.970
Pleshette Murphy you said and I think

a huge difference if that's the case how

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:50.870
a huge difference if that's the case how
 

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.230
a huge difference if that's the case how
do you account for these research

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:53.240
do you account for these research
 

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.060
do you account for these research
findings from these twin and adoption

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:55.070
findings from these twin and adoption
 

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.890
findings from these twin and adoption
studies we've heard quite a lot about

01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:56.900
studies we've heard quite a lot about
 

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.930
studies we've heard quite a lot about
this evening if it's true that what we

01:17:58.930 --> 01:17:58.940
this evening if it's true that what we
 

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.940
this evening if it's true that what we
do as parents makes a huge difference

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:00.950
do as parents makes a huge difference
 

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.750
do as parents makes a huge difference
had you account for the fact that

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760
had you account for the fact that
 

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.940
had you account for the fact that
siblings raised in the same household

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:06.950
siblings raised in the same household
 

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.520
siblings raised in the same household
are as different as siblings raised in

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:09.530
are as different as siblings raised in
 

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:10.660
are as different as siblings raised in
different households you said it's

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:10.670
different households you said it's
 

01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:13.030
different households you said it's
because when we parent even siblings in

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040
because when we parent even siblings in
 

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.290
because when we parent even siblings in
the same household would treat the

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:14.300
the same household would treat the
 

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.030
the same household would treat the
siblings slightly differently yes that's

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040
siblings slightly differently yes that's
 

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.710
siblings slightly differently yes that's
probably true but we can't possibly

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:17.720
probably true but we can't possibly
 

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.140
probably true but we can't possibly
treat them as differently as an entirely

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:20.150
treat them as differently as an entirely
 

01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:22.780
treat them as differently as an entirely
different set of parents would treat two

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:22.790
different set of parents would treat two
 

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.300
different set of parents would treat two
siblings separated at birth so how do

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:25.310
siblings separated at birth so how do
 

01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:28.510
siblings separated at birth so how do
you account for the fact that not only

01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520
you account for the fact that not only
 

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.600
you account for the fact that not only
to sibs brought up separately eras

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:31.610
to sibs brought up separately eras
 

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:33.370

neither view of addressed this how do

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:36.680
neither view of addressed this how do
 

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.610
neither view of addressed this how do
you account for the research findings of

01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:39.620
you account for the research findings of
 

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.130
you account for the research findings of
all these twins that have been brought

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:42.140
all these twins that have been brought
 

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.200
all these twins that have been brought
up separately separated at birth and

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:44.210
up separately separated at birth and
 

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.940
up separately separated at birth and
brought up by different families they

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:45.950
brought up by different families they
 

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:47.760
brought up by different families they
turn out to be it turns out almost

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:47.770
turn out to be it turns out almost
 

01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:49.630

identical in spite of being raised

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:49.640
identical in spite of being raised
 

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.950

differently if parenting makes such a

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960
differently if parenting makes such a
 

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.630
differently if parenting makes such a
big difference which you seem to think

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640
big difference which you seem to think
 

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.580
big difference which you seem to think
and that's your side of the argument how

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:54.590
and that's your side of the argument how
 

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:57.420
and that's your side of the argument how
do you account for these research going

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:57.430
do you account for these research going
 

01:18:57.430 --> 01:19:00.070
do you account for these research going
times you're gonna get that it's good I

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080

parenting I'd love to hear from everyone
 

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.320
parenting I'd love to hear from everyone
on that and then talk about peers and

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:14.330
on that and then talk about peers and
 

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:15.439

parenting well I've studied parenting in

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:27.390
parenting well I've studied parenting in
 

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:28.850
parenting well I've studied parenting in
many different ways observational

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860
many different ways observational
 

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.860
many different ways observational
studies videotaped interactions between

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:30.870
studies videotaped interactions between
 

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:33.560
studies videotaped interactions between
children so I've used all the methods to

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:33.570
children so I've used all the methods to
 

01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:35.479
children so I've used all the methods to
study parenting that anyone has used

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:35.489
study parenting that anyone has used
 

01:19:35.489 --> 01:19:38.080
study parenting that anyone has used
I've had large-scale studies with

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:38.090
I've had large-scale studies with
 

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:40.700
I've had large-scale studies with
developmental psychologists etc so I'm

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:40.710
developmental psychologists etc so I'm
 

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:43.310
developmental psychologists etc so I'm
defining parenting in terms of the

01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320
defining parenting in terms of the
 

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.050
defining parenting in terms of the
measures that people are using there's

01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060
measures that people are using there's
 

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.880
measures that people are using there's
two major factors you know it's a warmth

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:46.890
two major factors you know it's a warmth
 

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:49.160
two major factors you know it's a warmth
dimension and a control discipline sort

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:49.170
dimension and a control discipline sort
 

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.800
dimension and a control discipline sort
of factor so we're just using measures

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:51.810
of factor so we're just using measures
 

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:55.660
of factor so we're just using measures
that other people use and call parenting

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:55.670
that other people use and call parenting
 

01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:59.959
that other people use and call parenting
so in terms of peers oh sorry did you

01:19:59.959 --> 01:19:59.969
so in terms of peers oh sorry did you
 

01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:02.390
so in terms of peers oh sorry did you
want to well I'd like just to add that

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400
want to well I'd like just to add that
 

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.669
want to well I'd like just to add that
there is no word in the English well

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679
there is no word in the English well
 

01:20:04.679 --> 01:20:06.770
there is no word in the English well
there is now but the word parenting

01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780
there is now but the word parenting
 

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.229
there is now but the word parenting
doesn't exist in fact there isn't a verb

01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239
doesn't exist in fact there isn't a verb
 

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.810
doesn't exist in fact there isn't a verb
to parent if you look back in the

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:11.820
to parent if you look back in the
 

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.729
to parent if you look back in the
English in the English dictionary in the

01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739
English in the English dictionary in the
 

01:20:13.739 --> 01:20:16.970
English in the English dictionary in the
past and actually it rather negates the

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980
past and actually it rather negates the
 

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.950
past and actually it rather negates the
meaning of a parent who is actually a

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960
meaning of a parent who is actually a
 

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.300
meaning of a parent who is actually a
man or a woman in an undeniable and

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:22.310

relationship with a child by reason of a
 

01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:28.370
relationship with a child by reason of a
biological fact and I think that I

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380
biological fact and I think that I
 

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.959
biological fact and I think that I
personally would want to call that

01:20:31.959 --> 01:20:31.969
personally would want to call that
 

01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:36.169
personally would want to call that
parental care and not parenting I often

01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:36.179
parental care and not parenting I often
 

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:39.290
parental care and not parenting I often
wonder why we don't blame the children

01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300
wonder why we don't blame the children
 

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:43.370
wonder why we don't blame the children
more and talk about offspring we're all

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380
more and talk about offspring we're all
 

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.860
more and talk about offspring we're all
here worrying about this what are they

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:45.870
here worrying about this what are they
 

01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.120
here worrying about this what are they
doing what are they thinking about are

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:47.130
doing what are they thinking about are
 

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:50.090
doing what are they thinking about are
they having their own debates that's a

01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100
they having their own debates that's a
 

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.100
they having their own debates that's a
lovely definition thank you can you talk

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:52.110
lovely definition thank you can you talk
 

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:54.110
lovely definition thank you can you talk
I will I will call back back and forth

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120
I will I will call back back and forth
 

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.450
I will I will call back back and forth
can you talk about peers yeah I think

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460
can you talk about peers yeah I think
 

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.240
can you talk about peers yeah I think
yeah you know this great topic peers

01:20:59.240 --> 01:20:59.250
yeah you know this great topic peers
 

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.040
yeah you know this great topic peers
it's interesting how much we focused on

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:01.050
it's interesting how much we focused on
 

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.959
it's interesting how much we focused on
the family but if the environmental

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:02.969
the family but if the environmental
 

01:21:02.969 --> 01:21:04.520
the family but if the environmental
influences are those that make kids in a

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:04.530
influences are those that make kids in a
 

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:07.700
influences are those that make kids in a
family different then as Judith mr.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:07.710
family different then as Judith mr.
 

01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:09.200

Harris said a long time ago why aren't

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:09.210
Harris said a long time ago why aren't
 

01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:11.060
Harris said a long time ago why aren't
we studying things outside the family

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.070
we studying things outside the family
 

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:13.370
we studying things outside the family
beginning with peers but this happens to

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380
beginning with peers but this happens to
 

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:17.750

be a debate on parenting it's important

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760
be a debate on parenting it's important
 

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.910
be a debate on parenting it's important
I think it's important to note that just

01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920
I think it's important to note that just
 

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.090
I think it's important to note that just
to say again if it wasn't clear that the

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100
to say again if it wasn't clear that the
 

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.729
to say again if it wasn't clear that the
environment we're talking about it's not

01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739
environment we're talking about it's not
 

01:21:25.739 --> 01:21:26.870
environment we're talking about it's not
just parenting right there's there's

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880
just parenting right there's there's
 

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.280
just parenting right there's there's
what we call the shared environment so

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:28.290
what we call the shared environment so
 

01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:28.790
what we call the shared environment so
what makes

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800
what makes
 

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.200
what makes

in the same family similar to each other

in the same family similar to each other
and what we call the non-shared

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:31.230
and what we call the non-shared

and as Rover said there are some traits
that have larger effects than that so

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:52.790
that have larger effects than that so
 

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:55.330
that have larger effects than that so
things like education has a larger

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:55.340
things like education has a larger
 

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:57.760
things like education has a larger
shared environmental effect than than

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:57.770
shared environmental effect than than
 

01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:59.920
shared environmental effect than than
something like intelligence or or or

01:28:59.920 --> 01:28:59.930
something like intelligence or or or
 

01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.380
something like intelligence or or or
height or something like that or or

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:02.390
height or something like that or or
 

01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:04.420
height or something like that or or
indeed psychopathology yeah lovely but

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:04.430

01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:07.120

we've got 5% do you want to give a

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:07.130
we've got 5% do you want to give a
 

01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:09.640
we've got 5% do you want to give a
number I'm afraid you're not going to

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:09.650
number I'm afraid you're not going to
 

01:29:09.650 --> 01:29:12.040
number I'm afraid you're not going to
get a number out of me I think it's the

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.050
get a number out of me I think it's the
 

01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:14.800
get a number out of me I think it's the
false dichotomy I go I mean obviously

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:14.810
false dichotomy I go I mean obviously
 

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:18.310
false dichotomy I go I mean obviously
genetics is important and only it

01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320
genetics is important and only it
 

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.100
genetics is important and only it
accounts for a lot but I think that of

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:21.110
accounts for a lot but I think that of
 

01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:24.220
accounts for a lot but I think that of
course parenting the the epigenetic

01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:27.160
course parenting the the epigenetic
effect is affecting the gene so I don't

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:27.170
effect is affecting the gene so I don't
 

01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:29.410
effect is affecting the gene so I don't
think that we can quite I can give you a

think that we can quite I can give you a
 

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.020
think that we can quite I can give you a

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:32.030

01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.700

for number n well yeah I mean I would

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:33.710
for number n well yeah I mean I would
 

01:29:33.710 --> 01:29:35.710

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.390
save just the opposite I would say that
I would say parenting accounts for

01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400
I would say parenting accounts for
 

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.700
I would say parenting accounts for
probably huge a percentage or I put it

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:39.710
probably huge a percentage or I put it
 

01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:41.710
probably huge a percentage or I put it

chips off the old block and what you

01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:51.460
chips off the old block and what you
 

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.430
chips off the old block and what you
need to recognize is that your children

01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440
need to recognize is that your children
 

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.740
need to recognize is that your children
are different genetically from you and

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:55.750
are different genetically from you and
 

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.930
are different genetically from you and

and I don't think it can be called it
 

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.430
and I don't think it can be called it
can be called parenting in the same way

01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440
can be called parenting in the same way
 

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.709

that things like you know how you set

01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719
that things like you know how you set

boundaries and rules and so on and this
 

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.500
boundaries and rules and so on and this
is the sort of thing you get in

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:19.510
is the sort of thing you get in
 

01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:21.570
is the sort of thing you get in
parenting advice and if one if one of

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:21.580
parenting advice and if one if one of
 

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.180
parenting advice and if one if one of
the strongest things I've mmm I would

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:24.190
the strongest things I've mmm I would
 

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:25.080
the strongest things I've mmm I would
argue tonight is that all that stuff

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.090
argue tonight is that all that stuff
 

01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:27.150
argue tonight is that all that stuff
about parenting advice it's probably not

01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:27.160
about parenting advice it's probably not
 

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.650
about parenting advice it's probably not
really helping or making much of a

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:28.660
really helping or making much of a
 

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.910
really helping or making much of a
difference there's some good ideas in

01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920
difference there's some good ideas in
 

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.620
difference there's some good ideas in
there that you might want to try there's

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:31.630
there that you might want to try there's
 

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:32.610
there that you might want to try there's
nothing to make a huge difference the

01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:32.620
nothing to make a huge difference the
 

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.780
nothing to make a huge difference the
way your kid turns out in terms of their

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:33.790
way your kid turns out in terms of their
 

01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:35.790
way your kid turns out in terms of their
intelligence and their their personality

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800
intelligence and their their personality
 

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.010
intelligence and their their personality
and then I'll just chuck in one very

01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:38.020
and then I'll just chuck in one very
 

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.510
and then I'll just chuck in one very
brief point which is that if people are

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520
brief point which is that if people are
 

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.240
brief point which is that if people are
parenting their children and differently

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:42.250
parenting their children and differently
 

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:43.740
parenting their children and differently
you know we talk about you know it's not

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:43.750
you know we talk about you know it's not
 

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:46.020
you know we talk about you know it's not
just that the same parenting occurs to

01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:46.030
just that the same parenting occurs to
 

01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:47.340
just that the same parenting occurs to
every child and every child it screams

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:47.350
every child and every child it screams
 

01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:49.020
every child and every child it screams
to the same parenting that completely

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:49.030
to the same parenting that completely
 

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:51.030
to the same parenting that completely
undermines all these parenting books

01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040
undermines all these parenting books
 

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.320
undermines all these parenting books
that give you advice on how to treat

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:52.330
that give you advice on how to treat
 

01:31:52.330 --> 01:31:53.910
that give you advice on how to treat
your kids right these give general

01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920
your kids right these give general
 

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.620
your kids right these give general
advice but if you're treating your kids

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:55.630
advice but if you're treating your kids
 

01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:57.630
advice but if you're treating your kids
if every every child individually then

01:31:57.630 --> 01:31:57.640
if every every child individually then
 

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.860
if every every child individually then
that can put them domains all that way

01:31:58.860 --> 01:31:58.870
that can put them domains all that way
 

01:31:58.870 --> 01:32:01.620
that can put them domains all that way
so it's it's all of it it's all a bit of

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:01.630
so it's it's all of it it's all a bit of
 

01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:11.000
so it's it's all of it it's all a bit of
a disaster we won't end on that okay

to the person who asked the question
 

01:32:13.239 --> 01:32:19.049
to the person who asked the question
about parenting in the prenatal and in

01:32:19.049 --> 01:32:19.059
about parenting in the prenatal and in
 

01:32:19.059 --> 01:32:22.410
about parenting in the prenatal and in
the prenatal life it goes back to my

01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:22.420
the prenatal life it goes back to my
 

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.479
the prenatal life it goes back to my
question my answer about what is

01:32:24.479 --> 01:32:24.489
question my answer about what is
 

01:32:24.489 --> 01:32:26.910
question my answer about what is
parenting and if we go to what is a

01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920
parenting and if we go to what is a
 

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.899
parenting and if we go to what is a
parent and parental care then this is

01:32:30.899 --> 01:32:30.909
parent and parental care then this is
 

01:32:30.909 --> 01:32:34.500
parent and parental care then this is
about a relationship with your child and

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:34.510
about a relationship with your child and
 

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:37.200
