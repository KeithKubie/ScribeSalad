00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.590
So, probably the last place that you think
about hope and optimism existing is in prison,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.000
but in the last ten years of working there
I've come to realize that all humans possess

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
these things—they just need a little coaxing
sometimes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In June 2006 The Actors' Gang Theater Company
started an experiment: we decided to take

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Sunday night workshop we do with our whole
company into prison to work with non-actors,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to see what kind of effect our style of theater
would have on them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.080
So the style of theater we work in is a really
bastardized version of the Italian tradition

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.080
of Commedia Dell’Arte.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.440
It's masks, white-face, high emotional, physical
work, so we call it the “style.”

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.910
We took that workshop program into prison
and were absolutely astounded by the effect

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.910
it had on these non-actors and how it started
to help them be able to heal their trauma.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.910
We've seen this approach transform prison
yards, we've seen it break down barriers of

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.110
race and separation, and that has happened
through the courage of these people, picking

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.939
up the tools that we've offered them and using
those tools to transform their emotional lives,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
and they found a safe space in our work to
be able to do that.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.520
And as a result we have a ten percent recidivism
rate and an 89 percent drop in in-prison infractions

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.640
because these people now know how to deal
with their emotions.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.750
So amazingly, this little engine that could,
after ten years is now in ten prisons across

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.810
California, and for me the thing that makes
me so proud is that any day of the week there

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.520
will be a student-led program happening in
a prison.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.270
Like right now, there's a program happening
in the prison that's led by our students,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.750
and we go and check in and support them every
six weeks.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.463
Apart from the reentry programs that we have,
which is now run by one of our former students—we

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:05.829
employed him the day he paroled, to run that
reentry program—we are also creating a program

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.100
for correctional officers, who are often as
traumatized as the people that they are overseeing.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.100
It's the highest suicide rate of any job.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.030
The real secret of this work, for those of
us who are lucky enough to do it, is that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.860
we get as much, if not more, from the experience.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.549
One of our juvie girls told me the other day,
when people come and work with us she always

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.549
thinks to herself, “Take off your cape,”
and this has become out motto now.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070
Take off your cape, because we're not in the
business of saving people.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.220
We're going in and offering them tools that
we know work and as a result changing our

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.220
own lives.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.870
I've definitely become a better person and
a better actor, and these people have literally

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.870
changed my life.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.400
So I'm really honored to introduce the stars
of this work: the people.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
I mean it was an idea, right?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.530
I had an idea ten years ago; a lot of people
have ideas.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.360
It doesn't really mean anything unless people
make it happen, and these are the people that

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
made that happen.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.110
So I'd like to start off by introducing Chris
Bingley.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.110
Chris Bingley: Hello.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.110
Good afternoon everyone.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.110
I'm Chris Bingley.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.470
As Sabra said I returned to the community
last Friday from a 12-year prison sentence.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.560
Most of my time—honestly there's not a whole
lot of programs inside of California prisons—so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.560
I just kind of sat around and kind of read
books and tried to better myself on my own.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.220
But towards the end of my sentence—I think
I've been doing The Actors' Gang for about

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.600
five years—the Prison Project came in and
it gave me a lot of tools.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.299
It gave me a lot of tools to deal with prison,
to deal with myself, and now that I'm out

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.090
here it's given me a lot of tools that I'm
using out here as well.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.939
I'm using those tools with my family, at my
job, just everywhere I go.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.378
So just to explain what got me into prison
is pretty much not knowing how to manage my

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:23.378
own emotions.

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:28.579
I was angry growing up and I kept a lot of
that stuff inside of me, and I found people

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.169
that were angry just like I was, and we did
angry things and that's what led me to prison.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:39.389
Getting involved in with work it helped me
to be able to express my emotions, something

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.790
that I was never taught to do.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.629
I just, like I said, kept everything inside
of me, so what this work did is it created

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.840
a safe place for me to be able to express
myself no matter what, without judgment, whether

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.439
it be happy, sad, angry or fear, because are
the four emotions that we deal with.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.340
And it gave me a chance to exorcise those
emotions that were inside of me that I was

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.739
so used to just constantly pushing down and
that I was used to just acting out.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.579
So this work gave me a lot of tools to learn
how to manage my emotions.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.769
Not only that but all kinds of stuff, from
becoming a team player to supporting—we

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.082
always say in The Actors' Gang, “Support
your brother, or support the other actor that's

00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:10.082
onstage with you.”

00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:16.340
Before being involved in this kind of work
I was kind of like a selfish person, just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.420
all by myself, so it just taught me to be
more human, to be able to look in another

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.420
person's eyes and express an emotion, you
know, and be able to identify with the next

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.420
person.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.420
So this work is great and I know it's doing
a lot for people inside.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.420
As Sabra said it's breaking down a lot of
barriers.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.420
People that would normally want to fight each
other and want to stab each other, they're

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.939
friends in there because this work, it builds
a bridge between different races, between

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.559
different gangs, all that stuff, and we can
relate to each other because of this work.
