issue of global sustainability it was

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
issue of global sustainability it was
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039
issue of global sustainability it was
pretty clear to us that the school

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
pretty clear to us that the school
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050

environmental science and ecology in
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660
environmental science and ecology in
very fundamental ways and we needed

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
very fundamental ways and we needed
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850
very fundamental ways and we needed
something that was above Department and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
something that was above Department and
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800
something that was above Department and
above schools to be the integrative

above schools to be the integrative
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899
above schools to be the integrative
force and that was the Earth Institute

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
force and that was the Earth Institute
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890
get heavily involved in education the
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.250
get heavily involved in education the
Earth Institute has started over half a

dozen new education programs in the last
 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.350
dozen new education programs in the last
two years for example we started an

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360
two years for example we started an
 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.150
two years for example we started an
undergraduate major in sustainable

development the Masters of science and
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.680
development the Masters of science and
sustainability management earlier we

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
sustainability management earlier we
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.690
sustainability management earlier we
started the MPA and development practice

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700
started the MPA and development practice
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.400
started the MPA and development practice
the MPA and environmental science and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
the MPA and environmental science and
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.830
the MPA and environmental science and
policy the Masters in climate society

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
policy the Masters in climate society
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.780
policy the Masters in climate society
and of course the PhD in sustainable

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
and of course the PhD in sustainable
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.440
and of course the PhD in sustainable
development so this is a very unique

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450
development so this is a very unique
 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.500

higher education and really a very

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560
higher education and really a very
 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.850
higher education and really a very
exciting place to be and so a few years

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860
exciting place to be and so a few years
 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.140
exciting place to be and so a few years
ago the some people started to ask me

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150
ago the some people started to ask me
 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.230

well is sustainable development feasible

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240
well is sustainable development feasible
 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.480
well is sustainable development feasible
and there was a whole project of us

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490
and there was a whole project of us
 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.219
and there was a whole project of us
trying to work on that and I decided

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229
trying to work on that and I decided
 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.290
trying to work on that and I decided
halfway to the project even though the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300
halfway to the project even though the
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.779
halfway to the project even though the
that project didn't really resolve

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789
that project didn't really resolve
 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.029
that project didn't really resolve
itself successfully that we really have

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039
itself successfully that we really have
 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.800
itself successfully that we really have
no choice but make it feasible

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
no choice but make it feasible
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.450
no choice but make it feasible
it's either either sustainable

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
it's either either sustainable
 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.129
it's either either sustainable
development feasible or we're all dead

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139
development feasible or we're all dead
 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.379
development feasible or we're all dead
and so I have this belief that our

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389
and so I have this belief that our
 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.050
and so I have this belief that our
species is not suicidal it's just a

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060
species is not suicidal it's just a
 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.939
species is not suicidal it's just a
belief but I really think it's true and

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949
belief but I really think it's true and
 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.640
belief but I really think it's true and
so I decided to conceptualize

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
so I decided to conceptualize
 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.520
so I decided to conceptualize
sustainability as a management issue not

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530
sustainability as a management issue not
 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.790
sustainability as a management issue not
as an issue of necessarily of policy or

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800
as an issue of necessarily of policy or
 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.980
as an issue of necessarily of policy or
anything else but to really think about

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990
anything else but to really think about
 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.170
anything else but to really think about
what kind of human activities are

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180
what kind of human activities are
 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.180
what kind of human activities are
necessary if we're going to get to

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190
necessary if we're going to get to
 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.179
necessary if we're going to get to
sustainability so I'm gonna try to go

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189
sustainability so I'm gonna try to go
 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.709
sustainability so I'm gonna try to go
through this is my new book I'm going to

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719
through this is my new book I'm going to
 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.360
through this is my new book I'm going to
go through this rather quickly so that

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
go through this rather quickly so that
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.909
go through this rather quickly so that
we have some time for a discussion so

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919
we have some time for a discussion so
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.010
we have some time for a discussion so
this is the Express train version of my

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020
this is the Express train version of my
 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.890
this is the Express train version of my
book talk ok so what's the goal of

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900
book talk ok so what's the goal of
 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.309
book talk ok so what's the goal of
sustainability management I'm trying to

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319
sustainability management I'm trying to
 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.240
sustainability management I'm trying to
figure out how organizations can

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250
figure out how organizations can
 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.019
figure out how organizations can
contribute to global sustainability to

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029
contribute to global sustainability to
 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.459
contribute to global sustainability to
answer the question can we grow our

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469
answer the question can we grow our
 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.499
answer the question can we grow our
world economy and open up opportunity

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509
world economy and open up opportunity
 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.809
world economy and open up opportunity
the pores the pores and manage to keep

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819
the pores the pores and manage to keep
 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.809
the pores the pores and manage to keep
the planet intact and here's the problem

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819
the planet intact and here's the problem
 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.119
the planet intact and here's the problem
7 billion people on the planet now

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129
7 billion people on the planet now
 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.689
7 billion people on the planet now
probably growing to 10 billion China and

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699
probably growing to 10 billion China and
 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.809
probably growing to 10 billion China and
India and eventually Africa are going to

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819
India and eventually Africa are going to
 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.519
India and eventually Africa are going to
consume as much as the rest of us do

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529
consume as much as the rest of us do
 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.550
consume as much as the rest of us do
today so how do we keep the planet

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560
today so how do we keep the planet
 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.350
today so how do we keep the planet
intact with that level of consumption

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360
intact with that level of consumption
 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.059
intact with that level of consumption
now there are some people who think you

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069
now there are some people who think you
 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.409
now there are some people who think you
don't have to get to that level of

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419
don't have to get to that level of
 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.540
don't have to get to that level of
consumption but I'm a political

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
consumption but I'm a political
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.890
consumption but I'm a political
scientist and I can tell you that

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900
scientist and I can tell you that
 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.589
scientist and I can tell you that
everybody in the world wants what we

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599
everybody in the world wants what we
 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.589
everybody in the world wants what we
have they want the cars they want the

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599
have they want the cars they want the
 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.510
have they want the cars they want the
iPods they want the laptops they want

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520
iPods they want the laptops they want
 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.100
iPods they want the laptops they want
the air conditioning they want the wine

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110
the air conditioning they want the wine
 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.279
the air conditioning they want the wine
and they're gonna get it one way or the

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289
and they're gonna get it one way or the
 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.480
and they're gonna get it one way or the
other either they're going to take it

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490
other either they're going to take it
 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.219
other either they're going to take it
from you or we're going to figure out

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229
from you or we're going to figure out
 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.540
from you or we're going to figure out
some way of

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550
some way of
 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.640
some way of
of bringing it about in a peaceful way

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650
of bringing it about in a peaceful way
 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.890
of bringing it about in a peaceful way
so that's so my hope is that we actually

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900
so that's so my hope is that we actually
 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.620
so that's so my hope is that we actually
figure out a way to do this so the idea

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630
figure out a way to do this so the idea
 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.720
figure out a way to do this so the idea
behind the book is to survey the concept

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730
behind the book is to survey the concept
 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.900
behind the book is to survey the concept
of sustainability and then think about

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910
of sustainability and then think about
 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.600
of sustainability and then think about
the different arenas of organizations

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610
the different arenas of organizations
 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.880
the different arenas of organizations
and then of the issue of energy water

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890
and then of the issue of energy water
 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.730
and then of the issue of energy water
food and then move up several units of

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740
food and then move up several units of
 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.830
food and then move up several units of
analysis to cities as integrative

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840
analysis to cities as integrative
 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.310
analysis to cities as integrative
systems and planning I basically look at

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320
systems and planning I basically look at
 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.710
systems and planning I basically look at
each of those issues and say what are

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720
each of those issues and say what are
 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.080
each of those issues and say what are
the technological challenges is what

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090
the technological challenges is what
 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.340
the technological challenges is what
don't we know yet what are the financial

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350
don't we know yet what are the financial
 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.360
don't we know yet what are the financial
organizational and management challenges

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370
organizational and management challenges
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.850
organizational and management challenges
how do we get the capital one of the

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860
how do we get the capital one of the
 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.230
how do we get the capital one of the
issues that I'm always worried about is

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240
issues that I'm always worried about is
 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.670
issues that I'm always worried about is
how do we get people who were in

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680
how do we get people who were in
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.260
how do we get people who were in
organizations to know how to do these

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270
organizations to know how to do these
 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.080
organizations to know how to do these
things you know we might develop all

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090
things you know we might develop all
 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.720
things you know we might develop all
sorts of technology and all sorts of

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730
sorts of technology and all sorts of
 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.390
sorts of technology and all sorts of
methods but in the end it's a human

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400
methods but in the end it's a human
 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.130

these things happen and and my my focus

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760
these things happen and and my my focus
 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.220
these things happen and and my my focus
on management it really comes out of my

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230
on management it really comes out of my
 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.810
on management it really comes out of my
time at EPA when I worked in the

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820
time at EPA when I worked in the
 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.270

underground storage tank program in

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280
underground storage tank program in
 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.860
underground storage tank program in
America at 1985 40% of every underground

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870

storage tank for gasoline was leaking

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120
storage tank for gasoline was leaking
 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.590
storage tank for gasoline was leaking
we're now down to about 8% but you know

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:51.600
we're now down to about 8% but you know
 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.770
we're now down to about 8% but you know
it's one thing for a waste to to escape

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780
it's one thing for a waste to to escape
 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.600
it's one thing for a waste to to escape
into the environment but this is the

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610
into the environment but this is the
 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.450
into the environment but this is the
stuff they sell okay and they know how

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460
stuff they sell okay and they know how
 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.850
stuff they sell okay and they know how
to keep the gasoline inside the

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860
to keep the gasoline inside the
 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.560
to keep the gasoline inside the
underground tanks there's lots of

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.570
underground tanks there's lots of
 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.350
underground tanks there's lots of
technology for that so why don't they

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360
technology for that so why don't they
 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.990
technology for that so why don't they
use it and I mean some of it the answer

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000
use it and I mean some of it the answer
 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.090
use it and I mean some of it the answer
is economics the gasoline is just too

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.100
is economics the gasoline is just too
 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.830
is economics the gasoline is just too
cheap but some of it is basically

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840
cheap but some of it is basically
 

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.080
cheap but some of it is basically

productivity was the fact they were
 

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.019
productivity was the fact they were
being observed and so that creates a

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.029
being observed and so that creates a
 

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:39.510

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519
environmental movement that somehow we
 

00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:09.190
environmental movement that somehow we
should live close to nature and spread

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200
should live close to nature and spread
 

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.289
should live close to nature and spread
out among the planet if we did that we

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:11.299
out among the planet if we did that we
 

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:13.509
out among the planet if we did that we
would destroy the planet in fact the

00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519
would destroy the planet in fact the
 

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:15.279
would destroy the planet in fact the
answer to sustainability is greater

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:15.289
answer to sustainability is greater
 

00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:17.889
answer to sustainability is greater
concentrations of populations so you can

00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:17.899
concentrations of populations so you can
 

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.570
concentrations of populations so you can
build infrastructure to contain their

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:19.580
build infrastructure to contain their
 

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.430
build infrastructure to contain their
waste and to make them more energy and

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440
waste and to make them more energy and
 

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.450
waste and to make them more energy and
water efficient and so in fact I don't

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:25.460
water efficient and so in fact I don't
 

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.070
water efficient and so in fact I don't
think I want to restart now maybe I'll

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080
think I want to restart now maybe I'll
 

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.399
think I want to restart now maybe I'll
restart later ok so we hit so we we need

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:36.409
restart later ok so we hit so we we need
 

00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:38.529
restart later ok so we hit so we we need
concentrations and we and cities are in

00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:38.539
concentrations and we and cities are in
 

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:41.200
concentrations and we and cities are in
fact places where sustainability will

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.210
fact places where sustainability will
 

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:46.960
fact places where sustainability will

all that will ultimately make cities

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200
all that will ultimately make cities
 

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.599
all that will ultimately make cities
even more inhabitable than they are

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:55.609
even more inhabitable than they are
 

00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:57.580
even more inhabitable than they are
today now again this is a particularly

starting to see some of the benefits of
 

00:31:16.849 --> 00:31:22.149
starting to see some of the benefits of
living in cities obviously we're going

00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159
living in cities obviously we're going
 

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:23.619
living in cities obviously we're going
to need to make the energy system more

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:23.629
to need to make the energy system more

and we need the capital to do that the

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:32.989
and we need the capital to do that the

problem in America is Americans are

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.210
problem in America is Americans are
 

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.460
problem in America is Americans are
under tax but they think they're

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:36.470
under tax but they think they're
 

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.739
under tax but they think they're
overtaxed and so how we're going to

00:31:38.739 --> 00:31:38.749
overtaxed and so how we're going to
 

00:31:38.749 --> 00:31:40.810
overtaxed and so how we're going to
solve that problem is not something I'm

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:40.820
solve that problem is not something I'm
 

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.119
solve that problem is not something I'm
going to get into today but there is a

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:43.129
going to get into today but there is a
 

00:31:43.129 --> 00:31:47.460
going to get into today but there is a
there is a problem with that and then

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:47.470
there is a problem with that and then
 

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.700
there is a problem with that and then
for the whole planet part of it is we

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:51.710
for the whole planet part of it is we
 

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.080
for the whole planet part of it is we

question it's gonna the world is getting
 

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.520
question it's gonna the world is getting
more complicated the technology and the

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:07.530
more complicated the technology and the
 

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.290
more complicated the technology and the

greater and that's basically what my

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080
greater and that's basically what my
 

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.650
greater and that's basically what my
book talks about is how do we create

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:14.660

sustainability managers the key
technological challenge I think is

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:19.920
technological challenge I think is
 

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.420
technological challenge I think is
energy the key financial challenge is

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:22.430
energy the key financial challenge is
 

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.500
energy the key financial challenge is
funding the capital cost of the

term tangible impacts have more effect
and more political strength I mean this

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080
and more political strength I mean this
 

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.210
and more political strength I mean this
is the problem with an issue like

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220
is the problem with an issue like
 

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.610
is the problem with an issue like
climate climate is a problem that's

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620
climate climate is a problem that's
 

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.920
climate climate is a problem that's
created everywhere and it's impacts are

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:42.930
created everywhere and it's impacts are
 

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.830
created everywhere and it's impacts are
in the future so politically it's

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840
in the future so politically it's
 

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.780
in the future so politically it's
probably the worst case scenario if you

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:47.790
probably the worst case scenario if you
 

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.730
probably the worst case scenario if you
want to actually make something happen

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740
want to actually make something happen
 

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.160
want to actually make something happen
and you take something like toxic waste

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.170
and you take something like toxic waste
 

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.160
and you take something like toxic waste
toxic waste happens locally it affects

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.170
toxic waste happens locally it affects
 

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.960
toxic waste happens locally it affects
people locally it's not hard to get

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:56.970
people locally it's not hard to get
 

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.610

okay those kinds of environmental issues

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:00.990
okay those kinds of environmental issues
 

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.740
okay those kinds of environmental issues
are very easy to get people to act on

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:03.750
are very easy to get people to act on

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:50.690
raised three hundred fifty million
 

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.610
raised three hundred fifty million
dollars from the internet in

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:53.620
dollars from the internet in
 

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.770
dollars from the internet in
contributions of $50 or less never been

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:56.780
contributions of $50 or less never been
 

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.600
contributions of $50 or less never been
done before

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:57.610
done before
 

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.250
done before
totally overwhelmed the corporate money

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.260
totally overwhelmed the corporate money
 

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.100
totally overwhelmed the corporate money
at that point and totally surprised

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:03.110
at that point and totally surprised
 

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.670
at that point and totally surprised
everybody so we're seeing some so that's

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680
everybody so we're seeing some so that's
 

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.100
everybody so we're seeing some so that's
that technology is having a political

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.110
that technology is having a political
 

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.960
that technology is having a political
impact that we can't really predict

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:10.970
impact that we can't really predict
 

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:47.440
impact that we can't really predict
right now well here's the fundamental I

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:47.450
right now well here's the fundamental I
 

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.760
right now well here's the fundamental I
guess the way I would put it and

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:48.770
guess the way I would put it and
 

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.610
guess the way I would put it and
actually you know what Moore's law is on

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:51.620
actually you know what Moore's law is on
 

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.190
actually you know what Moore's law is on
computers that every 18 months you know

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200
computers that every 18 months you know
 

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.140
computers that every 18 months you know
that basically you're on a cost curve so

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.150
that basically you're on a cost curve so
 

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.780
that basically you're on a cost curve so
that the power the computer gets greater

00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:58.790
that the power the computer gets greater
 

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.230
that the power the computer gets greater
and the price goes down well technology

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240
and the price goes down well technology
 

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.560
and the price goes down well technology
has can have that impact if the cost of

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:05.570
has can have that impact if the cost of
 

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.830
has can have that impact if the cost of
raw materials is not central to the cost

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:08.840
raw materials is not central to the cost
 

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.530
raw materials is not central to the cost
calculus and so solar power will

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:14.540
calculus and so solar power will
 

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.540
calculus and so solar power will
eventually I don't know what eventually

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:16.550
eventually I don't know what eventually
 

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.730
eventually I don't know what eventually
will take place but will eventually be

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:18.740
will take place but will eventually be
 

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.280
will take place but will eventually be
cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.290
cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels
 

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.370
cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels
and generating electricity just because

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:24.380
and generating electricity just because
 

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.270
and generating electricity just because
the price of the basic fuel is free okay

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280
the price of the basic fuel is free okay
 

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.970
the price of the basic fuel is free okay
meaning the Sun so just a question of

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:30.980
meaning the Sun so just a question of
 

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.590
meaning the Sun so just a question of
the technological development of the

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:32.600
the technological development of the
 

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.690
the technological development of the
solar cell and the battery and the

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:34.700
solar cell and the battery and the
 

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.050
solar cell and the battery and the
distribution system so if you have

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:37.060
distribution system so if you have
 

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.790
distribution system so if you have
better distribution through a smart grid

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800
better distribution through a smart grid
 

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.740
better distribution through a smart grid
you have a more efficient solar cell and

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:41.750
you have a more efficient solar cell and
 

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.990
you have a more efficient solar cell and
you have a more efficient battery system

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000
you have a more efficient battery system
 

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.240
you have a more efficient battery system
but to store the energy if you have all

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.250
but to store the energy if you have all
 

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.610
but to store the energy if you have all
those things and again I'm not a

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:47.620
those things and again I'm not a
 

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.680
those things and again I'm not a
scientist I'm a political scientist but

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:50.690
scientist I'm a political scientist but
 

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.600
scientist I'm a political scientist but
I'm told by the people here who do that

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:52.610
I'm told by the people here who do that
 

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.910
I'm told by the people here who do that
work like Vijay Modi that in fact the

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920
work like Vijay Modi that in fact the
 

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.710
work like Vijay Modi that in fact the
cost curve is get the solar power is

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720
cost curve is get the solar power is
 

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:56.980
cost curve is get the solar power is
getting

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:56.990
getting
 

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.920
getting
less expensive from coming out of solar

00:43:59.920 --> 00:43:59.930
less expensive from coming out of solar
 

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.280
less expensive from coming out of solar
cells that that it's a question of

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.290
cells that that it's a question of
 

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.330
cells that that it's a question of
technological development so that

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:04.340
technological development so that
 

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.490
technological development so that
technology will develop now in the case

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:06.500
technology will develop now in the case
 

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.020
technology will develop now in the case
of fossil fuel extraction there's also

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.030
of fossil fuel extraction there's also
 

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.210
of fossil fuel extraction there's also
been technological development okay

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:10.220
been technological development okay
 

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.060
been technological development okay
and so you are able to get to fuels you

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.070
and so you are able to get to fuels you
 

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.330
and so you are able to get to fuels you
couldn't get to before okay one of the

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:16.340
couldn't get to before okay one of the
 

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.890
couldn't get to before okay one of the
problems with some of it is that some of

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:17.900
problems with some of it is that some of
 

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.750
problems with some of it is that some of
its creating more ecological impact than

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760
its creating more ecological impact than
 

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.480
its creating more ecological impact than
before so we had the Gulf oil spill we

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:22.490
before so we had the Gulf oil spill we
 

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.010
before so we had the Gulf oil spill we
also have things like hydro fracking

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:24.020
also have things like hydro fracking
 

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.230
also have things like hydro fracking
here or mountaintop removal good

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240
here or mountaintop removal good
 

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.330
here or mountaintop removal good
technologies but not exactly good for

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:28.340
technologies but not exactly good for
 

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:28.900
technologies but not exactly good for
the planet

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:28.910
the planet
 

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.170
the planet
so the the true cost of that energy

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:32.180
so the the true cost of that energy
 

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.150
so the the true cost of that energy
production is not reflected in the cost

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160
production is not reflected in the cost
 

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.470
production is not reflected in the cost
of the energy okay so and solar has some

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480
of the energy okay so and solar has some
 

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.270
of the energy okay so and solar has some
problems with the cells themselves are

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280
problems with the cells themselves are
 

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.850
problems with the cells themselves are
toxic and so you're gonna have to create

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:42.860
toxic and so you're gonna have to create
 

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.040
toxic and so you're gonna have to create
over time not just a more efficient

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.050
over time not just a more efficient
 

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.800
over time not just a more efficient
solar cell but a less toxic solar so but

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:47.810
solar cell but a less toxic solar so but
 

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:50.590
solar cell but a less toxic solar so but
again human ingenuity can go to work on

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:50.600
again human ingenuity can go to work on
 

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.810
again human ingenuity can go to work on
that problem we can't go to work on the

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:52.820
that problem we can't go to work on the
 

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.120
that problem we can't go to work on the
problem of fossil fuels because it work

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.130
problem of fossil fuels because it work
 

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.640
problem of fossil fuels because it work
you know eventually we use them I mean I

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:57.650
you know eventually we use them I mean I
 

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:58.990
you know eventually we use them I mean I
actually think 100 years from now people

00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000
actually think 100 years from now people
 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.510
actually think 100 years from now people
are going to say you burn that stuff you

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520
are going to say you burn that stuff you
 

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.220
are going to say you burn that stuff you
could have used it for plastics for this

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.230
could have used it for plastics for this
 

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.510
could have used it for plastics for this
and that this and that in production

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520
and that this and that in production
 

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.910
and that this and that in production
instead you you burned it what was the

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920
instead you you burned it what was the
 

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.900
instead you you burned it what was the
matter with you people

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:07.910
matter with you people
 

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.630
matter with you people
now this is this is a valuable one-time

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640
now this is this is a valuable one-time
 

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.880
now this is this is a valuable one-time
resource of the creation of the planet

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:12.890
resource of the creation of the planet
 

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.770
resource of the creation of the planet
and even though if there's a lot of it

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:14.780
and even though if there's a lot of it
 

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.660
and even though if there's a lot of it
is that really the best use of it

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:16.670
is that really the best use of it
 

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.160
is that really the best use of it
particularly given issues like climate

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.170
particularly given issues like climate
 

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.960
particularly given issues like climate
change but even forget about climate

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:19.970
change but even forget about climate
 

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.910
change but even forget about climate
change just in terms of cost if we can

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920
change just in terms of cost if we can
 

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.290
change just in terms of cost if we can
come up with a lower cost way of

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:23.300
come up with a lower cost way of
 

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.330
come up with a lower cost way of
generating electricity why wouldn't we

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:25.340
generating electricity why wouldn't we
 

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.550
generating electricity why wouldn't we
do it I think we will I mean I actually

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:27.560
do it I think we will I mean I actually
 

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.220
do it I think we will I mean I actually
think I mean I wrote about that today in

The Huffington Post I actually talked

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:31.970
The Huffington Post I actually talked
 

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.320
The Huffington Post I actually talked
about the about Steve Jobs and that

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:35.330
about the about Steve Jobs and that

also talked about you know it's hard

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160
also talked about you know it's hard
 

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.470
also talked about you know it's hard
sometimes you don't want to use current

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480
sometimes you don't want to use current

biggest environmental problem we had in

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.290
biggest environmental problem we had in
 

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.190
biggest environmental problem we had in
New York City in 1905 was horse manure

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200
New York City in 1905 was horse manure
 

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.160
New York City in 1905 was horse manure
the city streets were loaded with it it

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.170
the city streets were loaded with it it
 

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.430
the city streets were loaded with it it
was just awful that we don't talk about

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440
was just awful that we don't talk about
 

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.690
was just awful that we don't talk about
that anymore because the internal

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:01.700
that anymore because the internal
 

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.300
that anymore because the internal
combustion engine a technology nobody

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:04.310
combustion engine a technology nobody
 

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.030

expected got rid of all the horses okay

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040
expected got rid of all the horses okay
 

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.550
expected got rid of all the horses okay
so we don't really know what the

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:09.560
so we don't really know what the
 

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.790
so we don't really know what the
technological futures

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800
technological futures
 

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.330
technological futures
look like but but a solution that

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:14.340
look like but but a solution that
 

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.880
look like but but a solution that
focuses on using raw materials that are

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:16.890
focuses on using raw materials that are
 

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.910
focuses on using raw materials that are
natural resources versus one that allows

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920
natural resources versus one that allows
 

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.360
natural resources versus one that allows
prices to go down because of Technology

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:23.370
prices to go down because of Technology
 

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:26.150
prices to go down because of Technology
and human ingenuity I think in the long

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160
and human ingenuity I think in the long
 

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.650
and human ingenuity I think in the long
run it can only go in one direction it

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660
run it can only go in one direction it
 

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.480
run it can only go in one direction it
might not be solely it could be a form

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:29.490
might not be solely it could be a form
 

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:31.310
might not be solely it could be a form
of nuclear that I mean you could create

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:31.320
of nuclear that I mean you could create
 

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.440
of nuclear that I mean you could create
a nuclear power that doesn't create a

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:33.450
a nuclear power that doesn't create a
 

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.660
a nuclear power that doesn't create a
waste and isn't doesn't create a bomb

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:35.670
waste and isn't doesn't create a bomb
 

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.300
waste and isn't doesn't create a bomb
that could that might be the answer I

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.310
that could that might be the answer I
 

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.520
that could that might be the answer I
mean we know that scientifically there's

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:40.530
mean we know that scientifically there's
 

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.010
mean we know that scientifically there's
infinite amounts of energy at the

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020
infinite amounts of energy at the
 

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.280
infinite amounts of energy at the
subatomic level so you know virtually

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:46.290
subatomic level so you know virtually
 

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.900
subatomic level so you know virtually
infinite the point is there are other

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:47.910
infinite the point is there are other
 

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.360
infinite the point is there are other
technological solutions and I think that

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.370
technological solutions and I think that
 

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:54.200
technological solutions and I think that
in the long run and again how long and

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:54.210
in the long run and again how long and
 

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.150
in the long run and again how long and
how much damage so are we talking about

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160
how much damage so are we talking about
 

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.230
how much damage so are we talking about
a hundred years we're talking about

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240
a hundred years we're talking about
 

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.090
a hundred years we're talking about
twenty years we talk about 50 years I

00:46:59.090 --> 00:46:59.100
twenty years we talk about 50 years I
 

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.960
twenty years we talk about 50 years I
think it's gonna happen but my colleague

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:02.970
think it's gonna happen but my colleague
 

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.420
think it's gonna happen but my colleague

we have to do everything and I don't
know if you guys get to meet class ok so

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:09.270
know if you guys get to meet class ok so

we did during the Stone Age
we use more wood for fuel today that

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260
we use more wood for fuel today that
 

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.470
we use more wood for fuel today that
when wood was the main form of fuel and

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480
when wood was the main form of fuel and
 

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.930
when wood was the main form of fuel and
we'll use all the coal and all the all

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940
we'll use all the coal and all the all
 

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.770
we'll use all the coal and all the all
the fossil fuels we can find for as long

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780
the fossil fuels we can find for as long
 

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.680
the fossil fuels we can find for as long
as we can find them and that's why he

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:27.690
as we can find them and that's why he
 

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.060
as we can find them and that's why he
wants to do carbon capture and storage

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:29.070
wants to do carbon capture and storage
 

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.580
wants to do carbon capture and storage
and he's working on that pretty hard I

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:31.590
and he's working on that pretty hard I
 

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.530
and he's working on that pretty hard I
don't disagree with that but I actually

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540
don't disagree with that but I actually
 

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.230
don't disagree with that but I actually
think that if you could find a cheap

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240
think that if you could find a cheap
 

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.840

Sun and it worked and and it could be
 

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.820
Sun and it worked and and it could be
distributed widely and you had a way to

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:43.830
distributed widely and you had a way to
 

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.340
distributed widely and you had a way to
store and distribute it that solves the

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:46.350
store and distribute it that solves the
 

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.480
store and distribute it that solves the
problem and it solves the problem

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:47.490
problem and it solves the problem
 

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.010
problem and it solves the problem
without a lot of other complicated

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020
without a lot of other complicated
 

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.110
without a lot of other complicated
technologies and when it gets to be

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:51.120
technologies and when it gets to be
 

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.510
technologies and when it gets to be
cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520
cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil
 

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.370
cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil
you probably won't use as much of that

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380
you probably won't use as much of that
 

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.820
you probably won't use as much of that
stuff maybe you won't use it at all but

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:57.830
stuff maybe you won't use it at all but
 

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.770
stuff maybe you won't use it at all but
Klaus is right about the fact that the

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780
Klaus is right about the fact that the
 

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:06.380
Klaus is right about the fact that the
technology overtime continues to always

technology overtime continues to always
 

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.880
technology overtime continues to always
use the old stuff even as you develop

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:07.890
use the old stuff even as you develop
 

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.400
use the old stuff even as you develop
