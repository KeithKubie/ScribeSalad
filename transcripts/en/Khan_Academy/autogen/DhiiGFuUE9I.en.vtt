00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.859
 Diana gets the dog 

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.582
 5 canine cookies for one frisbee catch 

00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:08.264
 and 3 canine cookies per grip on a ball. 

00:00:08.264 --> 00:00:10.072
 Sounds like a very bargain deal. 

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.144
 She plans to get the most 

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.765
 D dog cookies before latching a queue. 

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.248
 Okay, that sounds good. 

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.200
 The inequality graph below 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.860
 represents the set of all combinations, 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.080
 in which Diana takes F Frisbee and B balls, 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.772
 to get the most D cookies, 

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:30.148
 because at this point she reasonably starts to queue the tail. 

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:33.359
 According to the chart we'll look at in a second, 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.480
 what is the largest number of cookies, 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.714
 which Diana wants to get before queues? 

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:43.254
 In other words, how much is D? 

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:46.117
 Let's interpret this graph correctly. 

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.412
 If we look at the horizontal axis here, 

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:52.199
 this is F - the number of Frisbee, 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.177
 the number of Frisbee she catches. 

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.671
 The number of balls is a vertical axis. 

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:05.671
 The number of balls she catches. 

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:09.773
 And we know what the total number of cookies is. 

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:13.329
 If she grabs F on Frisbee, 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.767
 will receive 5 cookies for each, 

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:18.875
 so cookies in the Frisbee are 5F. 

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.025
 If she catches B in number of balls, 

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.575
 or bring B balls if she catches those B balls, 

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.628
 will get ... how many were they? Three? 

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:30.273
 Three ball cookies? Yes! 

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:32.793
 Three canine cookies to capture each ball. 

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:38.045
 The B balls are 3B. 

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.700
 So the total number of cookies, 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.260
 which she receives is 5F plus 3B. 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 This is the number of Frisbee cookies, 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.440
 and this is the number of balls cookies. 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.260
 Now we can see all the allowed combinations here 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.940
 of the number of Frisbee and number of balls. 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.383
 For example, at this point here - 8, 

00:01:58.383 --> 00:02:00.282
 i. if you catch or bring 8 balls, 

00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:02.569
 and catch ... it will be half a frisbee, 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.108
 so this does not seem meaningful. 

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:10.100
 But if he brings 8 balls and grabs 1 frisbee ... 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.220
 Ok, that's it .. 

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:13.807
 It still does not reach 

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:16.500
 the maximum number of cookies. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.675
 How do I find the maximum number of cookies? 

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:20.827
 The maximum number of cookies 

00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:22.596
 is at each of these points, 

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.500
 who find themselves in the right, and notes that decisions, 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.533
 where all the points that meet this inequality lie, 

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:28.953
 are all under this right, 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.180
 so it reaches the maximum when it is on the right 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.798
 and the easiest one might be this point here, 

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:41.288
 where we see that the Frisbee is zero and we have 10 balls, 

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:45.818
 which increases to the maximum number of cookies. 

00:02:45.818 --> 00:02:48.846
 If she grabs 10 balls, let me record it, 

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:51.940
 if B = 10, F is 0. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.120
 If F equals 0 and B equals 10, 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 how many cookies will I receive? 

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.562
 She will receive - this will be 0 

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:07.182
 and then 3 in 10 is 30, 

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:11.185
 so there are 30 cookies. 

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:13.017
 Hence this point here 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.040
 corresponds to 30 cookies. 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.500
 You can see that each of these points 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.828
 along this blue line corresponds to 30 cookies. 

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.683
 If you go here at F = 6 

00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:29.409
 ... let me write it here: 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.240
 F = 6 and B = 0, 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.940
 Diana uses all her time, 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.444
 she earns the cookies entirely 

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:36.885
 from catching frisbee, 

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:41.072
 so this is the situation where F = 6 and B = 0, 

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.819
 Just once more, 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.300
 when F is 6, 5 by 6 is 30, plus 3 by 0, 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.652
 these are 30 cookies. 

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:55.111
 So the maximum, or the number of cookies, 

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.482
 which he needs before starting to queue, is 30. 

00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:00.680
 Therefore, D will be 30 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.280
 and we can express this inequality as 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.581
 5F + 3B is less than or equal to 30. 

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.835
 Okay, then ask another thing. 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.740
 Can Diana fulfill her plan, 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.060
 taking 4 Frisbee and 2 Balls? 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.056
 Let's see 4 Frisbee and 2 Balls ... 

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:28.558
 That's right here - 4 Frisbee and 2 Balls. 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 Here we are not saying, 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.803
 that she must take the maximum of 30 cookies, 

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:36.054
 but simply can not eat more than 30 cookies. 

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:41.054
 It seems she can do her plan to see. 

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:43.400
 The inequality chart below presents all combinations, 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.677
 in which Diana takes F Frisbee and B balls, 

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:48.480
 to get the most D cookies. 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 So, to see, will she do her plan by grabbing ... 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.940
 well yes, I would say yes.
