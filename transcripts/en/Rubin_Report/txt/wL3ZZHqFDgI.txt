Speaker 1:          00:05          Joining me today is a contributor for Canada's national post known here on the Youtube, as my name is Josephine Josephine. Matthias, welcome to the Rubin [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:14          Thank you for having me. I'm so excited to be here. So your real name is Josephine. My name is Josie can. It is. I know why a lot of people don't believe that. I think it's like an alias isn't really not that believable.

Speaker 1:          00:26          You say, my name is Josephine. We're always getting punked online. So they were curious.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Sorry. That was gonna say, I think they assume it's like Bong Queesha or something. Joseph into really? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38          All right, well I'm, I'm really super psyched that you're here. We met about a month and a half ago in Toronto after Jordan Peterson thing. We got to chat a little bit. Yeah. And I've been a fan of what you're doing for a while and I think you're actually one of the few people on the youtube making some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Hello. I feel special.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Thank you. So, so, uh, let's just do a little bit about your history first and then we're going to play a clip from one of your videos in case people haven't seen some of your stuff, and then we're going to talk about all sorts of political stuff because you are a true political beasts. So you're originally from Nigeria. Yes. Lived there for what, eight or nine years before you years to Canada. So tell me about growing up in Nigeria.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Yeah. Um, I actually don't remember much about growing up in Nigeria and my parents kind of a closed me off to what was really going on. I lived in the gated community and um, yeah, I immigrated here when I was nine years old. My Dad actually first went to Canada when I was too, uh, he got here on a work visa, worked his ass off for years, for about seven years. Actually. I didn't even know who my dad was for seven years. And then when he, you know, got his visa and everything, he brought my family over and yeah, now I'm in, I'm in Canada. I mean, a great guy.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Yeah. So what did your dad do that Mike was able to get a visa to go ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah, my dad was an accountant and then when he got to Canada, he went back to school and decided to do nursing instead. And my mom's a teacher, so that's, that's what they do. What does your mom teach? She teaches, she thought English in Nigeria and now she kind of teaches us special ed kids and stuff like that. So she still loves teaching. She obviously can't teach a nature and person can't teach English in Canada. Um, but yeah, so she still loves teaching, so I'm glad she's still kind of gets to do that. But yeah. So my dad's accountant, my dad, my mom's a teacher.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Yeah. Do your parents tell you anything about the political situation or anything at the time when you were growing up, even if you don't have great memories of it?

Speaker 2:          02:24          Uh, not necessarily. My parents were not really that political. Um, I think we became more political when we came to Canada. And I mean, politics in Nigeria is just, it's completely corrupt. And there, there was no such thing as politics. It's all just money. And, um, is when I came to Canada is when they start to get a little bit more political and uh, I don't know, I think religion and strict parents kinda create conservatism in a way. So they're very, very conservative. Uh, so I, I had grew up about, um, around that, but they didn't really name it as conservatism. It was just strict and religious and had all these rules that basically apply to conservatism in the way. Yeah. Yeah. So then you get to Canada, you're not even 10 years old. And what was that like to be in a new country?

Speaker 2:          03:04          So weird. I mean 16 degrees outside and I was freezing. It's why is it so cold? And there's people wearing t shirts. I did not understand. Uh, I remember like driving from the airport, I think it's piercing airport and we all stopped and was like, why are we stopping? And they're like, oh, it's a red light. I'm like, what does that mean? Don't you just go into this? Everyone has figured it out. My Dad's like, there's order here. I was like, oh, okay. And snow. Snow is the best one. I think I spent like half an hour just like touching it and like what is this? And My, uh, elementary school teachers or middle school teachers had to tell me to get back inside. I'll freeze. But yeah, it was, it was really, it was surreal as a culture shock. So it was mostly a weather related weather whether an order.

Speaker 2:          03:44          Exactly. It's basically it. Whether an order, so when you say you grew up in like a in a religious atmosphere where, what was that like? Um, my parents were just super religious and they hoped I'd be also as religious as them. Unfortunately I'm not. But I think that kind of comes with age and also living in, I don't know, a different country. Nigeria, it's easier, easier. The majority of people are religious. Um, but yeah, they, they are still a very, very, very Catholic. I'm Protestant. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So now you're in Canada, you're a kid, you're making a good life for yourself. When did you get interested in politics? Ooh, I got interested in politics. Uh, while I'm taking political science and studying political science in school right now. And, um, I was also president of the debate club. I was just interested in like this scores and discussing things.

Speaker 2:          04:31          I was interested in people's ideas and different ideas and reasoning, the reason for things. Um, but I also think my political views were really shaped by me immigrating to Canada and we lived in the inner cities. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of Jane and finch by any chance. It's kind of like a south side of Chicago lights. Like it's not, it's obviously not as bad. Um, but it's an inner city majority black, um, you know, poor neighborhoods. I lived there for most of my Canadian life actually. And then from there I moved to a more higher income neighborhood and having to experience that. So it was really cool, kind of seeing like the culture there and then get another culture shock and move somewhere else. So it's like I've experienced, you know, Nigeria in the inner city in Canada and then a much more, you know, well off neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          05:14          So, which would you say is the best out of those three? Uh, Nigeria, no, the wall up neighborhood. But yeah, living in like the um, inner cities really it shaped my views because now when I look back I was like, oh, that makes sense. You are a product of your environment and a lot of people that, you know, I think about two, three of my friends made it out of there. The majority of them are, you know, pregnants are single parents now they're in the system and it's unfortunate and weird to see that happen. And my parents being extremely strict and they gave me a curfew at like 5:00 PM every day. I wasn't allowed to, you know, have boyfriends, which I guess I was young, I probably shouldn't have. Um, but they were really, really strict and I hated them at that time, but I didn't understand why they didn't me to go out and play with people and now I get it because I would have ended up like a lot of the people that are still there right now.

Speaker 2:          06:03          Um, and then, yeah, moving to like the much better neighborhood. I realized that while there is a difference, there is a cultural difference I guess. But yeah, when I've watched a ton of your videos I thought all right, I sensed that she basically is a liberal, why kind of liberal. But I think you are probably some conservative leanings perhaps or at least have an understanding. I think that's what you're laying out here. You have an understanding of that line of thinking. I you consider yourself a classical liberal. I don't want to push you, but I'd like to hear you say it but, but what do you actually consider your views to be? Um, okay. Here. I know everyone says they don't like putting labels, but I absolutely hate labels because like I have some conservative ideas, I have some liberal ideas, I have some classical liberal ideas. Um, I have some progressive ideas, socialist ideas.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Um, but I guess I just see a look at things from issue to issue, but I am, you know, primarily liberal, but I'm fiscally conservative. So that's kind of where I lean I guess. So the route I think of of your ideas, he's sort of individualism. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. You want to throw to a clip? Yes, let's do it. Alright. Let's get people to know you and your natural environment. West has also been tweeting about the lack of freedom of thought in America and the backlash about whether blacks can be allowed to be Republicans. Sure is helping prove his point. But Black Americans, contrary to popular belief, can hold widely diverse and opposing opinions and political issues. Maybe Connie as a Republican, I mean, he's ever referred to himself as such, of course. But he said something about Trump that wasn't severely negative, so he suddenly the Black Paul Ryan.

Speaker 2:          07:37          But even if he is so what? In fact, a 2012 study by Vincent Hutchens and Kim Jefferson using data from the American national election studies found that 45% of black Americans identify as conservatives. Despite this, however, the Democratic Party typically received 85 to 95% of the black American vote. The tendency of black Americans to vote Democrat allows the Dempsey believe that they have a strong hold on the black American vote. In fact, back in 2016 when Kanye West announced he would run for president in 2020 the democratic Party's official Twitter account immediately assumed. He meant he'd be running for them responding. Welcome to the race, Mr. West. Glad to have you. If only the Dems had Ron Kanye in 2016 better candidate than she who shall not be named to be. All right. So I think I picked that one because it's a great example of what you do and there's, there's information and facts and it's kind of light to and find and all that good stuff.

Speaker 2:          08:30          Now, first off though, as a black Canadian talking about black Americans, that's kind of racist, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I think I've gotten a lot of comments of people saying like, he don't understand what it's like to be black in America. And it's like, oh my gosh, thought I can have the same discussions about race relations in America. It's just a little scaled down in, in the Canadian context. And I think a lot of Canadians try to project, I guess I American issues on Canadians as well. So, um, but yeah, I know, I do get that criticism, which is annoying. We should all be allowed to talk about whatever we want. You are black in America right now? Yes, I am. I know it's awful. I mean, sign down like 10 times. People are yelling the n word at me. I mean, I just, I feel so unsafe.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Well that's why we create a safe space. Okay. So I want to about that video though, because the numbers that you laid out there actually kind of incredible and something that we obviously had been talking about lately related to Kanye and Candace and the rest of it. Foot, 45% of black Americans consider themselves conservative yet at 85 to 95% of our voting Democrat. That is a massive disconnect. So, so what do you make of that? Yeah, I think it's just, there's an idea that the Democratic Party is the best one for black Americans. It's the one that's going to help black Americans. And although they are conservative and you know, in the true sense of the word, they aren't necessarily Republican. They don't believe in the Republican Party. Um, but it is, it is very interesting. I mean no one group or identity bolts the same way as black Americans do.

Speaker 2:          09:58          So there is some kind of, I guess, story that's being told to them that this is the way to do it. This is the way to go. And I don't think, you know, the Republican party per se is the way to go. And I don't think the Democratic Party, in fact, I think both parties are just garbage at this point. Um, but yeah, I think it's, it's a little odd that the majority 95% vote one single way, but yet they're still conservative in a sense. Um, but yeah, I just think it's, it's uh, it's a leftover ideas. Like they just need to kind of start to refigure things up. But first we probably have to start with, you know, changing up the government and changing up the party systems and I try to find who to vote for instead of just picking Democrat or Republican. Do you think this was more of a good sell job by the Democrats who are a bad cell drive by the Republicans?

Speaker 2:          10:42          Cause when you look at all this, the cities especially where it's the worst for black people, they're always democrat run cities for decade after decade after decade. Yet black people still in extremely high numbers keep voting Democrats. So that's obviously a great sell job, right? Yeah. Somebody is doing some serious PR work on. Yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. And um, I think it's also the Republicans as well on, I think Black Democrats make it feel like the Republicans are against the black Americans and the demo on the Republicans make it feel like, you know, the black Americans are against Republicans. Like it's just, I think both sides are not necessarily trying to help. They're just trying to pander to their own side. But it is interesting that you've been voting Democrat for so long and things are not getting better. It's like, oh, maybe I should start voting a different way or maybe I should start criticizing the Democratic Party. I think that's actually the biggest thing is it's not picking a side. It's criticizing what they're doing wrong. It's criticizing, you know, this didn't work. Let's try something else. Instead of just saying we need Democrat and that's it. This is what's going to happen, but it's clearly not not working. Let's try to figure out what policy changes we need instead of trying to pick like, you know, Democrat or Republican. Sorry, I keep saying that. I've never got to know. I'm with you. I'm with you. So I know you're not, you're not a huge proponent

Speaker 1:          11:54          of the sort of Candace Kanye training in general, but the fact that that conversation is happening now, the fact that you made that video, you view that all as positive, right?

Speaker 2:          12:04          Oh yeah, no, for sure. I think Connie really allowed a lot of people to think for a second and try to, you know, investigate some more information, try to figure out what their real, why they hold certain ideas. I think that was the biggest thing and it was really exciting. It's like scroll through Facebook and see people that are not normally engaging in politics. Now. Actually that might be scary because it's like the majority of people are saying you don't know what they're doing. But yeah, I'd rather have them some way. Exactly. I'd rather have them involved. And the thing is, I think as much as I, um, you know, dislike Ken is politics. I do think that it opened a lot of people's minds in the sense that it allowed them to investigate more. And that's the most important thing because then you're just stuck in the echo chamber.

Speaker 2:          12:43          Connie broke that. A lot of people, all they see is, you know, beyond say and Chrissy Tiegen and all these celebrities that are all just talking about the far left, you know, super. I hate saying social justice for you over Super Social Justice Warrior talking points. So Kanye broke that and show them the other side. Um, unfortunately I think, uh, you know, because Candace is kind of harsh and you know, I think it's harder for people to connect with her that are already sold down the drain of the far left. And unfortunately we might have to cuddle them, fill the Neil, come on, come to the other side. It's okay. Let me explain things to you.

Speaker 1:          13:17          So do you view that as just like a personality trait? Because that's what's interesting to me. Like people used to say to me all the time, well, uh, you know, when you have milo on like Milo's creating chaos and out of chaos, hopefully my feeling was if I brought Milo on that out of the chaos that he creates, that some people would hear some good ideas in a more calm, relaxed way, and then they joined me on the adventure that I'm on. And I think there's proof in that pudding. Yeah, I think you're kind of a little bit more like where I think you see a little bit of the chaos that cannabis is creating and you want people to understand the ideas behind them.

Speaker 2:          13:50          Yeah. That's, that's the thing is that, you know, when Candice says one thing, like, um, stop the victim mentality for example. Um, I think black Americans that are stuck in like the far left echo chamber just sees it as like, excuse me, like what are you trying to save a little blot? So it's like they needs either she explains it further, which obviously she doesn't have to do. I mean she can do whatever she wants, but I think she needs to break it down a little more cause saying get off the plantation, the victim hood, it's harder for people that all they've ever heard is white privilege. White people suck, blah, blah, blah. It's harder for them to kind of understand where she's coming from because if you do break it down, it makes a lot of sense. But if it's just thrown like that, then it's harder for them to figure it out. What they can do. The, I keep like pointing here like the Liberals are these people over here. Yeah. Um, so we just need to kind of break it down and figure

Speaker 1:          14:36          you think maybe you need both. Like in any movement, like if you just look at the black rights movement that Malcolm x who is different than Martin Luther King. And even the way comedians talk about things differently because we talk about things differently than Dick Gregory, then Chappelle and Chris Rock. We just need

Speaker 2:          14:52          people. People just get affected by different things. Yeah. Shock value works. I mean it gets people, it wakes people up. It allows them to kind of, you know, be more aware of what's going on. I totally, I do think we need both of them. We need people to say, you know, shut up, you're being annoying. And we also need people to say, here's why you're being annoying. We most certainly need both. Um, but yeah, I think she, what she does is awesome. She has such a great platform and there are also other people that are doing the same thing, but in a more kind of calmer, I'm not saying she's like crazy or anything. Um, yeah, she's just, she's a tough girl and it's a lot of SJWs or snowflakes. So I might goes out any direction. Um, not necessarily. I mean I think we've, I have d under like we've talked over dms on Twitter before.

Speaker 2:          15:36          Um, and this was after the whole Blair white debate and that was wise guys, guys, guys. Yeah. Uh, no I was just um, at reaching out to her and asking her like, Hey, what's going on? Like I don't, cause she was, I think closing everyone off that were criticizing her and I didn't want to openly criticize her and I wanted to go directly to the source. Um, but we left off on like a good notes. Yeah. Yeah. All right, well I'll put it out here. Why do we have a Jay z Kanye moment and you both can come on the show sometime. Oh yeah, let's talk it out. Yeah, you're going to be like guys guys, please guide if I'm a glutton for punishment. Exactly. So when I was doing a little research on you, one of the things that I thought was most interesting is that, so you have a twin sister and part of your awakening was related to a paper that she was writing in college.

Speaker 2:          16:22          Yeah. So can you tell me about that? Cause it's pretty fascinating. Yeah. So my sister is not into politics at all. She is studying marketing and she decided to take, she goes to various university, one of the biggest far left universities in Canada. And um, he took a sociology course that was her fault. I made called how society works. I think it was the title of the course or is what bothered me. Cause if the course was feminism studies, if the course was, you know how women are oppressed and yeah, sure, but this is how society works and you know, in your assignment they had to talk about, I know some societal issue and discuss it and analyze it or whatever. And she wanted to talk about the weight or I actually encouraged her, I'm like, you should talk about the wage gap and you know how it's false and you know how it's misinterpreted and all of that.

Speaker 2:          17:08          And you were setting her up. I was setting her up a little, I wanted to test it out, but I didn't know it would, the professor would, you know, respond that way. Um, but yeah, I told her to write about the wage gap so she just sent like a short thesis and said like, here's what I want to talk about. I'm going to use studies, blah blah blah. Let me know. And the professor like her response is a meme like I hope I could let you guys can like put it up or something. It's like the reality is patriarchy do not use business sources. They blame women and it's like period. The reality is patriarchy do not. They blame women and like you know the screenshot on this, you can say sure we're going to throw down. Totally. Yeah. I was reading it. I was like okay, this is fake, right?

Speaker 2:          17:44          This is, this is definitely fake. No, she basically shut it down and she said your premise is completely, and it was one of the most absurd emails ever and use only feminist sources and in the assignment details, the list of sources they can't use was dictionary.com the encyclopedia. You couldn't use the government of Canada website. You couldn't use statistic Canada, Statistics Canada. How like how does that even make sense? How are you going to explain how society works and the only source you have is feminist studies and you know, as Peterson has mentioned this so many times, they're not sighted. It's just within this little group. These aren't real textbooks. Uh, but yeah, it just, it blew my mind and I was, I'm so excited that she sat back cause I was like this is exactly what is wrong. So okay, so your sister gets this response.

Speaker 2:          18:32          What was her response? Was she like, Oh look what you did to me? No, yes. She was upset at me and she thought I was wrong and I have to sit her down and say, girl, let me explain it to you. Here is what is actually happening. By the end of that conversation she's like, oh my gosh, I've been, every class I go to, I've been lied to. They are lying to me every single day. And it, it's, it's, it's so messed up and I think it's, this isn't teaching, this is imposing your political ideas on students because if it's teaching, you teach it objectively, you show them the facts and let your students come up with their own conclusions. This is not teaching. She's trying to tell them how to think. And you know, I, I did some research on her actually, and she's the highest paid woman in her person, in her department.

Speaker 2:          19:11          She makes more money than the male counterparts. What are you talking about? So I'm sure there's a reason. Yeah, exactly. But it's like, there's obviously reasons for it. She probably works more hours. She's, you know, doing all these other things and that's how you can explain the wage gap. So it was just interesting to me that why like why are they doing this? Why are you lying to your students or isn't the point of education for you? Like, or essays or assignments. Like you're supposed to come to your own conclusions by using facts. We have the facts. What's wrong with it? She just didn't want those facts. It, it blew my mind. But that was right. Well they're often not for facts. Yeah. Facts that they lie. Yeah. What happened with the paper? Oh she, she's like, okay, this is like too much for me and my sister.

Speaker 2:          19:54          And she ended up just doing some other like topic and try to pander to what the professor wanted to get a good mark. And that is my advice to a lot of students. It's like, just suck it up. I mean if you are already in this class, it's not worth getting a bad mark over. Um, however, sorry. The great thing about it was I got a ton of messages from students from her class started to explain all the other things that this teacher is engaging it and how awful it is. And that made me happy cause they said, you know what, next week I'm going to speak up and I'm going to tell her she's wrong. And I was like, yes, yes, but be prepared. Don't just say she's wrong. So it's interesting. So I talk about this when I do college, uh, speeches. Yeah. Two years ago or so.

Speaker 2:          20:30          I used to say what you said about get the grade, like suck it up and get the green because hopefully you know if you want to move to Grad school or get a good job after or whatever, and I, I've turned on that. But really you're the one 80 on that because to me it's like we live in a time where people can be on youtube and expose these things, share the emails out on social media. Periscope while you're in classes, the teacher is telling you that you're an evil white racism. Many videos of my teachers. Just the worst thing. But that's been so empowering for you. So that's why I'm not for telling kids can students not to do that. But I, I understand the line of thinking and I guess it depends on the person or anything. It's still can challenge your professor while he's, you know, just teaching.

Speaker 2:          21:11          I met more for assignments. The assignments says explain why women are oppressed. Like just do it. That's it. Like if you, you're probably going to fail if you say women are not oppressed, but if the teacher is actually teaching, then yes please. That is the best time because you catch them at it. And I love watching them squirm. I love watching them just kind of look around and it's like, oh, there's a black woman asking me to tell, you know, tell her why she's oppressed and my white professor, please tell me what rights you have did I don't have in Toronto, Canada. And it's like, well, you know, there is white privilege. It's like, oh my gosh, stop. It's enough. Do you feel bizarrely empowered because of that? Now, I mean, someone who's clear on their political thoughts and you don't, you're not a victim nor want to be a victim or anything or he's immigrant status or blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          21:57          Do you feel very empowered? Like almost like your teachers can't push back on you in a weird way because they're caught in their own guilt cycle? Yeah, no, for sure. And it's also funny because, um, you know, I am the, I'm an immigrant, I am black and I'm a woman. It's like I just have to be, I guess Muslim and I'm all the impressions. Um, so it's really difficult for them or anything. Yeah. I got to limit to emulate every oppression there is. Um, but yeah, no, it, it's, it's, it's kind of funny to see how they can't challenge me because a lot of their arguments, it is based on lived experiences. This is what black people face. And I'm talking about the Canadian context. I think Canadian social racial relations is a little bit different than the states than here in the states. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          22:38          Um, but yeah, me being like a black woman, it's, it's very difficult for them. Like they can't give me any, they have to give me a legit argument because the only argument is, well, black people feel that way. I don't. So what is your argument? Um, but yeah, I mean in, in a sense it does kind of make me feel empowered because it's, it's funny to watch them score. Do you feel that you've had an undue influence? You know, I suspect in a positive way on some of your classmates, because I'm imagining they're probably learning as much from you in some ways. Oh yeah. More than they're learning from some of these professors. Yeah, for sure. Um, it's actually fun. There are some classes I would have where a professor would say something absurd and like there's a student that I know knows me from Youtube and he'll look at me and I'm like, I'm not saying anything and I know raise your hand and they'll talk and they'll want me to like chime in and I'm like, I don't want to do this in every class.

Speaker 2:          23:25          I'm not going to be challenging my professors. Um, but yeah, I really liked the fact that I've encouraged so many students, you know, step up and actually speak up and say what they believe in. And um, yeah, it was, it just really, it's really interesting. There was a course where one of the textbooks, I forgot, dammit, this is why school sucks cause like you forget everything literally, instantly. Um, but one of the students that how it was problematic and before we just kind of brush it off and then another student rose their hand and said, why is it problematic? And it looks at me. I was like, Oh God. But yeah, I really liked that. I've encouraged people to speak up and you know, state what they believe and do more research and not just listen to everything your professor is saying, not just listen to anything I'm saying. Do more research and investigate and try to find, you know, let's get closer to the truth is basically it.

Speaker 1:          24:08          Do you think students want to be smarter than this stuff? They're being spoon fed? Because I definitely do. And when I go to these schools, I see such a thirst for knowledge and honesty and facts and an exhaustion with this nonsense. But if you listen to the way the media talks either about millennials or whatever, it's like they're the spoiled entitled generation on that same, I'm not saying that a lot of them aren't, but I, I genuinely think that, that most people, especially young people, they want real answers, not just like easy dribble.

Speaker 2:          24:39          No, for sure. And, um, I think a lot of this has to do with the student unions. And again, I'm talking, I'm obviously more familiar with the Canadian context of this. Um, but the, you know, major schools, University of Toronto, York University and viruses university. I go to University of Toronto, run by black lives matter, Ryerson black lives matter and feminist, uh, York. University of black lives matter. I mean, individuals that are part of the black lives matter. Original organizations are the presidents, vice president and all that of the student union. And, um, I was a president of the debate club for about three years, the first three years of my schooling. And I was like, you know, what would be really exciting to have a debate on race, racial issues? I would love to. I don't care if I'm on this side, on the other side, that would be such a good thing cause all we're ever being fed is raised.

Speaker 2:          25:21          Every corner there's some poster about being black and UFT, which by the way, people just realize like during the Trump election, we've been here for three years. No one complained and all of a sudden Trump is elected. It's hard to be black. Come on. Um, but yeah, I, I went to go talk to the school presidents and I said I would love to have this event, all of that. They shut me down. They said anyone that goes in the other side on the opposite side is, you know, trying to question the humanity of black people. How dare they try it. And I'm sitting there like, I will be the one, like what are you talking about? But yeah, they, they canceled it and shut it down, which is so sad. It was so excited for that. So

Speaker 1:          25:56          it's interesting. I know you've been pretty critical of black lives matter and I want to get into that a little bit. But the moment for me that I realized it had morphed into something that I no longer felt was positive because at the beginning I did think it was basically a, a positive movement. Yeah. Or a grass roots movement that was making some sense and, and addressing some important issues. But the moment I realized that it jumped, the shark was in Toronto actually at the Toronto Pride Parade. When they stopped the parade, they literally stopped the parade from marching to demand that the organizers of the gay pride parade or another oppressed group, uh, submit to their demands. Their demands were that they were going to focus on these issues. And I thought, wow, what a perfect example of everything that's wrong with identity politics, with the oppression, Olympics, the whole thing. And then subsequently saw a lot more

Speaker 2:          26:44          of that style of thinking happening throughout black lives matter. But was that moment for you as someone that's from a Rondo? We met in Toronto, um, is that, was that a seminal moment for you? Yeah, for sure. I mean, I, I absolutely hate black lives matter. Toronto. I can't say much for many of the other black lives matter chapters. What black lives matter. Toronto is extremely toxic and divisive and I think it's mainly because I, we were getting so much better in terms of racial relations and people were getting along and there wasn't really, I mean, I'm speaking for myself. It wasn't really that many racism or racist acts happening, but all of a sudden they erupt and they say, you know, black people feel uncomfortable during pride because of the police. When again happens during the Trump presidency, it's like all of a sudden you're starting to feel oppressed.

Speaker 2:          27:28          And it blew my mind stopping the pride parade. I was so confused. They stopped it for like an hour asking for demands that the police be band. And it's like being a gay police officer, isn't that an oppression? And then they say, okay, but you can go without your uniform. Are you kidding me? No, that's not the point. The point is there was a stigma against being, you know, a police officer and gay being gay. How dare you take that away from them. And there were a lot of proposals, by the way, during the pride parade with officers and their uniform. That's beautiful. Like what are you, are you really going to try to marriage proposals? Yeah, it's married. Yeah. Sorry. It's marriage proposals. Yeah. It was like, oh my God, this is such a great thing. But no, no, no. Now they, they've actually been banned.

Speaker 2:          28:07          They didn't, they're not coming to the pride I think for the next like five years or so. Um, but that actually was not the reason why I started to hate BLM. Do you remember the Jordan Peterson free speech event in Toronto? Oh, yeah. Uh, so he teaches at University of Toronto. My school, and this is actually when I started making videos. Um, it was because during the, the event he, this was his first public event after making the series of videos and um, black lives matter was there, you know, just there are two sides I guess. And I wasn't really picking a side. It was also my very first protest. I was just there to observe. I was very confused as to why people were yelling at each other. What was going on? Oh, I should have just gotten home. No. Yeah. So I, I, you know, I observed the whole thing and it was pretty peaceful there.

Speaker 2:          28:54          People of color went up there and we're seeing things like, you know, I don't feel oppressed. This is one of the greatest countries in the world, especially Toronto. Like this is so diverse. It's everyone loves each, everyone's nice to each other. Um, you know, the black lives matter, we're calling them coons, they're calling up sellouts, they're yelling all these things. And I immediately knew who the aggressors, where I immediately knew who, which side I did not want to be on. I wasn't picking sides, but it was like, Oh God, I stayed til the very end until the last person left because this was again first protest. I was like excited and talking to everyone. I got home and there are articles that are posted by the school newspaper, by Toronto Star about, you know, black people were, you know, called the n word. They were harassed.

Speaker 2:          29:33          Someone brought dogs, someone brought dot. I was actually standing next to the person with the dogs. So when apparently brought dogs to chase off the block, black people complete lies. And that opened my eyes to like the media bias. That didn't happen, not even close to being happening to happen. So it blew my mind that they would lie about that. And then I personally messaged a, the leader of black lives matter instead, I am disappointed girl. I was there like why are you doing this? Um, and then I decided to start making videos cause I said clearly there in getting the wrong information, the school, literally things. Jordan Peterson was this Nazi that came and said I hate black people and women and transgenders and all about, um, so I just thought like, you know what, if no one's going to do it, I should do it. And then I started making videos, which was weird cause I had to go to school the next day and then deal with these people.

Speaker 1:          30:19          Yeah. But do you know what you, you put your ass on the line and yeah, paid off. Wait. So did, when you a DM, the black lives matter president, did she respond to you?

Speaker 2:          30:28          Yeah. She responded to me saying, I'm, I'm going to screenshot this, uh, to use against you in the future. Why don't you say it to my face? I still have it saved cause I'm like, I'm going to save this for the rest of my life. Yeah. The, the president, like the CO founder of black lives matter Toronto said she's going to, I should say it to her face and she's going to use this against me in the future. Meanwhile, all I said was, I was there. This is very inappropriate. Why are you telling lies or making black people feel like, you know, this is what actually happened. You're making students feel like that's why students feel like they're being oppressed because you're telling them, sorry,

Speaker 1:          30:59          what do you know? What do you think these people, and I don't mean just black lives matter in this case, but like this, this type of person at a university, whether it's from gender studies or whatever it is, you know, with all the identity politics stuff, what do you think they actually want in the end? Like if they were to get what they want, what is that?

Speaker 2:          31:20          That's what I don't understand is that the are obviously fakes because if they truly care about black liberation, there are policies that you could point to that you can probably fix and help the black community and, and Canada, one of the things was a carding and that was actually immediately carding was gone. I'm in Toronto, Ontario. I'm not sure either the province or the city. Um, but that's the one thing where I was like, okay, random stops. I think that's something that you should be, you know, stopped and it's done in inner city neighborhoods and blah, blah blah. Apart from that it's like, okay, what else do you want? They want black professors. They want police out of pride. That's not helping black people. That's not changing their social economic status. So what do you, what is your goal? I really don't understand cause it's, you don't care. I don't want to say, I mean I do care. I don't want to say like I'm, I have all the solutions but I can tell you what to do. But they are telling people false solutions. You're telling them that we need all black professors to teach black people. Um, but I don't know what their, what their goal is. I don't know if I is money, I guess. I really don't get it. I don't get it seriously.

Speaker 3:          32:29          Okay.
