00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.310
Welcome to the
playlist on statistics,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.297
something I've been meaning
to do for some time.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.630
So anyway, I just want to get
right into the meat of it.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.610
And I'll try to do as
many examples as possible,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.510
and hopefully give you the
feel for what statistics is all

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.129
about.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.670
And really just to
start off, in case

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.320
you're not familiar with
it, I think a lot of people

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.180
have an intuitive feel
for what statistics

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.130
is about-- statistics.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.780
In very general terms, it's
getting your head around data.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.729
And it can broadly be classified
into maybe three categories.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.690
You have descriptive, so
say you have a lot of data

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.630
and you wanted to
tell someone about it

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.510
without giving them
all of the data.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.247
Maybe you can find indicative
numbers that somehow represent

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:48.580
all of that data without
having to go over all the data.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.420
So that would be
descriptive statistics.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.590
There's also predictive.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.260
Well, I'll kind of
group them together.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.170
There's inferential statistics.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.980
This is when you use
data to essentially make

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.290
conclusions about things.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.540
So let's say you've sampled
some data from a population,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.880
and we'll talk a lot about
samples versus populations,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450
but I think just a basic
sense of what that is.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.400
If I survey three people who
are going to vote for president,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.680
I clearly haven't surveyed
the entire population.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.280
I've surveyed a sample.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.250
But what inferential
statistics are all about

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.220
are if we can do some
math on the samples,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.920
maybe we can make
inferences or conclusions

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.812
about the population as a whole.

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:29.270
Anyway, that's just
the big picture

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.890
of what statistics is all about.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.110
So let's just get
into the meat of it.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.955
We'll start with
the descriptive.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.255
So the first thing that
I would want to do it,

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:42.630
or I think most
people would want

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.317
to do when they're given a
whole set of numbers and they're

00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:47.150
told to describe it.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.930
It's like well,
maybe I can come up

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.560
with some number that is
most indicative of all

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.420
of the numbers in that
set, or some number that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.480
represents the central tendency.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.950
This is a word you'll see
a lot in statistics books.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.905
The central tendency
of a set of numbers.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.343
This is also called the average.

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:11.009
And I'll be a little
bit more exact here

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.230
than I normally am
with the word average.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140
When I talk about
in this context,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720
it just means that
the average is

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.930
a number that
somehow is giving us

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.650
a sense of the central
tendency, or maybe a number that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.269
is most representative of a set.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.810
I know that sounds
all very abstract,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.020
but let's do a
couple of examples.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.270
So there's a bunch of
ways you can actually

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.040
measure of the central
tendency, or the average,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.020
of a set of numbers, and you've
probably seen these before.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.402
They are the mean-- actually,
there are types of means,

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:44.110
but we'll stick with
the arithmetic mean.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360
Later when we talk about
stock returns and things,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.410
we'll do geometric means.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.080
And maybe we'll cover the
harmonic mean one day.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.760
There's a mean, the
median, and the mode.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.940
And in statistics
speak, these all

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.090
can kind of be
representative of a data set,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390
or a population's central
tendency, or a sample

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.820
central tendency.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.490
And they all are
collectively-- they can all

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.895
be forms of an average.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:18.270
And I think when
we see examples,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.728
it'll make a little
bit more sense.

00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:23.490
In every day speak when people
talk about an average-- I think

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.000
you've already computed
averages in your life--

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.092
they're usually talking
about the arithmetic mean.

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:30.300
So normally when someone
says, let's take the average

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.190
of these numbers and they
expect you to do something,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.330
they want you to figure
out the arithmetic mean.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.705
They don't want you to figure
out the median or the mode.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.170
But before we go
any further, let's

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.510
figure out what
these things are.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.290
So let me make up
a set of numbers.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.560
Let's say I have the number
1, let's say I have another 1,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.440
2, 3, let's say I have a 4.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.330
That's good enough.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.500
We just wanted a simple example.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.660
So the mean, or the
arithmetic mean,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.400
is probably what you're
most familiar with when

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.320
people talk about average.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.665
You add up all the numbers
and you divide by the numbers

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.290
that there are.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.480
So in this case, it would be
1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.680
and you're going to divide
by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.510
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.610
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.674
4 plus 3 is 7.

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:29.640
7 plus 4 is 11.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.610
So this is equal to 11 over 5.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.307
That's 2 and 1/5, so
that's equal to 2.2.

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:39.890
And so someone could
say, hey, that is

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.520
a pretty good representative
number of this set.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.910
That's the number that all of
these numbers, you can say,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.770
are closest to.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.270
2.2 represents the central
tendency of this set.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.310
And in common speak, that
would be the average.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.310
But if we're being a
little bit more particular,

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.460
this is the arithmetic mean
of this set of numbers.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.790
And you see it represents them.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.260
If I didn't want to give you
the list of five numbers,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.218
I could say, well, I have
a set of five numbers

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:02.620
and their mean is 2.2.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.790
And it tells you
where the numbers are.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.682
And we'll talk a little
bit more about how

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.140
do you know how
far the numbers are

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.650
from that mean in
the next video.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.890
So that's one measure.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.170
Another measure-- instead
of averaging it in this way,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.986
you could average it
by putting the numbers

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.610
in order, which I
actually already did.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.950
So let's just write them down
in order again-- 1, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.610
And you just take
the middle number.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.880
So let's see.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.830
There's one, two, three,
four, five numbers.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.080
So the middle number is going
to be right here, right?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.038
The middle number is 2.

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:36.780
There's two numbers
greater than 2,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.600
and there's two
numbers less than 2.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.850
And this is called the median.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.580
So it's actually very
little computation.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.640
You just have to essentially
sort the numbers.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.130
And then you find
whatever number

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.670
where you have an equal
number greater than or less

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.420
than that number.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.640
So the median of this set is 2.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.450
You see, that's actually
fairly close to the mean.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.050
And there's no right answer.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.620
One of these isn't a better
answer for the average.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.080
They're just different ways
of measuring the average.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.935
So here, it's the median.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:06.810
And I know what you
might be thinking-- well,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.740
that was easy enough
when we had five numbers.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.420
But what if we had six numbers?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.760
What if it was like this?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.310
What if this was
our set of numbers?

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.020
1, 1, 2, 3, let's
add another 4 there.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.690
So now there's no middle number.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.440
2 is not the middle
number because there's

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.622
two less than it and
three larger than it.

00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:28.080
And then 3 is not
the middle number

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.730
because there's two larger
and three smaller than it.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.014
So there's no middle number.

00:06:34.014 --> 00:06:36.430
So when you have a set with
even numbers and someone tells

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.170
you to figure out the
median, what you do

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.628
is you take the
middle two numbers.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.210
And then you take the arithmetic
mean of those two numbers.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.780
So in this case, of this
set, the median would be 2.5.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.422
Fair enough.

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:52.880
But let's put this
aside, because I

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.230
want to compare the
median and the means

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.590
and the modes for the
same set of numbers.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.200
But that's a good thing to
know, because sometimes it

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.717
can be a little confusing.

00:07:02.717 --> 00:07:03.800
These are all definitions.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.400
These are all mathematical
tools for getting our heads

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.540
around numbers.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.470
It's not like one day someone
saw one of these formulas

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.300
on the face of the sun
and says, oh, that's

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.210
part of the universe.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.020
That is how the average
should be calculated.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.470
These are human
constructs to just get

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.775
our heads around
large sets of data.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.400
I mean, this isn't
a large set of data.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.010
But instead of five numbers,
if we had five million numbers,

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.010
you could imagine
that you don't like

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.860
thinking about every
number individually.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.420
Anyway, before I
talk more about that,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.560
let me tell you
what the mode is.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.310
And the mode, to
some degree, it's

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.580
the one that I think most
people forget or never learn.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.315
And when they see
it on an exam, it

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:41.940
confuses them because
they're like, oh,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.230
that sounds very advanced.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.260
But in some ways,
it is the easiest

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.480
of all of the measures of
central tendency or of average.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.950
The mode is essentially what
number is most common in a set.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.580
So in this example,
there's two ones

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.590
and then there's one
of everything else.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.290
So the mode here is 1.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.070
So mode you can say is
the most common number.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.900
And then you could say, hey,
Sal, what if this was our set?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.010
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.624
Here, I have two 1s
and I have two 4s.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.790
And this is where the mode
gets a little bit tricky,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.206
because either of
these would have

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:17.535
been a decent
answer for the mode.

00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:19.660
You could have actually
said the mode of this is 1,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.770
or the mode of this is 4.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.500
And it gets a little
bit ambiguous,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.740
and you probably
want a little clarity

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.864
from the person asking you.

00:08:25.864 --> 00:08:27.605
Most times on a test
when they ask you,

00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:29.230
there's not going to
be this ambiguity.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.630
There will be a most
common number in the set.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.809
Now you're saying,
oh, why wasn't just

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.067
one of these good enough?

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.150
Why did we learn averages?

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.347
Why don't we just use
arithmetic mean all the time?

00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:44.680
What's median and mode good for?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.520
Well, I'll try to do
one example of that

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.379
and see if it rings
true with you.

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:52.170
And then you could
think a little bit more.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.860
Let's say I had this set
of numbers-- 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.380
and 100.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.030
So what's the
arithmetic mean here?

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.130
What's the mean here?

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.100
So one, two, three,
four, five 3s and 100.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.540
So it would be 115 divided by 6.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.980
Because I have one, two,
three, four, five, six numbers.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.130
115 is just the sum
of all of these.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.421
So that's equal to-- how many
times does 6 go into 115?

00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:28.630
6 goes into it one time.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.735
1 times 6 is 6.

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:32.400
55 goes into it 9 times.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.470
9 times 6 is 54.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.580
So it's equal to 19 and 1/6.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.290
Fair enough.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.210
I just added all the numbers and
divided by how many there are.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.900
But my question is, is
this really representative

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.559
of this set?

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.100
I mean, I have a
ton of 3s and then I

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.550
have 100 all of a sudden.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.940
And we're saying that the
central tendency is 19 and 1/6.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.230
19 and 1/6 doesn't really
seem indicative of this set.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.438
I mean, maybe it does,
depending on your application.

00:09:56.438 --> 00:09:57.910
But it just seems
a little bit off.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.034
I mean, my intuition would
be that central tendency

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.080
is something closer to 3.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.210
Because there's
a lot of 3s here.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.660
So what the median tell us?

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.427
We already put these
numbers in order.

00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:11.010
If I had given you
out of order, you'd

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.940
want to put it in this order.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.640
And you'd say, what's
the middle number?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.710
Let's see.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.950
The middle two numbers,
since I have an even number,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.550
are 3 and 3.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.230
So if I take the
average of 3 and 3--

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.970
I should be particular
with my language--

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.940
if I take the arithmetic
mean of 3 and 3, I get 3.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.680
And this is maybe a
better measurement

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.910
of the central tendency
or of the average

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.450
of this set of numbers.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.570
Essentially, what it does
is by taking the median,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.500
I wasn't so much affected by
this really large number that's

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.240
very different than the others.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.090
In statistics, they
call that an outlier.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.160
If you talked about
average home prices, maybe

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.390
every house in the
city is $100,000

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.844
and then there's one house
that costs a trillion dollars.

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:55.760
And then if someone told
you the average house

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.530
price was a million
dollars, you might

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.820
have a very wrong
perception of that city.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.140
But the median house
price would be $100,000,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.640
and you'd get a better sense
of what the houses in that city

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.610
are like.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.480
So similarly, this
median gives you

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.060
a better sense of what the
numbers in this set are like.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.149
The arithmetic mean was skewed
by what they'd call an outlier.

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:19.690
Being able to tell
what an outlier is

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.911
is one of those things that
a statistician will say,

00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:23.160
well, I know it when I see it.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.145
There isn't really a
formal definition for it,

00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:27.920
but it tends to be a number
that really sticks out.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.320
And sometimes it's due to a
measurement error, or whatever.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.200
And then finally, the mode.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.490
What is the most common
number in this set?

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.700
Well, there's five 3s
and there's one 100.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.540
So the most common number
is, once again, it's a 3.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.460
So in this case, when
you had this outlier,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.080
the median and the mode tend
to be maybe a little bit better

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.470
about giving you an
indication of what

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.670
these numbers represent.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.350
Maybe this was just
a measurement error.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.770
But I don't know.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.290
We don't actually know
what these represent.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.740
If these are house
prices, then I

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.270
would argue that
these are probably

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.102
more indicative measures of
what the houses in an area cost.

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:05.560
But if this is something else,
if this is scores on a test,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.190
maybe, maybe there is one kid
in the class-- one out of six

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.648
kids-- who did
really, really well,

00:12:09.648 --> 00:12:10.950
and everyone else didn't study.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.137
And this is more indicative
of how students at that level

00:12:14.137 --> 00:12:14.720
do on average.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.695
Anyway, I'm done talking
about all of this.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.570
I encourage you to play
with a lot of numbers

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.560
and deal with the
concepts yourself.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.304
In the next video, we'll explore
more descriptive statistics.

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:27.220
Instead of talking about
the central tendency,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.480
we'll talk about how
spread apart things

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.570
are away from the
central tendency.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.636
See you in the next video.
