[Music]

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.740
What if you didn't need a lie detector?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.090
What if your knowledge of psychology and human
behavior was enough to tell if people were

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.639
telling the truth?

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.390
Some people are inherently born with the ability
to spot a liar.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.089
Others study and practice for years before
they can call people out on their dishonesty.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:33.570
Well, we're about to give you a crash course
on how to spot a liar.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.720
Here are ten of the most obvious signs: evasiveness;
one study on lying, found that evasiveness

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.280
was one of the biggest signs of dishonesty.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
But what is evasiveness?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.270
Basically, when people are lying, they are
less likely to be specific.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.180
They might say "I don't know" or "I don't
remember".

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.970
In terms of lying, this is a massive red flag.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.610
Inconsistency; Liars can't keep their story
straight.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.640
That's basically what psychologists mean when
they say inconsistency.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.000
And studies have proven it's a big sign of
lying.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.830
This is a common tactic used by police during
interrogations.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.270
They ask the suspect to repeat their story
again and again hoping to poke holes in it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.570
when certain details are inconsistent.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.390
Simulated facial expressions; although this
is another huge sign of lying, it's very hard

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210
to spot.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.880
Why?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.840
Because some Liars are just really good at
acting.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.170
One study showed that only certain facial
muscles are activated when people are experiencing

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740
genuine happiness.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.010
These muscles are called the orbicularis oculi,
otherwise known as cow’s feet.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.659
But, you'd have to be a serious expert the
spot which muscles are being activated in

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.690
the face.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.900
They can't tell their story backwards.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.620
If you ever doubt that someone is telling
the truth, ask them to tell their story backwards.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.349
Studies have shown that when people are lying,
they have trouble telling their false version

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.970
of events in Reverse.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.480
When people are lying, they have an increased
cognitive load.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.879
This basically means that liar’s brains
are working much harder than those who are

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.459
telling the truth.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.799
When you ask a liar to tell their story backwards,
this might push their cognitive load over

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.370
the edge leaving them unable to keep their
story straight.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.939
Not maintaining eye contact; this has to be
one of the most obvious signs of a liar.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:13.010
Eye contact is linked with truthfulness, and
multiple studies have linked lying with the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.749
inability to look someone in the eye.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.659
Although this has been explored by research,
it only takes a little bit of common sense

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.169
to see why this is true.

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.049
Once again, it goes back to evasiveness.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:37.549
They can't handle unexpected questions; like
we've mentioned previously, Liars are using

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.959
their brains much more than those telling
the truth.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.590
Honest people don't have to think too hard
about what they're saying, they're simply

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.800
telling the truth.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.590
Liars on the other hand are inventing entire
stories and situations clearly out of their

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.459
own imaginations.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.299
Sometimes, they plan out their responses and
stories long in advance.

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:09.950
That's why when we ask them unexpected random
questions, it often catches them out.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.629
It's another technique that police often use;
simply asking them what they were wearing

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:23.020
or what they ate could be enough to leave
a liar stuttering.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.850
Micro-expressions; this is another sign which
is incredibly hard to spot.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.340
Research has shown that facial expressions
linked with genuine emotions might only last

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.919
a few milliseconds.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.370
As a general rule, shorter expressions are
usually real.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.640
Longer drawn-out expressions have a higher
chance of being fake.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.650
A liar is essentially trying very hard to
show everyone what they're feeling, as opposed

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.520
to genuinely feeling these emotions.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.830
The problem is that these genuine micro expressions
are very hard to spot.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.660
Sometimes, they're impossible to even see
because they're so quick.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.610
Blinking; but there might be an easier way
to spot what psychologists refer to as masked

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.960
emotions.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.860
Just take note of how often someone is blinking.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.740
Research has shown that frequent blinking
is linked to masked emotions, a clear sign

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.909
of lying.

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:38.639
Their facial expressions and their emotions
don't match up.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.100
This is something most of us aren't familiar
with.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.000
Sometimes, people just give us a strange vibe.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Often, this is because their emotions and
facial expressions seem totally disconnected.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.560
They might be smiling when their body language
seems sad or vice versa.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.979
Studies have shown that this is a major red
flag when it comes to lying.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:12.550
Play devil's advocate; now we're getting into
expert territory.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.850
This might be hard to pull off but it's a
great way to spot a liar.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:24.289
Let's say someone says that they love roller
coasters, but you have a sneaking suspicion

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:30.949
that they're actually terrified of them, all
you need to do is play devil's advocate.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:37.539
Talk about how scary you think roller-coasters
are and situations where you've been terrified,

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.319
they'll probably agree with you on some level.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.580
Now, all you need to do is compare that statement
with what they initially said about loving

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.650
roller-coasters.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.210
Which statement seems more genuine?

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.659
The answer should be pretty obvious.

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.879
This is a technique which has been backed
up by quite a few studies.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.740
Tell us about your stories of when you caught
a liar.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.949
What were some of the signs that made it obvious?

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.999
We hope this helps you in getting the truth
out of people in the future.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.669
What did you think of this video?

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.639
Does it help you spot a liar?

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.009

you use to catch a liar in the act.
