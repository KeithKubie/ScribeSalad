00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Vsauce!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.460
Kevin here.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.920
Astronaut Mike Hopkins ran around the world.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
Sort of.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.769
During a 12 mile run on a treadmill the space
station had orbited the Earth and traveled

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.990
more than 25 thousand miles.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.430
What the FAK.....the facts and knowledge on
the daily life of Astronauts.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.439
With a new sunrise every 90 minutes interrupting
their natural circadian rhythms along with

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.020
loud engine noises, and floating in microgravity
it's much harder to sleep in space than on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.190
Earth.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.590
Astronauts have to tether sleeping bags to
the ground, ceiling, or wall so they don't

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.170
float around and bump into things.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.390
Aboard the International Space Station, crew
members have individual sleeping quarters

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.260
that are well ventilated so they're not surrounded
by the carbon dioxide they're exhaling.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.400
Ear plugs, sleep masks, and sleeping pills
are used to combat the unusual feeling of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.210
sleeping without gravity, yet still astronauts
get 30 to 60 minutes less sleep per night

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.019
on average compared to when they're on Earth.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.300
Since water won't naturally fall into a drain
system, astronauts get creative when it comes

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.520
to showering.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.370
Like taking a sponge bath where they moisten
a cloth using warm packaged water with soap

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.760
already mixed in, rubbing themselves down,
and drying off with a towel.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.960
Sometimes they can shower in a plastic cylinder
that goes from floor to ceiling to prevent

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.760
water from floating away.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.220
For their hair there is a rinseless shampoo
that is applied, rubbed in, and wiped off

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.500
with a towel.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.590
Because there's no washer or dryer - clothes
are disposable.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.740
Shirts, socks, and underwear are changed every
day or two and pants once a week.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.400
That's just inside the stabilized interior,
if they're required to go out into space it

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.730
gets a lot more complicated.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.030
Space suits must protect from a pressurized
atmosphere, provide oxygen, allow sight and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.520
movement, protect from radiation and micro
meteoroids, and do all of this while keeping

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.890
the human body at a comfortable temperature.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.479
There are 25 steps to take when getting into
and out of the 13 layer, 280 pound, 12 million

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.310
dollar suit referred to as an EMU.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.110
Astronauts select their food menus about 5
months before taking flight.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.420
Those selections are sent in for review and
analyzed for nutritional content because nutrition

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.629
is vital to the health of the crew.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.879
Each is provided with three meals a day plus
snacks with two days worth of emergency meals

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.790
per person if needed.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.519
Aboard the shuttles and at the ISS foods come
prepared in four ways: thermostabalized, rehydratable,

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.669
natural form, and irradiated.

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.529
They're stored in special packaging to prevent
anything from floating around and even condiments

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:49.659
like salt and pepper are suspended in liquid
to prevent particles from floating away.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.790
For exercise there's a treadmill, stationary
bike, or resistance training.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.700
Two and a half hours a day are devoted to
physical fitness.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.099
One reason this is so important is because
astronauts lose plasma throughout the body

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.029
because body fluids move around in microgravity
and exercise is proven to increase the amount

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.370
of plasma.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.220
When they're not working out or walking in
space they stay entertained by watching TV

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.310
streamed from Earth, working on the computer,
and reading.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.379
Along with doing experiments on how things
work in microgravity.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.749
Toilets are equipped with footholds and both
men and women can urinate standing up with

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.349
the aid of a funnel.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.919
When its time to sit down astronauts pull
a bar over their laps like when riding a roller

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.569
coaster that fastens to their thighs.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.579
To avoid anything floating around, space toilets
use flowing air instead of water to flush.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.489
When astronauts return from spacewalks and
remove their helmets there's a lingering odor

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.909
of what space smells like left on their suits
and it's described to be similar to burnt

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.909
metal.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.950
I'm gonna leave you with this - who is the
only US President to ever be present during

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.089
the launch of a shuttle?

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.669
Before we go here's last video's winner.
