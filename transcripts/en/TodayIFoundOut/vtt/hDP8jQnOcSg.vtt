00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:29.160
When it comes to science, we think there’s
a saying that is fairly applicable, “who

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.610
dares, wins”.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.370
Fans of military history may recognise that
as the motto of the Special Air Services (SAS).

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.719
However, we feel scientists and researchers
deserve to use it just as much, because sometimes

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.470
they take risks too.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.400
Just ask Nobel Prize winner Barry J. Marshall
if you don’t believe us.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.739
Marshall is known primarily for his work revolving
around peptic ulcers.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.540
If you don’t think that sounds important,
ask someone who has had them how painful they

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.200
are and then shield your groin from the barrage
of kicks as they try to give you some idea

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.289
of the crippling level of pain.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.450
Beyond the agony and the decreased quality
of life it can cause, peptic ulcers have been

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
linked to increased chances of one getting
stomach cancer.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.869
Prior to Marshall’s work, it was commonly
accepted by the medical community that ulcers

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.390
were caused by a combination of stress, spicy
food and too much stomach acid being produced.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.609
Something that many people still believe to
this day.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.530
Seriously, ask anyone on the street what causes
stomach ulcers and “stress” will likely

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.619
be one of the answers you’ll get.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.270
Marshall’s first significant encounter with
stomach ulcers was while training to become

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.670
a specialist in gastroenterology.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.969
During this time, he came into contact with
Dr Robin Warren, who just so happened to be

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.829
treating several patients with crippling stomach
ulcers.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.799
During treatment, Warren had collected samples
of a bacteria that seemed present in every

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.130
ulcer patient.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.709
This bacteria, Helicobacter pylori was later
found to be directly responsible for ulcers.

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.729
That said, neither Warren nor Marshall discovered
the bacteria.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.599
In his work, Helicobacter pylori: Physiology
and Genetics, Marshall himself penned a section

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.210
on how humanity has been aware of the bacteria
since 1893.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.270
Along with this, links between the bacteria
and ulcers had been suggested as early as

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.000
1940 by Dr. A. Stone Freedberg, a cardiologist
from Harvard.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.510
In fact, it’s widely accepted that if Freedberg
would have continued with his research into

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.650
these microbes and ulcers, he likely would
have solved the problem decades before Marshall

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
did.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.939
However, Freedberg’s boss pressured him
to abandon his research in favor of something

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.989
that would be easier to prove, so that’s
exactly what he did.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.579
In the meantime, millions of people suffered
and lost chunks of their stomachs via wholly

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.000
unnecessary surgery.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.280
One of the reasons Freedberg, and indeed just
about every other scientist and microbiologist

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.870
that wasn’t a crazed Australian, gave up
on this line of reasoning was due to overwhelming

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.760
opposition from the wider scientific community.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.230
As mentioned, up until Marshall shotgunned
a glass of the bacteria, the commonly accepted

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.790
cause of ulcers was stress and stomach acid,
as it was believed no bacteria could thrive

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.829
in the highly acidic environment of the stomach.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.310
You know, even though people had been finding
said bacteria in stomachs since 1893.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.299
There was also the fact that there was a lot
of documented evidence that antibiotics cleared

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.909
ulcers right up.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.730
In the case of Freedberg, when he made his
prediction about the link between bacteria

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.650
and ulcers and tests were inconclusive, his
superiors essentially told him to give up

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.140
and stop wasting his time.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.450
On a similar vein, when Greek doctor John
Lykoudis presented his findings that antibiotics

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.579
eradicated ulcers in 1964, his evidence was
largely ignored because it went against the

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.579
current consensus.

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.639
In fact, in 1968, when Lykoudis refused to
stop treating (and curing) his patients’

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.020
stomach ulcers with antibiotics, he was fined
4000 Drachma for his troubles and was largely

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.950
regarded as a quack until Marshall went freshman
on a glass of Helicobacter pylori.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.980
In other words, suggesting ulcers were caused
by anything other than stress was career suicide.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.569
Regardless, both Marshall and Warren continued
with their research and although the pair

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:18.079
managed to cultivate Helicobacter pylori,
they couldn’t make 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.910
it cause stomach ulcers, regardless of how
many piglets they injected it into.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.500
As Marshall stated,
“…1984 was a difficult year.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.440
I was unsuccessfully attempting to infect
an animal model.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.169
There was interest and support from a few
but most of my work was rejected for publication

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.319
and even accepted papers were significantly
delayed.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.569
I was met with constant criticism that my
conclusions were premature and not well supported.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.930
When the work was presented, my results were
disputed and disbelieved, not on the basis

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.750
of science but because they simply could not
be true.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.210
It was often said that no one was able to
replicate my results.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.550
This was untrue but became part of the folklore
of the period.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.410
I was told that the bacteria were either contaminants
or harmless commensals.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.090
At the same time I was successfully experimentally
treating patients who had suffered with life

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.220
threatening ulcer disease for years.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.600
Some of my patients had postponed surgery
which became unnecessary after a simple 2

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.500
week course of antibiotics and bismuth.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.630
I had developed my hypothesis that these bacteria
were the cause of peptic ulcers and a significant

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.310
risk for stomach cancer.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.199
If I was right, then treatment for ulcer disease
would be revolutionized.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.539
It would be simple, cheap and it would be
a cure.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.639
It seemed to me that for the sake of patients
this research had to be fast tracked.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.350
The sense of urgency and frustration with
the medical community was partly due to my

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.850
disposition and age.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.120
However, the primary reason was a practical
one.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.330
I was driven to get this theory proven quickly
to provide curative treatment for the millions

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.009
of people suffering with ulcers around the
world.”

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.710
He finally reasoned that there had to be an
easier way.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.389
Even though Marshall was absolutely convinced
the bacteria caused stomach ulcers, he couldn’t

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.870
test his theory on humans.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.580
However, no law could stop Marshall from testing
his theory on himself.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.440
Which is exactly what he did on June 12, 1984.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.229
Marshall finished his workday after drinking
the bacteria.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.889
If movies have taught me anything, scientists
who test their theories on themselves invariably

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.259
become either superheroes or supervillains,
and that’s kind of what happened here.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.599
At least, I assume most people who’ve had
the misfortune of suffering from ulcers consider

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.870
Mashall to be something of a superhero.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.360
So what exactly happened after he drank the
offending microbes?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.960
Despite Marshall thinking that it would take
weeks if not months for anything significant

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.991
to occur, just a few days later, he developed
ulcers for the first time in his life, along

00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:43.280
with presumably the inability to stop extending
his middle finger at the medical community.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.300
Marshall put a stop to his little experiment
after two weeks when his wife found out about

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.300
it.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.910
He didn’t need to be a scientist to know
that upsetting your wife is worse for one’s

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.009
well-being than stomach ulcers, even when
factoring in the potential increased risk

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.720
of getting stomach cancer.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.639
But, as he said, “She was already convinced
about the risk of these bacteria and I knew

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.360
I would never get her approval.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.430
This was one of those occasions when it would
be easier to get forgiveness than permission.”

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.099
After a biopsy to further document this event,
he then treated himself with antibiotics and

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.720
was soon fully cured of the ulcers.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.260
At this point, certain people within the medical
community started paying closer attention

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.699
to Marshall’s research and taking it a whole
lot more seriously.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:29.080
However, it still took time and a significant
amount of work and publicity to get the message

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:35.100
across; even into the early 1990s after curing
numerous people of ulcers and publishing several

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.289
papers on the subject, many in the medical
field still scoffed at him and even outright

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.919
accused him of pushing snake oil-like treatments
onto their patients through the media who

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.879
was eating up the battle Marshall was waging.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.500
Of course, the fact that these patients predominately
ended up cured was winning over more and more

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.500
medical professionals as time went by.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.879
Finally, in 1994, it all changed when the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) held a

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.689
two day summit in Washington D.C. over the
matter.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.330
They could no longer ignore the evidence.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.789
At the end of the summit, they released a
statement stating that “the key to treatment

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:07.050
of duodenal and gastric ulcer was detection
and eradication of Helicobacter pylori.”

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.159
With that stamp of approval on his work, the
majority of the holdouts in the medical community

00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:14.540
switched their stance and accepted Marshall’s
hypothesis.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.379
Eleven years later, in 2005, he was given
a Nobel prize for his work, which was all

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:23.270
the more impressive given the extreme opposition
he had faced.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.810
Sure, scientists (and really everyone) should
always question new ideas and thoroughly vet

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.810
them.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.370
But when a mountain of well documented evidence
in easily repeatable scientifically performed

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.320
experiments clearly shows the old theory was
wrong and the new one right, one shouldn’t

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.630
continue to oppose it just because it’s
not what was believed before.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.990
Yet, it took Marshall climbing on top of that
mountain of evidence and showing his ulcer

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.000
filled stomach before anyone started to listen.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.250
Let that be a lesson to everyone.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.090
Even the smartest of us humans are amazingly
susceptible to getting stuck in a “knowledge

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.090
rut.”

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.890
Always question everything, and never stop
learning.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.630
Bonus Fact:
• Funny enough, the first “news” agency

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.610
to report on Marshall’s little experiment
was Star newspaper, which as he put it was

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.470
“a tabloid that often features stories about
alien babies being adopted by Nancy Reagan.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.120
This was right up their alley.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.010
The next day the story appeared, ‘Guinea-pig
doctor discovers new cure for ulcers … and

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.590
the cause.’”

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.830
Needless to say, this wasn’t an auspicious
beginning to being taken seriously, but certain

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.480
key people did take notice thanks to the story,
and funding for further experiments started

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480
to trickle in.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.150
I’m not sure what’s more interesting about
this fact, that such a tabloid actually broke

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.570
a major world news story or the revelation
that they actually do real reporting sometimes

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:56.830
rather than just sitting around making stuff
up.
