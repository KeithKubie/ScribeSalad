00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.880
Hi there, my name’s John Green; this is
Crash Course: World History, and today we’re

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.470
going to talk about the fall of Rome.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.510
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
Who’s that pretty lady?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.960
That lady, me-from-the-past, is Emperor Justinian.
We’ll get to him in a minute.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:21.090
[Theme Music]

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.000
How and when Rome fell remains the subject
of considerable historical debate—

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.100
but today I’m going to argue that the Rome
didn’t really fully fall until the middle of the 15th century.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.180
But first, let me introduce you to The Traditional
View:

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.319
Barbarians at the Gates.
My, don’t you look traditional?

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.309
If you want to be really technical about it,
the city of Rome was

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.519
conquered by bar bar bar barbarians in 476
CE.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.199
There was a last Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus,
who ruled the empire for less than a year

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.409
before being deposed and sent into exile by
Odoacer,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.329
who was some kind of barbarian- we don’t
know for sure.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.449
Ostrogoth, Hun, Visigoth, Vandals;
they all looked the same to the Romans.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.429
Rome had been sacked by barbarians before,
most notably by Alaric the Visigoth in 410-

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.850
Is it Uh-lar-ick or Uh-lair-ick?
The dictionary says Uh-lair-ick but

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.530
The Vampire Diaries say Uh-lar-ick so
I’m going to go with Uh-lar-ick.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.979
But anyway, after 476, there was never again
a “Roman” emperor in Rome.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.509
Then there’s the hipper anti-imperialistic
argument—

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.659
that’s nice, but if you really want to go
full hipster

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.090
you should probably deny that you’re being
hipst—

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.859
right, exactly—which goes like this:

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.509
Rome was doomed to fall as soon as it spread
outside of Italy

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.159
because the further the territory is from
the capital,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.520
the harder it is to govern.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.539
Thus imperialism itself sowed the seeds of
destruction in Rome.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.679
This was the argument put forth by the Roman
historian Tacitus,

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.229
although he put it in the mouth of a British
chieftain.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.509
That sounded dirty, but it’s not,
it’s all about context here on Crash Course:

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.040
"To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying
name of empire; they make a desert and call it peace.”

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.310
There are two ways to overcome this governance
problem:

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.299
First, you rule with the proverbial topaz
fist—

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.490
that’s not the proverb? Really, Stan?
It’s an iron fist? But topaz is much harder

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.560
than iron.
Don’t these people know their Mohs scale of mineral hardness?..

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.240
Regardless,
the Romans couldn’t do this because their

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.090
whole identity was wrapped up in an idea
of justice that precluded indiscriminate violence.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.950
The other strategy is to try to incorporate
conquered people into the empire more fully:

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.150
In Rome’s case,
to make them Romans.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.330
This worked really well in the early days
of the Republic

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
and even at the beginning of the Empire.
But it eventually led to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.010
Barbarians inside the Gates.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.810
The decline of the legions started long before
Rome started getting sacked.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.209
It really began with the extremely bad decision
to incorporate Germanic warriors into the Roman Army.

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.599
Rome had a long history of absorbing people
from the empire’s fringes into the polity

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.399
first by making them allies and then
eventually by granting them full citizenship rights.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.740
But usually these “foreign” citizens had
developed ties to Rome itself;

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.150
they learned Latin, they bought into the whole
idea of the aristocratic republic.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.209
But by the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, though,
the empire had been forced to

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.769
allow the kind of riffraff into their army
who didn’t really care about the idea of

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.019
Rome itself.
They were only loyal to their commanders.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.879
—And as you no doubt remember from the historical
examples of

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.329
Caesar, Pompey, Marius, contemporary Afghanistan—
this is not a recipe for domestic bliss.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.170
So here is Rome,
stuck with a bunch of expensive and bloody

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.189
wars against Germanic peoples who were really
good at fighting

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.870
and then they had a great idea:
Why not fight with these guys?

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.079
So they essentially hired them
and soon the Roman Legions were teeming with

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.360
these mercenaries
who were loyal mostly to gold,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.329
secondarily to their commanders,
and not at all to Rome

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.319
which is a place that very few of them ever
even saw.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.200
I mean, why would they give a crap about the
health and well-being of the empire?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.469
Am I allowed to say crap, Stan?
Nice.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.790
This was of course a recipe for civil war,
and that’s exactly what happened with general

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.439
after general after general
declaring himself Emperor of Rome.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.969
So there was very little stability in the
West.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.989
For instance, between 235 and 284 CE, 41 different
people were either emperor or claimed to be emperor.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.719
And after the year 200,
many of the generals who were powerful enough

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.280
to proclaim themselves emperors weren’t
even Roman.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.609
In fact, a lot of them didn’t speak much
Latin.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.719
Oddly enough, one of the best symbols of the
new face of the Roman Empire was sartorial.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.000
Instead of the traditional tunic and toga
of the glory days of the Senate,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.140
most of the new general-emperors adopted that
most practical and most barbaric of garments: pants.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.480
Oh, which reminds me,
it’s time for the Open Letter.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.800
An Open Letter to Pants:

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.280
But first let's see what's inside the secret compartment.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.220
Oh, look, it's Rosie the Riveter! And she's wearing PANTS.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.940
Dear Pants, Although you eventually became
a symbol of patriarchal oppression,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.250
in your early days you were worn by both men
and women.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.700
And in the days of the Roman Republic, they
hated you.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.560
They thought you barbarous.
They thought that people wearing you was

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.160
the definition of people lacking civilization.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.560
They ventured north and the wind blew up through
their togas

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.570
and lo and behold, they adopted pants.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.450
And there’s a history lesson in that, pants,
which is that when people have to choose between

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.050
civilization and warm genitals,
they choose warm genitals.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.770
Best Wishes,
John Green

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.580
And now a note from our sponsor:
Today’s episode of crash course is brought

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.270
o you by
the all-new Oldsmobile Byzantium,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.070
mixing power and luxury in a way-
Really? Oldsmobile isn’t a company anymore?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.140
And Byzantium is a place?
Are you sure?

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.960
So remember when I said the Roman Empire survived
til the 15th century?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.720
Well that was the Eastern Roman Empire, commonly
known as the Byzantine Empire

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.690
(although not by the people who lived in it
who identified themselves as Romans).

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.910
So while the Western empire descended into
chaos,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.520
the eastern half of the Empire had its capital
in Byzantium,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520
a city on the Bosporus Strait that Constantine
would later rename Constantinople,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.880
thereby paving the way for
They Might Be Giants only mainstream hit.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.880
Constantine had lots of reasons to move his
capitol east.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.780
For one thing he was born in modern-day Croatia,
also he probably spoke better Greek than Latin,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.880
and plus the eastern provinces were a lot
richer than the Western provinces and

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.160
from a looting perspective, you just
want to be closer to where the good warring is.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.580
The enemies in the East, like the Persian
Parthians and the Persian Sassanians,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.380
were real empires,
not just bands of warriors.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.850
And no matter who you were in world history,
if you wanted to make a name for yourself

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.110
in terms of war,
you really needed to be up against the Persians.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.590
EVEN IF you were—
wait for it—

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.600
the Mongols.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.020
Not this time, friends.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.400
As the political center of the Roman Empire
shifted east,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.540
Constantine also tried to re-orient his new
religion, Christianity, toward the east,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.920
holding the first Church council in Nicaea
in 325.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.480
The idea was to get all Christians to believe
the same thing-

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.860
that worked-
but it did mark the beginning of the emperor

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.610
having greater control over the Church.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.380
That trend would of course later lead to tensions
between the church centered at Constantinople

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.270
and the one centered in Rome.
But, more on that in a bit.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.930
To give you a sense of how dramatic this shift
was,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.130
by the 4th century CE, Constantinople’s
population had soared

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.550
while Rome’s had gone from 500,000 to 80,000.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.510
And although the Byzantines spoke Greek not
Latin, they considered themselves Romans

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.490
and if they did then we probably should too.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.310
There was a lot of continuity between the
old, Western Roman Empire,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.010
and the new, Eastern one.
Politically, each was ruled by a single

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.310
(sometimes there were two, and once there
were four– but let’s forget about them

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.440
for now)
who wielded absolute military power.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.450
War was pretty much constant as the Byzantines
fought the Persian Sassanian Empire

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.110
and then various Islamic empires.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.480
Trade and valuable agricultural land that
yielded high taxes meant that the Byzantine

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.640
Empire was like the Western Roman Empire,
exceptionally rich,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.370
and it was slightly more compact as a territory
than its predecessor and much more urban,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.320
containing as it did all of those once independent
Greek city states,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.270
which made it easier to administer.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.780
Also like their Western counterparts, the
Byzantines enjoyed spectacle and sport.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.260
Chariot races in Constantinople were huge,
with thousands turning out at the Hippodrome

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.740
to cheer on their favorites.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.520
Big bets were placed and there was a huge
rivalry not just about sports

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.630
but also about political affiliations between
the two main teams,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.880
the Blues and the Greens-
Thanks for putting us on the Greens, Thought

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.660
Bubble.
That rivalry was so heated that riots often

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.030
broke out between them.
In one such riot, an estimated 30,000 people

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.720
were killed.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.080
Thanks Thought Bubble.
But perhaps the most consistently Roman aspect

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.470
of Byzantine society was that they followed
Roman law.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.070
The Romans always prided themselves on being
ruled by laws,

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.130
not by men,
and even though that’s not actually the

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.790
case after the second century BCE,
there’s no question that the Eastern Roman

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.910
Empire’s codification of Roman laws
was one of it’s greatest achievements.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.180
And much of the credit for that goes to the
most famous Byzantine Emperor,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.760
at least after Constantine,
Justinian.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.920
I like your brooch, sir.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:37.100
In 533 Justinian published the Digest, an
800,000-word condensation of 1,528 Latin law books.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.589
And to go along with this he published the
Institutes,

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:43.769
which was like a curriculum for the Roman
law schools that existed all through the Empire.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:47.519
Justinian, incidentally, was by far the most
awesome of the Byzantine emperors.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:49.620
He was like the David Tennant of doctors.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.399
He was born a peasant somewhere in the Balkans
and than rose to became emperor in 527.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:58.149
He ruled for almost 30 years and in addition
to codifying Roman law,

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:01.939
he did a lot to restore the former glory of
the Roman Empire.

00:09:01.939 --> 00:09:05.479
He took Carthage back, he even took Rome
back from the Goths, although not for long.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.400
And he’s responsible for the building of
one of the great churches in all of time—

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.420
which is now a mosque—
the Hagia Sophia or Church of Saint Wisdom.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.110
So after one of those sporting riots destroyed
the previous church,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.550
he built this,
which with its soaring domes became a symbol

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.120
for the wealth and opulence of his empire.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.920
The Romans were remarkable builders and engineers
and the Hagia Sophia is no exception:

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.399
a dome its equal wouldn’t be build for another
500 years.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.329
But you would never mistake it for a Roman
temple;

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:36.329
It doesn’t have the austerity or the emphasis
on engineering that you see, for instance, the Coliseum.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:39.430
And this building in many ways functions a
symbol for the ways the

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.250
Eastern Roman Empire was both Roman and not.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.490
But maybe the most interesting thing Justinian
ever did was

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.959
be married to his controversial Theater Person
of a wife,

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.920
Theodora.
Hey Danica, can we get Theodora up here?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.300
Wow that is perfect. It’s funny
how married couples always look like each other.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.480
Theodora began her career as an actress, dancer,
and possible prostitute before become Empress.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.810
And she may have saved her husband’s rule
by convincing him not to flee the city during

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.499
riots
between the Blues and Greens.

00:10:05.499 --> 00:10:08.870
She also mentored a eunuch
who went on to become a hugely important general-

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.899
Mentoring a eunuch sounds like a euphemism,
but it’s not.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.970
And she fought to expand the rights of women
in divorce and property ownership,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.490
and even had a law passed taking the bold
stance

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.589
that adulterous women should not be executed.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:23.050
So, in short,
the Byzantines continued the Roman legacy

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.790
of empire and war and law for almost 1000
years after Romulus Augustus was driven out of Rome.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.700
The Byzantines may not have spoken Latin,
and few of their emperors came from Rome,

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:38.310
but in most important ways they were Romans.
Except one REALLY IMPORTANT way.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.649
The Byzantines followed a different form of
Christianity,

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:43.959
the branch we now call Eastern or sometimes
Greek Orthodox.

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:47.249
How there came to be a split between the Catholic
and Orthodox traditions is complicated –

00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:48.959
you might even call it Byzantine.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.329
What matters for us are the differences between
the churches,

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:53.259
the main doctrinal one being about the dating
of Easter,

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:57.240
and the main political one being about who
rules whom.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.050
Did I get my whom right there, Stan?
YES!

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.170
In the West there was a Pope and in the East
there was a Patriarch.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.389
The Pope is the head of the Roman Catholic
Church.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:09.230
He sort of serves as god’s regent on earth
and he doesn’t answer to any secular ruler.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.709
And ever since the fall of Rome,
there has been a lot of tension in Western

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:16.839
Europe between Popes and kings
over who should have the real power.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:18.790
But in the Orthodox church they didn’t have
that problem

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.550
because the Patriarch was always appointed
by the Emperor.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.519
So it was pretty clear who had control over
the church,

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:29.779
so much that they even have a word for it-
caesaropapism: Caesar over Pope.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:33.819
But the fact that in Rome there was no emperor
after 476 meant there was no one to challenge

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:36.540
the Pope,
which would profoundly shape European history

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.879
over the next, like, 1200 years.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:42.569
So I would argue that in some important ways,
the Roman Empire survived for a thousand years

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:46.050
after it left Rome,
but in some ways it still survives today.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.629
It survives in our imagination when we think
of this as east, and this as west;

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:53.990
It survives in football rivalries that have
their roots in religious conflicts;

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.959
and it survives in the Justinian law code
which continues to be

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:59.509
the basis for much of civil law in Europe.

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:01.970
Next week we’ll talk about the emergence
of Islam over here...

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.090
How’d I do, Stan?
Well, you can’t win ‘em all.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.120
Thanks for watching.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.439
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller,

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:12.939
our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:16.360
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and
our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.240
Last week’s Phrase of the Week was
“Aristotelian logic”.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.800
You can guess this week’s Phrase of the
Week or suggest new ones in Comments,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.420
where you can also ask questions that our
team of historians will endeavor to answer.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.299
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don’t forget to be awesome.
