it's cheaper to make reality shows which

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220
it's cheaper to make reality shows which
 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.960
it's cheaper to make reality shows which
are which are very entertaining and you

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970

know it I think they're coming back

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710
know it I think they're coming back
 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.740
know it I think they're coming back
it everything's on a pendulum you know

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750
it everything's on a pendulum you know
 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.520
it everything's on a pendulum you know
you you can only entertain people with

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530
you you can only entertain people with
 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.920
you you can only entertain people with
the standard reality format so much and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930
the standard reality format so much and
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.560
the standard reality format so much and
people like stories they really do

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570
people like stories they really do
 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.800
people like stories they really do
people like sitcoms people like friends

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810
people like sitcoms people like friends
 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.080
people like sitcoms people like friends
so I think the pendulum is swinging back
