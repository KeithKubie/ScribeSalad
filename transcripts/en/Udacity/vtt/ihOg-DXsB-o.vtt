00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.710
Let us make this example
a little bit more complicated.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.890
Complicated enough that it cannot
be proven simply by applying

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.480
one instance of modus ponens.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.050
Imagine that a robot proved to itself
that this box is not liftable.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.780
And the humans in the factory
who were trying to make

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.830
fun of the robots said to the robot
well, the reason it's not liftable is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.130
not because it's not movable, but
because your battery is not working.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.080
So now the situation
is more complicated,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.130
the robot must also check its battery.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.340
So now the robot begins with
slightly different knowledge in this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.570
knowledge case.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.500
So suppose that the knowledge in its
knowledge basis, cannot move and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.520
battery full means it's not liftable.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.980
It finds from its concept.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.090
Again, it cannot move, so it checks its
battery, and it checks its battery and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.540
it finds that the battery's full.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.510
So then two new sentences that get
written in the knowledge base.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.730
By the knowledge base
contains three sentences.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.870
As earlier, the resolutions you're
improving, the agent must convert

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.960
all these sentences, in its knowledge
base into a conjunctive normal form.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.190
That means that the sentences
can contain a literal or

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.010
a disjunctional literal or
a conjunction of disjunctional literals.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.600
So if we begin by removing
the implication from sentence one,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.650
because an implication cannot occur
in a conjunctive normal form.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.030
So when we remove implication from
the first sentence we get this sentence.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.090
Where the sentence is not yet
satisfactory, it is not yet

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.270
a conjunctive normal form because this
is a disjunction of conjunctions.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.770
And what we want are conjunctions
of disjunctions.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.900
So we apply the deMorgan's Law and
now we get the following sentence.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.940
We're simply taking the negation inside
which flips the conjunction into

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.800
a disjunction and now we have three
liftables connected with disjunctions

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.720
and this is a conjunctive normal form,
disjunctional liftable.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.640
So now we have in the knowledge base,
three sentences, all three of them in

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.960
the conductor normal form, either
literals or disjunctional literals.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.650
Recall that the robot wanted
to prove not liftable.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.630
So it takes the negation of that,
this is again proof by refutation, so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.320
it considers liftable.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.370
So now this knowledge
base has four sentences.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.490
These four sentences coming from
the negation of what it wants to prove.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.720
Once again the reasoning begins by
the literal that it wants to prove,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.030
in this case liftable.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.130
It finds a sentence in which
the negation of literal is true.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.680
So once again,
we begin with the sentence,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.200
S4 because that is
what we want to prove.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.520
And we find a sentence in the knowledge
base which contains a literal

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.390
which is a negation of the literal in
this sentence S4 that we want to prove.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.730
We resolve on this because
they both cannot be true, and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.630
resolution here simply
means that we drop them.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.030
Now, in the sentence S1 that is
under consideration currently,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.880
we have two literals.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280
We can begin with either one of them.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.980
Let us begin with not battery full.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.770
We'll try to find a sentence
which contains a negation of

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.100
this particle electrode.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.110
There is a sentence, S3, which is a
negation of this so we resolve on this.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.950
Battery full and not battery full
because they both cannot be true.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.220
We'll drop them.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.910
Now in sentence S1 we are left
with just one literal, can-move.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.510
We can try to find a sentence in
the knowledge base which contains

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.840
a negational judge literal.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.380
Here it is, and so
we can resolve on them.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.480
And we resolve on them, we drop them.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.830
And once we drop them,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.930
then we have a null condition,
which stands for a contradiction.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.080
So we reached a contradiction, therefore
the assumption that this was liftable

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.010
cannot be true, therefore not liftable
is true, and we have just shown that

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.820
resolution theorem proving in this case
proves what the robot wanted to prove.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.420
One important point to note here is
the issue of focus of attention.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.640
Often when the problem space is very
complex, for example, when the number of

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.410
sentences is really large, the sentences
are very complex, it can become really

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.060
hard for the logical agent
to decide what to focus on.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.330
But because we have converted everything
in a conjunctive normal form, and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.040
because resolution theorem proving is
making use of resolution, therefore

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.200
at any particular time, the logical
agent knows exactly what to focus on.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.200
You always begin with this literal,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.390
you always try to find a sentence
which contains this negation.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.020
You always resolve on that.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.160
You take the remaining literal in
the sentence and proceed forward.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.350
This focus of attention, this
computational efficiency of resolution

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.720
theorem proving is arising because
a [INAUDIBLE] called horn clauses.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.570
A horn clause, is a disjunction that
contains at most one positive literal.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.460
This is happening in S1.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.785
This is a disjunction that contains
at most one positive recall.

00:04:56.785 --> 00:04:59.545
This is a negative recall,
this is a negative recall, and

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:02.415
the fact that it contains
just one positive recall,

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:06.805
is a very powerful idea because that's
where the focus of attention comes from.
