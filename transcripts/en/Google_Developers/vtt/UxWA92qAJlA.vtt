Hi, I'm Hernan Liendo, one of the 13 Google Developer Experts for Cloud Platform. I've been a university

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.670
professor for 15 years. 
 I'm also the Co-founder of Zupcat. Zupcat is the company

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.980
where I spend most of my time and it has allowed me to design technologies to create

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.269
massive games. In this video and in the next ones, I'll tell you the key to run products

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.600
used by millions of people around the world 
using Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.370
In ZupCat we have made ​​great strides 
like producing high quality games

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.339
which are distributed around the world. We also have over 15 million installs, and we have partnerships

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.580
with large companies in Asia and North America. We have achieved all this with great effort, 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.360
but also with the infrastructure that 
helps us in these massive requirements.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.729
Some numbers that allow us to understand the amount of computing are the hundreds 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.339
of thousands of events we run daily, or the thousands of challenges in real time that our players

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.890
play. We accomplish this by the automatic scaling 
that Google App Engine

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.010
provide us. This behavior 
can be seen in the Instance Administration Console

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.220
of App Engine. Here we can see what instances are pinned when more players enter the game 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.610
and then are returned when the number of players drops. We accomplish this with a simple 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.610
configuration in this file using the "Auto-Scaling" directive.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.300
Regarding the storage 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.840
we have more than 400 million 
entities in about 500 GB. App Engine allows us

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.070
to check the logs to a constant time which is independent of the number of customers 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.480
who want to access at the same 
time and the amount of records we have.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.530
We achieve this by auto-scaling that works as follows. When

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.380
a table has many records, App Engine automatically clones it, and from that moment 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
it began to distribute the consultations  in a more equitable manner. A very successful product requires 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.090
this enormous amount of load, 
but don't forget, we have to develop it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.979
 in a very short time, with low cost of development
 and we require a high availability

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.450
for worldwide users. We accomplish this through a combination of products such as

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.340
Cloud Datastore to host data.
We also use Cloud Storage to host content 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.090
and databases as Cassandra or Redis on Compute Engine. 
In the following

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.470
presentations I'm going to give much more details 
 about these products and also tell you 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.090
about the architecture used in our games, that is Open Source. 
See you next time!
