00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.780
&gt;&gt; John Kelly: Wouldn't you like
to be reincarnated as a taste bud

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.950
on Calvin Trillin's tongue?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.920
His books "American
Fried", "Alice Let's Eat"

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.940
and "Third Helping" the
so-called tummy trilogy recount

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.410
in wonderful detail meals
he has eaten both the good

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.690
and less frequently the bad.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.880
In our family, we still
quote one of his essays

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.580
in which he quoted a daughter
dismissing inferior bagels

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.900
as round bread.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.200
That's not a bagel.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.970
That's just round bread.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.420
Calvin Trillin is the
[inaudible] of pleasure, I think,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.340
not in any fussy overly
aesthetic way

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.910
but in the honest pleasure
that's to be found in a stack

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.250
of barbecued ribs or a decent
honest bagel or fresh corn,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.200
or as in his novel,
"Temper Isn't Going Out.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.480
The Pleasure of the
Perfect Parking Spot."

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.330
I love what Wikipedia had to say
about Temper Isn't Going Out.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.000
It said, " It is unusual
among novels

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.690
for exploring the subject
of parking."

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.800
I did not look to see if the
Melville entry in Wikipedia said,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.860
"It is unusual among novels for
exploring the subject of whales."

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.860
Calvin Trillin started out as
a journalist at Time Magazine.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.190
His first piece is in The New
Yorker about desegregation

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.770
at the University of Georgia
were published in 1963.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.930
He's been appearing regularly
in its pages ever since.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.110
In the summer of 1990
prompted by the sound

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
of John Sununu's last
name, he wrote the first

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.590
of a series of short poems.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.870
"If you knew what Sununu knew."

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.360
I wonder what politician's last
name would be worthy of parody now.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.390
That was in the nation
and he continues

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.830
to skew our nations politics and
culture in verse on deadline.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.130 position:56%
In 2012, Calvin Trillin received the
Thurber Prize for American Humor.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.300
He once said, "I actually think of
being funny as an odd turn of mind.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.410
Like a mild disability.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.850
Some weird way of looking at the
world that you can't get rid of."

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.280 position:56%
Aren't we glad that you're disabled.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.620
His new book is called "No Fair.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.590
No Fair. And Other Jolly
Poems of Childhood."

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.980
It is illustrated by his New
Yorker accomplice Roz Chast.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.540
His poems now are often very
short in The Nation so I'm going

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.300
to keep the rest of this
introduction very short.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.960
Welcome all.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.510
Let's have a ball as we start
chilling with Calvin Trillin.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.210
[ Applause ]

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.620
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Thank you.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.920
Thank you John.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.460
Can you hear me?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.920
I told John not to --
it was not necessary

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.100
to have some complicated
introduction.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:38.110 position:56%
Just something simple like not since
Mark Twain or something like that.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.110
If I seem in a cheerier mood than a
lot of people here and less nervous

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.510
about the election, it's because
I already have a house in Canada.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.100
[ Laughter ]

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.660
Let me make a couple of corrections
to that lovely introduction

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.100
or things that John left out.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.060 position:56%
We think that "Temper Isn't Going
Out" is the first parking novel ever

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.100
written, and I'd also like
to say about the poetry,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.880
I get paid $100 a poem no
matter how long the poem is.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.950
So, if I write a short poem
which is why I write short poems,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.140
I'm the highest paid poet
in the United States.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.930
Most poets get paid by the line.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.180
So, if I want to get the
buzz you get from working

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.200
at the absolute top
dollar in your field,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.210
I just write even a four line poem.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.030
Like in 2008 election I
wrote one about Mitt Romney.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.110
Yes, Mitt is smooth of speech
and smooth of [inaudible].

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.620
Reminds us all of Ken,
of Ken and Barbie.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.880
So quick to shed his
moderate regalia.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.510
He may like Ken be
lacking genitalia.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.010
[ Laughter ]

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.000
The origin of this book, "No Fair.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.290
No Fair" is my life experience,
partly with my grandchildren,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.330
partly with my children, and
partly when I was growing

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.360
up with an older sister
known as Suki, the oppressor.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.430
The idea of doing it in poetry
started when my youngest grandson,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.370
Netty, was slow in getting dressed.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.430
He was about seven and his mother
said, "Netty, put your pants on,"

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.580
and I found myself saying
or actually singing.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.550
I won't trouble you
with the singing.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.240
"Oh, this is such a silly rule that
people must wear pants to school.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.080
A better rule a wise man said was
wear your underpants instead."

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.320
And that sort of started
me on the idea

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.820
of writing a book about
childhood really.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.740
But as I say, part of it was

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.230
from my own experience
with Suki the oppressor.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.970
We used to share the
backseat on long trips.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.600
I lived in Kansas City which the
real estate people would call

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.440
equally convenient to either
coast, and my father thought

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.070
that we should see the country.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.190
So, we took long motor
trips when we were children

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.520
and we shared the backseat and
there was an invisible line

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.700
down the middle of the backseat.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.530
At least she said it was the
middle and there was a lot

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.830
of tension around that line.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.170
I compared it to the
tension between countries.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.950
Say between the Soviet
Union and Finland.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.250
I played Finland.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.760
Then my father said something
that I think he meant well

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.960
but he had old fashioned values.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.420
He said, "We do not hit girls.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.150
You will never hit
your sister again."

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.230
Suki was not visited with
a similar injunction.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.470
So, I became a unilaterally
disarmed Finland.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.530
My father meanwhile was pointing
out the Buicks and the [inaudible].

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.380
I think now if I hadn't had to stay
on a constant alert from a sister

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.420 position:56%
with expansionist backseat policies,
I would now know the difference

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.050
between a Buick and a [inaudible].

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.140
There's also a poem in here
-- so there's a poem about --

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.580
it's called "The Backseat" in here.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.450
There's another poem that's
called "To Get A Pet."

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.400
Children have different
ideas of pets.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.890
Those of you who are
parents know this

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.320
and again I harken
it to my childhood.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.460
We had a collie puppy named Chubby
and Chubby was quite sickly.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.150
And then one day, Chubby was
gone and we said to our parents,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.460
"Where's Chubby," and they
said, "Well, Chubby --

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.960
we have friends who have a farm.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.160 position:56%
We thought Chubby would be happier
and healthier in the farm frolicking

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.800
in the barn yard with
the other animals."

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.350
I didn't think much of
it and I didn't think

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.520
about Chubby for a long time.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.360
Then I was home from college
and Chubby's name was brought up

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.850
and I said, "Why didn't we ever
go visit Chubby at the farm?"

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.220
Suki said, "There wasn't
any farm you dummy.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.100
Chubby had to be put down,"
and I said, "Chubby's gone?"

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.760
My mother said, "He'd
be gone in any case.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.170
Collies don't usually
live 18 or 20 years."

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.200
I said, "Why am I just
hearing about it now?"

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.510
My father said, "It's not our
fault you're slow on the uptake."

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.470
[ Laughter ]

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:41.150
Then about a week or so
after I wrote about Chubby

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.260
in some place, I got
a call from Suki.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.800
She said the collie
was not called Chubby.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.300
The Collie was called George.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:59.150
"You were called Chubby."

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.800 position:56%
There's another poem about
somebody who asked the same question

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.370
of children he meets, a
kind of ice-breaker question

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.410
which as it happens, I
asked children just to sort

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:17.340
of break the ice if I'm left
alone with a kid, I say,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.360
"Who's the nastiest awfullest
meanest kid in your whole class?"

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.960
You'd be surprised how
often the answer is Jason.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.080
I'm not quite sure why but those
of you who are about to have a baby

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.850
and are thinking of names
ought to think about that.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:47.860
And there's a poem about trying
to send back a baby here.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.830
That is from the best
story I ever heard

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.390
about older children
responding to the birth

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:02.280
of a new child was some people I
know who had a three-year-old boy

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.930
and then they had another
little boy.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.200
Everything seemed fine
for about six weeks

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.640
and then the three-year-old walked
into their bedroom one morning

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.890
and said, "I think this would be
a good day to send Brandon back

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.210
to his real mommy and daddy."

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.030
So, that's in this story and
there's some stuff about fantasy

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.150
in this story that
I fantasize about.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:33.100
There's a story about a little
boy who eats everything.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.270
One of the lines is,
"His tum it seems

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.650
at times was nearly bottomless.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.030
His dad said Matt would
eat a hippotamus,"

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.980
and I think that's sort
of a wish fulfillment.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.190
I had two girls and one of
them was a very picky eater.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.110
Particularly, I had troubles
getting her to eat vegetables.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:03.030 position:56%
And one day my wife made the most
elaborate concoction out of spinach.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.740
World famous chefs would have
fainted at eating this spinach

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.360
and we asked her to
test the spinach.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.910
She took what I use to
call one of her micro-bites

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:22.760
and then we all waited for her
opinion and she said, "Well,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.060
it's better than a carrot."

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.970
We found that a very
valuable phrase to use.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:37.230
Sometimes we'd see a movie and say,
"Well, it's better than a carrot,"

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.030
and sometimes we'd
see a movie and say,

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:48.400
"Not quite as good as a carrot."

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.650
And I think some of
the poems are a fantasy

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.700
of my vengeance on
Suki the oppressor.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.350
I mean, Suki's very nice now.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.150
Well --

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.200
[ Laughter ]

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.140
-- I once upon Suki's request, no,

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:21.140 position:56%
I'll say upon Suki's order dedicated
a book to her and I showed it

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.760
to my wife and said, "What do you
think about this as a dedication?"

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.060
And it said, "To my sister Suki Fox

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.150 position:56%
and a first tentative step toward
forgiving her for trying to throw me

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.540
down the laundry chute in 1937."

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.870
My wife said I couldn't
use the laundry chute part.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.080
I said, "Why not?"

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.580
She said, "It's not gracious."

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.800
I said, "Attempted
murder is not gracious."

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.480 position:56%
Suki recently had a big birthday and
we sent her a tape and I started it

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.430
by saying, "Well, you're
80 now Suki.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.500
It occurred to me it might
be an appropriate time for me

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.430
to forgive you once and for
all for trying to throw me

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.820
down the laundry chute in 1937."

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.510
But then I thought, there's time.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.260
[ Laughter ]

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.960
I'd like to read one
of the fantasy poems.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.870
This one's about a
sister named Jenny.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.610
Jenny's a better rhyme than Suki.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:41.960
I have to get my glasses on first.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.060
This book is illustrated
by the way, as you heard,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.950
by Roz Chast, who is
simply a genius.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:03.160
She sort of makes the book.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.430
This poem is called -- I'm
not sure I can see here.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.770
Excuse me.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:14.480
Let me -- this book is called
"Could Jenny Get This Shot For Me?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.410
I've Done So Much For Her."

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:22.570
This was actually inspired by one
of my nephews who when he was taken

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.780
to the doctor for a shot, when they
parked the car said to his mom,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.520
"Maybe you should get this for me.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.820
I'll just wait in the car."

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.050
I know the shot will guard me
from the measles and the mumps.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.370
Diseases that could leave me with
two different kinds of lumps.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.320
I'm glad the stuff that's in the
shot will keep me safe from harm

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.980
but can't they put the needle
into someone else's arm?

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.630
If so, my older sister
is the person I'd prefer.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.330
Could Jenny get this shot for me?

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.920
I've done so much for her.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.440
He once read her a fairy tale
she loved and ever since,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.870
she's thought a certain frog if
kissed would turn into a prince.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.210
Remember what I did for her?

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.140
I'm sure you didn't miss it.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.130
I threw my pet frog in her lap
and then I said, "So, kiss it."

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.450
That frog was only one of
many favors that there were.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.570
Could Jenny get this shot for me?

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.960
I've done so much for her.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.790
Once Jenny on a summer day
was in her party clothes

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.970
and seeing just how hot she
was, I sprayed her with a hose.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:37.730
Once noticing how much the
same her dollies all appeared,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.160
I gave one doll a different
look by drawing on a beard.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.590
She has to be so grateful
for my favors.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.160
There have been many.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.500
So, could she get this shot for me?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.060
I've done so much for Jenny.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.190
[ Applause ]

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:03.430
Well, I'm sure that's given you
meat for many profound questions.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.940
I've just wrecked the stage.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:14.810
So, if anybody has any
questions, step to the microphone.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.200
There's a question.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.160
Oh, no, there's just a look.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.570
Questions?

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.920
There's a question.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.400
&gt;&gt; Just wondering as the
grandson of a bagel baker,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.760
once you get out of New York City,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.670
do you have a favorite
place for bagels?

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.070
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Well, you heard
the quote from my daughter Abigail

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.570
when she was four that
in Kansas City,

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.320
bagels taste just like round bread.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:59.480
I remember doing a column once on
a new finding in emergency rooms,

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.440
not in New York but out in the
country where people cut themselves

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:11.560 position:56%
on trying to slice frozen bagels out
in what I call the bagel barrens.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.070
And, of course, there
wasn't any problem,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.610
and one of the New York
emergency room doctors said,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:24.140
"Some of those places are just
ethnically unprepared for bagels."

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.310
But I like Montreal Bagels.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:34.040
They're sort of sweet, and I
just read a story that somebody

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:40.210 position:56%
in Cincinnati is trying to make
very good bagels but it's difficult.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:45.380
And of course, everybody says it's
the water in New York and they say

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.250
that about the pizza too.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.100
So, I don't know.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.350
I think it's just old-fashioned
preparation.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:19:01.890
The bagel place near me was started
by a German-Irish guy from Queens

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:07.230
who sold to the people who ran the
pizza parlor next door who were

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.310
of course from the Middle East

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.500
and their bagels were rolled
out at night by Thais.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.980
The Thais have taken over the
bagel ruling from the Dominicans.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.040
Yes, ma'am?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.310
&gt;&gt; Hi. I love you first of all.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.610
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Oh, chucks.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.910
Chucks.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.210
[ Laughter ]

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.620
&gt;&gt; I remember reading
"Alice Let's Eat" lying

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.590
on the living room sofa
literally falling off

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.500
because I was laughing so hard.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.800
And my question --

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.440
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Oh, by the way,
I'm not liable for any of that.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.740
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.040
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin:
That's not actionable.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.340
We've checked this before.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.110
&gt;&gt; No lawsuits.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.940
The three writers who make me
laugh out loud are P.G. Wodehouse,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.260
E.F. Benson, and Calvin
Trillin, and I'm wondering

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.550
who makes you laugh
when you read them?

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.610
Laugh out loud?

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:58.970
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: I'm
not much of a laugher.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.970
&gt;&gt; I never would have guessed.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.690
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: But
I think a lot of people,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.510
Dave Perry used to make me laugh.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.160
He sort of quit writing.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.720
Kind of turned to the
more lucrative area

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.120
of young adult books and things.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.370
Although he just wrote
a book about Florida.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.640
I used to laugh a lot at a writer

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.550
who was considered sort
of low-brow I think.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.130
It was Max Shulman.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.960
I gave one of his books
to my daughter

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.580
and he could hear her
laughing in her room.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.800
She was about 14, and I meant to
find out where he was and write him

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.330
and say, "It's nice to make
two generations laugh."

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.570
I remember actually the
passage where Doby Gillis

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:59.530 position:56%
which later became a television show
and Doby's mother is saying, "Doby,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.990
you're going off to college
and here I am no smarter

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.680
than your hound dog Fred over
in the corner playing dead."

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.690
And he says, "Watch how
you talk about Fred, mom."

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.250
She said, "Look at him
playing dead over there."

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:26.830 position:56%
She says, "Doby, I meant to tell you
Sarah liked that as much as I did."

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.130
Thank you.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.420
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.430
&gt;&gt; I love the way you have those
reminisces about the rivalries.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.810
I'm in the middle of seven kids
and you've got me thinking a lot

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.380
about stuff that is
still to be forgiven.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.380
But what I'm not hearing is
your sister's perspective.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.180
What would she say in
retort to some of the --

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.480
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: I'm sorry.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.780
I couldn't hear you.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.080
Could you say it again?

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.380
&gt;&gt; What is your sister's
-- that's what happened.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.680
Okay.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: No, no, go ahead.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.280
I really didn't hear you.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.580
&gt;&gt; Well, seriously then, what would
be your sister's retort to some

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.130
of the liabilest things
you're saying about her?

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:04.480
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Well,
the laundry chute incident,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.660
the attempted murder
incident is very easy.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.830
She told one of my
daughters I was too fat

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.950
to fit down the laundry chute.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.850
And then, I don't know.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.790
I would say that on the incursion
on my side of the front seat,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.340
I would say if you read
what Vladimir Putin says

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:35.230
about the Ukraine, you get
pretty much what Suki would say.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.810
&gt;&gt; I also love you and [inaudible].

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:44.000
For those of us who can't make
your New Yorker tour of Chinatown,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.680
do you have any recommendations
there?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.770
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Well,
a lot of places are good.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:59.690
The real Chinese food freaks
go to Queens or Brooklyn now,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.360
but I live about an eight or nine
minute bike ride to Chinatown

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.090
so I tend to still go to Chinatown.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.030
One of the places we stop
at [inaudible] Restaurant

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.370
where we stop on the tour.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.320
It's really kind of a walk --

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.100
snacking walk, is Xi'an's
Famous Food

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:28.760
which has something I love called
a spicy lamb and cumin sandwich.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.830
Sometimes when I go to
Chinatown I just pick up things.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.230
Like there's a place called Super
Taste which I found when I stopped

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.940
on my bike because I saw
what I thought was one

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.690
of the best restaurant names
I have seen in New York,

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.550
New City Fish Balls, and it
turned out that there are a lot

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.280
of hand-pulled noodle
places on Eldrige Street

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:02.820
and the one I would go to is
Super Taste, and I get a bag

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:11.980
of frozen dumplings, 50 for $9.00,
and I put them in the freezer

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:17.410 position:56%
because I've seen those movies where
the Apaches attack and you can't go

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:22.160
out and I dump them in
boiling water and I'm done.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.870
&gt;&gt; You asked me who
the most annoying kid

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:38.110
in my class was and I said Michael.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.510
What advice can you give me
for annoying kids like Michael?

any organized crime connections,

I guess.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.240
This is Theo who suffered -- that's
right, your name is Theo, right?

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.870
Get rid of that kid.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.590
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Or have
him change his name to Jason.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:33.580
&gt;&gt; You write extensively about
parking in New York City,

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:39.540 position:56%
and I'm wondering how you feel about
Uber now using driverless cars.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:45.000
Would you be comfortable
in a driverless car?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: I don't think I'm
quite ready for a driverless car,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.750
and parking is difficult
in certain neighborhoods.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.520
And then I keep my car in a garage.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.090
I used to do the alternate
side parking thing

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:03.280
but I heard somebody say in New
York about alternate side parking.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.830
You can either have a car or a job.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:12.780
It takes up your life and
a lot of people are afraid

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:17.780
to move their cars once
they get a good spot.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.780
And [inaudible], I think
there was a passage

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.380
where that was how this young
man rated the young women he met.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.670
Was she worth moving the
car for out of the spot

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.930
that was good for tomorrow?

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.950
&gt;&gt; First I want to thank you for
many hours of enjoyable reading.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:47.180
I used to live in Kansas City so I
was wondering what you missed most

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.720
about Kansas City if anything.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.480
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin: Well,
everything, and I don't doubt

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.510
that you live there but I have to
say a lot of people claim to be

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.990
from Kansas who aren't
just for the prestige.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.900
&gt;&gt; I really am from Kansas City.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.360
&gt;&gt; Calvin Trillin:
I'm glad to hear that.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.960
I miss everything.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.260
Thank you.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.750
I think we're done.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.940
[ Applause ]

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.600
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
