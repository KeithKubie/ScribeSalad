00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.040
Bacteria are everywhere, and they’re incredibly
versatile.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.200
They can get us sick, they’re essential
good guys in our digestive system...and they

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.139
almost defy the laws of physics to create
a fluid that basically could power a perpetual

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.139
motion machine??

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.860
I didn’t see that coming.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.490
Ok, some vocab here.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.690
For fluids, friction is expressed as viscosity:
the less friction in a fluid, the lower its

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.180
viscosity.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.000
Superfluids are materials that seem to not
be bound by the power of friction.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.930
They have ‘frictionless flow’ and therefore
zero viscosity, which means they aren’t

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.300
stopped or slowed down by their own internal
motion, and so don’t lose momentum when

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.180
moving--give it one first push, and then you’re
good.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.970
It’ll just keep going.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.940
For the most part, this property has only
been observed in liquid helium when it’s

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.730
at close to absolute zero, and its behavior
is due to some funky quantum stuff.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.670
But scientists have now observed this phenomenon
in water.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.170
I mean can you imagine what could we do with
water that moves on its own??

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110
Now, I bet you saw this coming--it’s not
just any old water.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.079
It’s water filled with E. coli.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.499
If that makes you squirm a little, trust me--I
get it.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:10.079
Usually when we hear the name of that bacteria
it’s in the context of a nasty outbreak

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.220
of a disease we’re hoping not to catch,
but there’s a lot more to this little creature

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.090
that the bad rap it catches in the press.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.329
See, usually when you add little bits of things
to water, pieces of dirt, clumps of sand,

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.210
other ‘particulate matter’--the motion
of the water slows down.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.340
That’s because the surfaces of the particulate
are exerting extra friction on each other

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.799
and on the water, giving the fluid a higher
viscosity, meaning it takes more energy to

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.679
keep the whole thing swirling around.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.229
You’d think that adding organisms would
do the same, but that’s where you’d be

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.859
wrong, my friend.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.539
Bacteria are full of surprises, and not always
bad ones.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.069
If you put E. coli in water, they swim.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.851
They all swim in their own directions with
no real organized movement, they don’t usually

00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:50.399
have their act together.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.359
But if there are enough of them, the ripples
caused by each of their little bodies’ movement

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.609
starts affecting the other bacteria’s directions.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.920
Their motion starts to be more collective,
and when around 10-20% of your water is filled

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.590
with bacteria, they start to form tiny swirling
currents.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.340
But at this point their direction and movement
are still pretty random, they don’t radically

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.299
change the behavior of the water.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.800
But then when you add a force--say, you put
some of this bacteria-filled water between

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.829
two microscope slides--the motion gets organized.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.459
The shearing force of the glass slide makes
all the bacteria align their collective movement

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.760
in a particular direction because they have
these irregularly shaped, oblong bodies.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.280
This pushes on the water in a way that makes
that water exhibit superfluid properties.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
Zero viscosity.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.879
Those little guys could just keep rollin’
and rollin’ and no one can stop them!

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.122
(*mutters to self* ok Maren tone it down,
no one can know you want bacteria to take

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.769
over the world)
The experts are still a little unclear on

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.209
the nitty-gritty physics specifics of exactly
how the bacteria’s motion does this.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.459
But the effect is real.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.180
The recently published experimental data is
supported by previous theoretical work, and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.849
has some crazy real-life implications.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.569
Because the motion of a superfluid is frictionless
and therefore only needs to be set into motion

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.790
once, there is a potential for it to be used
as a ‘fuel’.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.549
You could set your super-water in motion--which
would take some initial energy investment--and

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.079
then you watch its motion power a motor or
a turbine...essentially forever.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.549
(I say essentially because the solid moving
parts of the motor itself would probably be

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.060
slowed down by friction, so you’d need to
give it a nudge every now and then.)

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.489
Plus, when we’re talking about a hypothetical
motor, at this point we’re talking pretty

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.280
small and not necessarily that fast.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.420
Scaling this operation up in any way is going
to require a lot more work.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.719
And then there’s the whole problem of the
fact that the bacteria are living organisms,

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.230
so you have to feed them.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.249
You gotta fuel the fuel, so to speak.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.569
And they’re kinda picky--you really have
to get their care and feeding right for them

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.850
to work properly, so that’s an issue that
needs to be reckoned with.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.219
There’s lots more work to be done in uncovering
the details of just how this does what it

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.930
does, but superfluids powered by bacteria
are exciting.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.030
And not just for their potential as a ‘fuel’,
but also because their superfluid characteristics

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.280
could allow them to move into spaces on their
own without having to be forced or injected,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.060
meaning they could help do things like clear
up spilled pollutants.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.320
But for now, we’re just inching toward that
future.
