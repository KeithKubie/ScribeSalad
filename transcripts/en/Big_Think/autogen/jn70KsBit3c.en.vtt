is this question of scientific literacy

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
is this question of scientific literacy
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.190
is this question of scientific literacy
in the United States is in fact one of

in the United States is in fact one of
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.040
in the United States is in fact one of
our greatest challenges what we

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050
our greatest challenges what we

our greatest challenges what we
scientists would want people to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
scientists would want people to
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.299
scientists would want people to
understand is a our science is not a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
understand is a our science is not a

challenge to their religion because

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
challenge to their religion because
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.019
challenge to their religion because
that's the tension that we can see

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
that's the tension that we can see
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.939
that's the tension that we can see
rising in our society you'll remember

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
rising in our society you'll remember
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.320
rising in our society you'll remember
earlier I talked about the fact that we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
earlier I talked about the fact that we
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.529
earlier I talked about the fact that we
build theories we don't build truths as

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
build theories we don't build truths as
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.210
build theories we don't build truths as
I understand religions they're about

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
I understand religions they're about
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300
I understand religions they're about
truths that's a different thing and in

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
truths that's a different thing and in
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950
truths that's a different thing and in
fact it's that wall that actually

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
fact it's that wall that actually
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410
fact it's that wall that actually
protects religion from science and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
protects religion from science and
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540
protects religion from science and
vice-versa the fact that they're really

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
vice-versa the fact that they're really
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.540
vice-versa the fact that they're really
about very different things Stephen Jay

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
about very different things Stephen Jay
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119
about very different things Stephen Jay
Gould used to call them non-overlapping

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
Gould used to call them non-overlapping
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030
Gould used to call them non-overlapping
magisteria and I think that's about

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
magisteria and I think that's about
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.799
magisteria and I think that's about
right

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809
right
 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.500

even Galileo this makes this comment

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
even Galileo this makes this comment
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150
even Galileo this makes this comment
about the different spheres in which

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
about the different spheres in which
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.119
about the different spheres in which
these two activities reside so I think

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
these two activities reside so I think
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.299
these two activities reside so I think
that's of great importance to us because

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309
that's of great importance to us because
 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.119
that's of great importance to us because
we know from looking at several thousand

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
we know from looking at several thousand
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369
we know from looking at several thousand
years of history that when religion and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
years of history that when religion and
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.750
years of history that when religion and
science clash science generally loses

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760
science clash science generally loses
 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.950
science clash science generally loses
for example over two thousand years ago

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960
for example over two thousand years ago
 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.570

there were two philosophers named

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
there were two philosophers named
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.679
there were two philosophers named
Aristotle thought the knees and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689
Aristotle thought the knees and
 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.230
Aristotle thought the knees and
Aristarchus who figured out that the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
Aristarchus who figured out that the
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.830
Aristarchus who figured out that the
earth was round this belief was in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
earth was round this belief was in
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.310
earth was round this belief was in
conflict with beliefs about the Olympian

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
conflict with beliefs about the Olympian
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.340
conflict with beliefs about the Olympian
gods and so this scientific fact was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
gods and so this scientific fact was
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.789
gods and so this scientific fact was
lost until it was rediscovered with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
lost until it was rediscovered with
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740
lost until it was rediscovered with
Comper nika's about eighteen hundred

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
Comper nika's about eighteen hundred
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.780
Comper nika's about eighteen hundred
years later so the religion there wasn't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
years later so the religion there wasn't
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520
years later so the religion there wasn't
our one of our modern religions but it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
our one of our modern religions but it
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.649
our one of our modern religions but it
was a religion and there are other

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
was a religion and there are other
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.350
was a religion and there are other
examples the first person who had the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
examples the first person who had the
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760
examples the first person who had the
idea that there might be life on another

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
idea that there might be life on another
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340
idea that there might be life on another
planet was a priest by the name of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
planet was a priest by the name of
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.929
planet was a priest by the name of
Giordano Bruno he paid in part for this

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
Giordano Bruno he paid in part for this
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.709
Giordano Bruno he paid in part for this
with his life so science loses when a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
with his life so science loses when a
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.499
with his life so science loses when a
society sees science and conflict with a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
society sees science and conflict with a
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.179
society sees science and conflict with a
religion we could do other examples so

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
religion we could do other examples so
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.550
religion we could do other examples so
that's one thing the other thing that we

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
that's one thing the other thing that we
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.749
that's one thing the other thing that we
would want people to know about is that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
would want people to know about is that
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.170
would want people to know about is that
science is a process by which we are

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
science is a process by which we are
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.770
science is a process by which we are
trying to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
trying to
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.949
trying to
decrease our ignorance we want to know

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959
decrease our ignorance we want to know
 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.720
decrease our ignorance we want to know
more about the universe we want to know

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
more about the universe we want to know
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.059
more about the universe we want to know
it more accurately and the ultimate

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
it more accurately and the ultimate
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.000
it more accurately and the ultimate
purpose of this knowing is to increase

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
purpose of this knowing is to increase
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.970
purpose of this knowing is to increase
the storehouse of human knowledge which

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980
the storehouse of human knowledge which
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.150
the storehouse of human knowledge which
is ultimate to be used to increase the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
is ultimate to be used to increase the
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.120
is ultimate to be used to increase the
quality of human life I think most of us

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
quality of human life I think most of us
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.150
quality of human life I think most of us
who do science would not do this if

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
who do science would not do this if
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.760
who do science would not do this if
someone said you can learn all these

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770
someone said you can learn all these
 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.949
someone said you can learn all these
things but at the end of the day it's

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959
things but at the end of the day it's
 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.250
things but at the end of the day it's
not for increasing everyone's quality of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260
not for increasing everyone's quality of
 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.250
not for increasing everyone's quality of
life so I would personally want a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
life so I would personally want a
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.080
life so I would personally want a
scientifically literate citizen to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
scientifically literate citizen to
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.479
scientifically literate citizen to
understand that you're that scientists

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489
understand that you're that scientists
 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.860
understand that you're that scientists
are people that are really working on

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
are people that are really working on
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.650
are people that are really working on
behalf of not perhaps you but that would

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660
behalf of not perhaps you but that would
 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.540
behalf of not perhaps you but that would
be nice but maybe it's your children or

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550
be nice but maybe it's your children or
 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.040
be nice but maybe it's your children or
your grandchildren or your great-great

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050
your grandchildren or your great-great
 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.540

great-great-great grandchildren that in

great-great-great grandchildren that in
fact it's a it's a commitment to

fact it's a it's a commitment to
 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.520
fact it's a it's a commitment to
humanity and then I guess the final

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
humanity and then I guess the final
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.199
humanity and then I guess the final
thing that I'd like for the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
thing that I'd like for the
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.210
thing that I'd like for the
scientifically literate citizen to do is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
scientifically literate citizen to do is
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.180
scientifically literate citizen to do is
to be a lifelong learner to not

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
to be a lifelong learner to not
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.880
to be a lifelong learner to not
disengage because most people disengage

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890
disengage because most people disengage
 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.370
disengage because most people disengage
from science after they leave University

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380
from science after they leave University
 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.810
from science after they leave University
because it's not relevant to their life

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
because it's not relevant to their life
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.400
because it's not relevant to their life
they're doing something else making

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410
they're doing something else making
 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.550
they're doing something else making
money making a life but we're now moving

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
money making a life but we're now moving
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.199
money making a life but we're now moving
into a period in the history of our

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209
into a period in the history of our
 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.539
into a period in the history of our
nation where for example we have genomic

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549
nation where for example we have genomic
 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.729
nation where for example we have genomic
science I like to challenge people to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739
science I like to challenge people to
 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.530
science I like to challenge people to
say look suppose you could have a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
say look suppose you could have a
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.140
say look suppose you could have a
daughter that played tennis like Venus

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
daughter that played tennis like Venus
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940
daughter that played tennis like Venus
Williams and looked like corner

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950
Williams and looked like corner
 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.819
Williams and looked like corner
Kournikova and played golf like Tiger

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829
Kournikova and played golf like Tiger
 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.610
Kournikova and played golf like Tiger
Woods would you choose not to give her

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620
Woods would you choose not to give her
 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.449
Woods would you choose not to give her
that opportunity or the genomic science

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459
that opportunity or the genomic science
 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.250
that opportunity or the genomic science
that may not become a theoretical

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260
that may not become a theoretical
 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.650
that may not become a theoretical
question and so we're gonna have to make

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
question and so we're gonna have to make
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.349
question and so we're gonna have to make
clever choices as a society about the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359
clever choices as a society about the
 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.930
clever choices as a society about the
way we apply science genomic science
