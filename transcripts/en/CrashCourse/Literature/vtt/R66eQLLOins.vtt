00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.720
Hi, I'm John Green.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.940
This is Crash Course Literature, and today we're going to talk about The Catcher in the Rye, the best-selling book never to be adapted into a film.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.980
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what about the Quran?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.520
Fair enough, me from the past, but there's a religious injunction there; the reason this has never been made into a movie is of course because Salinger and his estate won't allow it.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.280
But how this text – I mean, even most of Salinger's covers are imageless – has managed to remain relevant without a movie adaptation in our image-saturated and image-driven culture is a very interesting question.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.020
And so today, we're going to take a look at the pure and unadulterated text of The Catcher in the Rye.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.220
Now there are many ways to read a novel critically, and next week we'll take a very different approach – we'll infuriate JD Salinger's ghost by reading this novel in a historical and biographical context.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.260
But today let's appease Salinger's ghost by
pretending that he as a person never existed.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.380
These days our artistic landscape is so deeply defined by visual narratives on TV and in the movies that we can hardly imagine a world without images.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.860
In fact, I'd argue that we have a bad habit of seeing books as sort of cheaply made movies where the words do nothing but create visual narratives in our heads.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.920
So too often what passes for literary criticism is "I couldn't picture that guy", or "I liked that part", or "this part shouldn't have happened."

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.100
That is, we've left language so far behind that sometimes we judge quality solely based on a story's actions.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.420
So we can appreciate a novel that constructs its conflicts primarily through plot – the layered ambiguity of a fatal car accident caused by a vehicle owned by Gatsby but driven by someone else, for instance.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.180
But in this image-drenched world, sometimes we struggle to appreciate and celebrate books where the quality arises not exclusively from plot but also from the language itself.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.740
Holden Caulfield, by the way, was aware of this,
because he too lived in an image-driven world.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.000
I mean, on the very first page of the book, Holden calls his brother a prostitute for abandoning book-writing for Hollywood, and says,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.780
"If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies."

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.380
And the novel frequently identifies itself in direct opposition to film, as for instance when Holden says,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.440
"I don't remember if he knocked me out or not, but I don't think so.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.640
It's pretty hard to knock a guy out, except
in the goddamn movies."

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.800
By the way, for the record, it is okay to say Charlotte Bronte if you are quoting the book in question but now, outside of the text, I have to use "Charlotte Bronte."

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.740
Ugh Stan, I know we have to do this for the schools but this prohibition on cursing is so Emily Bronte annoying.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.260
OK, so if you'll just allow me one biographical note here, Salinger once wrote in a letter that "The Catcher in the Rye is a very novelistic novel.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:35.760
There are ready-made 'scenes' – only a fool would deny that – but, for me, the weight of the book is in the narrator's voice, the non-stop peculiarities of it, his personal, extremely discriminating attitude to his reader-listener.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
He can't legitimately be separated from his
own first-person technique."

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.680
All right, but before we examine that first-person technique, let's go to the imagetastic Thought Bubble.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.760
Catcher in the Rye is the story of Holden Caulfield's expulsion from Pencey Prep and his journey back home to New York City,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.620
where he bums around for a few days trying to get someone to listen to him and meaningfully respond to his fears about becoming an adult.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.100
Holden has grown six inches in the past year and one side of his head is full of gray hair, both symbols of impending inevitable adulthood and its accompanying adulteration of innocence.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.100
He's so obsessed with, and protective of, innocence that he can't even throw a snowball at a car because the car "looked so nice and white."

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:21.580
Over and over again Holden tries to reach out to people who might tell him that adulthood will be okay – friends, old teachers, a prostitute, a nun, cab drivers –

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.340
but he can never quite find a way to ask these questions directly, and anyway, no one ever listens to him.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:37.820
Nothing much else happens; there are no explosions or car chases, and certainly no skoodilypooping, as Holden Caulfield is perhaps the first human in history ever to pay a prostitute not to have sex with him.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.780
What Holden really wants is not sex, or money, or power, or any of the dramatic stuff in Hollywood movies; he wants to stop time.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.120
As he famously says when thinking about the Natural History Museum, "the best thing, though, in that museum, was that everything always stayed right where it was."

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.880
Holden wants to be a protector of innocence, a catcher in the rye, but he also wants to stay innocent himself.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.720
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So one way this is explored is through sex.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.400
Holden is certainly very interested in sexuality, and he acknowledges his sexual desire, but what he knows of the adult world of sex is very scary, and even abusive.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.780
After a possible sexual advance from a trusted
adult near the end of the novel, Holden says,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.340
"That kind of stuff's happened to me about
twenty times since I was a kid."

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.960
Like a lot of what Holden tells us about his feelings, that's very subtle, and it requires close reading, but it's important.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.120
Like, it's easy to see why the adult world strikes Holden as so phony: the only adult who pays attention to him in the entire novel has ulterior motives.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.800
So he just wants to stop time to keep himself and the people he cares about away from that world.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.380
You may remember this obsession with stopping time – "Holden time back", if you'll pardon the pun – from The Great Gatsby.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.520
Of course, that doesn't work out for Gatsby,
just as it doesn't work for Holden.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.090
I mean the kid's 16 years old and he's already
got grey hair.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.320
Oh, it's time for the open letter?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.670
An open letter to grey hair.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.280
But first, let's see what's in the secret
compartment today.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.150
Oh, thank god, it's the red hunting cap.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.300
Ohh, my people hunting hat.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.140
Stan, I know this is corny, but I just feel
so much more confident when I'm wearing it.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.220
It's kind of my emblem of protection.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.240
Dear grey hair,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.140
You generally result from the wisdom that comes with age, or else someone experiencing a great fright.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.100
But grey hair, if you're associated with age, how come you've already attacked Holden Caulfield, and more importantly, how come you've already attacked me?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.500
I just had a haircut, and not a great one, I might add, and my stylist said, "Do you think we should dye your hair?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.880
You are on YouTube."

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.020
There's no room in the brave new media world
for wisdom or age.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.120
Holden Caulfield, I am beginning to know what
it's like to be you.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.460
Grey hair, all of this leads, as TS Eliot put it, to an overwhelming question: should I dye my hair?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.700
Eh, I think I'll just stick with my red hat; it covers my grey hair and it makes me feel like I can take on the crushing phoniness of the adult world.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.240
Best wishes, John Green.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.660
OK, let's now turn to what Salinger called
"Holden's first-person technique."

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.160
So all these experiences are obviously very
important and intense to Holden.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.500
I mean he's writing us about the stuff that led him to a mental hospital – but the intensity of these emotions is masked by the tactics of his narration.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.680
I mean, we just saw how subtly he hints at
sexual abuse, for instance.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.560
And also, Holden uses the passive voice constantly, which of course, you're not supposed to do as a writer.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.360
Look, for instance, at this sentence:

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.740
"The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I'd just gotten back from New York with the fencing team."

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.020
Any writing teacher would tell you that this is a disaster; you ought to say "I stood way up on Thomsen Hill," not "I was standing on it."

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.060
But this passive voice is a coping mechanism.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:36.000
I mean, the whole reason that writing teachers tell you not to use the passive voice is because it creates distance, whereas active verbs feel immediate and real.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.900
But Holden needs to create distance between
himself and the reality of his pain.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.860
I mean, he's standing on top of that hill
because he's been expelled from school.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:54.840
And also because everyone hates him because he left the fencing team's equipment on the subway, thereby forcing them to forfeit, becoming the first person in history to lose the big game without being on the team.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.660
Who wouldn't want to distance themselves from
that humiliation?

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.780
You see this again and again in Holden's voice, and you also see other strategies of minimization of language as a form of self-protection.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.510
I mean, he describes his institutionalized
self as "pretty run-down."

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.820
He says that Ackley is "sort of a nasty guy."

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.800
He "sort of" strikes up a conversation with a cabdriver, asking him what happens to the ducks in the pond when winter comes.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.920
Late in the novel, he "sort of" gives his
sister Phoebe a kiss.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.600
In fact, the phrase "sort of" appears in the
novel 179 times!

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.260
Also, even 60 years later, Holden's voice still sounds authentic, which is a function of grammar and word choice.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.480
After Stradlater asks the expelled Holden to write a composition for him because he "doesn't know where to put the commas," Holden writes,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.540
"That's something else that gives me a royal pain.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.360
I mean if you're good at writing compositions
and somebody starts talking about commas.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.840
Stradlater was always doing that.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:49.140
He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong places.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.340
He was a little bit like Ackley, that way."

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.600
You see what Holden did there?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.280
He stuck a comma in the wrong place.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.390
There shouldn't technically be a comma before
"that way," but it sounds right.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:06.750
But Holden's greatest gift as a narrator is that all these techniques of creating distance only make it easier to empathize with him, especially when his defenses finally break down.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.260
I mean, look, for instance, at this passage where he's talking about his brother Allie's baseball glove.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.760
"He had poems written all over the fingers
and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.320
He wrote them on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.480
He's dead now."

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.660
The gut-punch of those last three words is
brilliant.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.460
A present tense sentence in a past tense novel.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:37.120
We go from imagining a kid standing in the outfield reading poetry from his glove to knowing that this kid is dead – not that he died or that he passed away, but that he is dead now.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.940
The tense reminds us that the dead don't stop being dead; that they remain dead, and that is how they haunt us.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.620
Or another example, look at the use of the
word 'listen' in this novel.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.400
Over and over again, characters – but especially
Holden – begin sentences with 'listen.'

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.680
"Listen, do you feel like laying canasta?"
Holden asks Ackley.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.760
Ackley doesn't.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.220
To Luce he says, "Listen, hey, Luce. You're one of those intellectual guys. I need your advice. I'm in a terrific-"

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.520
and then Luce cuts him off, unable to listen
even to the end of the sentence.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.760
But at the end of the novel, Holden says to
Phoebe, "Listen, do you want to go for a walk?"

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.300
It takes her a while – they start out walking on opposite sides of the street – but they do go for a walk.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.340
Holden finally does get listened to.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.060
Maybe you realize that as you're reading and maybe you don't, but it works on you unconsciously regardless.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.700
And so, moments later, you feel something
welling up inside of you as Holden writes,

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.180
"I felt so damn happy all of a sudden, the
way old Phoebe kept going around and around.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.000
I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy,
if you want to know the truth.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.220
I don't know why.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:37.180
It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.020
God, I wish you could have been there."

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.620
Look at the phrases that get repeated there: "So Bronte happy" and "kept going around and around."

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.020
Some say that Holden never changes in this novel,
but I think he does right there at the end.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:55.560
The boy who wants nothing ever to change becomes "so damn happy" when he sees his little sister going around and around.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:08.680
When Holden stops thinking of time as a line toward corrupt adulthood and starts imagining it as a circle where one goes around and around, in a journey to and from innocence that lasts throughout life, he can finally be so damn happy.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.880
Yes, Holden never really gets anywhere.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.640
And yes, nothing much happens.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.160
He just keeps going around and around.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.080
But that doesn't mean nothing changes.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.340
