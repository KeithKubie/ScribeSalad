00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.150
Let's say we've been
hanging out in scenario E

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.170
for a bunch of days.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.410
On average, we've been
catching one rabbit,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.350
but gathering 280 berries.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.330
We were in, I
guess, a berry mood.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.750
So this is scenario
E right over here.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.260
But now all of a sudden, we're
in the mood for more protein.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.620
So let me write down,
we are in scenario E.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.052
And we're in the mood
for more protein.

00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:25.510
And so we want to think about
what are the trade-offs if we

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.420
try to catch more rabbits?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450
So what I want to
do-- I want to say,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.490
if I want to catch
1 more rabbit,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.330
what am I going to
have to give up?

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.700
So if I catch one
more rabbit-- so

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.530
I go from 1 rabbit on
average to 2 rabbits a day.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.060
So I'm really going
from scenario E

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.550
to scenario D. What
am I going to give up?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.500
So this is plus 1 over here.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.450
Well, I'm going to
give up 40 berries.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.100
And you can see it
visually right here.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.840
If I try to get 1
more rabbit, I can't

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.560
go into this impossible,
this unattainable part

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.250
right over here.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.350
I have to stay on the production
possibilities frontier,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.860
sometimes abbreviated as PPF.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.200
Or I guess the acronym for
it, I should say, is PPF.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.490
But if I want 1 more rabbit,
the production possibilities

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.980
frontier drops off, and I
will have to give up 40 fruit.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.490
So 1 more rabbit means
that I have a cost.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.390
So I have to give up,
on average, 40 berries.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.160
And the technical term for
what I've just described

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.880
is the opportunity cost
of going after 1 more

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.530
rabbit is giving up 40 berries.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.660
So let me write this down.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:51.910
The opportunity cost of
1 more rabbit-- and this

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.110
is particular to
scenario E. As we'll see,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.160
it's going to change depending
on what scenario we are in,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.730
at least for this example.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.820
So the opportunity
cost of 1 more rabbit

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.350
is 40 berries, assuming
we are in scenario E. 1

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.730
more rabbit, I have
to give up 40 berries.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.970
And another term when we
talk about the opportunity

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.250
cost of going after--
after producing I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.520
guess you could say-- the
operating cost of producing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.770
1 more rabbit here, when we
talk about the opportunity

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.920
cost of producing 1 more
unit, that's sometimes

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.830
called the marginal cost.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.900
So this right over
here, you can also

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.530
view it as the marginal cost.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.480
In the context of
this video, our costs

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.020
are in terms of the
thing that I'm giving up,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.080
the opportunity
that I'm giving up.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.300
In other scenarios, you'll
see sometimes a marginal cost

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.330
be given in actual monetary
units, like dollars or whatever

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.830
else.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.290
What was the cost of
producing that extra unit,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680
that extra widget,
right over there.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.269
But let's make sure we
understand opportunity cost.

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.810
So that's when we were sitting
in scenario E, the opportunity

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.810
cost of 1 more rabbit.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.100
But what's the opportunity
cost-- let's say,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.350
we're tired of eating meat.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.808
We're sitting in
scenario E, and we

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:06.760
want to become
vegetarians altogether.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.210
So we want to go to scenario F--
essentially not eat any rabbits

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.430
and eat as much
fruit as possible.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.100
So another thing you
could ask in scenario E

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.457
is the opportunity
cost of-- and just

00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.040
to make the numbers
easier-- I'm going

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.970
to say opportunity
cost of 20 more berries

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.820
is, well, I'm going
to give up a rabbit.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.790
So over here, what we're
doing is we're saying,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.940
OK, I want to increase
my berries by 20,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.220
but to do that, I have to
decrease my rabbits by 1.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.270
So the opportunity
cost-- assuming we

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.650
are in scenario E-- the
opportunity cost of 20 more

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.940
berries is 1 rabbit.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.490
Now this right over here
is not a marginal cost,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.420
because I'm talking about the
cost of 20 more units, not just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.450
1.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.450
If I want to write this as a
marginal cost of 1 more berry,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.530
then I could just say, well
if 20 berries is 1 rabbit,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.890
you could essentially
divide both sides by 20.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.950
So 1 more berry-- and I'll
assume, for those of you who

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.200
want to get technical, that
it's somewhat linear right

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.910
over here-- 1 more berry if
we divide both sides by 20

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.500
is 1/20 of a rabbit.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.000
So if I go for one extra
berry sitting in scenario E,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.690
on average I'm going to
get 1/20 less of a berry.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.730
And when I phrase
it this way, it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:51.217
is being phrased
as a marginal cost.

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:53.550
Now for those of you who want
to get a little technical,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.510
this is a curve right over here.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.910
So it might not be exactly this.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.420
Well, I don't want to get
too technical for the sake

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.200
of this one right
over here, this

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.810
is a safe way to think about it.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.706
The opportunity cost of 20
more berries is 1 rabbit,

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.330
but if you assume
that this is somewhat

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.680
linear right over here--
it's not so curved,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.070
it's somewhat of a line
between those 2 points--

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.070
then the opportunity cost of
1 berry is 1/20 of a rabbit.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.396
Or the marginal cost of an
extra berry is 1/20 of a rabbit.

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:23.520
And we can do it at different
points of this curve,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.010
and I actually
encourage you to do.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.190
Based on the data that we
have in this table that we

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.580
constructed in the last
video and maybe this curve,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.530
think about what
the opportunity cost

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.840
is in the different scenarios.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.730
If you're in scenario B and
if you want an extra rabbit,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.620
how much is that going to
cost you in terms of berries?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.720
Or if you want more
berries, what's

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.070
that going to cost you
in terms of rabbits?
