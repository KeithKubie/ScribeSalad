00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:11.185
Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:15.576
In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:21.566
to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls.

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.934
So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff?

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:29.244
You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess.

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:34.568
Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night,

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:40.253
these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces.

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:46.065
Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:48.785
—everywhere except Antarctica.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.924
A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.954
Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals,

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.493
ready to leap off when they defecate.

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:01.986
Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind.

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:07.055
A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.868
So once a beetle finds dung,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.964
it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself.

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:16.935
Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups:

00:01:16.935 --> 00:01:17.878
rollers,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:18.749
tunnelers,

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:21.254
and dwellers.

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:25.253
Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs,

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:28.447
quickly roll it away from competitors.

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.434
Potential partners jump on the ball,

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.975
and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate,

00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:36.375
the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:41.614
Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball.

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:43.654
Tunnelers have a different approach.

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:47.536
Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.896
and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls,

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.004
dung balls,

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:56.305
or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:00.205
Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:02.595
to fight each other
for control of these tunnels,

00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:06.770
which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.027
Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:16.795
and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.355
The third group of dung beetles, dwellers,

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.634
take the most straightforward approach,

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:25.135
laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat.

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:28.016
This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:30.645
than those of the tunnelers and rollers.

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:34.084
As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels,

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:39.754
leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away.

00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:43.896
Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch,

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:47.514
they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa

00:02:47.514 --> 00:02:50.295
and then an adult beetle.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.375
Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.666
have considerable ecological importance.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.625
For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.035
Dung from monkeys,

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:02.894
wild pigs,

00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:06.744
and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat.

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:08.875
When beetles bury their dung balls,

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.004
they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:15.086
and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate.

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:18.494
The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant

00:03:18.494 --> 00:03:22.844
has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung

00:03:22.844 --> 00:03:25.873
to trick beetles into burying them.

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:30.156
Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems.

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:34.004
Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.645
which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants.

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:41.525
The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil,

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:45.825
bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:51.767
Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:56.094
and £367 million a year in the UK.

00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:59.196
Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming

00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:03.476
by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.796
Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:10.685
produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.175
But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them,

00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:17.624
preventing the microbes
from producing methane.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.525
The dung beetle spreads seeds,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.594
helps farmers,

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.435
and fights climate change

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:26.675
—and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business.

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:30.465
Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field,

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.945
you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.
