00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
&gt;&gt; BAUM: Thank you. These are really great
extensions. Hi. My name is Nick. I'm the Product

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.340
Manager on the Extensions Project. And I'd
like to tell you a little bit about the gallery

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.709
that we launched yesterday. So first, let
me close down some of these tabs. And I'm

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.100
also going to head over and uninstall Aaron's
extension. Not because I don't like it, but

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:32.550
because I have a secret plan. Let me go ahead
and do that. And now, let me go to our gallery.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:43.550
So, let's search for gopher. We weren't lying.
Here is Aaron's extension. It's getting pretty

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.050
good ratings. So, maybe I should report it
as spam now for having a fake description,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.570
but actually what I'm going to do is I'm going
to try to install it, and there we go. So,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.760
I promise that this isn't because we had someone
behind the scene is furiously approving this.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.619
Actually, we think that one of the great strengths
of our gallery is that most approval for most

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.479
extension is absolutely automatic. So you
don't need to set away around for one of us

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.130
to go and check on it. Now, of course there's
still extensions that might be abusive and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
so if we receive a report about that, we'll
go and take it down. Same thing if an extension

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.690
violates our terms of service, we'll go and
take it down. But the nice thing is you don't

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.999
have to wait for us when you post your extension.
You can just get it live right away. There

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:42.600
are a couple of exceptions to this policy
namely: extensions that use native code and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.669
extensions that access the file system. Now,
for security purposes, we do send those to

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:52.859
manual review. But this review is as simple
as signing a copy of our terms and sending

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.130
that into us. We've seen very few extensions
uses so far. So I think it's a testament to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.119
the flexibility of the system already. And
when those we have seen have gotten approved

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.919
very, very quickly. So we think that this
is really a big game for developers. As you

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.220
saw, you can write an extension for five minutes.
You can get it up in a minute. And start distributing,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.480
start testing, and start getting users. The
second thing I'd like to tell you about today

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:26.390
is a little bit about how to make your extension
successful in the gallery. We think there

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.400
are three things you can do to make your extension
really do very well. First one, of course,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.780
is to build a great extension. The second
one is to pay attention to how this extension

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.970
shows up in the gallery. And the last one
is to promote that extension yourself. So,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.570
let's go through those in order. Building
a great extension, that one is pretty obvious.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.180
At Google we're very focused on the user.
We think that the products have best meet

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.670
the needs of the user, at the end of the day
win. And we think the same applies for extensions.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.510
And in fact, we'll be tweaking our ranking
algorithms and the extensions we featured

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.260
to constantly try to give an edge to those
extensions that are helping users to really

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.620
browse the Web and enjoy the Web better. The
second one is about making your appearance

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.250
in the gallery as good as possible. I will
illustrate with an example. So, let me pull

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.510
up an extension that I find particularly pretty
here, which is the glue extension. The glue

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.290
extension allows you to get social recommendations
for movies, books, music, and other media.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.710
And you'll notice that this looks a little
bit different from Aaron's extension, which

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.230
Aaron I'm sure will polish his up later on.
You'll see that we've made it incredibly easy

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.870
to actually make a very beautiful extension
page. We let you add large screenshots. We

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
let you add a description and we even let
you add YouTube videos. We think this last

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.960
feature adding a YouTube video is going to
be particularly useful for extensions, because

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.810
it's often hard to explain exactly what an
extension does without showing it in action.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.990
And you can do this right on your detail page.
Another thing I'd like you to notice on this

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.470
gallery page on this detail page is a little
section here in the corner on the blue background.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.690
We all notice here is that they have a very
nice colorful logo. And they have a short

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.279
description that very clearly states what
their extension is going to do and doesn't,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:25.319
and actually avoids any kind of marketing
speak. Now, the reason this is so important

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:29.539
is that this information is what shows up
in search results and as you browse through

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.219
the gallery. And so, this is really what the
user bases their decision to click in your

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.289
extension on. And by keeping this as clear
as possible, that leads you standout among,

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.499
you know, a field of extensions. The last
part of promoting your--of making your extension

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:51.560
successful is to promote it. Now, of course,
as a Chrome Extensions Team, we're going to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.599
do our very best to promote all the great
extensions you write. So, we have featured

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.160
extensions, we have top picks, we're going
to do a video in blog post, and many more

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.240
things. But we also encourage all developers,
such as yourselves to go out and promote the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.590
extensions to the channels that you have available
to you. One example of that that I think is

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.279
great is promoting your Chrome Extension to
users of Chrome that visit your Website. And

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:22.059
with that that does is gives you a starting
user base unless you start rising in our rankings

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:27.499
and then that in turn makes us even more likely
to want to showcase you. So we think if you

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:32.659
do these three things: build a great extension,
really polish its appearance in the gallery,

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.169
and then start promoting in, then you'll have
a really good chance of having success, and

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:45.540
we think that's a really great opportunity.
So, let me also speak for you that today will

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.240
not the first day of extensions we've been
working publicly for a while. It's the first

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.169
day that we're out in the open for our beta
users, but it's by no means the last day for

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.819
extensions. We've got a lot of exciting things
going forward. First obvious one is Mac support.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.830
In fact, extensions already work on the latest
Chromium build. So the latest open source

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:14.090
builds of extensions of Mac have extensions.
And we expect that later this week, we will

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.430
ship a dev build with extensions enabled on
Mac, and then extensions will come to Mac

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.830
beta and it's stable in early 2010. The second
part is internationalization. Chrome is already

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.539
available in more than 40 languages. And we
have a lot of users internationally. And we

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.059
want to make it just as easy for extension
developers to reach our international users

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:43.939
as it is for us. We hope that a lot of you
will take advantage of this functionality,

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:50.540
which again will be coming in Q1. Finally,
we're going to be adding lots of APIs. I expect

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.279
that for every subsequent major release of
Chrome, we will have a new set of APIs for

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:01.449
you to play with. Now, we have some ideas.
We want to add more UI surfaces. We want to

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.419
add, say, keyboard shortcuts, maybe some way
to interact with network request. But at the

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.639
end of the day, we're looking for your feedback
to tell us what you want and what's missing

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.129
to create your next great idea. And as we're
open source, just join us on the mailing list,

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:23.460
submit any idea, submit a proposal, or even
come help us implement it. So to finish, we've

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.650
been out now one day. When we first launched
we had about 300 extensions. The last I checked,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.290
I think we're up to 480. We're hoping we can
have 500 by the end of today. Actually, we

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:42.550
must be at 481 by now at least. And so, we've
been really happy with the reception we've

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.901
seen so far. As Brian mentioned at the beginning,
we find extensions incredibly important to

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:53.050
the future of Google Chrome and we're hoping
that if you are a user, you'll go out and

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.289
try one of the many extensions we have available.
And if you are a developer, you come up with

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:08.460
your next awesome idea and build it for Chrome.
Thank you.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.119
One last thing, now, of course, you're welcome
to grab something to drink and eat. We've

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:18.369
also set up a few conference rooms around
this area where the demolers [PH], so Xmarks

00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:22.319
and eBay and Google Translate will be around
to showcase their extension and chat with

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:26.530
you guys. So, feel free to go find them. Also,
all the extensions team members are here.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:39.530
We're wearing these shirts. Come find us.
We're really excited to talk to you all.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.440
