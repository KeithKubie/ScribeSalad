WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.410
I've done so many things in my life,
you know,
movies,
TV,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.300
all this stuff.
Stand up.
But Joe for Okin,
Oh my God,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.800
Jack and blast and cheeses here run Joe Rogan.
Yeah,

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.470
I get you got fans,
you know that.
Oh,

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.240
like all these different ages and all different kinds of people and uh,

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.120
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.
One of the things that happened,

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.710
you don't remember this,
but you opened for me many times.
Louise Ck open for me.

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.360
Nick Depalo open for me.

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.400
So people that want a little show business advice open for me,

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
it helps them.
Then you get to go by me and uh,
you know,

11
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.000
I get to watch you guys become stars.
I've sold,

12
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:47.001
I'm playing fucking Chinese for us and Saugus some of the best standup comedy in

13
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:51.010
the world is at Chinese restaurants and Sargus.
And that's a fact.

14
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.950
Still to this day.
All those people that live there,

15
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.460
they don't know how good they have it.
Well,
you know what it is.
I,
you know,

16
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:00.270
you work with these guys,
you and I've worked with guys that are like genius,

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.020
you know,
a transcendent,
whatever word you want to use.
But

18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.540
doing stand up is not about being funny.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.610
It's about going into these shed holes and like developing this extra skin.

20
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.830
You know,
you,
you're a martial artist and sort of,

21
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.310
you have kind of that mentality.
But you know,

22
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.470
when I started it was like I came from,
you know,
I was an actor,

23
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.270
I was very serious person.
I was like an actor,
you know.

24
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.030
And I do like these obscure impressions,

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
Paul Scofield and Lawrence,
Lawrence,
Olivia,
you know,
all right,

26
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.030
it's on that and all this bullshit.

27
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.510
And I'd be playing at places like the sugar shack.

28
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.420
So you remember the sugar shack?
It was a black,
uh,

29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.240
R and B joint and I opened for BB King.
Wow.
Yeah.

30
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.810
And I'm doing like John Lennon.

31
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.150
It was very important when we started them and the black,
the do some dirty shit,

32
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:59.130
man,
what the fuck are you doing?
Don't you know any jokes?
So in the back,

33
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.600
I get heckled,
my first heckler,
he said,
Yo,
suck.
And I said,
yeah,

34
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.580
fuck you.
Who are you?
He says,
I'm BB King.
I hired you a motherfucker.
Oh No.

35
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:13.440
And then I was doing,
I will never forget this.
Do you remember the channel?

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.820
The channel?
Yeah.
Channel the Rock,
rock and roll place.

37
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.420
So I'm opening for like these bands,
you know,

38
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.870
it was like that blues brothers scenes with the throwing shit at the cage.
Yeah.

39
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.720
So,
um,
the bouncer,
he says,
you know,

40
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.970
point to people and we'll throw them out.
So I point to them,

41
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:36.870
but then they bring them out in the alley and beat the shit out of,
you know,

42
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.080
but I,
I'm thinking because you're a martial artist.
So I,
it's,

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.130
I've kind of got this thing about people fighting and growing up in Charleston.

44
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.510
And,
um,

45
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.570
I think back on certain incidents when I was starting doing stand up and I was

46
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.690
at this place and calm AV and this guy stole one of my lines.

47
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.620
Now I know that you're bringing into that,
right?
So he goes offstage,

48
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.380
I hit with a right cross fucking cause over the tables and I'm thinking to

49
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.920
myself,
my friend says,
I thought you wanted to be Jonathan Winters and reds.

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.780
They don't do shit like that.

51
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.380
And then another time we were at the ground round in Brighton,

52
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.420
I'll never forget round round.
Yeah.
I'll never forget this Joe.

53
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.720
So amongst the guy on before me guy in the audience's throwing little lights,

54
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.580
things that I'm right.
So I said,
uh,
my opening line,

55
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.480
usually it's trying to get the audience to light cue,
you know,
or laugh,

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.790
make them laugh or whatever.

57
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.990
So my opening line was like the first mother fucker that throws something at me.

58
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.340
I'm going to knock 'em out.
You know,

59
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:41.140
you're not exactly setting the stage for hilarious comedy,
but uh,

60
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.490
you know,
I ran at work.
What's that?
Work out terrible.
I bombed.
You know,

61
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.320
people think,
you know,
when you do this for a while,
you've never bombed.
I mean,

62
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.740
there's no experience in life like bombing in Louisville,

63
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.880
Kentucky.
I'll never forget that.

64
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.030
And a guy comes up to me afterwards and he says,

65
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.410
and he was trying to make me feel good.
He says,
well,
I could tell by your tone,

66
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.990
your funny.
Ah,
you know,

67
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.630
but I'm doing shit like about subways and stuff.

68
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.390
They don't even know what they are.
Right.

69
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.270
So those early years there was like one,
um,

70
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.010
there wasn't even a comedy clubs.
So you just kind of did it.
I fell into it.

71
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.370
What year did you start?
Oh my God.
People,
you know,

72
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.750
people I am now at that point,
Joe,
what people come up to me and you know,

73
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.220
they say,
I'm so glad to see you.
I keep telling my husband,

74
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.800
I'm telling you he's not dead.
He is not tied.

75
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.370
So it's been like 30 or 40 years.
Um,

76
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.560
I don't remember the year,
but uh,
I remember those were the years you started?

77
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.030
No,
I don't remember.

78
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.660
<v 1>I started in [inaudible] 88 and you were a legend.
The legend.</v>

79
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.600
But you were for sure.
Dude,

80
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:57.340
I watched you one night at Nick's comedy.
Stop kill so hard.
I stopped.

81
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.640
I thought about quitting because I had only been doing comedy like a year and I

82
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:03.400
was like,
fuck this.
I can,
I gotta get the fuck.

83
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.780
<v 0>Got It.
You know,
you know,
you know when I had that feeling,</v>

84
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.620
Richard Pryor's first performance film.

85
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.920
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Richard Pryor live.
He filled them in Long Beach.
I was,</v>

86
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.460
I went to see that with Steven Wright and both of us walked out.
We said,

87
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.950
we don't even want to do this.
You know,
it was so intimidating.
Yeah,

88
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.480
I know that feeling,
man.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

89
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:29.400
we got that feeling a lot in Boston and uh,
as,
as a kid starting out there,

90
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:31.550
it was,
I tell everybody that I,

91
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.630
I stumbled into the greatest comedy scene in the history of the known universe

92
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.100
in 1988 when I started.
It was insane.
It was insane.

93
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.060
Dawn Gavin was in his prime.
You were in your Prime Roger Person.

94
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.920
I would watch these guys go up.
Don.
Um,
um,

95
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.620
there was so many guys that were so fucking good.
Knox was killing back then.

96
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.850
There was so many guys that you would go any night you would go and watch some

97
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:01.550
of the standup comedy on the planet.
It was,
it was amazing.
Mike Donovan,

98
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.430
Mike Donovan.
To this day,
people don't know who Mike Donovan is.

99
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.930
He was a fucking Johnny most.
Do you know who Johnny most?

100
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.810
Most people don't know what's in my right side for the Celtics.

101
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.320
<v 0>Yeah,
he would do this long.
What do you know what?</v>

102
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.370
But it's funny you say in your prime because,

103
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.880
and I've talked to people who've been at it longer than me.

104
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.270
This is one job where you can get better.
Yes,

105
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.510
you can get better and more skillful,
you know,

106
00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:33.790
but it's something that you,
you know,
you,

107
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:37.710
you just have to give the finger to the business because they're looking for the

108
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:40.760
fat guy,
the small guy,
that black guy that you know,
they're,

109
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:43.890
they're always looking for something other than what you are.

110
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.980
So you do what you do.
Like you've done what you did

111
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.840
<v 1>business in terms of like movies and television shows.
Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.320
They will try to lure you away and they lure you away with money.

113
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.320
But the business is standup comedies.

114
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.330
It's really about what you do in front of that microphone.
You know,

115
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.550
how the audience responds on

116
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.790
<v 0>stage.
I followed a woman and uh,</v>

117
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.780
she had a lot of TV credits,
but she had no material and it was unbelievable.

118
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.960
You know,
you forget when you do something,
you forget.

119
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:14.660
It's like you're a trained fighter,
your trend radio person,

120
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:19.250
you forget that in order to do it,
you've developed a certain set of skills.
Yeah.

121
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.100
And like in Boston they have a Saint Patrick's,

122
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:27.101
they breakfast where the politicians try to be funny and it's excruciating.

123
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.660
You know what I mean?
And you forget,
Oh yeah,
I do this all the time.

124
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.590
It'd be like me trying to give a speech before I came on this show,

125
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.600
I talked to Nick Depalo,
you know your buddy.
Sure.
And he says,
well,

126
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.750
Joe and I always talk about politics.
And I said,
well,
no,
nobody to help himself.

127
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.770
And nobody,
nobody talks to me about politics.

128
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.630
I'm just not that smart.
Good.
I'm done with politics.
I'm going to quit.
Yeah.

129
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.520
I want to talk about,
you know,
where we are in this country now is like,

130
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.040
um,
well I,

131
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.000
I kind of,
uh,

132
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.260
I don't like to not like someone because of what they believe.

133
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.130
So I just kind of do silly shit.
I was thinking the other day with the Democrats,

134
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.930
you know,
I'm gonna run,
I'm gonna run and that,
but they let the moderate lane,

135
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:24.770
the,
um,
Progressive Lane,
so I'm going to run in the breakdown lane,
you know,

136
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.460
just a silly little shit,
you know?
Uh,

137
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.570
I try to keep it upbeat,
whatever,
but I got into this,

138
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.850
I fell into this because I kept thinking I'm going to get an acting job and I

139
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.050
won't do standup.
This is going to fucking end at some point,

140
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.470
you know what I mean?
And I,
I have,
you know,

141
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:48.500
I like people,
kids would,

142
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.250
will actually ask me for advice and I say,
advice,
are you shitting me?

143
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:55.890
I fell into this shit I expected at the end.
But he,
I say,
all right,

144
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.000
do you want some advice?

145
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.100
Don't ever work at a place that's named after the guy.

146
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.690
Like if it's Vinnie's fucking pizza parlor,
a Joey Shithole,

147
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.920
blobbies moneymaking piece of shit.
When it's named after the guide,

148
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.700
it's never enough.
You know Nick's comedy.
Stop next.

149
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.930
Now I'm going to do something.
Feel okay.
Then we're going to play a little scene.

150
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.430
Okay.
Now you ask me,
say is Nixa mafia joint?

151
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.560
Is Nixon Mafia joint?

152
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.270
Yeah.
Is this next still around?
100% yeah.
Nick's is around.

153
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.770
Is it the same ownership and do you know that there isn't one inch of that

154
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:42.630
building that I didn't do cocaine?
I believe that it was.
It was really something.

155
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.350
I mean,
I mean it was like,
I know that,
you know,

156
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.730
I lived in La many years ago and it's like I'm driving around and say,
oh,

157
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:54.060
I know that's what,
so with next,
I know every spot in the building.
