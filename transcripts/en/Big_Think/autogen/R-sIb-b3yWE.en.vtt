sometimes and by mining this data we can

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
sometimes and by mining this data we can
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.010
sometimes and by mining this data we can
get better insights into who we are all

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

two elections so this was a clue that

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
two elections so this was a clue that

I think as far as predicting the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210
I think as far as predicting the
 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.230
I think as far as predicting the
elections just based on searches we're

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240
elections just based on searches we're
 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.939
elections just based on searches we're
not really there yet because we haven't

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949
not really there yet because we haven't
 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.860
not really there yet because we haven't
had enough elections to test the models

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
had enough elections to test the models
 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.100
had enough elections to test the models
on you only have a few we've only had a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110
on you only have a few we've only had a
 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.100
on you only have a few we've only had a
few elections to build to build the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110
few elections to build to build the
 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.709
few elections to build to build the
models and where it's poles have been

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719
models and where it's poles have been
 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.899
models and where it's poles have been
building models over many many elections

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909
building models over many many elections
 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.969
building models over many many elections
I think there definitely are clues in

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979
I think there definitely are clues in
 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.279
I think there definitely are clues in
searches for which way people will go

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289
searches for which way people will go
 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.230
searches for which way people will go
they're a little more subtle than we

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240
they're a little more subtle than we
 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.839
they're a little more subtle than we
usually think so for example you can't

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849
usually think so for example you can't
 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.459
usually think so for example you can't
predict which way a state's going to go

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469
predict which way a state's going to go
 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.320
predict which way a state's going to go
based on how frequently they search for

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330
based on how frequently they search for
 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.110
based on how frequently they search for
a candidate it's not like places that

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120
a candidate it's not like places that
 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.029
a candidate it's not like places that
search for Trump more go for Trump in

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039
search for Trump more go for Trump in
 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.619
search for Trump more go for Trump in
places that search for Clinton more go

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629
places that search for Clinton more go
 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.600
places that search for Clinton more go
for Clinton the problem and can probably

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610
for Clinton the problem and can probably
 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.469
for Clinton the problem and can probably
guess it's obvious is that you might

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479
guess it's obvious is that you might
 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.209
guess it's obvious is that you might
search Trump because you love him or you

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219
search Trump because you love him or you
 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.589
search Trump because you love him or you
might search Trump because you hate him

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599
might search Trump because you hate him
 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.300
might search Trump because you hate him
so it doesn't really tell us too much

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310
so it doesn't really tell us too much
 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.430
so it doesn't really tell us too much
there are some subtle indicators that

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440
there are some subtle indicators that
 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.409
there are some subtle indicators that
seem to have predictive powers one that

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419
seem to have predictive powers one that
 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.379
seem to have predictive powers one that
I've found is the order in which people

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389
I've found is the order in which people
 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.589
I've found is the order in which people
search candidates about 26% of searches

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599
search candidates about 26% of searches
 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.209
search candidates about 26% of searches
for Clinton in the previous election

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219
for Clinton in the previous election
 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.540
for Clinton in the previous election
cycle also included the word Trump so

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
cycle also included the word Trump so
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.730
cycle also included the word Trump so
people search for Clinton Trump polls or

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740
people search for Clinton Trump polls or
 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.010
people search for Clinton Trump polls or
Trump Clinton debate and it turns out

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
Trump Clinton debate and it turns out
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.409
Trump Clinton debate and it turns out
interestingly there's a subtle clue in

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419
interestingly there's a subtle clue in
 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.350
interestingly there's a subtle clue in
which way people will go based on the

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360
which way people will go based on the
 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.879
which way people will go based on the
order in which they list the candidates

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889
order in which they list the candidates
 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.439
order in which they list the candidates
in their search so if people search

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449
in their search so if people search
 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.510
in their search so if people search
Trump Clinton polls they're much more

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520
Trump Clinton polls they're much more
 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.070
Trump Clinton polls they're much more
likely to go Trump if people search

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080
likely to go Trump if people search
 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.929
likely to go Trump if people search
Clinton Trump polls they're much more

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939
Clinton Trump polls they're much more
 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.760
Clinton Trump polls they're much more
likely to go Clinton but it's going to

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770
likely to go Clinton but it's going to
 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.140
likely to go Clinton but it's going to
take a lot of Elections to kind of build

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150
take a lot of Elections to kind of build
 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.480
take a lot of Elections to kind of build
these models and weight these models and

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490
these models and weight these models and
 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.490
these models and weight these models and
figure out exactly how to translate the

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500
figure out exactly how to translate the
 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.929
figure out exactly how to translate the
searches to vote totals but I think

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939
searches to vote totals but I think
 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.579
searches to vote totals but I think
there is some information in these

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589
there is some information in these
 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.529
there is some information in these
searches for the purposes of predicting

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539
searches for the purposes of predicting
