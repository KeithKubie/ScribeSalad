- Looks like this is our...
- Okay, yes.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.506 line:0%
Oh, thank the Lord, okay.

(Williams)
'Hey, baby, what's going on?'

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.709 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
Bravo,
thank you so much for coming.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.077 align:start size:59% position:41%
So, here's what
I want to make sure

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.513 align:start size:91% position:9%
you all understand right now,
right off the top.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.814 align:start size:38% position:63%
I called you

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.583 align:start size:53% position:47%
to report a crime

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.352
that I don't have
nothing to do with.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.787 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Okay?
- 'Well, this is a first.'

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.321
I'm not involved in the crime

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.590
I didn't perpetrate the crime

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't do anything, okay?
I was--

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.394 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Can we get to the crime?
- Yes, ma'am, yes!

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start size:91% position:9%
I was minding my, I was
walking down the street, okay

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.665 align:start size:63% position:38%
and I was, indeed,
I'm not going to lie

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.600 align:start size:66% position:34%
I'm a vagabond, a bit

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.835
I'm a little bit of a vagabond

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.236 align:start size:81% position:19%
I was looking for shelter.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.605 align:start size:66% position:34%
I found this vehicle,
the window was open

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.140 align:start size:72% position:28%
and I climbed in.
I climbed into the car.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.543
Okay, so, you called us to tell
us that you climbed into a car?

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.111
Yes, and I looked in the trunk

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start size:66% position:34%
and there's something
in the trunk

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.014 align:start size:59% position:41%
that I think may be
of interest to you.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.550 align:start size:66% position:34%
So, I made sure that
I called immediately.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.118
- What's in the trunk?
- It's... There's a head.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's a head in the trunk.
There's a head.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.689
Twenty-three-year-old male head.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.724 align:start size:69% position:31%
Hypothetically, if I
had severed the head--

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.526 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Yeah, let's get to that.
- If I had done it...

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.195
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.362 align:start position:0%
Then...

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.798
What would the repercussions be?

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:08.267 align:start position:0%
- Hypothetically?
- Just hypothetically speaking--

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.635 align:start size:81% position:19%
- If you had done it?
- Let's say...

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.704 align:start size:91% position:9%
Let's say I was not me.
Let's say I was a different--

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start size:81% position:19%
Let's do...
Let's play role play.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.174
You be... You be you.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We gonna be us, okay?
- Okay, I'll be me.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:20.346
We would be, like, "Hold up."

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.515 align:start position:0%
Stop, freeze, stop
in the name of the law.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.383
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Get them guns out my way.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.952 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Freeze!
- I'm freezing!

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm crazy!
- And then we would go...

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:28.921
"Boom, boom, boom."

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.290 align:start position:0%
There's a head in that trunk,
oh, Lord

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:32.492
- There's a head--
- Oh, I'm bleeding.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.760 align:start size:59% position:41%
I'm bleeding.
I hate you, Jerome.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.529
- Why did you betray me?
- You said, "Jerome, stop."

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start position:0%
We're not role-playing anymore,
we're playing real life.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why did you say Jerome?
- 'Bec..'

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.803
Well, that's my cousin's name,
it just come to me right now.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.538 align:start position:0%
Is your cousin living
or is he dead?

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.906 align:start size:97% position:3%
Is your cousin living
or is he dead?

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.809 align:start size:81% position:19%
He is alive,
he is alive with the Lord.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.245 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Alive with the Lord.
- Get your ass in the car.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.715
Hypothetically speaking

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.782
you're about to get

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.751
your salad tossed in prison.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.288
Oh, okay, well

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.357
thank God it's hypothetical.
