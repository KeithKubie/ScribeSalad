00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.920
Settle down. The weekend doesn't
begin until at least after the 3.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.840
91 lecture. Work first, then play.
A couple of announcements, next

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.760
Tuesday, quiz two based on the
subject matter of homework two,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.690
the periodic table tests will be on
Thursday, and it's going to be not

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
before too long that we'll have time
for the monthly test,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
the first monthly test.
The mnemonics contest deadline is a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.140
week from today at 5:00.
Send it to me by e-mail if you want

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.420
to win that hot tie or that hot
scarf. It's come to my attention

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.710
that people are moving freely about
recitations without arranging

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.990
through my office.
And, some of the recitations

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.280
sections are uncomfortably large,
which defeats the purpose of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
recitation in part.
I mean, we want you to have access

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.850
to the instructor and if you have 30
students there instead of 20,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.540
that dilutes your access.
So, we insist that you go to the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.630
section that you are assigned to.
And, if you must change because

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.720
you've got a UROP,
or you've got some other activity.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.810
Please do it through my office so
that we can make the learning

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.900
experience good for the majority and
not just for the few.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:02:02.200
Oh, there was something else I
think.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:54.350
Yes, I just learned yesterday that
to my somewhat disappointment,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.700
you know my favorite transuranic
element is 111 because it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.050
unununium. But,
it has been isolated by the team in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.400
Darmstadt in Germany and they have
proposed the name roentgenium after

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.760
Wilhelm Rontgen,
who is the discoverer of x-rays.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.110
And, that's now before the
International Union of Pure and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.460
Applied Chemistry.
So, maybe before the fall is out

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.820
we'll have to change.
I already showed you that this is

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.060
now darmstadtium.
So, we're going to have a whole

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.180
bunch of, it looks like,
Meitnerium. So, there's going to be

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.310
a whole bunch of German names along
here pretty soon.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.430
So, somebody better get busy over
in Berkeley. What are they doing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.550
there? What's going on?
Anybody know? People are sleeping.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.680
OK, so let's get to the lesson.
Last day, we studied the Bohr model

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.810
for one electron atoms.
And, the Bohr model showed us that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.930
through the quantum condition,
all of these quantities were

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:16.793
quantized.
They were functions of the quantum

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
number, n. And,
later in the lecture,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and later in the lecture,
we began to look for reconciliation

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
between the Bohr model and Balmer's
analysis of Angstrom's spectral line

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
study of the atomic hydrogen.
And, so we looked at the prism

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
spectrograph, and the gas discharge
tube, and I showed you the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
energetics of what goes on in there.
And, towards the end of the lecture,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we started talking about the actual
energetics of collision.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
And, I want to return to that.
So, let's put up that sketch again

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.000
where we're looking at the incident
electron. And,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.500
this is the electron that is
accelerating off the cathode.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.000
There is electrons all over, and I
want to make sure we are not

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
confusing one electron for another.
So, this electron I'm talking about

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.000
here is this one that is moving off
the cathode and towards the anode.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:04:02.090
And, en route is going to collide
with some atomic hydrogen.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.180
So, this is the incident electron.
And, it has kinetic energy of, I'm

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.270
going to denote it E incident,
one half mv squared **E=1/2 mv^2**.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.360
It's not bound. It's moving along.
And let's subscript this as well.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.450
Incident velocity,
electron rest mass,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.710
incident energy.
And, it's going to collide with a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.140
hydrogen atom at some point.
I'm going to draw the hydrogen

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.570
schematically like this with a
proton in the nucleus,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.990
and a lone electron in some orbit
here. And, if the energy of the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.420
incident electron is greater than
the energy required for some

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.850
transition within the hydrogen,
then it's possible that this

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.280
electron will capture some of the
energy from the incident electron,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.110
and be excited to some other state.
So, let's put that on.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.330
Let's call this some initial state,
and let's call this some final state.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.550
And, that's only going to occur
when this incident energy is greater

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.770
than the energy of transition.
So, we've got two electrons here.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:36.140
Here's a moving electron, free
electron.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:27.380
This one is bound.
So, this is in the target,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.760
or in the specimen, which in this
case is atomic hydrogen.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.150
So, let's look at what happens here.
The excitation occurs.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.530
And we can get the energy required
for this transition by using the

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.920
Bohr model. The Bohr model gives
this value, and gives the value as,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.300
that came right out of the
postulates, the delta E of

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.160
transition is going to equal -K.
I'm putting it up generally,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.490
z squared to allow for a higher z
level, one electron atoms.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.830
And, it's one over final quantum
number squared minus one over

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.160
initial quantum number squared.
So, that gives you the amount of

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.490
energy. And, that energy is going
to be taken away from the kinetic

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.830
energy of the incident electron,
which then will make its merry way

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.350
off after the collision.
And, I'm purposely making that

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.070
vector shorter to indicate that this
electron has been slowed.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.780
And, we call this electron the
scattered electron scattered by the

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.490
collision with the target hydrogen.
And, it has kinetic energy E sub

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.210
scattered as one half mv squared
scattered. The mass of the electron

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.920
doesn't change,
but its velocity certainly decreases

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.640
as a result of this collision.
But, that's not the end of the

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:11.413
story.
That's not the end of the story.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.200
What happens here is that this
electron that's excited is there in

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.000
an unsustainable basis.
It's just a one-shot deal.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.800
So, the electron wants to fall back
down to the lower energy state,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.600
and it does so. It falls back down,
and when it does so, it gives off

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:23.090
that energy in the form of a photon.
So, we have an emitted photon,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.270
and it has energy h nu or hc over
lambda, or hc nu bar.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.450
And, it is the set of these emitted
photons that Angstrom studied.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:41.630
Angstrom was studying these emitted
photons. And,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.810
clearly, there is some relationship
between the wavelengths that he

00:07:47.810 --> 00:08:05.220
observed, and energy levels within
the atomic hydrogen.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And, all of this,
this whole process is subject to

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
conservation. So,
let's get that up. Let's make sure

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that we don't violate any basic law.
So, we're going to say that the

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
energy of the incident electron will
then be spread across the electron

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
energy of transition within the
target. And, whatever's left over

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
will remain with the electron at
some reduced value.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:28.720
And, what I've shown here,
I'm applying it to the experiment

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.450
that Angstrom conducted in which he
accelerated electrons.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.170
But, it's the same calculation for
any particle. So,

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.900
this is for all incident particles
would be subject to this.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.630
All incident particles, so,
it could be obviously electrons.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.530
We could accelerate protons.
We could accelerate neutrons.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.610
We could accelerate alpha particles.
We could accelerate argon ions.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.690
There's a host of incident
particles. Consider them only as

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.760
bearers of energy.
They are energy transfer vehicles,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.840
and they transfer energy here,
provided that the energy is high

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.920
enough to cause excitation.
Now, another way of looking at it

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:37.573
conceptually is this is a probe beam,
a probe beam, or maybe a stimulus.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:28.830
And, the integral of the energy of
the particle after interaction and

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.660
the emitted photons,
that collectivity is the response.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.490
This is the response, OK? This is
the response. So,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:46.330
what does this mean?
This means that we could

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:52.160
interrogate some atom of unknown
identity, and on the basis of these

00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:09.653
values, infer,
deduce the identity of that species.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:10:02.900
And, we talked at the end of last
day about how this is applied in

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.810
analyzing the chemical composition
of stars. So,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.720
the radiation goes a long way,
and we're able to use the

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.630
information contained therein to
conduct analyses.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:22.540
So, let's see how this will help us
reconcile the Bohr model to Balmer's

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:40.880
analysis of Angstrom's data.
So, let's see.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I think we have to go back to the
Bohr model. If we go over to Bohr,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
this thing's decided that it wants
to sleep. Finally.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
See, it's Friday. The computer has
decided it's going to goof off a

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
little bit. So,
we're going to use postulate number

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
six in order to help elucidate
what's going on here so we can then

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
resume here and say that delta E of
the transition is the energy of the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
final state minus the energy
of the initial state.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:59.920
That's always the case.
We always say that the difference

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.840
goes final minus initial.
And, we can represent that as the

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.760
product, kZ squared,
one over n final squared minus one

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.680
over initial squared.
And, conservation of energy says

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.610
that must be the value of the energy
imparted to the emitted photons.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.530
So, the emitted photon, E of the
photon, this is emitted when the

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.770
electron cascades back down.
And that will be hc over lambda.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:35.330
So, let's flip this thing around.
Let's flip this thing around, and

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.880
what we'll get that is nu bar,
or one over lambda. Then will be kZ

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.440
squared over the product of the
Planck constant times the speed of

00:11:46.440 --> 00:12:05.146
light, one over n final squared
minus one over n initial squared.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Now, for the Balmer series,
for Balmer series, we had this set

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of lines for which the n member was
always n equals two.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So, we're dealing with atomic
hydrogen. So,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
let's put Z equals one.
And, let's put the final state as n

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
equals two. And,
furthermore, if we evaluate k over

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
hc using values that
we already know,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:26.660
We get 1.1 times ten to the seven
reciprocal meters.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.330
So, if you put all that in,
you get 1.1 times ten to the plus

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.990
seven, one over two squared minus
one over ni squared.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.660
And, ni has to be greater than nf.
So, that necessarily means that it

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.330
must begin at three.
It could go four, five,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:13:03.593
etc. Well, that's exactly the
Balmer formula.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:54.710
We've got the Balmer lines out of
the Bohr model,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.420
identical to Balmer.
So, Bohr has been able to reconcile

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.140
with Angstrom's data taken half a
century earlier.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.850
But furthermore,
Bohr suggests other experiments.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.570
For example, doesn't it bother you
that the lines end at n equals two?

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.280
You know that according to the
energetics here,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:37.360
the electrons have to keep cascading
down to n equals one.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:27.150
I mean, is there something funny
going on in Sweden?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.300
Maybe the electrons in Sweden,
they are a little bit nervous.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.460
Maybe it's winter.
Maybe they are afraid to go down n

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.610
equals one. How come we only get n
equals two? Well,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.760
let's look for a second here.
Look at this. The sleep function

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.920
is kicking in.
I see the hard drive.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.170
There we go.
So, let's for a moment take a look

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.520
at the electromagnetic spectrum.
This is taken from your book. And

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.880
you see, again,
I'm thinking about you all the time.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.230
I got out my pens, and I've colored
it in. The doctor says this is good.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.580
It's very good.
So, here we are with wavelengths on

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.930
the upper trace showing wavelength
increasing from right to left,

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.290
and energy increases from left to
right. So, high energy is low

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.640
wavelength. One point here that
irritates me: the SI unit of

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:41.413
frequency is hertz which
means beats per second.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:30.840
It's not the per-second.
This is a little sloppiness on the

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.690
part of the textbook.
And so, here what we've got is at

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.530
the very, very low end of wavelength,
very high energy are gamma rays,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.380
cosmic rays, and then over here at
the low end of energy are the gentle

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.230
forms of radiation,
radio, TV, microwaves over here,

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.070
and then in the center as it's drawn
is visible light. And

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.380
I want to expand that.
And, here's the visible spectrum,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.150
which in round numbers, I'd like you
to know a little bit of this.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.920
I think an educated person should
know a few things here.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.680
And, round numbers, visible
spectrum runs from about 400 nm up

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.450
to about 700 nm.
And so, the blue is low wavelength.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.220
It's high energy, and red is high
wavelength, low energy.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:36.840
And, here it is staggered from one
end to the other.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:27.720
And so, what we have here is
actually an indication of what our

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.450
photodetectors are capable of
sensing. We are tuned to operate

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.180
here, and it's no accident that we
are maximally positioned here in

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.900
green, we are very sensitive in the
green. We don't have uniform

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.630
sensitivity. It maxes in green.
So, the green pointer is a very

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.060
good pointer to use.
So, now let's go over to the

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.180
experiment. We can convert this to
electron volts,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.310
by the way. I think electron volts
is a good way to view this.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.430
And, you can see that visible
spectrum stands roughly two to three

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.550
electron volts,
two to three electron volts.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.680
And, think about it. Think about
already this little paradigm here

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.810
I've shown you,
something excites.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.930
Something gives off photon.
What about the inverse? Photon

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:39.226
comes in; something excites.
Wouldn't it make sense to have

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.500
photodetectors that operate at
around two to three electron volts?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.500
We are going to see later on in
3.091 that semiconductors have band

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.500
gaps roughly in this regime.
OK, so what's this have to do with

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.500
n equals two? Well,
this is taken from your textbook.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.500
And here's the Balmer series ending
in n equals two.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.500
If you convert these transitions,
n equals three to n equals two, that

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.500
turns out to give you an energy on
the order of something between 400

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.900
and 700 nanometers.
And, what was the sensor that

00:16:43.900 --> 00:17:07.690
Angstrom was using?
He was using photographic film.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.490
And, photographic film is sensitive
in the visible.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.290
So, the electrons in Sweden were
falling down to n equals one.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.090
But, look what happens. When you
fall down to n equals one,

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.230
look at these wavelengths.
100 nm, well, where does the 100 nm

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.690
put you? Way over here.
You are in the ultraviolet.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.150
So, the photographic detector
doesn't pick them up.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.610
And likewise, some of the electrons
were promoted even higher than n

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:41.070
equals four, n equals five.
And, on their way down, they were

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.530
landing on n equals three.
So you say, well, why didn't he get

00:17:45.530 --> 00:18:05.126
a set of lines where sometimes you
get one over three squared?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:54.630
Well, let's take a look.
Let's take a look. If you go down

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.260
to n equals three,
that's called the Paschen series.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.890
And, look at these numbers, these 1,
75 nm? 1,875 nm,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.520
that puts you way over here in the
infrared. So,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.150
n equals two, those four lines end
up right in the middle of the

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.780
visible spectrum.
And, that's why the lines that

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.410
Angstrom measured were in that
regime. So, we can generalize all

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.050
of this in the following equation,
nu bar, which is the wave number,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.680
goes as R times Z squared one over
nf squared minus one

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.660
over ni squared.
And, this is known as the Rydberg

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.990
Equation in honor of Professor
Rydberg. Another Swede,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:47.330
he was at the University of Lund.
And he was also active in

00:18:47.330 --> 00:19:05.226
spectroscopy.
And so, we encapsulate everything

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.500
that's on this slide here is in this
equation, and more so because this

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
allows for higher Z elements besides
just elemental hydrogen.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.500
Well, there is still more evidence.
There is still more evidence in

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.500
support of Bohr.
Let's take a look at that.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500
Bohr was really riding high.
This was good, but it gets better.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:22.830
It gets better.
There is the Franck-Hertz experiment.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:28.490
Franck-Hertz experiment was
performed in Berlin around 1912 to

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:34.160
1914. So, it was published around
1914. And, what Franck and Hertz

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.830
did was operate a gas discharge tube.
But, instead of running it with

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:45.490
hydrogen, they filled it with
mercury vapor.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:51.160
Now, mercury, as you will learn
later in its vapor state exists as

00:19:51.160 --> 00:20:07.720
the single atom.
It's like helium,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:20:02.390
single atom, whereas hydrogen,
there is atomic hydrogen. There is

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:07.990
a molecular hydrogen.
So, they operated gas discharge

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.590
tube with mercury vapor.
And, what did they find?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:19.190
What they found was that when they
varied - so let's draw this

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.360
little schematic here.
They've got a variable voltage power

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.080
supply feeding electrodes.
We've got mercury in here,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.810
cathode, anode. And, they put up an
ammeter in the circuit.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.540
And, they measured the current
voltage characteristic.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.270
So, here's the current.
It goes through the cell,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:21:02.606
electrons moving off the cathode
shooting across to the anode.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:52.920
And they measured the current as a
function of voltage.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.840
And, what they found was that at
low voltage, you get low current and

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.760
at higher voltage you get higher
current as you'd expect,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.690
some kind of an ohmic behavior.
Up to some critical voltage, and at

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.610
that point the current dropped to
almost zero. And,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:17.530
the tube started glowing blinding
white. This turns out

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:36.860
to be about 4.9 volts.
They continued raising the voltage,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and again, now they've got current
going through,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
the ammeter is registering current.
The tube is glowing, and now, the

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
current is rising until another
critical voltage.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And then it falls again.
And now, the tube is glowing even

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
brighter. And,
this is 6.7 volts.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And just for your information,
you look on the periodic table today

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and it turns out that the ionization
voltage for mercury is about 10.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
eV. 10.4 eV is the ionization
energy.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:59.660
So, this is below the ionization
energy. So, what's going on here?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:05.330
What they reasoned was, they were
exciting bound electrons within

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.990
mercury, and furthermore that there
are critical voltages associated

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:16.660
with critical energies.
Conclusion: there are quantized

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:22.330
energy levels within mercury,
which is to say that the Bohr

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:40.993
postulate of quantization applies
not only to a one electron atom.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
But it applies to multi-electron
atoms. Well, if it applies to

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
multi-electron atoms,
doesn't that mean it applies to

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
everything? So,
they concluded from this experiment,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
quantization of energies of
electrons in multi-electron atoms.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:59.690
So, the Bohr model doesn't apply to
multi-electron atoms,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.380
but the assumption that energy is
quantized in multi-electron atoms,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.070
the assumption of energy
quantization extends to

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.760
multi-electron atoms.
So, this is really, really good.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.460
Bohr was riding very, very high.
But, all good things come to an end.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.150
There were problems with the Bohr
model too. So, now let's

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.220
look at limitations.
I want to look at limitations of the

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:29.660
Bohr model. Limitations of Bohr.
OK, first of all, there's data out

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:36.110
there. There's data out there
already, first 1887.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:42.550
1887 Michelson and Morley,
this work was distinguished by the

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:58.900
fact that it was done
in the United States.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:52.870
You notice, most of everything I've
shown you up until now was done in

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.740
Europe with one exception,
the Millikan experiment in Chicago.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.620
Everything else is European science.
But, Michelson had immigrated to

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.490
the United States and was really,
really clever. He was brilliant

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.370
inventor, was doing military
research for the Navy back in the

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:12.240
early 1880's. He invented the
interferometer.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.120
And, he was the first to make
accurate measurements of the speed

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:34.773
of light, the Michelson
interferometer.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.690
And, he eventually worked at the
Case School of Applied Science in

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.390
Cleveland, which ultimately became
Case Western Reserve University

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.090
after a number of transitions.
So, he was working at Case in

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.790
Cleveland, and doing very,
very high precision spectroscopy.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.490
That was his forte. He was a
brilliant experimentalist,

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.190
knew how to make equipment that was
highly accurate.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.890
And, what he found was that one of
Angstrom's lines,

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.590
the line associated with the
transition three to two,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.290
if you look really, really carefully,
now remember, Angstrom made the

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:21.646
measurements by looking at light
hitting a photographic plate.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:25:10.770
And, that light doesn't come down
nice and sharp.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.550
There is a little bit of scatter in
the data. So,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.330
you get this fat line.
But the positions of center to

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.110
center on the lines follow that set
of four numbers that we were

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:41.953
looking at yesterday.
Now, what Michelson redid the work,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
remember, Angstrom did his
experiments in 1853.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Michelson looks very,
very carefully and sees that it's

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
not one line, but that it's two
lines, two lines very close together.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So, the three to two line is in
fact a doublet.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
It's a doublet,
that is to say, two lines very,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
very close together. But from a
distance, it looks like a line.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And then, if you've got really
accurate instrumentation,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:57.710
you discover that it's a doublet.
And that's a problem.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.140
That's a problem because if you
look at this term scheme here,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.570
if we've got a doublet, it means
that you've got two different

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.990
transitions. So,
the Bohr model is saying you go from

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.420
n equals two up to n equals three.
And, when you fall from three back

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.850
down to two, you give off a photon.
And that photon has a unique value

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.280
of wavelength.
But, they're measuring two.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.050
But they're very close.
So, what that suggests is that maybe

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:26.160
there are two levels that are really,
really close together.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.270
And, sometimes the electron falls
from the higher level.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.380
And, sometimes it falls from the
lower level. But in any event,

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.490
there must be more than one level,
but very close together. So, Bohr

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.600
is silent on that.
Now, the other possibility is that

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.710
two is the problem.
We don't know. Maybe this has got

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.830
two lines, and this has one.
So, that's the point, first of all.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.940
By the way, Michelson was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 1907, not

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.530
for this observation.
He got it for the measurement of the

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.590
speed of light.
Why I'm putting it down is you are

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.660
going to see everybody today.
We are giving out Nobels like

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.730
they're going out of style.
So, everybody gets a Nobel today.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.790
It's not like Oprah; we're not
giving everybody a car.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.860
But we're going to give everybody a
Nobel, OK? So,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.930
that's the first piece of bad news
for Bohr. These are headaches for

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:36.526
Bohr. OK, number two:
number two is 1896.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:24.850
1896: Pete Zeeman,
who is a postdoc at Leyden in the

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.710
Netherlands, he was a postdoc at
Leyden in the Netherlands.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:34.560
And, what he did, these people were
so creative. I mean,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.420
they were so excited about science.
So, he works with a gas discharge

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.280
tube, and he takes the gas discharge
tube and he puts it into a magnetic

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.140
field. He makes the magnetic field
by wrapping a conductor around the

00:27:49.140 --> 00:28:07.346
tube and passing current
through the conductor.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:58.900
And, by playing with the value of
the current through the coil,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.810
he changes the intensity of magnetic
field, and then goes through the

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.720
experiments with the prism
spectrograph. OK,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.630
so he measures gas discharge tube,
same thing all over again, gas

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.540
discharge tube in a magnetic field.
And, what he observes is the

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.200
following.
Just schematically,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.600
if this is the photographic plate,
and you've got multiple lines on the

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.990
photographic plate,
this is no magnetic field,

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.390
what we've seen before. What he
finds is that in the magnetic field,

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.790
some of these lines actually, and
this is not to scale,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:45.190
some of these lines actually show up
as doublets, triplets,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:49.590
but only in the applied magnetic
field. So, we call this line

00:28:49.590 --> 00:29:08.913
splitting, which is even different
from what Morley said.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:58.120
Michelson and Morley observed that
no magnetic field,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.240
if you look carefully,
there's multiple lines.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.370
What Zeeman sees is that single
line, no magnetic field.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.490
Apply a magnetic field, you see a
line splitting.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.620
And, furthermore,
he found that the intensity of the

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.740
magnetic field affected the degree
of splitting. The higher the

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.870
magnetic field,
the greater the degree of splitting,

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:42.606
line splitting proportional to
intensity of magnetic field.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:30.840
So, this is called the Zeeman effect.
And, that's not bad for a postdoc

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.690
because he got a Nobel in 1902,
and they were only offered for the

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.530
first time in 1901,
so talk about a meteoric rise.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.380
People obviously on the Nobel
committee thought this was pretty

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.230
good work. So,
how's the Bohr model going to

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.070
describe this?
It can't. It's incapable of

00:29:50.070 --> 00:30:08.106
describing this effect.
There is more.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.500
People are looking; they're working
hard. So, 1913,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.500
I'm even going to give you the month.
November 1913,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.500
why am I giving you the month?
Because the paper was published in

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.500
July of 1913, Bohr's paper,
July 1913. November 1913 there is a

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.500
fellow by the name of Starck,
and he's doing some work at Aachen

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:24.150
in Germany.
And, analogous to what Zeeman was

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.460
doing, Starck takes gas discharge
tube and he puts it between plates

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.760
that are connected to a power supply.
So then, he subjects the gas in the

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.070
tube to an electric field.
And, what does he observe?

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:41.380
Line splitting. And, how is the
line splitting?

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.690
The more intense the applied
electric field,

00:30:45.690 --> 00:31:04.446
the greater the line splitting.
So, same thing.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:55.660
Line splitting in electric field.
It's known as the Starck effect.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:01.330
And, you guessed it: he gets a Nobel.
Everybody's getting Nobels.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.990
1919 he gets a Nobel for the Starck
effect. So, all of this is adding

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:12.660
up to, there's good news here.
Bohr was able to give us a sense of

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.330
what was going on in the Angstrom
experiment, but there's a lot of

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:36.060
stuff here indicating that it's an
incomplete model.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:29.090
So, 1916, a theoretician comes to
the rescue, Arnold Sommerfeld.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:34.180
He was a professor of physics in
Munich. And he proposed some

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.270
modifications to the Bohr model.
He liked the Bohr model. He didn't

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.360
want to throw it out.
He liked the concept of a planetary

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.450
model. But then maybe he looked to
the heavens. You know Kepler's laws

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:54.330
of planetary motion.
What's the orbit that the planets

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.990
describe? It's an ellipse,
ellipsoidal. So, Sommerfeld said,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.660
how about this? Just suppose, and
this is not to scale.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.330
It's going to be exaggerated so you
get a sense of it.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.990
Suppose in addition to a spherical
orbit, suppose the electron might

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.660
describe an elliptical orbit.
Now, overall, this is roughly the

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.330
same. It's not super elliptical.
It's just mildly elliptical, but

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:40.526
just enough that it's not
exactly spherical.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
So, this could give you sort of have
your cake and eat it too.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
You could say, this is the
principal quantum number of Bohr.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
It's n. But, within n there's a
little bit of fine structure.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Fine structure, that is to say,
there are details there that the

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
first pass didn't quite capture.
So, suppose we have more than one.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Maybe we have a plurality
of elliptical orbits.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
So, we have elliptical orbits.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But, they are roughly of the same
dimension as the original circular

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
orbit. And, he says we have sort of
a band. And he calls this a shell

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
containing multiple orbits,
which he termed orbitals to

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
distinguish them from the
circular orbits of Bohr.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:30.750
Why did he call it a shell model?
He said, think about the eggshell.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:50.266
The eggshell: we can describe it
but the eggshell itself has some

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:40.250
thickness. So,
this is a sense of what Sommerfeld

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:58.433
was giving us.
So, he says, how am I going to

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:49.750
capture these ideas quantitatively?
Well, the shell could be captured

00:33:49.750 --> 00:34:07.466
by the quantity n,
but these orbitals,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:59.250
some of them circular,
some of them elliptical; I'm going

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:18.700
to need new quantum numbers in order
to capture these new ideas.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:08.220
And so, let's take a look at the
quantum numbers that Sommerfeld gave

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.440
us. So, the first one is N,
and it is as it was in the case of

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.660
the Bohr model.
So, this is called the principal

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.880
quantum number or the shell quantum
number, principal or shell

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.070
quantum number.
And, it talks about size.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.210
It talks about size, the size,
that is to say the distance from the

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.350
nucleus to the shell.
And, it takes values one,

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.490
two, three, and so on up to infinity.
And at infinity,

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.640
we're talking about a free electron.
And, in parallel, there is another

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.780
notation that's used that
spectroscopists came up with,

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.920
their own notation. They don't like
numbers. The spectroscopists

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.860
used letters.
But the spectroscopists,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.590
they're a funny bunch. They're very
suspicious. So,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.330
here's what happened.
If you look on this chart here,

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.060
for a while we thought Balmer was
the bottom of the barrel.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.790
But that's n equals two. And then,
when the detectors got better, we

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.530
saw that n equals one.
So, the spectroscopists said what

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.260
if somebody comes along with an even
better detector and finds

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:36.786
transitions to energy levels below
that which we are calling one?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:23.750
So, we are going to get ready.
We are going to give letters to

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:44.400
these, and they started with the
letter K because it's somewhere in

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:31.250
the middle of the alphabet.
So, if we ever discover an energy

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:51.833
level lower than n equals one,
we can use a letter. It will be the

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:38.750
J. So, there's K,
L, M, and this notation is used to

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:59.333
this day. When we talk about x-rays,
x-rays generated by electrons

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:46.250
falling down to ground state are
called K x-rays.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:36:06.566
So, this is the other notation for
the values that n can take.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:54.850
Now, let's get into the
contributions of Sommerfeld.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:59.710
He called the next quantum number
lowercase l. And,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:04.560
this is the orbital quantum number,
the orbital quantum number, and it

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.420
describes the shape of the orbital.
Remember, I said we needed some way

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.280
to distinguish purely circular from
elliptical or other shape orbitals.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.140
And, the orbital quantum number
takes values zero,

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:36.946
one, two, up to the value of n minus
one.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:28.300
And, the spectroscopists use letters.
They refuse to use numbers.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.590
They're very numerophobic (sic).
So, the use lowercase letters to

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.890
distinguish the orbital quantum
number from the principal quantum

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.190
number. And so,
when l equals zero,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.490
it's lowercase s for sharp because
these would be very sharp lines.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.790
Then, p for l equals one, which is
principal, d for l equals two,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:54.090
which stands for diffuse, and f
which stands for fundamental because

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.390
by the time you get up to f level,
you've got such compression that all

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.690
of the spectral lines are starting
to look very similar to those of

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:22.046
hydrogen, which is the fundamental
spectrum of all time.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:11.250
And then, after that,
they go g, h because they ran out of

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:30.533
ideas. So, that was it,
OK? So, now let's take a look.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:19.750
When l equals zero, this means you
have a spherical or circular,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:37.966
a spherical orbit or a circular
orbit.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:28.330
And that's easy to remember because
O is, think of it as a perfect

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.660
sphere. All right,
when L equals one, this is

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.990
elliptical. You have an elliptical
orbit. You can think of that,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.330
zero is zero, and one, think of that
as there's some elongation,

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.660
OK? And, when L equals two,
when L equals two, I'll show you

00:37:45.660 --> 00:38:05.720
these later in about a week's time.
They're just much more complex.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
You get dumbbell shaped,
doughnut shaped, and all sorts of

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
things. So, just say they're more
complex. So, those are the numbers

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
associated with certain shapes of
the orbital. Then,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
the next quantum number he gave us
was m, which was the magnetic

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
quantum number.
It's the magnetic quantum number,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
and it speaks to the question of
orientation.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
And, the admissible values of m are
l, l minus one through zero down to

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
minus l. So, spanning from plus l
to minus l, and of course l is

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
subject to values of n.
So, in the case of n equals one,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
when n equals one, l can equal only
zero. So, if l is zero,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
then this value, m must always be
zero.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:55.450
And, indeed this confirms the
observations. There was no line

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:00.900
splitting in a magnetic field for
the ground state.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.360
It wasn't seen. What happens when
n equals two? When n equals two,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.810
well, l can take values of one and
zero. So, what do we have?

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:17.270
We have now n equals two, l equals
one, so, m can now go one,

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:36.273
zero, and minus one.
So, this is the one case where there

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
is some value in thinking about the
Cartesian equivalent of this.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
It's very dangerous when you're
talking about quantum ideas to try

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
to ascribe physical attributes to
them because in many cases,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
it just doesn't work. But, in this
case, I think it does.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So, let's look at three values of
the magnetic quantum number when we

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
have an elliptical orbit,
right? So, one way of thinking

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
about it is here are the three
principal coordinate directions,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:54.120
X, Y, and Z.
Now, I don't know where real X lies,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.370
but once I choose X, I can use the
right-hand rule,

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:02.620
and I know where Y and Z have to be.
They're orthogonal. So, if this is

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.870
X, this is Y, this is Z.
I have a non-spherical,

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.120
non-axisymmetric orbital.
So, for simplicity, I'm going to

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.370
just make it elongated,
OK? Well, what does this say?

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.620
It says m can go one, zero, minus
one, which to my mind represents the

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.870
fact that there are three principal
coordinate directions in which you

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:28.720
can orient that.
So, I think this is a nice example

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.180
of mathematics imitating reality.
OK, after that, it gets very messy.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.630
And then, the last quantum number,
this is where Sommerfeld left it.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:45.080
But I'll finish by introducing the
last quantum number.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.540
The last quantum number came a
little bit later.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:41:08.546
It's a lowercase s,
which is the spin quantum number.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:41:00.160
And, it represents the fact that the
electron is considered to have spin.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.330
And it takes values plus or minus
one half. And here's the basis for

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.490
this value here.
I want to put this all together so

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.660
that I'm doing a little bit of back
to the future because this is 1916.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.830
That's where Sommerfeld leaves it.
This comes about 1925,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:35.460
but I want you to have all quantum
numbers.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:26.090
And then, we can move forward.
And what introduced this was an

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:31.180
experiment conducted by Stern and
Gerlach in Frankfurt,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.270
and that was done around 1921.
We can wake this up; we'll have a

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:41.360
look at it. This is cute.
I think it's cute. We'll see.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.450
You don't laugh at any of my jokes,
but this is Sommerfeld on the

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.940
occasion of his 80th birthday.
And as is the custom for her

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.820
birthday so momentous as this,
people from all over the world get

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.700
together for a party.
And they accompany this with a two

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.580
or three day affair in which people
give scientific papers in honor of

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.460
the celebrant.
So, this is taken from the book

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.350
that was published on the occasion
of Sommerfeld's 80th birthday.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.230
And, since Sommerfeld was the one
that proposed that orbits could be

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.110
spherical or elliptical,
they as a gag said, well,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:38.486
here's Sommerfeld, and then here's
Sommerfeld somewhat distended.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:26.150
So, this is l equals zero,
and this is l equals one, and this

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.300
was accompanied by the inscription
that said Sommerfeld was the one who

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.460
taught us that the circle is the
degenerate form of the ellipse.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.610
And, that was really funny. That's
1920s geek humor.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:42.760
That was roaring.
But clearly it doesn't age well.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.920
You're not sensing this. OK,
here's the Stern-Gerlach experiment,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.870
very, very cool experiment.
They were doing studies in the early

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.620
20s to try to validate Maxwell's
equations. So,

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.370
what they've got over here is a
furnace with a crucible of liquid

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.120
metal. And, the metal has obviously
a vapor pressure above it.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.870
And, there's a slit here. And,
they've got a beam. It's like a

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.620
physical vapor deposition.
And so, they're shooting metal in a

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.370
beam over to a cooled substrate here.
And, they're analyzing the deposit.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.120
OK, so if you shoot a beam and it's
got a slit, you should just get a

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.160
shadow of the slit.
So now, let's get interesting.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.490
Let's test Maxwell's equations.
So, they send the beam through a

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.830
divergent magnetic field.
You can see the South Pole comes to

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:34.160
a point. And the North Pole is a
curve. So, the field lines had to

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.490
diverge. So, they were asking
questions like,

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.830
what happens if you take a beam of
metal and send it through?

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.160
And here's what they found.
What they found was really, really

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.490
interesting. If you take a metal
and send it with no magnetic field,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.830
and you look at what you get on the
substrate, this is the

00:43:55.830 --> 00:44:00.070
shadow of the slit.
In other words,

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.210
if you send it through a narrow slit,
this will be the deposit of the

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.350
metal. When B does not equal zero,
they observe a deflection. So, now,

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:12.490
the question is, if here's the rest
position of the beam,

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.640
in which direction should the
deflection go?

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.780
And, so some would argue,
well, it should go up, and some

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.920
argued that it should go down.
And, what they found was they found

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.070
two, a single beam split into two.
And, this really vexed people.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.230
In fact, here are the data. This
is a very grainy reproduction from

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.380
their paper. The dark line is a
trace of the deposit,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.530
in this case, it's silver.
They are sending silver through

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.690
with no magnetic field and now,
here it is with the magnetic field

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.840
on. And this is a grating.
And they are measuring separation.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:45:09.413
So, the silver beam splits into two.
It goes up and down.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
So, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck come
along. Let's get these guys on here

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000
first. This is Stern and Gerlach,
1921, and, yeah, so they're working

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
on that one. And then comes
Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck also at

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Leiden, again. They were
two graduate students.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:25.520
And they said,
we can explain that.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.050
Watch this. Crazy as it sounds,
here's the electron moving around.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.580
They said the electron just doesn't
move, it spins.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.110
They said what is the electron is
spinning as it moves around the

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:39.640
nucleus, all right?
And, if you use the right-hand rule,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.170
if it's spinning clockwise,
it's spinning up. But maybe an

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.700
electron, we don't know where the
absolute up or the absolute down is.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.230
Some electrons might be spinning
anticlockwise,

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.750
in which case they are spinning down.
And, silver is atomic number 47.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.250
So, it has an odd number of
electrons. So,

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.750
it can't get a spin up electron
canceling a spin-down electron.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.250
It has a net non-paired spin, and
they said, well,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.750
since we don't know what the
absolute is, half of the silvers are

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:11.250
spin up, and half of the silvers are
spin down. And that's why you get

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.750
this. So, let's give a fourth
quantum number.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.250
Let's call it plus or minus one
half. And, you could

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.050
say this is crazy.
But, it explains those results.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.160
And, they actually were here during
World War II. Both of them,

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.270
they worked down just around the
corner here in the Rad Lab,

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.380
radiation laboratory where radar was
discovered. It's around building

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.490
four, first floor.
There's a plaque there indicating

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.600
it. OK, well let's jump ahead.
I want to talk a little bit about

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.720
hydrogen and energy and I want to
talk about the Hindenburg.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.830
The Hindenburg was a giant,
rigid airship. To give you a sense

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:54.940
of scale, it was almost as long as
the Titanic: 135 feet in

00:46:54.940 --> 00:47:13.946
diameter, 804 feet long.
This is a 747 dwarfed.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
7 million cubic feet of gas,
112 tons of useful lift. But,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
they inflated it with hydrogen
because the Nazis had come to power.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Most of the helium was to be found
in the United States.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And, Congress passed the Helium
Control Act, which forbade the sale

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
of helium to Germany.
So, the engineers said,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:23.110
OK, we'll use hydrogen.
So, they filled this thing with

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.350
molecular hydrogen.
And, I mean, it was a fantastic

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:31.580
boon. I mean,
these are posters from that era: two

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.820
and a half days to Europe,
only two and a half days, much

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.050
faster than going by ship.
Here's a sketch. This is in German,

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:44.290
and now over the North Atlantic,
there's the tip of Manhattan.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.520
There's a nice shot of the airship
over Manhattan.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.760
So, it made ten transatlantic
flights in '36 carrying almost 1,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:48:11.586
00 passengers, cruising speed 78
miles an hour.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:48:00.750
They only flew in summer.
So, it's the arrival of the first

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:20.466
flight to the US on May 6,
1937. And, it's docking at

00:47:44.500 --> 00:48:08.250
Lakehurst, New Jersey.
The docking was moved.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:28.900
If you go to the top of the Empire
State building and you look out,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:15.750
you'll see these protrusions. Those
protrusions were put there in the

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:36.733
expectation that zeppelin airships,
dirigible airships would dock at the

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:23.250
Empire State building.
People would get off, take the

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:43.300
elevator, and next thing you know,
you're on Fifth Avenue.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:31.540
When they tried to dock these things,
the air currents were so turbulent

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.080
that it was unsafe to do so.
So, they made this docking station

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.630
across the river in Lakehurst.
So, this is what happens: 36 dead.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.180
That's not what's amazing. It's
amazing that the majority of people

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.720
disembarked. What I want to tell
you is it was not an explosion.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.590
The Hindenburg did not explode.
There was an aluminum grand piano on

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.790
there. They had ballrooms.
They had restaurants. You were

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.990
there for two and a half days.
You're dressed. It's elegant.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:03.190
The aluminum piano melted. They
figured what happened was there was

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.390
electric discharge in the vicinity
of a tiny hydrogen leak.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.590
Hydrogen is a tiny molecule,
and some hydrogen must have been

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.790
leaking. They think it may have
been something like a St.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.990
Elmo's fire or something like that,
just a high electrical discharge and

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:19.190
the misfortune that this thing
caught. So, here's the analysis.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.390
This skin was made of resin, and it
was finished with a lacquer dope to

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.860
make it water repellent.
And, to make it glow,

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.590
they used aluminum powder in the
lacquer dope. And then,

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:33.330
they put iron oxide on the inside.
Lord knows why. So, you basically

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:37.060
have the elements of a thermite
reaction. This is what the shuttle

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.790
uses, in its solid rocket boosters.
So, once this thing caught, it was

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:44.530
the skin that went.
And of course this meant the end of

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.260
rigid airships and commercial air
transportation,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:50:07.453
and to point out that it wasn't the
hydrogen.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:56.130
If that had exploded,
it would have been a very different

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:00.260
scene. This is 1956,
a U.S. Navy airship dirigible filled

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.390
with helium; same thing,
but it had a two ply cotton envelope.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:08.530
Gasoline fire: away it goes.
So, it was the skin. In fact,

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.660
100% hydrogen will quench flame.
It's like running a carburetor too

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.790
rich. You choke.
You need fuel plus oxygen.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.930
You cannot get 7 million cubic feet
of oxygen to the site to

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:25.250
sustain the explosion.
Besides, you're working with only

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:29.750
20% oxygen in air.
This, I blew it up because I

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:34.250
thought this would look sort of like
modern art. So,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:38.750
there it is. This is a Roman candle.
It's not an explosion.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:43.250
If this had been an explosion it
would have been totally different.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:47.750
So, this is stoichiometry. This is
a limited reaction.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:52.250
There was not enough oxygen to keep
it going. So, there it is.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.583
Have a nice weekend.
