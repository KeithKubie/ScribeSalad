00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.060
PROFESSOR: Let's get
right into it.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.160
So last day, we started looking
at Roentgen again and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.800
the generation of x-rays, which
we saw occurred when we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
operate the gas discharge tube
at high voltage and low

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.640
pressure and this is the
image that we saw

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.370
of his wife's hand.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.510
Birth of medical radiography.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.060
And we started looking at the
origin of x-rays and we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.970
started looking at the energy
level diagram of the target

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.620
anode in the gas discharge tube
and this is the energy

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.310
level diagram of the target.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.550
So the ballistic electron--

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.950
I'm calling it incident--

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.810
this is the electron that's
making its journey across the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.500
x-ray generating tube.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.500
It left the cathode and it's
moving across and crashing

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.490
into the anode.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.660
So this is the target
or the anode.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.876
So let's label it as such.

00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:25.250
So we're looking at one of these
mixed metaphors, where

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.150
we've got both a Cartesian image
here of the electron and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.330
we've got an energy image.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.970
So this is the target or it's
the anode and it's charged

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.980
positively and so the
electrons are

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.990
crashing into it.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.635
And we reason that what would
happen is, if the electrons,

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:48.260
the ballistic electrons, had
high enough energy, they could

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.390
actually dislodge 1s electrons
and when they do so, they make

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.150
the conditions for a cascade.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.730
So you can see electrons falling
from n equals 2 to n

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.820
equals 1 and when they do
so, they emit radiation.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.330
They emit photons and these
photons are called K alpha.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.975
K because the final shell
number was n equals 1.

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.850
And remember, the
spectroscopists

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.450
prefer to use letters.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.540
So when the electron ends at n
equals 1, that's n final, we

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.380
call it a K photon.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.670
And furthermore, the subscript
alpha means that the delta,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.510
the n initial to n final
is only one.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.780
So when you go from 2 to
1, you get the K alpha.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.580
And less likely but still
possible is the transition

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.180
from 3 down to 1.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.750
So it's still called a K photon
because the electron

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.930
that generated the photon ended
in the K shell, but it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.140
traveled from a delta n
of 2, went from 3 to 1

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.760
so that's a K beta.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.435
Over here, obviously if we have
enough energy to kick out

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.800
K shell electrons, we have
enough energy to kick out L

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.120
shell electrons.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.550
And so if we lose an L shell
electron and we have a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.100
cascade, then anything that
ends in n equals 2 will be

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.120
called an L photon.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.910
If it comes from 3 to 2,
that's a delta of 1.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.240
That's the L alpha.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.390
It it falls 4 to 2, that's
a delta of 2.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.520
That's the L beta.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.325
And so you can see you
get a set of lines.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.790
And that set of lines
looks like this.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.370
We can plot a spectrum of this
entire set of lines, which

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.185
will be characteristic of the
identity of the target.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.360
And I think I showed you last
day that it's going to look

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.650
like this, where we will plot
intensity and the intensity on

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.410
a spectrum is related to the
frequency of occurrence and on

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.930
the abscissa, we're going to
have some kind of energy

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.520
coordinate.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.300
We can put lambda increasing
from left to right, which

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.020
means energy increases
from right to left.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.420
And we saw that we have this
family of lines where we have

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.610
a discrete line at the energy
of K alpha and a second line

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.860
at the energy associated with K
beta and K beta has a higher

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.780
energy, therefore, a lower
wavelength, and the relative

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.450
heights related to the relative
frequency, again, not

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.470
to scale, but still the general

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.870
relationship is correct.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.040
The likelihood of falling from
2 to 1 is higher than falling

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.700
from 3 to 1 and so you'd expect
to have the intensity

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.060
of the K alpha line greater than
the intensity of the K

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.040
beta line and the L lines have
to be of lower energy because

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.570
transitions 3 to 2 are less
energy than 2 to 1 so we

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.960
expect those lines to be out
here and again, a relative

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.460
frequency where the L alpha has
a slightly lower energy

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.220
and L beta has a slightly lower
frequency of a current.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.645
So that's the spectrum and this
we call characteristic.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.730
Characteristic of what?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.240
Of the identity of the
anode or the target.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.510
This is generating the x-rays.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.500
So if I want x-rays of this
value of wavelength, I choose

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.450
the target appropriately.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.240
That's why we have the
relationship here.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.410
And then the other
thing is that--

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.920
it's obvious, but I just
want to make sure that

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.020
we put it up here--

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.330
it's quantized because we're
looking at the photons coming

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.160
at discrete values of energy.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.910
So that's what we
speculated on.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.230
Are there any data?

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.130
The answer is yes and the data
come from a young man by the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.380
name of Henry Moseley.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.670
He was doing his PhD
up in Manchester.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.820
He was is working
for Rutherford.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.450
Rutherford was his PhD thesis
supervisor and 1913, 1914, he

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.600
was making systematic
measurements.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.170
He was conducting a systematic
study of the characteristic

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.750
spectra of no fewer than
38 elements of

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.560
the Periodic Table.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.910
And what did we learn from
his measurements?

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.170
Learned from his measurements
that there's was a pattern

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.730
here and here's what the pattern
is that Moseley found.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.300
He found that if he took
the value of--

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.120
I'm going to just
take one line.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.170
If he took all of the K alpha
lines from 1K alpha per

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.810
element and he plotted the value
of the wave number of a

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.670
particular line, he found that
the value of the wave number

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.160
of a particular line scaled
with the identity of the

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.720
element by the square of
the proton number.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.420
So, for example, we would
have, say here we

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.300
started with aluminum.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.890
So aluminum proton numbers
13 so 13 squared.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.030
And he went all the
way up to gold.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.670
Didn't do all of them but
he did, as I say, 38

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.740
from one to the other.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.230
And these are discrete values.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.150
You have different elements here
and gold is up here and

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.340
he found that he could take the
set of data for, say, all

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.700
the K alphas and they
lie on a line--

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.260
new bar--

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.440
as if proportional to the square
of the proton number

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.520
and he did the same
with other lines--

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.470
say, L alpha and so on--

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.700
found that they lie on a line.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.400
So what does all of this mean?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.090
Well, let's take a look.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.690
Here's the image of the paper.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.740
High-frequency spectra
elements.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.040
Henry Moseley, Master's degree,
so he's working on his

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.970
PhD, and the data were
taken as follows in

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.780
photographic plates.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.090
And so by trigonometry, you
can figure out what the

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.120
wavelength would be of the line
that would go to this

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.760
degree of distortion, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.120
It's a beautiful set of lines.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.460
Look at how these
date are posed.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.700
So there's calcium.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.530
Scandium is frightfully
expensive so you

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.270
don't see it here.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.990
Then there's titanium, vanadium,
chromium, manganese,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.120
and as you change the element,
the wave number, the

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.820
wavelength, the energy of all
of these lines changes

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.650
systematically in accordance
with the square of the proton

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.610
number, and we got over
here to copper.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.870
Next one is zinc. Zinc melts at
420 degrees Celsius, which

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.320
is relatively low melting.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.530
And under the bombardment
of electrons--

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.450
the bombardment of zinc would
cause it to melt and so rather

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.460
than work with zinc, he instead
worked with brass

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.750
because brass is an alloy
of copper and zinc--

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.890
and look carefully.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.480
You can see that brass has
four lines, two lines

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.670
identical to the lines of copper
and these two new lines

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.670
are the lines associated with
zinc. And I mentioned last day

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.490
that you could actually
deconvolve the complex spectra

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.920
and identify the constituent
elements.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.130
So this was really fantastic,
really fantastic.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.580
Si what did we learn
from all of this?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.210
What did we learn
by these data?

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:44.530
well, first of all, corrected
Mendeleyev What

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.700
do I mean by that?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.570
Not here to say bad things
about Mendeleyev, but

00:09:48.570 --> 00:10:00.240
Mendeleyev had told us that
periodicity is a function of

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.900
the atomic mass.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.670
That's what Mendeleyev said.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.510
Periodicity is a function
of atomic mass.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.460
And now Moseley says no.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.480
Moseley says that
periodicity is a

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.040
function of proton number.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.080
And you can see here--

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.470
I wanted to show you the--

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.810
this is an image taken
from his paper.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.970
He worked for Rutherford.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.770
These people were brilliant
experimentalists and

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.130
so here he's got--

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.500
the cathode is up
here at the top.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.007
You see cathode of x-ray tube
and the feed through and so

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:44.740
on, so the anode is down here
and it's connected and so on,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.020
and rather than take the x-ray
tube apart in order to change

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.850
the target, he went to the
toy store and he bought--

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.330
this is the train from the toy
store and he's got different

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:03.080
elements seated next to each
other on the flat car of the

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.750
train and he's got feedthroughs
with silk fishing

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.180
line so that after he's done
the experiment with one

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:16.790
element, he can pull the train
car over and change the anode

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.002
without having to take
the apparatus apart.

00:11:20.002 --> 00:11:23.160
These guys were very, very
good experimentalists.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.620
So here's from his paper.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.620
The author intends first to make
a general survey of the

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.440
principal types of
high-frequency radiation and

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.060
then to examine the spectra of
a few elements in greater

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.120
detail with greater accuracy.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.210
The results already obtained
show that such data have an

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.840
important bearing on the
question of the internal

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.700
structure of the atom and
strongly support the views of

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.420
Rutherford and Bohr.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.670
It's 1913.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.510
Remember, that's when
Bohr paper came out.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.270
All these people were working
in the lab at the same time,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.800
supporting each other.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.680
You see, this doesn't make any
sense with a Plum Pudding

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.380
Model, does it?

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.640
See, he continues: "We have here
a proof that there isn't

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.910
the atom of fundamental
quantity, which increases by

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.370
regular steps as we pass from
one element to the next.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.340
This quantity can only be the
charge on the central positive

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.840
nucleus on the existence of
which we already have definite

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.470
proof."

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.090
See, not only-- remember, the
Plum Pudding Model has this

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.800
big blob of positive
charge nests.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.770
There are no protons.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.890
In the nuclear model, we have
a nucleus that has positive

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.430
charge and he's saying, I know
there's positive charge, and

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.150
it increases as you go from
one element to the next.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.610
We are therefore led by
experiment to view that N-- we

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.210
use the letter Z today.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.560
He's using capital N.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.460
N is the same as the number of
the place occupied by the

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.740
element in the periodic
system.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.720
This atomic number-- for the
first time, the term atomic

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.450
number is used.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.350
That's why I was being coy here
and I kept saying proton

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.410
number, because that's
the way they knew it.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.480
Now he's say, this is
the social security

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.630
number of the element.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.560
Proton number is then for
hydrogen 1, helium 2, lithium

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.310
3, calcium 20, zinc
30, et cetera.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.310
We can confidently predict--

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.940
look at-- this is the
masters student and

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.770
he's going on a limb.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.680
He says: "We can confidently
predict that in the few cases

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.230
in which the order of the atomic
weights A clashes with

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.190
the chemical order of the
periodic system, the chemical

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.850
properties are governed by N,
while A itself is probably a

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.700
complicated function
of N." He's right.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.160
You look at the Periodic
Table.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.530
You say, yeah, yeah, they just
go in descending mass or

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.990
ascending proton number.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.240
Look carefully.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.180
Potassium has a lower
mass than argon.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.070
And nobody's to--

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.620
well, if you were Mendeleyev,
you'd say, go back

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.340
and measure it again.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.310
Well, they have measured it.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.520
These are the accurate values
and no one's going to put

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.820
potassium underneath neon, but
it comes next in the order of

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.550
ascending atomic mass.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.290
Cobalt and nickel--
nickel actually

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.090
weighs less than cobalt.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.390
But they're transition elements
so who cares if you

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.760
get those two mixed up?

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.080
You find them in stainless
steel.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.610
It doesn't matter.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.960
This is a good one.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.350
Iodine is lower mass
than tellurium.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.040
Iodine is a halogen.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.420
It belongs under fluorine,
chlorine and bromine.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.590
You're not going
to put it under

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.280
oxygen, sulfur, selenium.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.310
But look, there's the data.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.340
And then last one that Moseley
couldn't have known about is

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.090
transuranic synthetic element,
but that's just the fourth

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.390
case in the periodic table.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.580
So that gets you the last wedge
in Trivial Pursuit.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.960
What are the four pairs
of elements

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.460
that are out of sequence?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.470
OK.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:56.630
So now we can say that proton
number is the atomic number.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.200
It's the identity.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.710
So that comes out of Moseley,
comes out of his work.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:07.260
The second thing that he did as
a result of his study of 38

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.420
elements is he figured out
what to do with the

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.160
lanthanides.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.410
Remember our friends,
the lanthanides.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.650
Place the lanthanides
correctly in

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.900
the Periodic Table.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.240
Many of the lanthanides have
a valence 3 so people were

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.840
struggling.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.600
They were putting them
underneath aluminum.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.590
They didn't know what
to do with them.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.450
He placed the lanthanides
correctly in

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.680
the Periodic Table.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.350
And it's not as though
these were brand new.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:46.650
Lanthanum itself had been first
isolated in 1839, and

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.970
all through the 1800s, they
were picking them up and

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.600
finally, lutetium was the
last one discovered,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.390
categorized in 1907.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.500
But people didn't know what to
do with them and remember,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.360
they were obsessed with atomic
mass measurements.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.300
So I'm going to give you this.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.190
I'll give you this piece
of information.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.340
There's the atomic mass of
lanthanum, and the atomic mass

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.350
of lutetium is 174.97.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.940
So what?

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.790
I don't know what to do
with that information.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.430
That doesn't help me at all.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.720
But now comes Moseley and he
says, we're not talking about

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.710
atomic mass.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.450
We're talking about
atomic number.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.460
So now I tell you this
atomic number is 57.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.090
So where do you put it?

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.150
Duh, you put it right
next to barium.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.830
There's no debate.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.800
And furthermore, this
one is 71--

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.310
atomic number.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.850
Well, if this is 71 and
this is 57, I can

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.210
tell you with impunity--

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.980
how many lanthanides
are there?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.650
There's 14 of them from
here to there.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.370
OK.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:58.390
14 elements, which makes sense
because in s we've got one

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.790
orbital, in p we've got three
orbitals, and d we've got 5

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.690
orbitals and these are f
and there's 7 orbitals.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.360
7 times 2 is 14.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.610
Everything makes sense.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.110
And the last thing that's a
corollary to the item two--

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.470
we were able to give
uranium its proper

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.110
atomic number is 92.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.930
So now I ask you, how many
elements are there up to

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.910
uranium starting
with hydrogen?

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.090
92.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:36.180
All of this comes as the
result of Moseley's

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:36.890
experiments.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.420
But it's not over yet because he
worked for Rutherford, and

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.040
Rutherford pushed his
people really hard.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.160
He wasn't abusive, but he
brought out the best in them.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.130
So who else was in
the building?

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.260
Bohr, and what were
they doing?

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.000
They were doing theory and so
he said, well, that's nice,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.960
but he says, I want those things
fit to an equation.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.610
So Moseley said, all right.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.400
I'm going to use--

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.090
there's already an equation in
the building for a new bar.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.390
It's the Rydberg equation.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.200
So I'm going to use a
Rydberg-like equation.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.320
So this is what he does.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.550
This is Moseley's fit.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.490
He goes the wave number of
whatever the line is-- whether

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.550
it's K alpha, L alpha, what have
you-- is going to go as

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.790
the product of the Rydberg
constant--

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.760
1/NF squared minus
1/NI squared.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.700
So far that's just the
Rydberg equation.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.730
But now comes Moseley's
contribution.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:38.260
We're going to put z squared,
but one more piece.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.970
Notice the way I've
drawn those lines.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.100
They don't go through
the origin, do they?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.830
There's an offset.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.140
So he said, let's allow
for the offset--

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.120
z minus sigma quantity square.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.120
And this is known as
Moseley's Law.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.160
And you've got values
for sigma.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:16.270
sigma for K alpha equals 1 and
for L alpha equals 7.4.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.860
So now I can--

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.030
with impunity, you give
me the wavelength.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.670
I can get the wave number-- it's
1 over the wavelength and

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.260
I can plug into this equation
and identify the element or

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.495
turn it around if I want to get
wavelength radiation of,

00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:35.910
say, 1.25 angstroms, I can plug
into this equation and

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.640
come up with the z, which will
tell me what the target

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.890
element choice should be.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.020
So let's go and plug this in
because we're only going to

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.390
look at these two.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.390
So we can say that the wave
number for K alpha--

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.780
it's always going to be 1/2
squared minus 1/1 squared,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.900
which is always going
to come up 3/4.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.600
So it's 3/4 times Rydberg
z minus 1 squared.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.150
So this is for the 2:1 or, if
you like, L to K transition

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.670
and then the other one
of interest here

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.670
is nu bar of L alpha.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.060
nu bar of L alpha's going to
be 1/3 squared minus 1/2

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:26.270
squared, which becomes 536 times
the Rydberg constant z

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.540
minus 7.4 squared and this
is for the transition 3:2

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:38.100
or KLM, M to L.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.150
OK.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.480
So there it is.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.430
And now, what's the significance
of all of this?

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.960
I try to give a physical
significance of this sigma,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.940
which is known as the
screening factor.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.590
We're going to call sigma here
the screening factor.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.840
You'll see why in a second.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.740
Why are we calling it the
screening factor?

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.620
So let's consider what's
happening in the case of the K

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.190
alpha lines.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.010
Let's look at K alpha
generation.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.115
So not to scale.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.480
Let's draw--

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.840
here's the nucleus with all of
its z positive charges and

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.640
then I'm going to draw the
K shell, and its got two

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.480
electrons in it, and I'm going
to show there's a hole here.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.350
Because without this
hole, there's no

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.060
reason for the cascade.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.490
And then I'm going to draw the
L shell and it's got-- what?

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:54.920
There's 2 from the s, 2s,
and then 6 from the 2p.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.860
At most. I know this is
a terrible model.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.820
It violates all kinds of things,
but it's as complex as

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.530
it needs to be for the
explanation I'm about to give

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.900
and I don't want to load you
down with a whole bunch of

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.540
extraneous information.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.210
So consider the electrons
in the L shell.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.380
They see the electron vacancy
in the K shell and they're

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.570
going to fall down.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.330
What's the Coulombic
pull of the nucleus

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.620
on the L shell electrons?

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:27.110
Can you see that it's not z
plus, but at z plus screened

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.200
by 1 minus.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.900
So the nuclear charge
is mediated--

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.210
in other words, it's reduced by
1 thanks to the presence of

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.360
the one negative charge here.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.000
So these electrons in L shell
feel z less 1 and hence, we

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.850
get z minus 1 as screening
factor.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.180
It's plausible.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.360
It's at least physically
consistent.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.780
Now let's look at
the next one.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.230
That's the transition
from M to L.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.850
OK.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.660
So we get to M.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.270
We've got 18 electrons, up to
maximum of 18, and if they're

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.740
going to fall down to n equals
2, there needs to be at least

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.810
one vacancy here.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.000
So now let's use
the same logic.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.120
So an electron in the m shell
sees the positive charge of

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.890
the nucleus mediated by the
electrons between the shell n

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.030
equals 3 and the nucleus.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.210
Now, I don't know how many
electrons there are.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.080
What's the extreme case here?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.700
Two, four, six, seven,
maybe eight, nine.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.910
Because this would still give me
the conditions to generate

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.360
the transition 3 to 2.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.980
I need a vacancy in two.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.050
I don't need a vacancy in one.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:42.640
So this is the maximum.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.620
so that would be two, four,
six, eight, nine.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.990
So it could be z minus nine, but
that would mean that all

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:54.080
of these electrons are on the
same side and I don't have any

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.000
vacancies lower.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.620
I only have one vacancy here.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.265
That's an extreme.

00:23:57.265 --> 00:23:58.880
It's not observed.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.920
And the other extreme is, we
blow away all the electrons.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.130
So somewhere in between 9 and
0, it turns out it's 7.4.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.670
I can't predict that it's 7.4,
but 7.4 makes sense.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:16.490
If the number were greater than
9, I would be distressed.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.063
So it makes sense,
rationalizes.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.320
OK.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.570
And by the way, if you use this
formula, Moseley's Law--

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.380
let's bring that back down.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.520
Remember, I told you I can still
wake up in the middle of

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.540
the night and quote you the
wavelength of copper K alpha

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.590
radiation of five significant
figures.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.690
I had it drilled into me
in my junior year.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.550
It's 1.5418 angstroms.
That's the lambda.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.660
So you can use this formula for
new bar and you know that

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.520
new bar is equal to
1 over lambda.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.170
So I can use Moseley's Law.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.030
But true value, lambda--

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.910
I love this one.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.340
Watch.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.360
I'm going to do a triple
subscript.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.790
Lambda of copper K alpha.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.640
Isn't that cool?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.880
Lambda of copper K alpha is
equal to 1.5418 angstroms. And

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.165
if you use Moseley's law, you
get 1.546 and the delta here

00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:20.600
is 1/3 of 1%.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.800
This man was a positive
genius.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.210
He was heading pell-mell for
the Nobel Prize, but

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.530
he never got it.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.530
Why not?

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:42.190
World War I broke out in 1914
and Moseley was passionately

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.420
concerned about World War I.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.460
He wanted to fight.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.710
He wanted to fight for the
Allied cause and he enlisted

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.250
in the Army.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.990
Rutherford was furious.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.850
Rutherford called the Minister
of War, which is analogous to

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.850
the Secretary of Defense and
said, give him a desk job.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.570
Put him up in Oxford at
a military laboratory.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.400
And Moseley said,
no, I refuse.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.580
I'm going to fight.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.440
And so he was sent
to Gallipoli.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.040
Gallipoli, as you may know, was
one of the bloodiest sites

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.950
of World War I.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.300
A quarter of a million Allied
troops and 1/3 sort of a

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.650
million Turkish troops were
killed at Gallipoli.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.190
Almost 2/3 of a million
people died for that

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.080
little piece of land.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.850
And on August 10th, 1915, at the
age of 27, Henry Moseley

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:37.910
was killed in the battle of
Suvla Bay, and they don't give

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:44.250
Nobel Prizes posthumously, and
so that was the way it ended.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.920
There's a shot of Henry Moseley
with one of his books.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.150
The tributes poured in from
all over the world.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.620
The physics community was
devastated because they knew

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.620
all of this stuff.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.100
This is the one that really, I
think, says it best. This was

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.520
written by Robert Milliken,
an American.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.880
He's the one that gave us the
elementary charge of the

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.620
electron, from the University
of Chicago at the time.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.780
This is what Milliken wrote--
wrote this to

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.920
Rutherford to read.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.520
"In a research which is destined
to rank as one of the

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.590
dozen most brilliant in
conception, skillful in

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.140
execution, and illuminating in
results, a young man 26 years

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.410
old threw open the windows
through which we can glimpse

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.030
the subatomic world with a
definiteness and a certainty

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.880
never dreamed before.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.750
Had the European War no other
result than the snuffing out

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.600
of this young life, that alone
would make it one of the most

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.330
hideous and most irreparable
crimes in history." That's

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.870
when American scientists
knew to write.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.490
It's beautiful writing.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.470
What a tribute.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.850
OK.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.630
So let's move on.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.555
Now that we've got Moseley's
Law, we've straightened out

00:27:58.555 --> 00:28:00.910
the Periodic Table.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.750
So we keep moving.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:09.280
And I say, well, I gave you the
drawing of the spectrum.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.890
Remember the spectrum?

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.140
The spectrum was here.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.670
You see it?

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.400
I'll put it up real
quick again.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.650
This was the spectrum.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.140
OK.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:31.350
This is intensity and this is
wavelength and this is K alpha

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.800
and this is K beta and this is
L alpha and this is L beta.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.920
These are the data coming
from the x-ray tube.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.030
This happens to be a
molybdenum target.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.970
Well, it doesn't quite look like
what I've drawn, does it?

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.340
It looks a little bit like
it, but not quite.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.500
This is definitely there.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.070
You can see some of these lines
so I'm going to call

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:59.220
this spectrum A and it looks
like spectrum A has been added

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.370
on top of something else.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.440
I'm going to call the something
else spectrum B and

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.980
the spectrum B looks
like this.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.100
And in New England--

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.180
this curve has a shape because
it's New England.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.790
This is called whale-shaped.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.780
I don't know what they call it
in the rest of the country,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.170
but it even looks
like a whale.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.440
So you can go on
a whale watch.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.990
So it starts--

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.840
it's a sharp front, goes
straight up, hits the maximum

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.810
and then-- are you
ready for this?

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.780
It tails off, all right?

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.480
Whales have tails, yes.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.160
So what's the difference here?

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.820
Well, the spectrum A, we already
observed is quantized,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.790
whereas this one isn't.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.800
This one's continuous.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.330
It has continuous values up to
this minimum value or, if you

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.320
like, maximum value of energy,
minimum value of wavelengths.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.650
So we got that.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.650
It's not quantized.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.830
And the other thing that's
interesting is--

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.250
spectrum A, we said, is a
function of the identity of

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:08.910
the target.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:13.030
z of the target, whereas this
one, it's a function of the

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.270
plate voltage.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.080
So you can see in the diagram
I've shown you, as the plate

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:24.730
voltage changes, we get a series
of enveloping curves.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.080
So this is V1 and this is V2--

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.780
greater than V1.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.980
So this whale-shaped
thing is somehow

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.245
related to plate voltage.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.770
And then beyond a certain
critical value, can you see

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.410
when you're down here at 15 or
20,000 volts, all you got is

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.780
the whale-shaped curve?

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.510
But somewhere between 20 and
25,000 volts, you hit a

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:53.070
threshold and now you switch on
the characteristic lines.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.170
So with low voltage, you don't
get the characteristic lines.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.260
You only get the whale-shaped
curve.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.320
And then beyond a certain
critical value of V, it's as

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.020
though all of a sudden
these lines appear.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.650
Low voltage, no lines.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.015
High voltage, you get the
characteristic lines.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.960
And what can we do here?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.840
Well, we can compute K alpha,
L alpha by Moseley's Law.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.000
The continuous spectrum can't
do anything with that, with

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.560
one exception--

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.430
here.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:38.460
So let's look inside and figure
out what's going on.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.860
We have a proposal here of
what's going on inside that

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.800
target atom.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.830
So I'm going to make--

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.460
this could be the molybdenum
target up there.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:53.760
So these are molybdenum
atoms. And just as

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.520
in Moseley's figure--

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.990
so this is body centered
cubic--

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.030
I can look that up on
the Periodic Table.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.990
I know this is BCC crystal
structure, molybdenum atom

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.940
sitting here.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.950
This is the anode.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:08.230
It's charged positive and way
up top, I get the cathode.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:13.080
So the cathode is shooting off
ballistic electrons and they

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.510
go zooming across the gap and
crash into anode, but up until

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.800
now, we've just said the
anode is some material.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.580
Now we're going to take one more
peel off the onion and

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.020
say that these are discrete
atoms. It's not continuous

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.470
molybdenum.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.530
It's molybdenum atoms.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.440
And what do we know the
molybdenum atom looks like?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.030
It's got a dense nucleus where
all the positive charge

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:40.460
resides and then there's this
almost vacuum-like zone with

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.760
the negative charge.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.440
So when the electron comes in,
this electron sees the

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.560
negative charge around
the molybdenum atom.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.850
What happens?

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.610
It's deflected.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:56.360
Maybe it comes in on a closer
angle and it's scattered

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.790
through a higher angle.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.550
Maybe it comes in almost
in between and it

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.030
hardly moves at all.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.740
Now can you see that when you
have a charged species that

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.330
changes direction, that's called
an acceleration, and an

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.140
acceleration gives rise to
an emission of radiation?

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.580
So because the angle
of deflection--

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:24.660
so this is low-angle deflection,
this is high-angle

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.170
deflection.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:31.020
So low-angle deflection means
low energy emission.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.590
High angle means high-energy
emission, and the result is

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.580
this continue spectrum that
I've shown you here.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.800
So this is the result of
low-angle scattering of the

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.130
ballistic electrons.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:52.580
This is the result of high-angle
scattering of the

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.230
ballistic electrons, and
somewhere in the middle here

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.670
is the dominant angle.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.880
I can't calculate this curve
with one exception.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.150
Imagine the electron comes from
the cathode, and with all

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:11.750
of its energy is dead on and
stops, gives up all of its

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.070
kinetic energy to a photon.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.440
That's the maximum amount
of energy possible.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.590
Let's look at that.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:24.420
That's the case where an
electron comes in, stops dead

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.930
here and then emits
the photon.

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:31.370
Sp the kinetic energy
is translated

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.420
into the photon energy.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.420
So we can do that one.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.150
That's a straightforward
calculation.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:44.280
So the energy of the
incident electron--

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:49.720
E of the incident electron is
equal to product of the charge

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.950
on the electron and
the plate voltage.

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.440
Well, the charge on the electron
is the elementary

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.300
charge and the plate voltage
is whatever it is, and I'm

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:04.740
going to equate that with the
energy of the emitted photon,

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.520
and that's equal to
hc over lambda.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.730
So now I can cross multiply and
I can call this the lambda

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.250
of the shortest wavelength.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.120
That's the shortest wavelength
on the whale-shaped curve.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.100
So by algebra, you're going to
get the product of the plane

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.550
constant times the speed
of light divided by the

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.930
elementary charge times the
plate voltage, which turns out

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:33.140
to be 12,400 divided by plate
voltage where the wavelength's

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.470
given in angstroms.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.130
Just try it.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.520
If you put 10,000 volts, you're
going to get 1.24

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.460
angstroms, which is smack dab in
the middle of the x-region

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.930
of the spectrum, and this is
called the Duane-Hunt Law.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:54.343
That's the only thing
we can compute in

00:35:54.343 --> 00:35:57.020
the continuous spectrum.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.060
So I can get this one.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.030
Lambda shortest wavelength,
because shortest wavelength is

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.380
maximum energy.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:11.660
Now there's a fancier name for
this whale-shaped curve, and

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.300
it's the scientific community's
term, and it's a

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.010
German word.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.260
It's called bremsstrahlung.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.320
I love it.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.750
You need to know this.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.350
You can impress your
friends at parties.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.060
What does bremsstrahlung mean?

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.650
Brems is the German word for
brake, as when you put on the

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.180
brakes of a car.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.230
And strahl, strahl is
the word for ray.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.910
And ung is like ing.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.950
So this is raying radiation
and this is the

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.250
radiation of braking.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.080
So the electrons are coming in
and when they come up against

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.450
the negative charge of the outer
shell the target atom,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.820
they are slamming on the
brakes and skidding

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.330
everywhere.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.020
So this is what bremsstrahlung
means: braking radiation.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.620
So we're going to call--

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.840
I'm going to put a B here--

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.340
see that?

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.170
I was thinking ahead.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.420
B is bremsstrahlung.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:16.620
OK.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.900
So we've got a lot going
here. for us.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.020
I think we've explained
a fair bit.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.700
Now I want to talk about
modern x-ray tubes.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.030
What do modern x-ray tubes have
that these primitive ones

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:33.900
that Moseley worked
with and Roentgen

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.480
worked with didn't have?

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.300
So I want to show you that the
modern x-ray tube is the

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.890
result of improvements
made by an MIT alum.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:53.880
His name was William Coolidge,
and he's the class of '96--

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:59.490
1896.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:04.260
And he made a number
of improvements.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.680
He actually taught for awhile
then eventually spent a good

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.940
part of his professional career
working as a research

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.030
scientist at the General
Electric Labs out in

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.850
Schenectady.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.470
If you go down to the lobby of
Building 6, on the south side

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.910
of the lobby, there's
a showcase.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.130
Look inside the showcase.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:27.780
You'll see there's a little
display in honor of Coolidge.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.630
So what's the first thing
Coolidge did?

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.640
He was an engineer so he was
thinking about making things

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.250
more efficient.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.270
First thing he did is he turned
the discharge tube into

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.010
a vacuum tube.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.090
Remember, Roentgen worked at
low pressure, but there was

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.910
still gas, and he was blinded
by the light and so on.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.730
This means you don't get any
visible light, and secondly,

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.650
it's more efficient because if
you've got the tube like this

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.510
with the two electrodes, the
feedthroughs and you've got

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.190
gas inside, some of the
electrons are crashing into

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.310
the gas molecules,
and we don't care

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.290
about the gas molecules.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.130
We want to get the electrons
crashing into the target.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.575
So by going to vacuum, this
improves the efficiency.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.485
No glow in the visible and
higher energy efficiency.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.930
More x-rays out per
unit power put in.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.410
What's the second
thing he did?

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.887
Second think he did
was hot cathode.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.610
Remember, you're trying to rip
the electrons out of the

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.690
cathode and send them
on their journey.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.670
So Coolidge reasoned that if you
heated the cathode, you'd

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.110
weaken the bonds, and the
electrons would come off.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.780
They'd boil off much
more readily, OK?

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:54.630
Raise temperature to reduce bond
energy, to reduce binding

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.284
energy of the electrons.

00:39:58.284 --> 00:40:04.450
The electrons in the cathode
makes them easier to boil off.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.200
Think I've got a cartoon
of that.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.310
Yeah, here it is.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.490
So here's the tube lying
on its side.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.300
So the cathode is over
here to the left.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.120
It's negative.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.430
Here's the anode to the right.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.770
That's this purple thing here
and the electrons are moving

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.590
from left to right
and so he's got--

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.090
see, you can have multiple
electrical signals going

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.070
through the same conductor.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.750
It's not the same.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.860
You can't have an AC
waveform and a DC

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.410
waveform in the same conductor.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.950
So you've got a big DC voltage
between the cathode and the

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.440
anode and you'd got a separate
little circuit going through

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.990
the cathode, running almost
like a toaster to

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.790
make it super hot.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.860
So the potential between here
and here is 35,000 volts.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.860
The potential along this stretch
of real estate might

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.250
be several hundred volts,
and furthermore, this

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.200
could be an AC signal.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.720
It's Coolidge.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.940
He was smart.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.530
So this makes this hot and now
for per given voltage, you get

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.610
much more yield of
the electrons.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:01.810
So that was pretty good.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.610
I like that.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.210
Smart.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.160
Third thing he did was he heated
the cathode and he

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.720
cooled the anode.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.970
Water-cooled anode.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.675
Why?

00:41:18.675 --> 00:41:20.280
You got to dissipate the heat.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.830
All these electrons crashing
into the anode.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.250
You raise the temperature of
that anode so high you'll melt

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:29.010
it and so they had to run the
tubes intermittently.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.480
They just get a decent signal.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.400
You have to take these x-ray
measurements over a long

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.510
period of time because the
amount of x-rays you get is

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.680
small, but you have to keep
shutting the thing down.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.260
Otherwise, you melt
through the anode.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.840
So he put that on a water-cooled
copper hearth and

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.990
was able to run continuous.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.240
Continuous operation.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.650
No more pulse current.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.870
But sometimes when nature
hands you a

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.450
lemon, you make lemonade.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:56.730
So I'm going to turn
this thing around.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.790
I'll say, hey, wait a minute.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.070
I don't want any water-cooled
copper anode.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.300
Suppose I want to weld
some titanium.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.240
Titanium melts at 1675 degrees
Centigrade and it's got a

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.190
voracious appetite for oxygen.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.270
Well, this thing's
a vacuum tube.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.950
So what if I were to take my
part and I put the two pieces

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.940
of titanium in the path of an
electron beam and I don't cool

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.710
the titanium?

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.320
Eventually, I get the
temperature so high that I can

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.010
weld titanium.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.060
This is the birth of electron
beam welding.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.130
And that's how you weld
refracting metals.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.260
You get one of those titanium
bicycle frames

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.210
that cost about $4,000.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.030
It might be tungsten
inert gas.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.910
It might be electron
beam, depending.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.430
So that's the flip side
of the technology.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:44.830
By the way, if you were in
attendance observing

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.450
electronic beam welding, what
do you think is being

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.460
generated in the electron
beam welding apparatus?

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.320
X-rays, by the boatload

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.240
So there's a fourth thing--
maybe the most important thing

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.660
that Coolidge came up
with-- shielding.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.050
You see the yellow here?

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.350
That's lead shielding.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.200
Why did he choose lead?

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:24.620
Well, it's got a very high z.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.900
That means it's got many
energy levels.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.300
So that if you start looking at
the energy level diagram of

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:41.640
lead, you've got lots of
action up in here.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.930
So what can happen?

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:50.470
When the x-rays come with their
high energy, the x-rays

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:54.720
from the tube on their way out
to get you, and everybody

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.160
standing observing
this marvel.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.950
They excite electrons inside.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.970
So these x-rays are absorbed.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:07.410
The electrons inside the lead
rise, cascade down and now

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.380
they come out.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.240
And what's the difference
in energy between

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.590
the x-ray and these?

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:16.250
The ones up here are
much lower energy.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.870
So this is, if you like,
a frequency shifter

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.260
or an energy shifter.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.220
So now we're using
photons to excite

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.650
electrons to generate photons.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.000
And that's how the
shielding works.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.570
So you want to absorb
and re-emit.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.690
And while we're on the topic, he
gave us lead shielding and

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.030
he gave us beryllium windows
because they were using

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.690
silicate glass, just as you
use in your home, but the

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.930
silicate glass was absorbing
some of the x-rays.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.440
So to get higher efficiency,
he chose beryllium.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.820
Why did he choose beryllium?

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.350
Well, it's got a low z.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.840
So that means it has
few energy levels.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.880
So therefore, there's less
absorption and re-emission--

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.130
again, higher efficiency.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.400
I think this was taken from
one of the other readings.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.700
So they flipped it around.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.250
See, here you can see the
cathode here, the anode.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.390
That's one of these things.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.720
All right.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.820
So the window is up here.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.860
You don't use lithium because
lithium is unstable in the air

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.950
unless you had a giant room of
humidity set at a dew point of

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.560
minus 38 degrees, see,
and then you can

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.090
use a lithium window.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.580
Otherwise, you use beryllium
and lead down here.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.600
Why'd he choose lead?

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.690
Well, you're pretty much at the
bottom of the naturally

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.390
occurring elements in
the Periodic Table.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.340
So it's the cheapest of
all of these heavies.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:55.410
All right.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:58.240
So now let's take a few minutes
and talk about the use

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.820
of x-rays in characterizing
art.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.570
So this painting here at once
time was arguably one of the

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.950
most recognizable paintings
in the western world.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.270
It's The Angelus by
Jean-Francois Millet.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:16.430
It was painted at 1857 to 1859
on commission for an insurance

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.870
company here in Boston.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:24.490
The Boston Brahmins loved BA's
paintings of rural life in

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.800
19th century France.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.680
And this is couple of peasants
who are giving thanks to God.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.160
The Angelus is a prayer, and
they're thanking God for this

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.790
pitiful bounty of potatoes
evident.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.300
Salvador Dali, as an art
student, was required to paint

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.600
this as part of training.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.340
You know how when you learn to
play the piano, you reproduce

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.660
the works of the
Grand Masters.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.390
So when you go to art school,
you have to paint.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.170
He hated this painting.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.460
For many years, it was here
in Boston, and then it was

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.160
repatriated around World War I,
it hung in the Louvre, and

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.305
then ultimately, now it's
in the Musee d'Orsay.

00:47:01.305 --> 00:47:04.880
In 1963 when Dali was at the
peak of his career, he asked

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.060
the curator of the Louvre
if she would have

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.460
this painting x-rayed.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.160
He said this painting
spooks him.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.480
He doesn't like this painting.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.820
And they x-rayed the painting.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.600
What did they find?

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.640
They found that it had been
painted over down here.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.870
Wasn't an art forgery, Millet
himself had painted it over.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.630
You may have heard two years ago
there was this art find.

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.560
It was a van Gogh painting.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.930
They found that van Gogh had
painted over one of his own

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.770
paintings that had never been
seen before even though the

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.370
pencil sketches survived, so
they assumed that maybe the

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.290
painting was destroyed
in World War II

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.160
or some such thing.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.070
It turns out that van Gogh was
so poor at one point that he

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:44.580
valued the canvas over the art,
and he took his previous

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.570
painting, and he painted
over it.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:46.830
OK.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.140
So this was going on here.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.420
This is the truth.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.620
Now my speculation begins.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:56.800
So what was underneath
here initially?

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.230
It was the casket of a baby.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.290
Look at the pose.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:05.140
These people don't look like
they're happy with their

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.620
bounty of harvest.
They're grieving.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.200
This was this futility
of peasant life.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.530
It was a hard life and
they lost their baby.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.000
So imagine Millet paints this,
puts it on a boat, it comes

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.820
over to Boston, they unveil it,
and the directors of the

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.090
insurance company go, we can't
hang this in the lobby of an

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.010
insurance company.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.550
That's my speculation.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.990
It didn't take him three years
to paint this thing.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.920
I think it spent most of
its time on the boat.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.680
They sent it back
and said fix it.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.080
So he put the basket
of potatoes.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.200
That's my theory.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.490
All right, look at the pose.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.990
This is from the Galleria
Borghese in Rome.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.810
I was there about two years
ago and saw this and went,

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.010
wow, referential.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.460
You see, everything's
been said.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.720
All of art has been said.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.940
Now we're just recasting it.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.560
So now here's Dali's revenge.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.160
Now this is what he paints.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.090
You see the man is shorter
than the woman.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.070
His hat is down a little bit
below the waistline.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.540
There's all sorts of
psychosexual things going on

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.020
here, but we're running
out of time.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.790
So here's Dali and his father
and his dad is saying, see,

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.360
this is life, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.120
So you can see the reference.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.810
See, man taller here, woman
taller, et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.640
Have you seen this one?

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.000
The Hallucinogenic Toreador.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.690
OK, he went outside one day in
Manhattan to buy some pencils.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.870
There was a company called the
Venus Pencil Company, you see.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:33.220
And so he came back and made
this trompe l'oeil.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.360
So this is the toreador.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.900
Do you see the breast
here is the nose?

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.390
There is the face.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.940
There are the flies of the
Thames and here is

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.545
the cape and so on.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.860
Symmetry plane-- all of those
Venuses facing back, these

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.690
Venuses facing forward.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.830
There's the bull.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.910
The life force of the
bull is a crystal.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:00.970
What is the crystal structure?

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.560
It's one of the 14
Bravais lattices.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.230
If you ignore color, it's
simple cubic, isn't it?

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.080
And if you don't believe
me, check.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.310
And if you don't appreciate
it, study.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.360
Here's the symmetry plane.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.770
Atoms, atoms, fly, fly
et cetera, et cetera.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:18.630
What else do we have here?

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.900
Oh, this is the one he painted
on the occasion of the

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.610
revelation of the structure
of DNA.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:25.990
It's hard to see, but
over here is the

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.230
double helix of DNA.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:35.770
This is his wife Gaia and here
are people standing in cubic

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.600
arrays with guns pointing
at each other.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.540
And the point that he's making
is that now that we've

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:47.420
discovered the instruction set
for reproduction of life, not

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.160
just human life, but life, we
are still at a point where we

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.770
can't resist killing
each other.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.820
So this was the point and he
chose to use cubic arrays, and

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.090
I would venture to say
this is simple cubic.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.060
If you put a fifth person here,
it would be-- are you

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.570
ready for this?

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:03.820
Body-centered cubic.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.750
Oh, yes!

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.260
And there's more, but I think
we're running out of time so I

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.610
think at this point we will
dismiss the class.
