00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:03.980
I'm not arguing that and I think the I'm
 

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.500
I'm not arguing that and I think the I'm
guessing of course they weren't going

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:05.510
guessing of course they weren't going
 

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.970
guessing of course they weren't going
for the desperate and pathetic route

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:06.980
for the desperate and pathetic route
 

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.949
for the desperate and pathetic route
they were going for so who's just trying

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959
they were going for so who's just trying
 

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:11.980
they were going for so who's just trying
to ignore the past or ignore what just

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:11.990
to ignore the past or ignore what just
 

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.360
to ignore the past or ignore what just
happened and trying to go back to a

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.370
happened and trying to go back to a
 

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.850

simpler time I'm just guessing you know

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:18.860
simpler time I'm just guessing you know
 

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.470
simpler time I'm just guessing you know
I think especially after writing the

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480
I think especially after writing the
 

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.270
I think especially after writing the
last episode with him saying such

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:22.280
last episode with him saying such
 

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.850
last episode with him saying such
hurtful things to say yeah this episode

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:24.860
hurtful things to say yeah this episode
 

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.009
hurtful things to say yeah this episode
be right after

it's I can't quite see working the other
way either but to have this be

00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:30.309
way either but to have this be
 

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:32.609
way either but to have this be
immediately after that it just they

00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:32.619
immediately after that it just they
 

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.379

well there was an episode in between
that probably would have been a little

00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:37.239
that probably would have been a little
 

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:40.439
that probably would have been a little
bit smoother yeah or even I was saying

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:40.449
bit smoother yeah or even I was saying
 

00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:42.720
bit smoother yeah or even I was saying
to maybe there's an episode after that

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:42.730
to maybe there's an episode after that
 

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.220
to maybe there's an episode after that
