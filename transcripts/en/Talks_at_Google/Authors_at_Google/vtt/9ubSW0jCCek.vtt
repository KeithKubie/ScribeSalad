[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.830
MEGAN GREEN: Though initially
trained as a painter,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.800
William Wegman is best known
for his conceptually-driven

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.080
photographs and
videos featuring dogs.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.860
An early adopter of video
as an artistic forum, Wegman

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.570
continues to make
work that is equally

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.850
distinguished by
its experimentation

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.640
while simultaneously
appealing to a broad audience.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.410
After adopting a
Weimaraner named

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.320
Man Ray in the early
1970s, he embarked

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.770
on what he describes as a long
and fruitful collaboration

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.530
with the canine, featuring
his dogs in humorous

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.580
and often contrived scenarios.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.910
After Man Ray's death,
Wegman's second dog,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.670
Fay Ray, and her offspring,
became the central characters

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.170
of his work.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230
Wegman's whimsical photographs
of his Weimaraner dogs

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.180
have been celebrated
in the art world

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.650
and enjoyed by pet lovers
for nearly four decades.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.370
This entirely new volume
presents more than 300 images

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.710
from the artist's personal
archive, unearthing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.160
previously unseen gems along
with iconic images that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.410
have made Wegman, along
with the dressed up

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.400
dogs Man Ray, Fay Ray and
others beloved worldwide.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.238
Please welcome William Wegman.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.583
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:16.910
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Don't get up.

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:23.906
Oh yeah, here we are.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:27.950
Yeah, well, one of the reasons
that I photograph these dogs

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.750
so much is, it was kind
of like the Son of Sam.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.970
They made me do it.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.800
You know that story?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.180
Instead of being
a psycho killer,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.070
I'm a psycho photographer.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.100
So yeah, it's been a long,
very long history photographing

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.290
these dogs. but I
want to start the talk

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.280
with before I got a
dog, four or five images

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.470
from the late '60s, early '70s.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.650
And I assume I just hit this.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.850
There it is.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.850
So this is the first
photograph that I ever

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.830
took that made me realize I
could make photographs as art

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.740
rather than whatever
other reason

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.750
you would take photographs for.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.960
Back then, not everyone had
a cell phone, obviously,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.370
with a camera attached.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.720
So it was something you had
to learn about, get up, and do

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.760
somehow.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
In this case, I was teaching
at the University of Wisconsin,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.540
and I had one of my
students teach me

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.810
how to print and develop.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.580
That's one of the beauties
of universities is,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.170
you can tap into all
of those resources.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.140
And I certainly did
that with my students.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.250
I used them as my
models sometimes

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.880
and as my information.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.230
I wasn't a really good teacher.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.135
So I only taught
for three years.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:51.590
And I had nothing else to
do but move to New York

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.600
and become a famous artist.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.340
So if I had become
a good teacher,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.130
I would have still been at
the University of Wisconsin,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.920
tenured and all of that.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.380
So this started it all.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.770
I made this in Wisconsin
when I was teaching there.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.010
And what appealed to me
was the sort of circles.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.840
I had drawn little
circles on my hand

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.770
and when I reached
down into cotto salami,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.240
my hand seemed to
dissolve into it.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.200
So I stole these from the
party and went home to my house

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.510
and took this picture.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.790
And I did didn't say "eureka."

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.700
And from there, I started
to make other photographs.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.510
And here's another example of
a non-dog piece that's really

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.340
about photography, isn't it?

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.700
It's about trick photography,
because certainly what

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.650
happens after the
middle frame isn't

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.560
what happens in the last frame.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.750
Something far more
amazing, but somehow

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.290
it made a really
nice, nice picture,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.680
I think, and explained
photography, in a way,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.810
to the masses.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.550
Here's another use of milk,
kind of a mistake use.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.630
Three mistakes,
this one is called.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.210
I used milk a lot because
it photographed well.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.100
And my dogs liked it too,
which, as you can see there,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.130
rivets him in place.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.910
I didn't have to
train him at all.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.480
I just had to place him.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.640
And then, of course,
the hard thing

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.560
was building the whole floor
under him while he was there,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.080
and that took some time
and some real artistry,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.120
but I managed it.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.700
And this is my first
dog, Man Ray at, I think,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.530
about seven weeks.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.040
And he was a fat, tubby
little Weimaraner,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.590
as I found out why months
later, when he pooped out

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.076
a gigantic, blue balloon.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.760
A beach ball, in fact.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.440
He thought of himself as a
person rather than a dog.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.420
Let's see what else I got here.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.350
And there's him in old age.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.770
There he is, photographed
with this unique camera

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.310
called a Polaroid
2024, which takes

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.810
pictures that are 24 inches
vertically at that time

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.470
instantly.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.920
Development time was
about 70 seconds then.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.890
So I would kind of
build these works.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.920
This was actually my very
first color photograph.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.050
I just started out
using black and white

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.370
and didn't think
color was something

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.550
I should be dealing with.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.950
But I felt since I
painted his nails red,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.820
it would be a suitable
first color photograph.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.910
And I titled this one Fay Ray,
not realizing 15 years later I

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.030
would name my next dog
"Fay Ray," after Fay Wray.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.690
And other things with
the Polaroid camera

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.400
with Man Ray, the camera
at that time was in Boston,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.080
and I was living in New York.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.610
And so I would stay
with a friend in Boston

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.450
and use her props.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.360
She was working with Styrofoam.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.520
I think that was
one of her socks.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.890
So these pieces are kind
of built on the spot.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.870
And this one's titled "Bad Dog."

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.940
And it was the last photograph
I was ever able to take.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.440
Not true.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.100
And another kind of
photograph that startled me

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.250
because it's kind of kitschy,
it's anecdotal, isn't formal.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.230
I don't know if it's art
or not, but whatever.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.840
I took it, and
there you have it.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.760
This was taken on location
in Rangeley, Maine, where I

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.300
spent my summers and still do.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.910
Interestingly, there
is a kid holding up

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.390
the stuffed owl and another
kid behind the house sticking

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.360
that taxidermied deer head in.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.820
So these were lots
of fun to make.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.470
And I imagine this would be a
suitable last photograph of Man

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.970
Ray.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.820
He was getting very old.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.350
This was on Kennebago
Lake in a canoe.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.420
And I really contemplated just
launching it and then driving

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.960
back to New York,
because it just

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.200
seemed like it would be
a good way to end it all.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.890
But I didn't.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.800
I rescued him in time
for this picture,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.020
which is one of my favorites.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.030
I titled it "Dusted."

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.490
It's made with flour standing
over him on a step ladder.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.820
And if you look closely, you
can see these bronze stripes

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.850
that I sprayed on his back,
because I had been making him

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.710
into a raccoon, and
I had some flour

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.545
to sprinkle on his nose
just for some details,

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:44.230
but the flour looked
so great I ended up

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.110
climbing up on this
ladder and having

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.970
another person-- a lot
of these photographs

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.595
weren't really taken by me, but
I don't think that's a problem.

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:53.980
Right, Jason?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.540
I take a very small
percentage of my own pictures.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.840
And here is Fay in one of
her really classic moments.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.140
She's like Pandora, I think.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.800
After Man Ray died,
I didn't photograph

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.680
another dog for five years
or do much of anything

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.820
for five years.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.420
As it turns out,
I thought I was,

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.700
but when I looked through
everything, I really wasn't.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.980
So this is Fay Ray.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.060
And I love the way she's--

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.039
I loved her look.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.455
She looked different
from Man Ray.

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:29.980
She was thoroughbred,
a real Weimaraner,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.730
not a pretend Weimaraner.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.909
And she could do some
pretty crazy things.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.440
Getting her in front of
the camera in her youth

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.170
gave me some possibilities
I didn't have with Man Ray.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.650
Unlike Man Ray, who was
six weeks old when I first

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:57.620
photographed him, Fay
was practically a year.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.240
She took to it.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.220
The first time I got
her was at six months,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.500
so I didn't start her off.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.560
And so the camera is
bigger than this podium

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.700
here, quite a bit bigger, and
the dog is in front of it,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.070
and I'm off to the side.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.720
So I'm here looking
at Fay, who's there.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.510
And so I say "Ready, Fay?"

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.379
And when I say "ready," she
looks right into the lens.

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:26.920
I don't know.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.550
Somehow she knew how to do that.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.640
And this is the first--

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.340
It's called "Dressed
for a Ball."

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.090
It's a good title.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.440
And it was the first
dress dog thing I made.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.180
And I didn't wanna do the
anthropomorphic thing,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.960
but this was so weird and
exciting that I said "Hm."

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.740
And that led to this, which
is the evil stepmother

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.220
in my first children's
book "Cinderella."

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.440
She has her Joan
Crawford look there.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.160
And then how do I do
this with one dog?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.060
Well, I don't.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.540
I get another dog.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.180
And how I did that is, I bred
Fay to Arko, a German dog

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.500
in Maryland.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.630
That's a whole nother story.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.300
A very exciting
one, because I had

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.080
to photograph Barbara
Bush at the White House,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.740
and it was before 9/11.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.510
So a German shepherd got
in on my Polaroid truck

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:33.270
to check for bombs
not very carefully,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.380
and went over to my personal
bag and started going crazy.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.030
And the guard said, "Do you
have a sandwich in there?"

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.950
And I said "No, my
dog was in heat,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.920
and I dropped her off
in Virginia on the way

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.520
to this event."

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.020
So.

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:54.830
And this is Fay's
daughter Battina.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.710
This looks like Lolita, right?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.210
Of course.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.630
It's Lolita.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.920
A pretty sexy picture
of a dog, I must say.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.810
And Batty was as
different as from Fay

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.560
as Fay was from Man Ray.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:17.220
She was narcoleptic,
very long and careless,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.020
and really a wonderful
kind of a superstar.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.920
As you can see by the
next few pictures,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.300
she's really a spectacular dog.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.940
And every time I'd use
the Polaroid camera,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.980
which was maybe a
week out of a month,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.490
I forgot where I left off.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:43.910
So that's why I keep inventing
so many different movements.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.020
And this is the first day
of her son's life, Chip.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.620
And six months later,
he's playing the flute.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.010
So dogs mature
spectacularly, don't they?

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.610
This dog, Chip, led to a lot
of other children's books

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.880
that I started to make,
not with a Polaroid camera,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.780
but with my Hasselblad in
a two and quarter format.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.440
And this is another
sister Batty,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.395
Fay's other daughter, Crooky,
who is really a wonderful dog.

00:12:15.395 --> 00:12:18.700
I didn't have her, but she
belonged to a friend of mine

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.750
in Maine and loved to work,
as all the Weimaraners

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.040
that I've had have liked to do.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.860
I thought of making
a movie, which

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.750
I would title "The Hardly
Boys" as a parody of "The Hardy

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.880
Boys."

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.290
So this is [? Shundo ?]
and Fay's number one

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.530
son with Batty in a scene
from the Hardly Boys

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.870
in an amphibious car.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.940
And it was really, really
difficult to teach him

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.900
how to drive.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.310
It's not like a simple car,
where you just press on it.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.390
There's so many other
different features.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.570
So after the training period,
we were able to do this.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.940
This one was even harder,
how to teach dogs to sail.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.500
Because you get into
a car, you press it,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.700
but sailing a boat on a lake,
believe me, is not easy.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.480
Right, Jason?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.930
I'm saying "Jason" because
Jason is underwater there

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.170
in a wet suit, making
sure the boat goes

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.910
close enough to the dock and
the giant Polaroid camera.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.190
Then, after all of this
kind of narrative stuff,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.500
I wanted to get back to
something that looked like art.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.600
I think I was criticized
by someone saying that I

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.100
was going down the wrong line.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.110
So I wanted to obey
that, and I started

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.090
to make things
that look like art.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.092
This looks like Leger, correct?

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:47.370
Am I right?

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.890
Art majors out
there, or art lovers?

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.310
And another abstract
picture using the two

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.270
dogs with a Polaroid camera.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.510
You can see the Polaroid
fuzz marks on top there.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.870
That's how they come
out of the camera.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.880
And other fun things
that are kind of formal.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.880
This is where I've
turned them into rocks.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:14.484
Weimaraners really sort
of transcend themselves.

00:14:14.484 --> 00:14:15.500
Another fun thing.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.140
This is Chip, who's a very
handsome dog, I thought.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.910
And another dog, who is really
one of my assistants, Marlo.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.020
She had a dog, a very dark
Weimaraner with yellow eyes

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.400
she named Mazzy.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.180
And Mazzy would work
just once in a while

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.110
but really love
the strobe lights.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.440
So this is a picture, one
of my favorite pictures

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.491
that I made with her.

00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:41.490
And there's another one.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.970
You can see she's almost black.

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:48.730
More of those trick things.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.920
And there's the cover
of the recent book.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.100
This is Candy, one of the least
photographed of all of my dogs.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.520
She usually found a way to make
a really awful face in front

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.550
of the camera.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.660
I think that strobe
lights bothered her.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.950
So I ended up using
her in action a lot.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.170
This is her daughter, Penny.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.560
And this is my dog, Flo,
who's still with us.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.610
She's now seven.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.530
And this is not with
a Polaroid camera

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.600
but with the digital stuff.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.190
This is Flo's brother, Topper,
a year and a half younger

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.570
half-brother.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.300
This kind of looked like some
sort of electric connection,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.780
this picture.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.400
And then some flying stuff
and some magic with candy.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.420
And that's the end of that talk.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.150
So now we're supposed to
talk some more, right?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.070
MEGAN GREEN: We're
going to talk some more!

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:48.590
Thank you.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.606
That was great.

00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:53.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.340
I think that was a great
overview of this book, which

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.800
is comprehensive in nature and
a really great introduction

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.480
or reintroduction.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.390
Or, if you're a longtime
fan, it works for everyone.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.460
So obviously we've seen
your beloved Weimaraners.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.040
Can you tell a little
bit more about the breed,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.020
how you found the
breed, and what it was

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.605
like to popularize the breed?

00:16:16.605 --> 00:16:17.480
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.370
Well, I didn't get
one to photograph.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.190
I got one because my
first wife, Gayle,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.130
the deal was, we would
get a dog when we moved

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.610
to California from Wisconsin.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.210
So she wanted a
short haired dog,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.360
like a Dalmatian or
something, and someone said

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.580
"What about one Weimaraners?"

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.160
And I had remembered
seeing them,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:41.470
so there was an ad in a Long
Beach paper, "Weimaraners $35."

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.710
And so I went out to see
this litter of Weimaraners.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.010
And I swear, I flipped a coin.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.310
I still didn't want one.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.410
So I picked tails, and it was
tails five times in a row.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.980
So we had to get that dog.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.176
MEGAN GREEN: And now
you're glad you did.

00:16:55.176 --> 00:16:55.960
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I did, yeah.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.470
So I brought him
back to the studio,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.870
and then I just started
to do photo and video,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.770
so he was always in my
studio and of course I

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.245
photographed him.

00:17:05.245 --> 00:17:06.369
And I [INAUDIBLE] with him.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.452
MEGAN GREEN: And you've
popularized the breed too.

00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:10.440
And because of that,
there's been a lot more--

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.773
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, I was
a little worried about that.

00:17:12.773 --> 00:17:14.780
In 1978, eight years,
when Man Ray was eight,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.280
I didn't photograph
him for a year,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.380
because I didn't
want to do that.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.609
I didn't want to be
nailed to the dog cross.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.520
But now, after he died and
I started to photograph Fay,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.660
I accept it and I
actually cherish

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.060
that I think that I'm really
lucky to have had this,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:38.430
certainly embraced it
totally with Fay and all

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.164
of her offspring.

00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:40.080
MEGAN GREEN: For sure.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.074
And so you've had
10, is that right?

00:17:42.074 --> 00:17:43.240
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I've had 10.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.930
MEGAN GREEN: And you showed
us, obviously, a lot of them

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.030
have gone by from
Man Ray and Fay Ray,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.650
and Fay Ray had all
these offspring,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.290
and then now you
have Flo and Topper.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.040
WILLIAM WEGMAN: That's
right, who you met.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.000
MEGAN GREEN: Who I have met
and who are absolute delights.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.350
WILLIAM WEGMAN: To some.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.160
MEGAN GREEN: To me.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.170
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.140
their personalities
have differed over,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.100
you know, you've had
a lot of these dogs.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.040
You pick these dogs sometimes.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.900
Some you've inherited because
of their family lineage.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.386
Some you've actually
worked with and picked.

00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:13.760
Can you tell us a little bit
about your selection process

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.575
and what their
personalities are like?

00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:16.450
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.350
Well, certainly, Man
Ray being the first

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:25.270
was somehow oddly
memorable, also

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.245
him starting so
young at six weeks.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.930
He was my only dog too, so he
didn't really like other dogs,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.820
and I think he thought
of himself as a person.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.750
And he is the only
dog that I've had

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.800
that would try to figure
out how to drive a car.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.460
I remember him
looking at my feet.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.710
Because he'd sit in the front.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.800
I had a pickup truck then.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.500
He'd look at my feet and look
at the wheel, and look at me.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.890
And once, when I was
developing photographs,

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.650
he got the idea that
cones were interesting.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.650
So he kept finding
cones out of the kitchen

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.040
and would bring, "Oh, this could
be a good toy for us, Bill."

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.870
So he kept thinking
of things, and he

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.030
was really, really demanding.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.000
He also emitted a
high pitched whine

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.100
when I wasn't doing
something with him, which

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.130
really got under my nerves.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.769
"OK, OK, we'll do something."

00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:18.560
MEGAN GREEN: Well,
these dogs all love you.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.170
I mean, I've seen you work
with them, and they're all--

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.190
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Every dog I've had,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.106
even though they've been
very, very different,

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:28.780
each one, each group, one thing
is, they really love to work.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.230
They love being in the studio.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.810
They just go down
there very happily,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.240
and that's because I
don't give them treats.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.730
It's just like a thing we do.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.860
And I think because
they're working dogs,

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.500
like a hunting dog, they
like being around that kind

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.080
of busy but not--

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.750
you know how some people dress
up their dogs for Christmas

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.940
or birthday parties?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.790
MEGAN GREEN: Yes.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.900
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I do it every
day, so it's kind of their job,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.140
and they take it differently.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.300
MEGAN GREEN: How do
you feel about that?

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.299
So there's the Halloween
Dog Parade in New York,

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.480
and now there's a lot of
Instagram famous dogs.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.050
There's Men's Ware Dog,
and a lot of people

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.630
are using Instagram as a way
to make their dogs famous.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.420
You kind of started
that whole thing.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.850
How do you feel about
how that's evolved?

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.070
WILLIAM WEGMAN: What
is Instagram, anyway?

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.370
I don't know how to go
on any of those things,

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.850
but people have told
me that you should

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.080
go put your stuff on Facebook,
and I don't know how to do it,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.920
but I have people.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.105
MEGAN GREEN: I can help.

00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:27.860
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, I have
people that do it for me,

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.980
and you can help me too.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.310
MEGAN GREEN: Yeah.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.960
WILLIAM WEGMAN: So
I think it's good.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.280
I love showing my work, and
I love having an audience.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.430
You know what made
me so happy was,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:39.020
my dogs were on Sesame Street
a long time ago, 20 years ago.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.420
And when I biked the dogs
through the so-called projects

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.210
down 18th Street
further down, I hear

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:53.030
people say, "Hey, those are
those TV dogs," or "Sesame

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:53.750
Street."

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.622
These kids are only 20 years
old, and they have that.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:57.830
It makes me feel really good.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.370
MEGAN GREEN: It's amazing.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.722
And you do bike with them.

00:20:59.722 --> 00:21:01.430
That's how they get
walked, so these dogs

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.540
have a very active life.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:02.990
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Oh, they do.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.440
I have to keep
them in good shape.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.070
There's nothing worse than
a fat, ugly Weimaraner.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.447
Sorry if you happen to have
one, but you have to keep them.

00:21:10.447 --> 00:21:12.530
MEGAN GREEN: So this book,
it's really interesting

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.160
how it came to be, and
it's amazing to see all

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.344
of these photographs together.

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:19.010
You had to go through
a lot of archives.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.660
You have a lot of pictures.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.220
You showed us even
a sampling here.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.530
What was that like
emotionally, to go back

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.680
through this long history
of four or five decades

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.919
to select 300 pictures
to put in this volume?

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:31.460
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Yeah, well, I kind of

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.480
forgot what I was doing.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.730
I would rent the cameras, as I
said, for a few days at a time,

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.040
or sometimes for a
project or whatever.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.610
And then I'd put them away
in these archival boxes

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.020
and forget about them.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.940
Certain ones would
be rephotographed

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.450
with a 4x5 camera at the time.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.280
And those would be used for
calendars or occasional book.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.200
But a huge percentage of
them were just stored,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.750
put in storage in these boxes.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.930
And one day, Jason,
who is over there,

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.050
said we should take
a look at these.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.260
And it was pretty amazing.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.160
There's so many things
that I forgot that I did,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.830
directions that had dropped off.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.670
Also, the emotional thing
was, we worked rephotographing

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.440
them digitally backwards.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.950
So I could see the dogs getting
younger and younger and then

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.750
before they were
born and another one.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.865
It was very emotional, seeing
the curve of these 10 dogs.

00:22:26.865 --> 00:22:28.490
MEGAN GREEN: And
speaking of how you've

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.236
selected all these scenes
over the years and you've

00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:34.610
put them in boats, you've done
all these very complicated

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.712
things, what inspires you?

00:22:35.712 --> 00:22:37.670
So you've talked a little
bit about art history

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.370
and how you went back to art
history, but when you go, "OK,

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.480
what's the next concept,"
"what's the next,"

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.230
since this book is
organized thematically?

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.490
So how does that come to you?

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.186
How do these different
scenes and costumes?

00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:51.060
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.610
Well, for a while, it
was children's books.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.970
And that was fun for a
while until it became not

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.360
fun for a while.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.092
And I always loved putting
my dogs, getting them up.

00:23:02.092 --> 00:23:04.550
They're used to that through
the Polaroid camera, which you

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.520
had to raise up to that level.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.630
So I got used to
having them on things.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.780
And it's a way of
keeping them there too.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:17.000
Once you get them up, getting
down is more complicated.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.804
And they wait for
me to lift them up.

00:23:18.804 --> 00:23:20.720
MEGAN GREEN: Yeah, they
don't startle, really.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.261
I mean, I've seen
you work with them.

00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:24.142
Most dogs would be running.

00:23:24.142 --> 00:23:25.850
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Well,
they're not afraid,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.440
and I don't put them up
on things they don't like.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.040
So if something bothers
them, the last thing I want

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.260
is that look, so I avoid that.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.950
So we keep the studio calm.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.450
MEGAN GREEN: There's
a lot of trust.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.170
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Yeah, there's trust.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.870
And they yell, and it's just,
"OK, you don't want to do that?

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.520
We'll do something else."

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.480
But a funny thing happened, my
wife, who you met, Christine,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.320
got completely sick of this
crappy furniture I would drag

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.430
off the street to use
as props. and our house

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.660
was just full of it.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.570
So she thought what if we
use some really great stuff

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.500
that we get from Eames or Herman
Miller or one of these places.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.570
So she started to
bring these things in,

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.250
and that led to a whole new--

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.250
because they certainly had
colorful, bright, interesting

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.830
props, and that led
to a show called

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.350
"Good Dogs on Nice Furniture."

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.640
And that was a
pretty recent thing,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.190
but then last late
spring, French "Vogue"

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.630
asked me to do some dogs with
all of these designer clothes.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.650
And we did that, and
that was spectacular.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.670
I had people making
wigs for them,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.980
and really I thought
dressing up dogs

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.280
wasn't going to work
because of Photoshop.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.582
"Oh, he just sticks
a head on a, you

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:43.465
know, and photoshops it in."

00:24:43.465 --> 00:24:45.380
But no, there's a
way to work with it.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.869
So you really know theatrically
the dogs are cooperating.

00:24:49.869 --> 00:24:51.410
MEGAN GREEN: And
you don't photoshop.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.192
These dogs are--

00:24:52.192 --> 00:24:54.650
WILLIAM WEGMAN: No, I might
clean up some gunk or something

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.540
from around the
edge, but I never

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.432
stick their heads on stuff.

00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:00.890
MEGAN GREEN: That's
pretty amazing.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.220
So speaking of dressing
them up, making them taller,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.260
this book is called
"Being Human."

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.300
What does it mean to be human?

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.147
You've mentioned that Man
Ray thought he was a person.

00:25:12.147 --> 00:25:12.980
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yes.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.479
MEGAN GREEN: So
what does that mean?

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:17.389
And in the context of this book,
what does it mean to be human?

00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:19.430
WILLIAM WEGMAN: It's a
title that the real author

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.870
of the book,
producer, Bill Ewing--

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.500
does he go William Ewing?

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.370
I guess.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.830
He thought of it, and I didn't
really like it at first.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.700
And then I thought,
"OK, well, it's OK."

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.420
I'm not sure if it's OK, but
all of the different categories

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.690
that we ended up using
made it really interesting,

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.190
that there's dogs
as human people,

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.887
there's dogs as lots
of other things.

00:25:43.887 --> 00:25:44.970
MEGAN GREEN: Right, right.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.844
That's very cool, and
I think a lot of people

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:49.670
do think of their pets
as part of their family,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.727
as having very human qualities.

00:25:52.727 --> 00:25:54.810
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, until
I had my kids, though,

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.520
I realize that
they're different.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.620
Dogs are different
from children.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.810
MEGAN GREEN: In what ways?

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:03.055
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
In a lot of ways.

00:26:03.055 --> 00:26:06.810
Their college is a lot cheaper.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.620
I don't know.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.830
I mean, I care
about them as much,

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:16.550
but when they don't call--

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.550
although that's similar.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.920
When they're lost, some of my
dogs used to wander for hours

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.342
and eventually come back.

00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:23.550
I mean, they're hunting dogs.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.360
They would just
go and go and go.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.850
Yeah, it's similar
but different.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.809
MEGAN GREEN: Some of these
photos seem super complicated.

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:34.350
Like you were talking
about the boat.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.183
What are some of these
scenes that have just

00:26:36.183 --> 00:26:38.601
been so difficult to execute?

00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:40.350
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I can't
believe I bothered

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.410
to do some of these things.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.210
I don't work as hard
now, but I used to.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.940
And when you have something
so expensive and so formidable

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.430
as the Polaroid
2024 camera, which

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.740
you import with a Ryder truck.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.590
You had generators,
light banks, assistants,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:05.280
you're spending $10,000
a day, you get attention.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.572
You just go-- and I
just used to use it as

00:27:10.572 --> 00:27:11.780
though it was 35 millimeters.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.130
Click, click, click, click.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.080
Even though it was $50
every time you go click.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.997
So it was pretty amazing.

00:27:17.997 --> 00:27:19.830
And I'm really glad
that I used that camera,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.020
but I'm really happy now
that I'm not anymore.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.050
It's very difficult.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.750
MEGAN GREEN: And what
are you using now?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.330
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Jason,
what do I use now?

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.250
JASON: A Hasselblad.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.650
WILLIAM WEGMAN: And?

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.520
JASON: Digital back.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.090
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah?

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.110
What's the digital back?

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.196
Do you know?

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.420
JASON: It's Hasselblad.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.350
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah,
that's what I use.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.860
MEGAN GREEN: OK.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.970
So that's awesome.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.590
Switching gears a little
bit, so we talked.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.620
You mentioned a
couple of projects--

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.900
"Sesame Street," "Vogue."

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.550
That's a wide
range, and it's made

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.850
you widely known everywhere.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.360
What projects stick out that
you've absolutely loved?

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.800
How do you find these projects?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.300
How do these
projects come to you,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.640
and what's that been
like, to be invited

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.980
to do all of these really
interesting things?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.188
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I think
probably the first children's

00:28:04.188 --> 00:28:08.900
books with the Polaroid
camera were kind of amazing.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.990
It led to a direction I didn't
think I could have gone into

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.840
but did, and I showed
a couple of pictures

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.480
from there, notably
the evil stepmother.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.410
But I also did little
red riding-hood.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.810
And that interested me because
of the animal transformation,

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.370
the grandmother dog
thing with my dogs.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.160
That made sense.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.060
With Cinderella, I had the
idea of adoption appeal to me.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.940
Because you adopt a dog, you're
either its fairy godmother

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.160
or evil stepmother.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.030
Dogs are usually sent away
someplace and adopted,

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.150
so that seemed to be
a nice way to do it.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.130
Plus, I had a cast.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:53.830
I had a whole family, mother,
Fay, daughter, Batty, other son

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.200
being both the Wolf and
the Prince in those books.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.800
So I had a cast, a
family of family actors,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.510
an acting troupe.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.320
MEGAN GREEN: You
had a whole troupe.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:05.911
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Yeah, a whole troupe.

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.740
So doing all these
books, I made maybe

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.427
about 12 children's books.

00:29:09.427 --> 00:29:10.260
MEGAN GREEN: I know.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.770
I had them all.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.404
WILLIAM WEGMAN: So it
was really fun to do.

00:29:14.404 --> 00:29:15.570
MEGAN GREEN: That's awesome.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.890
And so you've done a lot of
these really popular culture

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.030
sorts of things.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.610
It has exposed you
to so many people.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.610
But you're a fine
artist by practice.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:26.660
Your postcard paintings--

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.743
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Thank you.

00:29:27.743 --> 00:29:30.180
MEGAN GREEN: Your postcard
paintings are amazing.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.674
I'm a big fan of those.

00:29:31.674 --> 00:29:33.090
And I was hoping
you could tell us

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.450
a little bit about what
that was like to reconcile

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.620
doing these really popularized
commercial projects

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.500
with your fine art
practice and your training

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.470
and your love of painting.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.970
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Well, you have
to realize that, in the '60s,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.560
painting was being attacked.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.750
It was dead.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:56.050
And so I turned to, not
because someone told me to,

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.180
but I found myself
interested in video,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.760
which was available
in a portable format

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.730
for the first time when I
was teaching in Wisconsin.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.050
And also the idea
of using a camera.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.330
So that was really,
I think, advanced,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.240
in a way, and
pioneering, so to speak.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.960
MEGAN GREEN: Yes.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.050
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
But painting, which

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.050
the reason I went to
art school was because I

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.420
loved to draw and paint--

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.360
"Hey, you should
go to art school.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.650
You're a really good artist."

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.310
So I went to art and found out
painting was not really it.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.880
And then grad school,
started to work

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.710
on a grant with a
biological computer lab,

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.830
working with engineers, making
interactive environments

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.937
and machines.

00:30:41.937 --> 00:30:43.770
And that seemed like
it was really advanced.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.210
Painting seemed like it was
so 19th century and so passe.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.450
And then I found myself
not around a big university

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.512
but just in my studio.

00:30:54.512 --> 00:30:56.470
And I said, "You know,
I really miss painting."

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.960
It was something that
I really loved doing.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.550
So secretly I started
doing it again.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.690
I didn't show anyone.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.380
In fact, I painted
my first painting

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.500
on the back of one of
those stretchers there.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.600
I had leaned it
against the wall.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.020
And the painting was of--

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.610
it had a telephone
wire broken in it,

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.160
which means no one can tell
anyone that I'm painting.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.550
So it was kind of a secret,
sheepish enterprise.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:28.300
But each year, I
sort of advanced it,

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.840
until one year I said "nah."

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.689
So I stopped for
about five years,

00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:34.730
and then I started again.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:35.938
And now it's just part of me.

00:31:35.938 --> 00:31:39.255
I've probably been painting
as long as anything.

00:31:39.255 --> 00:31:42.100
And some people, like
yourself, do know me as that.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.510
MEGAN GREEN: For sure.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.610
And I think that was
a great transition

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.840
about you being a pioneer.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.200
Because one of the other
projects that you have

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.120
currently up is at the Met.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.590
And you and your wife have
given 174 of your early video

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:02.020
works, which have been
described as pioneering works

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.540
of the 1970s and video art.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.090
And it's an amazingly
generous gift,

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.050
and I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about how you

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.010
think the videos are perceived
today versus when you made them

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.820
and what that journey has
been like to now see them

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.105
collectively at the Met?

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.230
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Well, sure.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.180
I think the gift thing,
I was just really

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.320
happy they wanted it.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.240
MEGAN GREEN: Yeah.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.240
WILLIAM WEGMAN: "Really?

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.630
OK."

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.200
So I'm really thrilled,
and they did an amazing job

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.620
installing that work, I
thought the video especially.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.370
But then I first started to make
it, I knew that it was good.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.370
And the reason I knew it
is, when I went to edit it,

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.440
technicians would
stop and look at it.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.790
It was riveting.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.100
And my parents would like it.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.340
And my parents' uncles, who
didn't like anything, liked it.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.750
And so it drew people in.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.570
I wasn't sure if the
art world would like it.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.860
In fact, some didn't.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.090
I remember Joel Shapiro,
a friend of mine now,

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.430
first time I saw it, I
gave a talk at Pratt--

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.530
"I hate humor in art."

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.570
You know, I do
too, but not mine.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.370
I will hate everyone else's.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.590
I think it's stupid.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.870
But mine was somehow
OK, don't you think?

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.300
MEGAN GREEN: I totally think so.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.330
And they talk a lot in the show
about this East Coast and West

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.510
Coast almost rivalry
in what was happening

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.130
in the art of the '70s.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.240
Did you really feel that?

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.170
And what was going on?

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.300
You were on the West
Coast at that time.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.240
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I
didn't feel it at all.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.800
The work I was doing was
from Wisconsin, video.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.170
And then suddenly I was an LA
artist because the timing was

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.110
so perfect, I think.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.230
There were other artists
that were working similarly.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.360
And so I was in
all of these shows

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.690
called-- the first one
was "24 Young LA Artists."

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.230
"11 LA Artists."

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.750
The work was just like,
I had one week in LA.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.910
So it seemed to be to
say something about LA.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.080
And that's fine.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.400
And then when I moved to
New York three years later,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.850
I guess I was still in LA
for a really long time,

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.054
and I might still be.

00:34:15.054 --> 00:34:16.000
MEGAN GREEN: It's so
funny, considering you--

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.874
WILLIAM WEGMAN: But I'm
a Massachusetts artist.

00:34:17.874 --> 00:34:18.370
That's where--

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:19.661
MEGAN GREEN: Where you're from.

00:34:19.661 --> 00:34:22.449
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, when I was
five years old and my parents

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.602
said, "Oh."

00:34:24.602 --> 00:34:27.699
Or my uncles would say,
"How's Billy the artist?"

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.501
My parents would say, "He's
upstairs drawing pictures."

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:33.111
So that's the way it started.

00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:35.110
MEGAN GREEN: And now
you're a neighborhood local

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.446
of the Google office
here in Chelsea.

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:38.320
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.969
MEGAN GREEN: You've been in
Chelsea a long time and not

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.650
so much in LA, even
though that might

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.570
be your former reputation.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.840
So what's this
neighborhood change

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.340
been like and watching that?

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.989
You've been here a long time.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.920
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Someone wrote
a book about 18th Street,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.270
and they said when we moved in.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.790
The whole neighborhood changed.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.970
And not dramatically because
of me, but it did 23 years ago,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.570
or two years ago was when
Chelsea really started to--

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.380
all of this.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.610
The empty lot started
to go this way.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.350
Then there was the
High Line and you guys.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.780
How long has this
place been here?

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.850
MEGAN GREEN: I think about 12
years, something like that.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.310
You can fact check me there.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.560
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Pioneer again.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.420
MEGAN GREEN: Pioneers
of the neighborhood.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.836
We're happier here,
and it's nice,

00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:23.237
because people do you see
you walking and biking along

00:35:23.237 --> 00:35:23.820
with the dogs.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.720
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah,
it's really good.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.470
MEGAN GREEN: Cool.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.060
I'm going to also
invite anybody who

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.360
has a question up
to the microphone,

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.730
so you can start thinking
about your questions.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:38.030
And we'll take some questions
from the audience too.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.740
Don't be shy.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.860
But I will continue.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.290
I have more questions.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.340
So another project you're
working on is with RxArt.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.190
RxArt is a fantastic
organization

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:53.150
that puts contemporary art
into children's hospitals

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.290
and does fabulous projects.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.952
And you have a project that
is opening in Flint, Michigan.

00:35:56.952 --> 00:35:58.160
WILLIAM WEGMAN: That's right.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.850
Pretty soon.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:03.087
We've found a way to
make these pictures--

00:36:03.087 --> 00:36:04.670
Jason, what's the
name of the material

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.670
we're using on these photographs
that's going to be in Flint?

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.350
JASON: Infused--

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.822
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Infused something?

00:36:10.822 --> 00:36:12.150
JASON: Sublimated metal.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.340
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, it's
an amazing process where

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:22.880
the photographs of the
dogs can be made publicly,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.690
and they're archival, and
they won't get damaged.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.390
I've done other projects,
Rx-related, in hospitals.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.230
I went to a cancer unit
in Washington for kids,

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:45.990
and it was just spectacular,
seeing them enjoy the work.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:51.400
And this trip, I'm going to be
doing art projects with them.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.890
So the pictures will be on
the walls in the hospital,

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.015
and I'll do stuff with the kids.

00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:57.100
MEGAN GREEN: It's a very
nice way to give back.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.770
WILLIAM WEGMAN: With the dogs.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.560
MEGAN GREEN: Oh, are
the dogs coming too?

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.767
WILLIAM WEGMAN: No, but
me and the dogs' pictures.

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:03.600
So they'll be able to
make their own William

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.562
Wegmans if they
want, or whatever

00:37:05.562 --> 00:37:06.520
else they want to make.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.686
MEGAN GREEN: That's awesome.

00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:10.630
OK, we'll take a
question from over here.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.830
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi there.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:12.746
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Hello.

00:37:12.746 --> 00:37:14.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.390
My question is in regards
to the actual photographing

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.560
of the dogs.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.630
So if you had any
specific tricks?

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.610
You mentioned that
you didn't use treats

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.110
when photographing your dogs?

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.230
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.660
So I was wondering if you
had any specific tricks

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.950
of if you held up stuffed
animals or dog toys

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.042
or how the dog really
stayed still for so long?

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.750
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Every
group and every dog

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.550
has had a different requirement.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.650
Two of them have been
really into balls.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.870
I just hold a ball
up, and suddenly

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.510
Fay in particular, or Man Ray.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.740
But Chip, Batty's son, you
could toss him the ball,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.000
it would bonk off his head.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.190
Or he'd go, "Why
are you doing that?"

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.990
He was almost like "Ooh."

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.810
So I had to think
of different things.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.940
I don't use food
generally, because I

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.860
don't like lurching and drool.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.114
I like more just a composure.

00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:04.780
The hardest thing, though, is in
the videos, where I had to get,

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.540
let's say, four dogs doing
four different things.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.480
Because you call one dog,
you go, "Fay," and all four,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.920
"What do you want with Fay?"

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.720
So I did something
really unique with that.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.360
I would talk through
tubes to throw my voice

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.430
during the filming, to
have my voice come out

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.840
in different ways.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.990
And another trick
I did was, we'd

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.299
film one shot in a building
that had a roof that

00:38:28.299 --> 00:38:29.590
went in a different directions.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.280
I had somebody throw gravel
on, and it would roll down

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.650
in different ways.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:39.430
So the dogs would react,
and that was very effective.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.910
But in the films, getting two
dogs to do different things

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.170
is a super challenge.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:53.740
For photography, sometimes
with one dog, if I just hide,

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.390
then he'll look for me.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.100
And that's with Topper, and
he gives a really great look.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.460
Like, where'd he go?

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.850
And the movies again, I can talk
about this for the whole two

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:04.940
hours.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.460
The movie is to make--

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.950
there's one dog that had
to play an evil character

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.300
and a nice character.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.460
For him to look evil, I
walked far away from him,

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.562
and he would squint, and
he'd look like a bad guy.

00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.770
And then to have the good
character, go really close.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.180
Because he liked me.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.490
And he'd look at me like that.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.320
So that's how I changed his
personality, by proximity.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.930
There's also a lot of
different things with angle.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.350
Like, a dog
photographed slightly

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.070
below looks kind of stupid.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.600
They look smarter
when you go like this,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.680
because they get more cranium.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.890
Dogs that have their
ears that go this way,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.000
like Batty, look very
smart, because it

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.470
makes their head bigger.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.904
And if they're like this.

00:39:45.904 --> 00:39:47.320
There's all these
different angles

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.964
that you have to explore.

00:39:48.964 --> 00:39:49.880
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.545
Thank you.

00:39:50.545 --> 00:39:51.836
WILLIAM WEGMAN: You're welcome.

00:39:51.836 --> 00:39:53.850
MEGAN GREEN: Thank you.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.590
Also thanks for
coming, the same way.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.720
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Welcome.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.710
AUDIENCE: The first
time I came to New York,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.930
I think it was
about 2001, I really

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.960
remarked on how many
Weimaraners there were around.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.675
I thought it made New York
seem very fancy, like all

00:40:08.675 --> 00:40:10.910
these people had
cooler, prettier dogs

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.450
than the rest of the world.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.910
And when I finally moved here,
I guess about 10 years later,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.520
I really felt like I had passed
the age of the Weimaraner.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.017
They just weren't
around anymore.

00:40:21.017 --> 00:40:23.350
Is that just my perception,
or have they really gone out

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.980
of fashion?

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.375
And if so, do you know why?

00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:27.750
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I don't know
how to answer that question.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.660
There's a few in
my neighborhood.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.040
And people say, "Oh, I
saw you walking your dogs

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.170
the other day."

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.042
And no, I was not
around, and I'm

00:40:36.042 --> 00:40:37.250
the only one that walks them.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.820
So I know there's someone
with two Weimaraners.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.100
There's one guy that
had a Weimaraner.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.430
He's from Iran.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.060
He and his dog were in Iran.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.290
And you're not allowed
to have a dog in Iran.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.900
The dog learned to
be quiet and hide.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.710
Isn't that amazing?

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:55.480
MEGAN GREEN: Wow.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.290
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah,
so I met this guy.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.744
He's a painter.

00:40:58.744 --> 00:41:01.160
MEGAN GREEN: Did you ever think
about being a dog trainer?

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.155
I mean, you have better tricks.

00:41:02.155 --> 00:41:04.100
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I'm
terrible at training.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.690
Ask anybody, right?

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.370
My dogs are really untrained.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.842
But in the studio, they're good.

00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:09.800
MEGAN GREEN: Very good.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.275
That's amazing how that works.

00:41:11.275 --> 00:41:12.191
WILLIAM WEGMAN: It is.

00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:14.270
It's amazing, but it's true.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.240
MEGAN GREEN: So we have a
dog friendly culture here,

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.220
as you can see.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.880
Do you think Flo
and Topper would

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.620
make good Google
dogs, given that you

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.000
said they're not well-trained?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.660
Do you think?

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.450
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Flo would
be in the restaurant.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.070
Wouldn't leave that alone.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.244
And Topper would be
after these little dogs

00:41:33.244 --> 00:41:34.410
here, but in a friendly way.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:35.305
He loves other dogs.

00:41:35.305 --> 00:41:36.180
MEGAN GREEN: He does.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.300
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.730
MEGAN GREEN: He carries
his blanket around.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:38.400
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, he does.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.380
He nurses on it.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.840
He's a child.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.340
Yeah.

00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:45.793
MEGAN GREEN: Oh, another
question, please.

00:41:45.793 --> 00:41:47.459
AUDIENCE: Hi, I think
you had mentioned,

00:41:47.459 --> 00:41:50.487
when you started off in art
school, you were a painter.

00:41:50.487 --> 00:41:51.320
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yes.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.903
AUDIENCE: I was
interested in learning

00:41:52.903 --> 00:41:56.180
more about what other
artists you were looking

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.550
at when you were younger.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.750
Because I know that around
the time when you're

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.740
talking about how you moved
to video and the art world

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.820
was moving in this
different direction.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.810
So I just wanted to
learned more about that.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.620
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Well, I went
to art school first in Boston,

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.520
Mass College of Art.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.050
And at that time in
1961, it was sort

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.650
of the tail end of abstract
expressionism, third generation

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.420
and all of that.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.310
And so the more advanced
artists, like Frank Stella

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.940
and so forth, were doing these
sort of hard edged paintings,

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.100
I think they were called.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.740
And there was a show that
I saw at the Brandeis

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.930
Museum of Stella,
those black paintings.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.980
That was very influential to me.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.990
And I started to become, I
suppose, a minimal artist.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.210
And then when I went to
grad school in Illinois

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:46.262
in mid-'65, I kept
doing that for a while.

00:42:46.262 --> 00:42:47.720
But then I quit
painting altogether

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.900
and started to make these
interactive environments.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:56.810
Way over my head
scientifically, but I I sort of

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.530
liked to follow that.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:04.430
But artists that I liked were,
besides Stella at the time,

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.190
were Bruce Nauman I
thought was pretty amazing.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.220
He was one of the
first video people.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.660
So the reason I moved to
LA rather than New York

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.260
after I didn't get rehired
as a teacher in Wisconsin

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.810
was Al Ruppersberg, a
really amazing artist

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.550
that's about my age.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.290
And he had a
presence in LA, so I

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.170
moved to LA hoping to
meet him, and I ended up

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.890
meeting him and Ed
Ruscha, and Baldessari,

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:40.737
and a lot of the really
well known LA artists.

00:43:40.737 --> 00:43:42.320
And there was a whole
group of artists

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.170
there that I became
friends with that were not

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:50.049
quite so well-known, but yeah.

00:43:50.049 --> 00:43:52.340
MEGAN GREEN: You're a big
hockey player, is that right?

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.131
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I'm a
little hockey player,

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.820
but I love hockey player.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.130
I do, and it's close to
the Chelsea Piers here,

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:02.990
and that's a really
good thing for me.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.000
It really is my
social life, in a way.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.200
Because I don't go to parties
or drink or anything like that.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.067
I just have the locker room.

00:44:11.067 --> 00:44:12.650
MEGAN GREEN: Have
you dressed the dogs

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.565
up as hockey players yet?

00:44:13.565 --> 00:44:15.565
WILLIAM WEGMAN: I did
once, yeah, in a Brown--

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:26.360
A friend of mine who went to
Brown, I dressed one of my dogs

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.820
up in Brown hockey gear.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.850
And then my son, who just
arrived, went to Brown,

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:36.250
and that's a dirty word here.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.780
Yes?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.499
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you again for coming.

00:44:39.499 --> 00:44:41.040
You're one of the
first photographers

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.630
I can remember being a fan
of, when I studied photography

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.280
in college.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.330
And I was wondering if
you've faced any resistance

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.530
or criticism of accepting your
work with the dogs as art?

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.440
Because they're dogs or
because they're dressed up?

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.990
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Certainly.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:06.460
In fact, the first head of
MoMA was, I guess, Szarkowski,

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.100
and he wasn't really
a big fan of my work.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.280
It was more like real
photography rather than this.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.500
And I can sort of
understand that.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.550
I really don't like
a lot of my work too.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.690
But some stuff just comes
through, in spite of myself.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:25.400
And that, I think,
drives me in a way.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.610
But when I first
did photographs,

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.310
I didn't want to be known
as a photographer at all.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.825
I thought that was a bad
word, being a photographer.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.820
But my first dealer, Sonnabend,
had a really amazing collection

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.370
of photographs,
real photographs.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:50.450
And I gradually came to
know it and really like it.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.880
But some people
don't like my work

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.250
because I'm abusing the dogs.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.080
That is certainly not true.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.400
Anyone who has seen
me work, as you have.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.440
MEGAN GREEN: Oh, yes.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.856
WILLIAM WEGMAN:
Whether they think

00:46:01.856 --> 00:46:07.996
the dogs are being
not nobly projected,

00:46:07.996 --> 00:46:08.870
that's another thing.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.703
Or if they don't like
the work, that's fine,

00:46:10.703 --> 00:46:13.490
but to think that they're
abused is not good.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.512
It's not right.

00:46:15.512 --> 00:46:17.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.790
MEGAN GREEN: Cool.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:23.760
So my last question is, you have
a show coming up in conjunction

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.440
with this book that's touring.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.774
And that's very exciting and
going all around the world.

00:46:28.774 --> 00:46:30.856
So maybe you could tell
us a little bit about that

00:46:30.856 --> 00:46:32.590
and whatever else
is next for you

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.840
and what we can expect to see
from you and Flo and Topper?

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.080
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Yeah, well,
there's also coming up,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.750
there's a show coming up at
the Met, the Metropolitan Opera

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:48.690
Gallery, of the Cinderella
pictures in a couple of weeks.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.370
So that's around the corner.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.290
And it's nice to see
those reprised in a way.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.620
So I'm happy about
that, and I love music.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.850
So that's good.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.560
It's going to be
at the same time

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.520
that the "Cendrillon"
is playing.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.250
The big show coming
up in Arles has

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:13.130
many of the pictures that are
in this "Being Human" book.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:17.034
It's going also to Melbourne
and some other places.

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:18.200
MEGAN GREEN: That's awesome.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.950
Well, thank you so
much for being here.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.140
Books are available
for sale in the back,

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.200
and please check
out "Being Human."

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.942
And if we can give
a round of applause

00:47:26.942 --> 00:47:27.900
to Bill for being here.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.917
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:30.000
WILLIAM WEGMAN: Thank you.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.400
Thank you.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.950
MEGAN GREEN: Thank you.
