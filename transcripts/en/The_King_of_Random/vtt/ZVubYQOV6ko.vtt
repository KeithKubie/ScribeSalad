00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.909
You guys ready to do this? Hahaha.  You might remember this guy.  This is Brian Brushwood with The Modern Rogue.  Links in the description so

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.290
you can go check out his channel

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.429
And we were back today testing out whether or not you can actually make a grenade with a coconut. [it's] cold. We're semi protected

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.419
We have a blast shield we got coconuts. That's what coconuts. Look like in, Texas

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.170
Hey, don't Judge, Texas by our coconuts everybody knows that moldy coconuts are a delicacy all right. So back when I was growing up

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.739
There's a movie called Swiss Family Robinson. Yeah, sure the Disney class it's a

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.399
1960s movie about a family they got shipwrecked on an island that got invaded by pirates in the way that they defended themselves was by

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.399
Making these coconut grenades and throwing over the edges

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.440
So they basically use black powder coconut shells and I imagine banana leaves to make the fuses and they made these improvised

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.100
explosives

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.419
So do they actually work the purpose of this experiment today is to find out whether or not you can actually

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.919
Use a coconut to make a grenade this isn't an experiment. We would recommend trying at home

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.579
That's why we're not trying it in my home. We're trying hip prints and we're not telling you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.670
How we do it either?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.840
These fuses have dried out overnight they become pretty stiff and rigid and we've done a couple of tests and they do look promising

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
They burn a little bit faster than we were expecting right? Oh, my gosh lightning fast. We're Gonna run

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.639
Now one thing that's a little bit unfortunate is most of the coconuts

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.760
We got were young and you can tell that because these ones are white now

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.049
He's black and white don't you look at the face of that coconut you can see two eyes and a mouth yep

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.969
Yep, now. I want you to just take that screwdriver and show us how difficult it is to burrow through the mouth

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Oh jeez hahaha. I

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.540
Did not expect that man. I was thinking we need a drill or some nonsense

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.180
Now in contrast why don't you try poking that through one of the eyes? Oh, jesus not happening. Oh, really?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.139
[oh], wow had no idea [-] see guys. I wouldn't lie to you coconut knowledge people. He says oh, I'm so sorry

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.109
I don't know what I did to deserve it so update guys

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.459
We've got our coconuts prepped and ready all we have to do now is stick in a fuse and light them off this one has

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.390
little

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.620
One has more this one is just right which one is going to make the biggest effect

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.199
What do you think little more or most put your comments down below and let us know before we try it you know it's so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
Cold out here. My lips are frigid. Yeah, they're fridging up. So we rigged up the fuse here

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.570
We got the paper fuse that may or may not burn superfast and we've got sugar fuse taped to it as well

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.260
So this will give us quite a bit of burn time

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.980
We hope so we're starting off with the smallest charge we're going to set this thing and get behind our black shield and just see

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.509
How the [first] reaction goes I'm ready? I [filled] [it] [boss]. All right, so is this gonna work

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.229
This is our smallest charge, so it looks like this thing off and see how it does

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.470
Okay, I'm glad we have a shield that thing ricocheted and like just do I hit my face. I'm amazed

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.890
Wow

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.640
Look at that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.200
That is full-on

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.299
Shrivel I saw a pieces flying probably at least a good 20 feet there

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.290
You know what I'm starting to think that there's some viability to the whole coconut grenade idea

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.979
[oh] yeah, no, I wouldn't want to be standing in the way of one wow let's check out the damage

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.489
Where's the coconut [it's] completely vaporized so your thoughts and impressions on that, Mr.. [Brushwood]. I was like comfortable with those projectiles

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.790
Now the next one has twice as much of the charge this one did so is it gonna be a bigger explosion or is it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.790
going less of an explosion

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.970
Coconut grenade number two let's have at it. [alright]. I'm ready to do the [honours]

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Good life here. He goes

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.810
oh

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.429
Wow, I mean that's looking more and more like a real grenade man dude

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.180
You know what my impression is like we'd probably use more powder than necessary

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.220
Yeah, because like there's so much still left behind but the power that that shell blast out with was was really preston

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.989
So I don't know where all the shrapnel win this one flew about 20 feet away smells like toasted coconut

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.679
Still chewy tribe. Oh is it yeah? [oh] there's still parts all we saw spits out butter in there

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.789
I wonder if that's because like it's a little bit too moist, so I didn't burn completely who?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.500
tastes like coconut

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.860
So our next one actually has double that amount of power

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.849
We call this one big bertha. Yeah, we call this one Brian hides behind the blast shield tell me how it goes

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.450
It's gone. Oh

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.299
Dude, I felt the repercussion [for] that. That was like an electric shock. It was like a thunderclap right in front of us

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.370
whoa

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.720
Is that [amazing] it would have been deadly? Oh, you're right there

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.489
That's that's ripping arm off right there the shrapnel like flies out completely horizontal

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.150
Yeah, I know. It's none of this john t up it comes and down and falls

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.280
This is just like out of my way. You're killing people okay? [so] yes bigger is better bigger is bigger

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.500
Well guys, that's all we were able to find in five minutes of searching so check it out guys coconut grenades totally viable

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.690
[I] think so, so you're stranded on a deserted island battling pirates it might be a good option [to] yeah

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.429
You could just raid your cannons for the powder you can use banana leaves to make the fuses use the coconuts

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.850
[I] don't know how you make a blast shield up king of random. You're an agent of Chaos

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.750
Super cool hanging out with you guys today [too] big. Thanks to you Brian brushwood. Yeah

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.580
man join us over at the Modern Rogue Channel

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.780
We're doing all kinds of stuff like this

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.690
So I got his links in the description below if you like the stuff we're doing here

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.709
You're probably gonna like the stuff that he's doing over there as well, so go check [him] out [high] five yeah

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.489
There's good stuff, and high fives to you guys. We'll see you in the next experiment. Talk to you, then I?

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.479
Really can't I know it's cold family please

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.289
