00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.370
You are listening to radiolab radio from W. N y.

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.030
S. T. E. N. P. R.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
Okay. Let us begin. Hello. Hello. With it. An unusual encounter,

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:18.060
which comes from this lady Susan Schaller.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.740
And where do you want me to start? Her story starts off actually,

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.710
it starts kind of abruptly. I was, uh, indeed riding a bicycle to high school

7
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.880
and a catering truck hit me

8
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.050
and I was put in the hospital with a concussion.

9
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.780
I was 17 years old and the concussion was bad enough that, um,

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.100
it slowed my brain enough that I couldn't read.

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.920
And so naturally I couldn't go to school, which sucked for her at 17.

12
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.760
I was very much a nerd and I was bored out of my mind.

13
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.220
So Imagine Susan sitting there in the hospital one day, one of your friends,

14
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.110
a friend of mine who is just a little older and had graduated the semester

15
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.560
before me, suggested going to the nearby university and, uh,

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.440
crashing classes. Why would you go if your brain was working slowly?

17
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.230
Why wouldn't you go swimming? I couldn't read,

18
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:17.520
but I could listen and I could hear and I, and the person was saying that, oh,

19
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:18.780
it's a lot better than high school.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
And so one day she was at this college just kind of wandering down a random hole

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.610
and I opened the first door on the left.

22
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.240
That was the accident that changed my whole life,

23
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:35.560
just picking that door at the front of the room. It was this older guy,

24
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:40.360
he was still, he was bald and he was tracing sheeps in the air with his hands.

25
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.590
It was as if there were pictures being painted in the air and then they

26
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.520
immediately disappeared. Then another picture appeared.

27
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.130
<v 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.300
<v 0>I was mesmerized.</v>

29
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.670
<v 1>Wow.</v>

30
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.670
<v 0>The professor was signing this class was actually one of the first classes to</v>

31
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:04.240
teach sign at a regular hearing university. I had,

32
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
I had also walked into history but didn't know what fast forward five years,

33
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:11.510
Susan now is fluent in sign. She moves to Los Angeles.

34
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.440
It's the late 1970s and I was snatched and put into interpreter training

35
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.170
programs because at that time there were very,

36
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:22.171
very few interpreters and I found myself in a classroom in a community college

37
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.510
and something called a reading skills class. So she walks into the class,

38
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.320
she's kids all over the classroom making big excited gestures.

39
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.660
One to the other end out the door.

40
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.290
I saw this man holding himself kind of off by himself making his own straight

41
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:42.000
jacket. She went over to the instructor and she pointed at the guy who, who,

42
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.810
who's that guy over there at me instructors as well. Um,

43
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.900
he was born deaf. His uncle, he has this kind of insistent uncle who,

44
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.280
who brings him here every day.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.770
We don't know exactly what to do with them though.

46
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.860
And what did this guy look like? He was a beautiful, um,

47
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.260
well, now I know, I don't know if I would had that in my head at the time,

48
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.060
but a beautiful looking Mayan, you know, high cheekbones and black hair,

49
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.110
black eyes and something about his eyes caught heritage.

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.400
He was studying mouth and I, I walked up to him and said, hello,

51
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.770
my name is Susan and this is where things start to get a little weird.

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
He looks at her and instead of signing his name, whatever it was,

53
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.470
he brings up his hands and signs right back to her. Hello, my name is Susan.

54
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.490
Susan like Shakespeare. There's no I am Susan. And he responds, no, no,

55
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.840
I am Susan. Everything you said he tried to say exactly.

56
00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:41.410
I call it visual Echolalia

57
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.740
and I remember thinking, why is he doing this? I mean,

58
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:52.900
Susan, did he, did he look like he had some kind of disability or um,

59
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.640
he was intelligent.

60
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.520
I wouldn't have been able to answer if you had asked me how can you see

61
00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:02.510
intelligence, but you can actually see intelligence and people's eyes.

62
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.460
He was just missing something to copy me meant that he didn't really know what I

63
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:11.720
was doing and that's when it occurred to me. This man does not blind

64
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.330
<v 3>at, wait, how old was this guy? He was 27 years old. I mean in all that time,</v>

65
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.820
no one had taught him sign language or anything. Well,

66
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.980
it didn't know he was deaf. He was born deaf.

67
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.360
He didn't know there was sound really 27 years, no idea that there was sound.

68
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.420
You could see the mouse moving, could see people responding.

69
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.650
He thought we figured all this stuff out visually and he thought,

70
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.240
I must be stupid. So here's the question for our hour.

71
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.800
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich words.

72
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.900
What do words do for us? Are they necessary? Can you live without?

73
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.860
Can you think without them? Can you dream without them?

74
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.690
<v 0>Can you, can you swim back to the story?</v>

75
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.110
So this man that Susan, that we don't actually know his real name,

76
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.260
but when she wrote about him in her book, a man without words,

77
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.220
she called him Ildefonso. They are sitting in the classroom,

78
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.450
she's right there with him.

79
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.480
And of course she's wondering what have you been doing for 27 years?

80
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.701
So she thinks, well,

81
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.840
let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language in interest in case

82
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.400
she takes out a book. And makes the sign book, but the sign for book,

83
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.200
it looks like opening up a book.

84
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.340
So he thought I was ordering him to open a book and so he grabbed the book in

85
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.620
the opens because they thought I was asking him to do something.

86
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.740
It was very difficult if I gave him the sign for standing up,

87
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.590
he thought I wanted him to stand up and so I couldn't,

88
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.020
I couldn't have a conversation with them then.

89
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.920
It was the most frustrating thing I've ever done in my life. Wait a second.

90
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.820
How long did this go on for? Well, uh, weeks.

91
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.230
There was weeks oftentimes when we said goodbye or just laughed me couldn't

92
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.130
really say goodbye. I really believe that we wouldn't see each other again.

93
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.220
And I was oftentimes very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table.

94
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.160
And I think sometimes he looks surprised that I showed up,

95
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.780
but after a couple of weeks of him constantly miming copying me,

96
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.530
she had an idea perhaps. So it's just possible that if I,

97
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.350
if I died tomorrow, I would have had only one really,

98
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:18.570
really good thought in my life. And this was it.

99
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.970
I thought I'm going to ignore him.

100
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.660
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

101
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.640
<v 0>I taught an invisible student.</v>

102
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.760
I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact and I set up an empty

103
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:35.130
chair. And then she said she would hold up to this empty chair,

104
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.150
a picture of a cat.

105
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.830
And I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature,

106
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:43.380
a cat. So I'd be miming a cat and petting a cat,

107
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.740
and then I sign the sign for cat. Then she would hop to the other seat,

108
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:50.270
the invisible student's seat and pretend to get it. Oh, I know.

109
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.940
It's my facial expression. Oh, I get it. So you're playing all the parts.

110
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.970
You're both the teacher and the invisible student. That's right.

111
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.390
That's doing all these crazy things. And he just watched me.

112
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.000
He stopped copying her, which was good.

113
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.780
But I do this over and over and over for days and days and days.

114
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.580
And she says he just didn't get it. He was, he looked bored a lot of times.

115
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.070
But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises,

116
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:21.090
something happened. How did the corner of her eye,

117
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.780
she sees him, his body, and they looked.

118
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.910
It's interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about

119
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:30.744
to happen.

120
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.010
<v 3>He looked around the room,</v>

121
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.480
this is a 27 year old man and looks around the room as if he had just landed

122
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:42.370
from Mars. And it was the first time he ever saw anything. Something was about

123
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.990
his eyes grew wider and wider and then he slaps his hands on the table.

124
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.510
<v 0>Oh, everything has a name. [inaudible]</v>

125
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.293
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.910
<v 3>and then looks at me in this demanding way and I signed table and he points to</v>

127
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:13.600
the door and I signed door and he points to the clock and he points to me and I

128
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.434
find Susan

129
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.470
<v 4>and then he started crying.</v>

130
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.560
<v 0>He just collapsed and he started crying.</v>

131
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.500
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.510
<v 3>what is it that happens in human beings?</v>

133
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:37.490
When we get symbols and we start trading symbols, it changes our thinking.

134
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.810
It changes our ideas of Oh, is no longer the thing,

135
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.040
a table that we eat on,

136
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:45.920
but there's something about the symbol enable that makes the table look

137
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:46.754
different.

138
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.570
Ildefonso was in love. He was in love.

139
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:55.320
It's like everything has a name.

140
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.130
And for the first couple of weeks he had this,

141
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.700
this list of names that kept growing and growing paper,

142
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.790
Eagle clock, green eye.

143
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.750
[inaudible] kept copying words for him and

144
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.920
gave him the sign for door, door door, right? D O r

145
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.770
start praying to see that. Can each try berry bolted this paper?

146
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.080
Yeah. J was treasure. Treasure.

147
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.680
And you would pull it out every day and you would lie in carefully unfolded

148
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.500
tiger and you would add to it, to SAP up there, Jay thanking

149
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.020
me idea, add to it. Land, walk down,

150
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.680
add to it cows.

151
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.820
The Blue Wall. Sorry.

152
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.630
What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols, symbols. You know,

153
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.060
once you have begun to put words onto things,

154
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.490
you can look at a thing,

155
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.590
<v 5>say this symbolic sound table and the person opposite you knows that you're</v>

156
00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:16.264
talking about.

157
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.750
But she seems to be saying something deeper though that like when you get the

158
00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:22.150
word for table, uh, suddenly the table,

159
00:10:22.151 --> 00:10:24.910
like this table right here looks different. Like,

160
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.980
it's somehow the word changes the world in some fundamental way. Now,

161
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:32.200
I don't know if that's true about the table thing,

162
00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:36.160
but consider what happens when you put words together. Okay.

163
00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:36.994
When you link them up.

164
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.820
<v 6>Good. Okay.</v>

165
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.840
So I want to tell you about this experiment and fantastic that I learned about

166
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.970
from a, a fellow I talked to sometimes Charles and Charles Phony,

167
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.010
who I'm a psychologist at Durham University in the UK for any Ho and note,

168
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:51.930
when I first read about this experiment in Charles's book,

169
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.310
cooled a thousand days of wonder.

170
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.510
It blew my mind out of my nose and onto the book. It's a little messy.

171
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.100
I never wanting to be with you in the library.

172
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.020
Takes a little journey to get to the mind blowing part. But, um, luckily,

173
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.590
and I'll let Charles explain it. The whole thing happens in a room. Yeah.

174
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.200
You're put into this room which is colored completely white.

175
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.810
The walls are white, saving's white, the floors. So it's all way all wind,

176
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.980
everything's fine. And you can tell where you are at today's standards.

177
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:23.160
Some of the walls are longer than others. So when you're we in a rectangle,

178
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.140
that's what you were just going. Yeah. So rectangular room.

179
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.450
Are you with me so far? I'm with you so far. Okay.

180
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:29.370
Just to give you a sense of the baseline conditions here.

181
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.770
Imagine you were a rat in this room. Okay.

182
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.740
And somebody comes along and heights an object in one corner of the room. What?

183
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.440
It can be anything. I mean for rats we do use food like a biscuit or something.

184
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:44.190
Yeah, they hide a biscuit and one of the four corners in one corner you see it.

185
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.100
Okay. But before you can get to it, they pick you up by your tail,

186
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.920
spin you around a bunch of times. Let me, so you don't know where you are,

187
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.650
you don't know which direction you're facing it.

188
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.230
And then they say right now go find the biscuit. So if you do this with rat,

189
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.870
what will happen is it'll say, all right, let me go find the biscuit.

190
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.070
And it will go to one corner, which looks right,

191
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.193
<v 4>right?</v>

192
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.660
<v 6>But of course the room also looks like that.</v>

193
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.710
If you turn around through 190 degrees and face exactly the opposite direction

194
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.661
because it's a rectangle.

195
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:18.220
So they get it right about 50% of the time because corners or rectangles or two

196
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:19.240
of them are identical. Yeah.

197
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.270
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.290
<v 6>all right. So uh,</v>

199
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.180
[inaudible] should we get on with this because I'm well aware of rectangles.

200
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.160
I've just, I just needed to get that out of the way.

201
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.300
Cause the cool part is coming up.

202
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.460
So what the experimenters did next is they took one of the four white walls

203
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.453
and they turned it blue.

204
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.190
<v 8>So imagine this scenario, you're in this room.</v>

205
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.250
Let's get these four white walls or rather three white walls.

206
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:47.120
One of them is blue, right? Yeah. Well now you're not confused anymore. You can,

207
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.640
you can relate everything to the blue wall. You can be like, oh,

208
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:54.050
the corner with the biscuit was left of the blue wall or right of the Blue Wall.

209
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.460
I get to the left. You now have the blue wall as a navigational clue. Yes.

210
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.810
<v 6>That makes sense. You know, we would all be able to do that.</v>

211
00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:03.060
That's not going to be difficult for us. All right,

212
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.490
we got to the good fight yet that's it's coming. It's coming.

213
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:08.190
Turns out though the rats, he says, Nice.

214
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.500
They're still scoring 50 50 what?

215
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.030
It's as if they can't take any notice of the Blue Wall. Even with the Blue Wall,

216
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.140
they're only finding the biscuit 50% of the time. Wait a second. Can see color.

217
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.250
Yeah. Rats can do color. They do call it pretty well. Okay. They also do left,

218
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:24.090
right? Just fine,

219
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:27.810
but what they can't do is connect those two bits of information together.

220
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:32.190
In other words, they can only, well, they can do left that they can do.

221
00:13:32.191 --> 00:13:35.880
They can do blue get blue, but it's, they're both separate.

222
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:38.760
They can't do left of blue.

223
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.820
These different kinds of knowledge can't talk to each other. Oh,

224
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.560
does anyone know that? I mean who? Who would?

225
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:47.090
Rats have been interviewed for this survey. What? David?

226
00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:50.940
They infer this based on studying the rats so the rat doesn't have what doesn't

227
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:53.100
have the neurons, doesn't have the what doesn't?

228
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.650
He doesn't have the rat can't do it. That's just, that's all you need to know.

229
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.180
And I'm gonna make it weird and right now, neither can some humans.

230
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:05.210
I spent the first 10 or 15 years of my scientific life studying creatures who

231
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:07.310
don't, don't

232
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.143
<v 8>talk yet.</v>

233
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.520
That's Elizabeth spell cause she's a psychologist at Harvard.

234
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.560
Quite famous for her work with um, hi. You can hear babies.

235
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.540
And I was interested in uh,

236
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.750
their abilities in relation to billions of other animals get up.

237
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.320
We're going to go into the monkey room. So she began the baby development lab,

238
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.710
which is filled with toys and on any given day,

239
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:32.390
five or six really tiny kids,

240
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.210
six months I'm thinking. Yeah, toddlers too.

241
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.750
You three and a half big time.

242
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.080
So at a certain point, Elizabeth Spelke,

243
00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:49.310
he decided to build a version of the white room in this lab because she wondered

244
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.600
if rats have so trouble connecting the idea of left to blue.

245
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.720
What about surely maybe humans,

246
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.750
a self-respecting 18 month old human child will succeed in putting them

247
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:04.020
together. But no,

248
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.200
what we find is that children behave just like the rats, just like the rat,

249
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.610
just like the rat. Just like the retro almost. Yeah, just like the rats.

250
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.180
Well, we don't test them with food. We don't test them with digging.

251
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:20.630
So in superficial ways, superficial features of the studies are different,

252
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.160
but she says kids like the rats cannot connect to the idea of left to the idea

253
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:25.791
of blue.

254
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:29.340
They just can't do it and they can't do it at one they can't do it at to,

255
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.440
I can't do it three, four, five.

256
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.680
And we find that those children start performing like adults around six years of

257
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:39.530
age. Now I'm interested. Good.

258
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.300
Something happens at the ripe old age of six or it is shockingly late, right?

259
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:44.931
Yeah. Well,

260
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:48.080
something happened at the age of six that suddenly allows the kid to connect

261
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:51.380
concepts like left to concepts like blue. And the question is what?

262
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.670
What happens?

263
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:56.750
Several people have suggested that one candidate for his processors doing this

264
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.063
is language

265
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.180
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

266
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.250
<v 8>you mean? It's the language. Kids are talking certainly at three four,</v>

267
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:09.020
five and six they talk, I'm like, I'm like the too much, but they're not.

268
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:12.770
What they haven't yet started to use is spatial language and particularly the

269
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:16.370
kinds of spatial language that adults would use in this situation to describe

270
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:18.770
what they're doing. And somewhere around the age of six,

271
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:22.850
they start to use phrases like [inaudible] over the Blue Wall.

272
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.250
And those aren't just words that come out of the child's mouth.

273
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.830
Liz thinks that inside the child's brain,

274
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.010
what that phrase does is link these concepts together plink and at that moment,

275
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.480
<v 9>Whoa,</v>

276
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.850
<v 8>the child leaves the rats behind</v>

277
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.040
you show that is that she doesn't think that kids have that. What?

278
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.830
Let me put it to you a different way. Okay?

279
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.520
This is my best understanding of what she thinks.

280
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.200
Her basic idea is that a child's brain begins as a series of islands

281
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.990
and on one island way over here in the rain, you've got say color.

282
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.400
Can you call that the blue island blue. Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

283
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.510
That's the part of you that perceives the color blue way.

284
00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:04.530
On the other side of the brain.

285
00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:08.430
You've got the part of you that perceived spatial stuff like left, left,

286
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.800
[inaudible] third objects like wall. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

287
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.140
These things are there from the beginning. But they're separate.

288
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.060
Then you get to where it's left Blue Wall and then the child for the first time

289
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:22.950
comes upon the phrase

290
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.180
<v 3>left the blue.</v>

291
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.390
And in that moment all the islands

292
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.410
come together. It is literally the phrase itself,

293
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:37.930
she says that creates that internal connection.

294
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.010
Everybody's always talked about how language is this incredible tool for

295
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:42.844
communication,

296
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.630
delays us to exchange information with other people so much more richly and

297
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:50.220
effectively other animals can.

298
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.160
<v 10>But language also seems to me to serve as a mechanism of communication between</v>

299
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:59.910
different systems within a single mind. There you go.

300
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.540
<v 6>Wouldn't it be just as possible? Just listen to me here.</v>

301
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.710
[inaudible] that the kid's brain is developing some new connections and what

302
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:12.230
follows then follows from the changes in the brain.

303
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.940
So the words are like an after, after, after, after fact after effect. Yeah.

304
00:18:16.941 --> 00:18:19.220
Well that's a good, that's um, no, no,

305
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.270
and the experiment is actually accounted for that, like what the experiment is,

306
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.520
did next is that they saw, okay,

307
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.230
if language is adding this extra element, let's try and knock it out.

308
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.153
How would you do that?

309
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.490
Would you like shoot something into their brain that kills the language part or

310
00:18:34.491 --> 00:18:35.120
something?

311
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.810
It's a much simpler way of doing it in a much more humane thing that you can do.

312
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.890
What we did is put adults in the room and then she says she gave him an iPod,

313
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.980
they've got headphones on playing through those headphones and someone talking.

314
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.550
Yup.

315
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.610
And their job while they're in the room is to just repeat what the person is

316
00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:53.660
saying continuously listening to speech and repeating it the whole time they

317
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.580
were in this actually a really hard thing to do.

318
00:18:55.581 --> 00:18:58.860
If you've ever tried shadowing somebody speaking, I mean if you try it,

319
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.170
can we try it? You go and I'll, and I'll shadow you. Okay.

320
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.010
Gel Chart and start speaking and start speaking, right?

321
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.540
Just say exactly that exact clear. Say, Oh my God, my head.

322
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.000
That's really hard actually. Solid. Yeah.

323
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.860
And what that does is it knocks out your capacity to use language for yourself.

324
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.450
Basically battering the words out of the adult's head. Why are they doing this?

325
00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:26.900
Again, I only want to see like if you blast the words out of somebody's head,

326
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.180
what would happen? Can they find the biscuit?

327
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.530
Will they be able to form that simple thought left of the blue wall or will they

328
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.560
be like the rats who can't and and we actually got very dramatic results.

329
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.730
They went right back to be not the rats. Wow.

330
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.380
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

331
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:48.740
<v 8>Charles,</v>

332
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.670
what I'm wondering is if language allows you to construct a thought that is so

333
00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:56.840
basic as the biscuit is left of the blue wall,

334
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.340
what is thought without language? Well,

335
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:02.840
I didn't think it's very much at all.

336
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.380
<v 6>What do you mean? I'm going to put it in a different way.</v>

337
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.110
And this involves making quite a controversial statement.

338
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.690
I don't think very young children. Do you think

339
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.910
like think period? Was there a period at the end of that sentence?

340
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.820
I don't think they think in the way that I want to call thinking,

341
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.410
which is a bit of a cheat, but let me see what I mean by thinking. Okay.

342
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:26.570
If you reflect on your own experience,

343
00:20:26.571 --> 00:20:29.990
if you think about what's going on inside your head as you're just walking to

344
00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:32.600
work or sitting on a subway train,

345
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.460
much of what's going on in your head at that point is actually verbal.

346
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.840
I'm going to suggest that the central thread of all that is actually language.

347
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.300
It's a stream of inner speech.

348
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.150
That's what most of us think of as

349
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.040
<v 8>well. On the other hand,</v>

350
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.020
what I'm most aware of when I'm reflecting is this stuff that I can't put into

351
00:20:56.021 --> 00:21:00.400
words. I think that he's exaggerating the role of of language here.

352
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.810
Yes. This all really hinges on how you would define thinking.

353
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.980
Yes, and Liz would say, take a musician,

354
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.790
like I'll give you my example of Bill Evans. Here is a form of thought

355
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.130
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

356
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.540
<v 8>that carries you through</v>

357
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.480
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

358
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.050
<v 8>definite sequence of phrases, feelings,</v>

359
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.460
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

360
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.000
<v 2>emotions, changes,</v>

361
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.973
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

362
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.110
<v 8>and there are no words,</v>

363
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:38.350
but there's something that we get access to when we gain a full natural language

364
00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:42.290
that we can use, not only to communicate with other people, but with ourselves.

365
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.340
Here we go to Shapiro's test, testing, test, test, test.

366
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.730
This language is fundamentally a competent tutorial system.

367
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.870
As we hit up the steps here, what is this?

368
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:58.440
This is that we're going to Columbia Lumpia University. See,

369
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.450
we'd gotten interested in the last thing that Liz Belky said about language

370
00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:05.830
being a common rhetorical thing system, right? And that led us to Columbia.

371
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.963
Here's the deal.

372
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.380
Seven minutes is you have words now you have words in combination now.

373
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.870
Now you can play with the combination and that one more as here.

374
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.430
Just us three then. Right? It's just a straight good opens up, huh?

375
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.880
<v 11>A kind of an infinity head to foot. Now as he total gills,</v>

376
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.640
hardly tripped with better fathers, mothers, daughters,

377
00:22:26.641 --> 00:22:29.520
sons baked in and pasted with the parching streets,

378
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.460
the lended Tyrannus and damn the light to their viral murders.

379
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.300
This is Shakespeare.

380
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.920
When I sat in middle school and they gave a Shakespeare roasted and wrath and

381
00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:39.990
fire and this or size it with coagulate goals,

382
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.510
I was completely confused and I felt stupid. I said,

383
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:45.840
can you just introduce yourself? This is James Shapiro, m. A.

384
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.700
He is a Shakespeare scholar,

385
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.560
obviously at Columbia University where I've taught for 25 years and one reason

386
00:22:52.561 --> 00:22:57.180
he says that Shakespeare can be confusing is that often Shakespeare behave not

387
00:22:57.181 --> 00:22:58.410
so much like a writer,

388
00:22:58.411 --> 00:23:02.970
but more like a like a chemist combining elements.

389
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.490
He's taking words and he's shoving them together, smashing them together,

390
00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:14.850
if you will, and combining sometimes these word experiments.

391
00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:15.990
They didn't go so well. Yes,

392
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.220
the princes or Gellis oculus has no,

393
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.530
that goes to me. What does it mean you got me? I mean, I should know.

394
00:23:25.531 --> 00:23:28.770
I told him, but look what he did just by adding a little prefix on.

395
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.140
There's so many words that we're now familiar with, unnerved it, you know,

396
00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:38.430
we all know what that means, but nobody had heard, unnerved it, unaware,

397
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.100
uncomfortable. He made up uncomfortable.

398
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.760
He was the first to use that word on a stage, right?

399
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.100
An earthly unhand undress,

400
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.870
an educated ungoverned,

401
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.850
mid Galeana published something that's near and dear to me, public, unsolicited,

402
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.840
unswayed unclog on a piece of unchanging unreal.

403
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.950
He made up unreal. He's the first to use it in print or on stage.

404
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.640
What an audience that time ever understood what the unprefixed meant.

405
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.170
I think it takes you a split second, um,

406
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.890
to kind of put that on on the reel,

407
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.920
but then suddenly you got this new concept that there's something real but Nah,

408
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.840
he's taking words that ordinarily are not stuck together.

409
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:30.830
Things like mad cat, lady bird shoving them together,

410
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.310
eye drops to achieve a kind of atomic power.

411
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.170
I saw eyeball. He did eyeball. Yes.

412
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.380
It's hard to understand how someone could think of that,

413
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.510
but it seems like it's always been there.

414
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.180
If you asked me what his greatest gift is,

415
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.320
he's putting them together into phrases that have stuck in our heads,

416
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.420
so truth will out, truth will out. What's done is done.

417
00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.550
I could go on and on. [inaudible] crack of doom.

418
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.020
My favorite dead as a doornail, a dish fit for the gods.

419
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.910
Dog will have his day. Fainthearted fool's paradise forever and a day for gone.

420
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:14.440
Conclusion, the game is a full game is up Greek to me in a pickle,

421
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.400
in my heart of hearts, in my mind's eye, kill with kindness.

422
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.080
Believe it or not, knock, knock. Who's [inaudible] there?

423
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.400
[inaudible] stuff into stitches. Love is blind. What the Dickens falls. Well,

424
00:25:29.401 --> 00:25:32.630
that ends well. Sure.

425
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.550
Something wicked this way comes

426
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.900
and a sorry sight. Wow,

427
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.690
that's a chip. That's fantastic.

428
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.670
How did he create phrases that stick in the mind that make it seem as if they

429
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.960
always existed? Yeah. You're taking out a book.

430
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.410
Thinking of a passage here that is maybe the biggest book I've ever seen.

431
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.220
Nonsense. It was at least 3000 patients. Shakespeare,

432
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.920
those write a lot about process.

433
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.220
But there are one or two places where he does in a poem called Lucrece in which

434
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:18.731
a woman is a rate Lucrece is rape and she has to write a letter to her husband

435
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.410
explaining what happened to her and she's struggling to um,

436
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.840
to find the words in which to do this.

437
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:30.230
And finally she picks up the pen and it goes,

438
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.050
she prepares to write first hovering all the paper with a quill conceit and

439
00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:38.210
grief and eager combat fight. What,

440
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.750
which sets down his bladder straight with will this two curious good.

441
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:45.900
This plantain l much like oppressive people at Adore. It's wrong.

442
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:49.200
Her inventions, which shall go before, are we that couplet again,

443
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.450
much like the press of people at a door for wrong, her inventions,

444
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.890
which shall go before,

445
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.310
if you want to extrapolate from this something that Shakespeare might have

446
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:03.870
himself experienced, you have a situation with all these ideas oppressing.

447
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.870
It's like a throng of them. Who's getting through that

448
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.233
<v 8>doorway first?</v>

449
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.870
It's a little bit maybe like that experience you might have at a nightmare New

450
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.890
York club where you've got like thousands of people in us,

451
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.190
tiny space and everyone's trying to push their way out. And I'm like, Jack,

452
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.700
let me do the door. Get out on my way. And it's just like this

453
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.290
<v 11>of images of sound concedes thoughts, ideas,</v>

454
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.680
and they are providing the pressure that's needed to produce

455
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.543
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

456
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.000
<v 8>You know what, just makes sense to me, this interpretation now,</v>

457
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:52.980
not just for Shakespeare, maybe for anybody,

458
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.940
certainly the guy we met at the beginning. Ildefonso who,

459
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.280
who just learned where it's for the first time. Yeah. I mean,

460
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.850
as you move through the world, if you're sensitive at all and you're observant,

461
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.960
you're going to get filled up with all of these things which you have to express

462
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.500
but can't until you get those words. Then

463
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.083
<v 2>the door opens.</v>

464
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.943
[inaudible]

465
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.620
<v 8>and thanks to James Shapiro,</v>

466
00:28:20.621 --> 00:28:25.460
Professor at Columbia University whose newest book is contested, will,

467
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.660
