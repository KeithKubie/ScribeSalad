[Evans] Now the answer is the third one--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
that it makes it about 4000 times harder.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So to compute a dictionary that would be effective against all the different salts,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the attacker really needs to pre-compute that dictionary for all the different salt values

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to be able to look for passwords that match.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So salting adds a lot of value for very little cost.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We just need some extra bits that don't need to be kept secret

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that are stored in our password file.
