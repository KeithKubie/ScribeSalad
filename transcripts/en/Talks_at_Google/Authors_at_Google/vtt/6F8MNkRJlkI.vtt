HALIMAH DELAINE PRADO: So please
welcome Richard Rothstein.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.490
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Thank
you very much, Halimah.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.550
And thanks to all of
you for coming today

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.220
to engage in this
conversation with me.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.610
In the 20th century,
this country

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.180
made a commitment to
abolish racial segregation.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.680
We began-- Halimah mentioned I'm
affiliated with the NAACP Legal

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.310
Defense Fund.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.350
The Legal Defense Fund began by
challenging racial segregation

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.210
in law schools
because it figured

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.624
that if judges could
understand nothing else,

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:45.040
they could understand
you couldn't

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.610
get a good legal education
in a segregated law school.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.670
So they attacked
segregation in law schools,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.590
desegregated law
schools, then went on

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.290
to other institutions
of higher education.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.580
As you probably all
know, in 1954 then,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.670
they abolished segregation
in elementary and secondary

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.660
schools with the
Supreme Court decision

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.350
in "Brown versus
Board of Education."

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.760
And then in the 1960s, a
series of civil rights laws

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.550
abolished racial
segregation in everything

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
from water fountains, to buses,
to public accommodations,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.600
restaurants.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.180
We understood-- we came to an
understanding in this country

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.370
that racial segregation
was wrong, it was harmful,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.010
and it was unconstitutional.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.870
And yet, we have abolished
segregation in all these areas

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.820
and left untouched the
biggest segregation

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.670
of all, which is that
every metropolitan area

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.120
in this country is residentially
segregated by race.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.590
I've lived in many of them.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.950
Everyone I've lived in
was segregated by race.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.400
We all accept it as part
of the natural environment

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.590
despite the fact that we
came to the conclusion

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.650
that racial segregation
was wrong, harmful,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.806
and unconstitutional.

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:03.430
This is part of the
natural environment

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.410
that we all accept and
have done nothing about.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.789
We have no-- had no civil rights
movements engaged in trying

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.170
to desegregate neighborhoods.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.230
There's no activism.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.350
There's no legislation.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.280
It's not on our radar screen.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.010
And the reason
for that, I think,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.236
is not hard to understand.

00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:22.960
At least one is that
it's much harder

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.800
to abolish racial
segregation in neighborhoods

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.660
than it is any of these other
areas that I talked about.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.480
If we abolish segregation in
water fountains, the next day,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.490
people can drink from
any water fountain.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.140
We abolish segregation
in buses, you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.292
can sit anywhere
you want on a bus.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.250
But if we abolish
segregation in neighborhoods,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.540
the next day things wouldn't
look much different.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.630
It's much harder
to undo once we've

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.440
established racial segregation.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.140
So in order to rationalize,
justify to ourselves the fact

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.970
that despite the fact
that we understand

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.120
that racial segregation
is wrong, harmful,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.300
unconstitutional, and
inconsistent with a democratic

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.090
society, we've adopted
the rationalization

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.640
to justify the fact that we
haven't done anything about it.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.420
And we call that
rationalization.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.280
It's something, a term that I'm
sure you're all familiar with.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.150
We say we have de
facto segregation,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.020
that the segregation
of neighborhoods

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.020
unlike any of these other
segregations I talked about,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.670
was not created
by government, it

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.250
wasn't created by laws,
or by regulations,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.420
or by public policy.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.310
It's just sort of
something that happened.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.860
It happened because of
people's personal choices.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.410
They like to live with each
other of the same race.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.240
Or it happened because
private homeowners

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.230
refuse to sell to people of
an opposite race, particularly

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.570
whites refusing
to sell to blacks.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.570
Or it happened because
maybe real estate agents,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.800
rogue real estate agents,
steered opposite race families

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.300
to different neighborhoods.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.670
Or banks discriminated
in the way they lended.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.980
All of these
accidental decisions

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.080
that government had
nothing to do with

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.204
and that resulted in
segregation of every city

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:01.870
in this country, every
metropolitan area

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.920
in this country.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.420
And because it
happened by accident,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.836
the Supreme Court
has said there's

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:07.960
nothing we can do about it.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.030
As Halimah said, I was a
specialist in education policy,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.550
and I got started on
this investigation, which

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.279
led to the book
"The Color Of Law"

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.490
when I read the Supreme
Court decision in 2007 that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.880
prohibited the school districts
of Louisville and Seattle

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.460
from a very, very token
school desegregation plan.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.250
In both cities, the
school districts

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.750
had adopted a choice plan where
parents, particularly parents

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.700
of adolescents, could
choose which high school

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.770
their child would go to.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.750
But if the choice would
exacerbate racial segregation,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.490
that choice would not
be honored in favor

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.940
of the choice of
a child who would

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.148
help to integrate the school.

00:04:52.148 --> 00:04:56.090
So if you had a school that
was overwhelmingly white

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.060
and there was one place
left, and both a black

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.090
and a white child
applied for it,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.294
let the black child be
given some preference.

00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:05.210
And the Supreme Court
said you couldn't do it.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.640
It was a violation
of the Constitution

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.289
to implement this very,
very token integration plan.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.080
You couldn't imagine
the more trivial plan.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.497
Most adolescences,
as you probably know,

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.080
don't want to go to the school
outside their own neighborhoods

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.670
and away from their friends.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.140
And on top of that,
the cases where

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.460
you have one place left and two
children, one black, one white,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.200
applies for it is trivial.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.937
But the Supreme Court
said you couldn't do it.

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:32.270
And the reason the Supreme
Court said you couldn't do it

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.090
is that the schools in
Louisville and Seattle

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.760
are segregated because the
neighborhoods in which they're

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.100
located are segregated.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100
Well, I agree with that.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.710
That is the reason we have
racial segregation in schools

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.010
everywhere.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.890
In fact, racial
segregation in schools

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.160
is now more intense than it
ever has been in history, more

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.990
segregation than
we've ever had before,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.073
because the neighborhoods
in which they're located

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:53.960
are segregated.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.090
But the Supreme Court went on.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.670
The segregation of neighborhoods
in Louisville and Seattle

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.050
was not created by government.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.000
It's de facto segregation.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.010
It was created by
accident, by all

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.750
of these individual decisions
that I talked about.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.370
And that would be a violation
to recognize a child's race

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.290
to remedy something
that wasn't created

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.880
by a racial policy
of the government.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.060
It was de facto segregation.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.950
And I remembered
reading about it.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.880
I read this case in
Louisville and Seattle.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.940
And I remembered reading a case
that took place in Louisville

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.210
where a white homeowner
in a suburb of Louisville,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.410
called Shively, had a friend
who is an African-American Navy

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.620
veteran, a middle
class with income,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.440
who wanted to move to
a suburb to get better

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.820
housing for his family, and no
realtor would sell him a home.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.910
So this white homeowner
bought another home

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.050
in his own suburb, resold
it to the African-American.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.440
And when the African-American
and his family moved in,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.450
a mob surrounded
the home, protected

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.260
by the police, the
mob stoned the home,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.680
broke windows,
eventually dynamited

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.640
and firebombed the home.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.010
And when this riot was over,
the state of Kentucky arrested,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.690
tried, convicted, and jailed,
with a 15-year sentence,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.646
the white homeowner
for sedition.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.520
And I said to myself,
this doesn't sound much

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.620
like de facto segregation.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.660
I wonder how much
more the government

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.130
might have had to do with
segregating metropolitan areas.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.790
And so I began
this investigation.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.650
And I'm exaggerating
a little bit.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.480
Obviously, I had
a little bit more

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.600
of a sense of the flaws in
the Supreme Court argument

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.140
than just this one case.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.870
But I began this
investigation, and was

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.250
stunned myself to find that
de facto segregation is

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.630
an "other myth."

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.370
There is no basis
to it whatsoever.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.980
The racial segregation in
every metropolitan area

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.000
in this country was created
by explicit, racially explicit

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.310
government policy
designed to create

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.340
racial boundaries, designed to
ensure that African-Americans

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.730
and whites could not live near
one another with policies that

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.580
are so powerful that
they still determine

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.450
the racial landscape that we see
in cities all over the country.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.490
Racial segregation,
I concluded--

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.590
and that's the
conclusion of this book--

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.130
in neighborhoods is
as unconstitutional

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.830
as racial segregation
in water fountains,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.390
or in buses, or in public
accommodations, or in schools.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.280
And it's just as imperative
under our Constitution

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.330
to remedy it.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.680
But because we have this
false history that we've all

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.210
accepted, we are powerless,
according to the Supreme Court,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.260
to do anything about it.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.450
And none of us do much
to challenge that view.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.020
So let me spend a
few minutes this--

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.460
I guess it's afternoon--

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.610
this afternoon describing
some of the major policies

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.570
that the government followed
to enforce segregation.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.480
And then we can have a
discussion about some of them.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.410
I want to begin--

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.399
I'll begin by talking
about public housing.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.940
Public housing-- I
know you all think

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.130
of public housing as a place
where poor people live.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.980
That's how I thought about it
before I did this research.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.250
But in fact, civilian public
housing in this country

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.150
began in the New Deal,
during the Depression,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.770
during the Roosevelt
Administration

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.590
as a program for
working families,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.990
people with good incomes,
not great incomes,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.260
but good incomes--

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.320
good enough to rent housing.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.680
But there was no housing
available in the Depression.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.850
And so the government, the
Public Works Administration,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.410
one of the first
New Deal agencies,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.400
began to build housing
for working families.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.290
It was so explicitly
not for poor people

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.230
that public housing--

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.327
social workers went
to visit applicants

00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:42.660
in their homes to make sure
that their children are well

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.970
behaved, to make sure
they had good furniture,

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.610
not to reduce the standards--
the high standards

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.270
of public housing.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.330
They even investigated
to make sure

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.300
that there were marriage
licenses uniting

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.775
anybody who planned to
live in public housing.

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.580
This was middle class,
working class housing.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.950
And it was primarily for whites.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.360
And it was segregated
everywhere in the country--

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.480
not in the South, but
everywhere in the country,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.700
frequently, frequently
segregating communities

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.120
that had never known
segregation before,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.150
or in some cases
exacerbating segregation

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.820
where it might have just
been incipient, but not

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.650
well-established.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.540
Some of you-- I don't
know, any of you

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.360
familiar with the great
African-American poet,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.900
novelist, the playwright,
Langston Hughes?

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.370
The name sounds-- he wrote
an autobiography called

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.720
"The Big Sea."

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.460
He described how he grew up in
a Cleveland neighborhood that

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.640
was integrated in the
early twentieth century.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.480
In fact, his neighborhood was
about half black, half white.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.310
He talked about in
his autobiography

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.770
how his best friend was Polish.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.420
He dated a Jewish girl.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.020
This was not unusual in mid
and early twentieth century.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.840
Virtually every metropolitan
area in this country

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.060
had some integrated
neighborhoods

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.610
for the simple reason
that workers didn't have

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.480
automobiles to get to work.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.850
And so if you had a downtown
area with lots of employment,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.580
factories, and
African-American workers,

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.860
and Eastern European
immigrant workers,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.066
Jewish immigrant
workers, Irish workers,

00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:16.690
they all had to live in roughly
the same neighborhoods in order

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.580
to be able to walk to work.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.510
Another reason was that
the railroads would

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.100
hire only African-Americans
as baggage handlers

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.540
or as Pullman car porters.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.060
So in this area, for example,
in West Oakland, which

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.400
was a white neighborhood
had African-Americans

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.040
living in it because
the Pullman car

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.190
porters had to live close
enough to the Oakland railroad

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.700
terminal to be able to walk
there when the trains came in

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.749
and they change shifts.

00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:45.790
So there were many, many
integrated neighborhoods

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.415
in the country.

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:49.384
The Public Works Administration
demolished integrated housing

00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:51.550
in this Cleveland neighborhood
where Langston Hughes

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.420
grew up and built two separate
projects, one for whites,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.740
one for African-Americans,
creating segregated pattern

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.640
in Cleveland which
helped to determine

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.680
the growth of that
city and the patterns

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.570
that subsequently developed.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.630
It happened everywhere.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.040
I will talk a little bit
about this area some more,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.840
but I like to, in my book,
focus on places like this area

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.040
and Cambridge, Massachusetts
because people think

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.840
of these as liberal areas.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.210
And I thought that
if I could explain

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.857
that it happened in places
like this, it would happen--

00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:23.190
it probably happened everywhere.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.814
Well, Cambridge,
Massachusetts the area

00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:27.730
around MIT, the Central
Square neighborhood,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.650
was also a neighborhood
that was integrated.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.747
It was about 40/60 black/white.

00:12:33.747 --> 00:12:35.830
The Public Works Administration
demolished housing

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.830
in that neighborhood, creating
two separate projects, one

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.290
for blacks, one for
whites, creating

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.110
a pattern of segregation in
the Boston metropolitan area

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.390
that hadn't previously existed.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.524
It happened in
the South as well.

00:12:48.524 --> 00:12:50.440
We all know that we had
Jim Crow in the South.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.090
That's where the water
fountains, and the buses,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.410
and the restaurants
were segregated.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.080
But housing wasn't
segregated for the reason

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.040
that I just described.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.450
There were integrated
neighborhoods in the South.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.460
In Atlanta, the Public
Works Administration

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.350
demolished an integrated
neighborhood that

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.380
was about half black and
half white called The Flats,

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.990
and built a project
for whites only,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.250
segregating a community that
hadn't previously existed--

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.070
had segregation before, and
forcing the African-Americans

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.530
who were living there to
move in with relatives

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.100
and find other housing
elsewhere in the city.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.390
In my book, for those
of you have it--

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.377
or if you ever get it--

00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:26.710
take a look at the frontispiece.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.860
It's a picture of Franklin
Roosevelt handing the keys

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.300
to the 100,000th family to
receive public housing during

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.500
the New Deal.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.150
And you can see
from that picture

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.760
that these families are
all white, for one thing,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.316
no African-Americans
in this project,

00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:43.690
they're all clearly
well-dressed,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.650
middle class families.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.380
The picture was taken in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.500
where segregated housing was
built, creating and reinforcing

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.440
a pattern of segregation that
otherwise would not nearly

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.660
have been so strong.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.860
During World War II, the
actions of the government

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.720
intensified to
create segregation.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.380
They intensified because
throughout the country,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.040
hundreds of thousands of workers
flocked to centers of defense

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.200
production, of war
production, to take

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.910
jobs that hadn't existed
during the Depression.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.640
The centers of the
work production

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.470
where these factories
were located

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.170
grew so rapidly, that there
was no place for the workers

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.560
to live.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.920
A good example here
in this area is

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.990
Richmond, California,
just north of Berkeley,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.730
just across the Bay.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.760
Richmond was the site
of the Kaiser Shipyards,

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.320
which was the major shipbuilding
center here on the West Coast.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.400
There were no shipyards
there before the war.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.120
By the end of the war, there
were five Kaiser Shipyards

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.747
employing 100,000 workers.

00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:53.080
I don't know if you can imagine
what a community is like

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.460
if it grows from--

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.610
Richmond had 20,000
residents before the war.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.250
By the end of the war it
had over 100,000 residents.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.570
It's unbelievable.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.924
Richmond was a community
that was all white.

00:15:07.924 --> 00:15:09.340
There were a few
African-Americans

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.432
who were actually related to
Pullman car porter families who

00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:14.140
were living on the
outskirts of Richmond,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.020
mostly working as domestics
in white families' homes.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.970
But it was a white community.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.030
The federal government
had to build housing

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.780
for these workers.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.000
It built housing for
African-Americans,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.450
segregated housing, in
Richmond for African-Americans,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.060
temporary housing,
not well constructed

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.970
along the railroad tracks
and in the industrial area

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.140
of the shipyards.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.330
It was temporary because
the City of Richmond

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.010
announced that any
African-Americans who

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.560
came to Richmond during
the war would have to leave

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.240
after the war was over.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.270
And it built more sturdy
housing, permanent housing,

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.090
for white workers
in the shipyards

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.240
further inland where
the white families,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.600
the white residential
neighborhoods existed.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.800
This, again, happened all over
the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.460
Unlike the East, the great
migration of African-Americans

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.900
took place in San Francisco, in
this area, during World War II.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.400
It was the Second
Great Migration

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.620
that brought many
African-Americans here.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.360
And there were very
few before, so we

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.110
didn't have any segregated
patterns here in the Bay Area

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.360
before World War II and
before the government embarked

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.680
on these policies.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.140
It built five projects,
five public housing projects

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.900
here in San Francisco itself.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.230
Four of them were in white
areas for whites only.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.080
One was in the Western
addition in Fillmore

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.400
for African-Americans only.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.440
And the government picked
Fillmore as the place

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.360
to build a home--

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.270
a project for African-Americans
because Fillmore

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.790
was a place where
there were vacancies,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.890
and African-Americans
happened to start moving in.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.348
The reason there
were vacancies was

00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:49.360
because many Japanese-Americans
who lived there and had been

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.270
evicted in order to move
them to internment camps,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.002
so a few African-Americans
were already

00:16:54.002 --> 00:16:55.960
living in that neighborhood,
and the government

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.459
decided that this was going to
be an African-American ghetto

00:16:58.459 --> 00:16:59.800
in San Francisco.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.810
And that's where the
black project was built.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.460
I want to emphasize this is
not because African-Americans

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.030
happen to choose one
project and whites happened

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.740
to choose another project.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.030
These were explicitly
designated by race,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.599
by the federal
government, to creating

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.619
a pattern of segregation
that didn't need to exist.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.030
And the tragedy of
all this is that it

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.810
didn't need to happen because
we have an existence proof here

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.760
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.810
Across the Bay, in
Marin, Marin City,

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.120
there was another
shipyard, Marin Ship.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.800
And there, the shipyards
grew so rapidly

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.140
that workers came
without their families

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.400
to work in the shipyards.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.830
And the administrators
of the barracks

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.990
that they built to
house these workers

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.630
had to accommodate them
so quickly that they just

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.490
handed out pillows and
blankets as workers

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.640
came without trying to
segregate the buildings by race.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.190
And they were surprised
that there were no problems

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.720
with integrated housing.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.859
And so then when they
built family housing,

00:17:57.859 --> 00:17:59.650
when the families of
these workers arrived,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.440
they integrated that as well,
and there were no problems.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.260
So there was no
justification for this policy

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.180
everywhere else in the country.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.517
It was something-- and as I
said, many of these projects

00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:12.850
were built in neighborhoods
where people had been living

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.620
in an integrated fashion.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.610
After World War II, there
was still an enormous housing

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.130
shortage in this country.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.750
Not only had no housing been
built during the Depression,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.810
but during the War,
it was prohibited

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.810
to use construction materials
for civilian purposes

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.850
except for housing
for war workers.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.320
So there was a big
backlog in housing needs,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.040
especially as
returning war veterans,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.800
millions of returning
war veterans came home

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.950
forming families-- we call
it the Baby Boom generation--

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.630
needing a place to live.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.620
Many of them were doubled
up with relatives,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.540
and living in Quonset huts.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.420
We had a national mother-in-law
crisis with all these families

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.730
doubled up, and needing
a place to live,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.500
and demanding that
the government do

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.550
something about this.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:05.270
And so President Truman in
the years after World War II

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.630
proposed a vast expansion of
the National Public Housing

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.130
program.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.700
Now remember, we're still not
talking about poor people.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.820
These were returning
war veterans,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.210
people who had jobs in
the big postwar boom,

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.350
but for whom there
was no housing.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.710
And he proposed the
1949 Housing Act

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.060
to create housing for returning
war veterans, particularly

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.460
public housing.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.220
In Congress, the
1949 Housing Act

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.130
was opposed by
conservatives not because--

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.320
not for racial reasons,
because it was understood

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.640
that it would be segregated.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.582
That was the pattern everywhere.

00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:42.290
Not because they didn't
like poor people.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.130
This wasn't housing
for poor people.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.770
It was for working
class families.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.330
They opposed the
simply because they

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.765
thought that the public
housing was socialistic,

00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:53.390
and the government shouldn't be
involved in the housing market.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.350
It should be done by private
builders, even though private--

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.140
the private sector
wasn't doing anything

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.850
to house returning war veterans.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.010
And they opposed the bill.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.960
And they came up with a strategy
which you may be familiar

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.850
with, you may have
heard of it before, it's

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.330
used in other situations
as well, it's called--

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.920
we call it a "poison
pill strategy."

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.950
And a poison pill
strategy is where

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.160
opponents of a bill
in Congress propose

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.140
an amendment to a bill which
they think can get passed.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.600
But if the amendment
gets passed,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.642
it makes the entire
bill unpalatable.

00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:31.100
So what kind of an
amendment do you

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.780
think the conservatives proposed
to the National Housing Act?

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.090
They proposed an amendment
that saying that from now

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.940
on, all public housing
has to be integrated,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.230
no more discrimination in public
housing, a very clever devise--

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.770
strategy.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.228
They figured that
they would vote--

00:20:47.228 --> 00:20:49.586
all the conservatives would
vote for this amendment,

00:20:49.586 --> 00:20:50.960
Northern liberals
would join them

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.626
in voting for the
amendments, so there'd

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.970
be a majority to attach
the amendment to the bill.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.490
And then when the full
bill came up to the floor

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.070
with this integration
amendment attached,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.070
the conservatives would
flip and vote against it.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.077
Southern Democrats would
also vote against it

00:21:06.077 --> 00:21:07.910
because they were in
favor of public housing

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.790
on a segregated
basis, but weren't

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.500
about to agree to
have integrated

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.110
housing in their states.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.390
And so the entire bill
will go down to defeat.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.810
So Northern liberals campaigned
against the integration

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.490
amendment in order to preserve
the Public Housing Act.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.010
They were led-- the campaign
against the integration

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.230
amendment was led by
the leading civil rights

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.480
advocate in the United States
Senate, Hubert Humphrey.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.200
I don't know how much--

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.010
a lot of young people here.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.840
I don't know how much you
remember about Hubert Humphrey.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.231
But Hubert Humphrey became
famous by becoming a--

00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:44.605
by being a Civil Rights advocate
in the Democratic Party.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.690
Actually in 1948
Democratic Convention,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.870
Southerners walked out because
Hubert Humphrey led an effort

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.450
to get a civil rights plank
in the Democratic platform.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.700
So he was the leading Civil
Rights advocate the United

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.650
States Senate, and
he led a campaign

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.230
to defeat the
integration amendment.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.920
He was successful.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.580
He persuaded Northern liberals
to vote against the integration

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.080
amendment.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.190
Southern Democrats
joined them as well.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.290
When the full bill then
came up to the floor,

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.440
it was as a continuing
segregated project,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.710
and it passed with the votes
of both Southern Democrats

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.450
and Northern Democrats.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.080
And because the segregation
policy, the integration

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.420
amendment, had been defeated,
the federal government

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.460
used that vote as
its justification

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.770
for continuing to
segregate all housing

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.900
programs of the
federal government, not

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.960
just public housing,
for the next 15 years

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.320
into the mid 1960s.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.972
Well, under the
1949 Housing Act,

00:22:42.972 --> 00:22:44.680
projects were built
all over the country.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.450
And you're familiar
with many of them.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.210
I know you've probably heard
the Robert Taylor Homes,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.760
these giant high rises all
over the country, in Chicago.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.210
Or in St. Louis, the most
famous one nationally

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.790
it was called the
Pruitt-Igoe Projects.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.970
I see some people nodding.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.890
You've heard of that.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.600
Actually, it was two projects.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.480
The Pruitt project was
for African-Americans.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.760
The Igoe project was for whites.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.040
We only call it Pruitt-Igoe now.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.570
It was to Pruitt projects and
the Igoe projects back then.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.110
And very soon after
these projects

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.210
were built in the
early 1950s, something

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.480
happened that was duplicated
everywhere in the country.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.530
And that is there was suddenly
large numbers of vacancies

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.140
in the white projects,
and long waiting lists

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.240
in the black projects.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.370
After a while, it
became so conspicuous

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.460
that the government had to
open up all the projects

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.480
to African-Americans.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.454
You couldn't tolerate
the situation

00:23:36.454 --> 00:23:38.620
where there were long waiting
list for some projects

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.460
and large numbers of
vacancies in another.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.240
And so all the projects
were opened up,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.670
gradually more and more
vacancies occurred,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.475
the projects became
all African-American.

00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:51.310
At about the same time-- we're
now talking about the mid

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.990
1950s--

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.610
industry left the
cities and moved

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.400
to suburban and rural areas.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.760
Prior to that time, industry had
to be located in central cities

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.770
because it needs to
be close to railroad

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.390
terminals or deep water ports.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.630
But by the 1950s,
highways were being built,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.510
and you longer needed a deep
water port or a railroad

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.000
to have a factory.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.450
And so industry moved away.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.160
Fewer and fewer jobs were
available in the city.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.630
The people in public housing
then became poorer and poorer.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.550
Eventually for the first
time, the government

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.100
had to start subsidizing
the rents of families

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.480
in public housing.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.320
Once they started doing
that, maintenance,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.050
and preventive
maintenance in particular,

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.280
declined in the projects.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.110
They became more deteriorated.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.970
The people in them
became poorer and poorer.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.210
And we got to know to develop
the kind of public housing

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.910
that we know today,
for poor people.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.830
It's not how it began.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.230
Well, the question that occurred
to me when I read all this--

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.299
and I suspect that it
occurred to you as I tell you

00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:00.340
about this-- is why did
all these vacancies occur

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.490
in the white projects,
and none of them

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.720
in the African-American
projects,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.412
and long waiting lists in the
African-American projects?

00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:09.370
And that was because of
another federal program

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.160
that was even more powerful
in creating racial segregation

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.520
in this country.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.540
And that's a program run by the
Federal Housing Administration,

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.060
another New Deal
agency, designed

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.380
to suburbanized the entire white
population into single family

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.400
homes in the suburbs.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.770
It was explicitly racial.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.210
After I published
the book, I came

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.950
across some additional research.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.450
I wish I had seen it before,
because I put this in the book.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.650
But I found the poster that the
Federal Housing Administration

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.690
had produced.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.030
The poster showed
an African-American

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.450
being led away in handcuffs.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.390
And the headline
was "Escape Crime.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.090
Move to The Suburbs."

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.170
And this was a poster
that was put up

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.630
in white communities
in urban areas

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.306
to get them to move
to the suburbs.

00:25:51.306 --> 00:25:52.430
It was actually a program--

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.910
a little aside-- it was
a program that actually

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.950
began many years before.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.860
In World War I, The
Wilson Administration,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.660
some geniuses in
that administration,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.040
figured that if they could
get white families to move

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.790
to single family homes after
the Russian Revolution,

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.950
they wouldn't become Bolsheviks.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.200
And so the federal
government had a program

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.170
to propagandize
starting in 1920,

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.160
to propagandize white families
to move to single family

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.920
homes in the suburbs.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.540
They actually sent out
the community organizers.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.950
The Department of Commerce
sent out community organizers

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.530
around the country to hold
meetings telling people

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.690
that they could avoid
racial strife by moving

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.499
to the suburbs.

00:26:33.499 --> 00:26:36.040
But it didn't have much effect
because working class families

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.080
didn't have the money
to move to single family

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.010
homes in the suburbs.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.634
There was no money
behind this program.

00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:42.994
It was just a
propaganda campaign.

00:26:42.994 --> 00:26:45.160
But the Federal Housing
Administration, the New Deal

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.560
agency, began to
put money behind it.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.350
And beginning
slowly in the 1930s,

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.950
and then ramping up the
1940s and early 1950s,

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.540
the Federal Housing
Administration

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.090
began to subsidize
the developers

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.140
of giant subdivisions in
every city in the country

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.080
to create single family home
subdivisions for working

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.870
class families, white only.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.014
The most famous of
these was Levittown,

00:27:10.014 --> 00:27:10.930
east of New York City.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.206
I assume you've heard of that.

00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:13.330
But they were here as well.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.330
San Lorenzo was one of them.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.400
San Leandro was another.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.630
Some you may remember a song
that Pete Seeger used to sing

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.080
written by Malvina
Reynolds about houses made

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.880
of ticky-tacky,-- little boxes--

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.650
I'm sorry-- little
boxes on the hillside

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.360
made of ticky-tacky,
ticky-tacky.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.800
They all looked the same.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.750
That was a song about
Westlake in Daly City,

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.880
just south of the city here.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.540
That was another one of these
FHA-financed developments

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.580
for working class families.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.060
That development was built
by Henry Doelger, a developer

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.160
here in San Francisco, or
San Lorenzo across the Bay,

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.150
built by another developer,
David Bohannon, or Levittown.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.902
These developers could never
have assembled the capital

00:28:02.902 --> 00:28:04.860
to build these giant
subdivisions on their own.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.035
Levittown was 17,000 homes.

00:28:07.035 --> 00:28:10.950
Where do you get the capital
to build 17,000 homes for which

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.129
you don't have any buyers?

00:28:12.129 --> 00:28:13.170
You have to buy the land.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.640
You have to build homes.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.110
It was inconceivable.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.030
The only way you could
develop the capital

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.490
was by going to the federal
government, the Federal Housing

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.750
Administration,
proposing a development,

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.757
submitting your
plans, everything

00:28:27.757 --> 00:28:29.715
from the architectural
design, to the materials

00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:32.250
you were going to use, to
the layout of the streets,

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.090
and the commitment never to
sell a home to a non-white.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.270
And with that commitment, the
Federal Housing Administration

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:45.000
would guarantee a bank
loan or bank loans

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.290
to build the development.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.790
The Federal Housing
Administration

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.430
even required that
the developers

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.620
of these subdivisions,
like Levittown and those

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.960
here in the Bay Area,
include a clause

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.000
in the deed of every
home prohibiting resale

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.500
to African-Americans.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.212
And those clauses
still exist today.

00:29:00.212 --> 00:29:02.670
If you look at the deeds of
homes anywhere in the Bay Area,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.060
you'll see these federally
required clauses that prohibit

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.580
resale to African-Americans.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.250
So the white families were able
to move out of the suburbs--

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.340
out of the public
housing projects

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.620
and out of urban areas generally
into the single family home

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.480
suburbs.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.240
The subsidy for these was so
great-- these were, I say,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.090
very small homes.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.110
They were for working class
families, not wealthy people,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.530
750 square feet, small homes.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.420
They sold in that
period of time,

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.390
around 1950 in the
mid-twentieth century,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.630
initially for about
$8,000 or $9,000.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.910
In today's money,
that's about $100,000

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.120
adjusted for inflation,
inexpensive homes, $100,000.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.710
Those were for working
class families.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.840
My uncle moved to Levittown.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.270
He stocked vegetables
in the supermarket.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.400
These were not homes
for wealthy people.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.970
They were homes to get the white
population out of urban areas

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.800
into the suburbs.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.680
Those homes, like I
said, sold in those days

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.630
for about $100,000
in today's money.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:08.599
Today, those homes sell for
$300,000, $400,000, $500,000

00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:10.140
depending on the
area of the country.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.490
And they are in
every-- these suburbs

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.865
are in every area
of the country.

00:30:12.865 --> 00:30:16.020
This is how the country
came to be suburbanized.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.330
The white families who
moved into those homes

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:22.320
with this federal subsidy-- you
can move out of public housing

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.840
and move into one of these
homes in a place like Levittown

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.270
and pay less in
your monthly housing

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.990
costs than you were paying
for rent in public housing.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.330
That's how enormous the
subsidy was for white families

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:33.860
to do that.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.580
They gained over the next two
or three generations, $300,000,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.750
$400,000 in equity in wealth.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.640
Most middle class
families in this country--

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.260
not the very wealthy,
but most middle

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.850
class families in
this country, gained

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.600
what wealth they have
from the equity they

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.270
have in their homes.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.460
The white families who
were able to move--

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.730
and this is most of the suburban
population in this country--

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.210
use that wealth to send
their children to college.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.830
They used it to take
care of emergencies,

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.490
medical emergencies, or
even bouts of unemployment.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.560
If you have wealth, you
can weather unemployment.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.380
If you don't have wealth,
it's much more difficult.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.430
And they used it to bequeath
it to their children who

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.230
then had down payments
for their own homes.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.000
Today, African-American
incomes in this country

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.060
are 60%, 6-0% of white incomes.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.930
You would expect that if
there was a 60% income ratio,

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.780
there'd be a 60%
wealth ratio as well.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.320
But you can-- if you have
income of the same amount,

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.300
you can save the same amount.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.850
The reality is that
today, although the income

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.510
ratio between blacks
and whites is 60%,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.280
the wealth ratio is 10%.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.160
African-Americans have 10% of
the average wealth of whites,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.070
even though they have 60%
of the average income.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.610
And that enormous disparity
which affects so much

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.390
of the racial inequality
in this country,

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.570
so many of the problems
we face in this country,

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.570
is entirely attributable
to unconstitutional federal

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.910
housing policy that was
practiced in the mid-twentieth

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:03.960
century--

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.250
entirely attributable to
an unconstitutional housing

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:06.750
policy.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.560
The wealth gap, the fact that
we have segregated neighborhoods

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.990
still because homes
itself sold for $100,000--

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.830
in 1950, that was twice
the national median income.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.750
Any working class
family can afford that.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.140
Homes that sell for today
$500,000, six or eight times

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.810
national median income,
are unaffordable to working

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.480
class families of any race.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.830
So this-- we passed the
Fair Housing Act in 1968.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.250
We said in the Fair
Housing Act in effect,

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.710
OK, African-Americans you can
now move to Levittown or to any

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.060
of these other suburbs.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.460
But it was an empty
offer because the homes

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.860
are no longer
affordable to working

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.694
class families of any race.

00:32:49.694 --> 00:32:50.860
So we've never addressed it.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.859
We've never remedied it.

00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:54.370
The Fair Housing Act is
inadequate to address

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.570
these problems.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.740
There are many, many
other federal, state,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.000
and local policies that
I describe in the book.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.030
I only mentioned two of the most
important, the public housing

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.700
program, and the Federal
Housing Administration

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.544
subsidization of the suburbs.

00:33:09.544 --> 00:33:11.710
But it goes from the top
from the federal government

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.830
all the way down to
the very local level.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.390
I'll just give you a
couple of local examples.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.990
In the course of
doing this research,

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.850
I was looking through
in Southern California,

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:26.200
an African-American newspaper
called "The California Eagle,"

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.560
just rifling through it.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.530
And I came across an article
that described how the City

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.330
Attorney of Culver City--

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.034
Culver City is a suburb
just west of Los Angeles.

00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:40.450
You may be familiar with it
because they make movies there

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:40.949
now.

00:33:40.949 --> 00:33:46.330
But it was an all-white suburb
just west of Los Angeles.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.030
The City Attorney of Culver
City assembled a meeting,

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.470
called a meeting
of all of the air

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.440
raid wardens during World
War II in Culver City.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.230
During World War II, both
here on the West Coast

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.420
and on the East
Coast, every city

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.370
had air raid wardens
whose job was

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.180
to go door to door to make
sure that people turned off

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.610
their lights, and close their
blackout curtains if they

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:10.270
had them, and made sure
not to give guidance

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.790
to enemy bombers that might
have been coming this way.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.464
So the City Attorney
of Culver City

00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:17.380
called the meeting of
all the air raid wardens

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.889
and gave them a
contract to distribute

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.409
to every family in the community
while they were telling

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.110
to turn off the lights
committing them legally never

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.690
to sell a home to
an African-American.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.170
That was the lowest
level of this.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.429
And, of course, I described
the use of the police,

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:37.772
and the prosecutors in
Louisville at the beginning.

00:34:37.772 --> 00:34:40.179
Halimah was telling
me earlier-- or maybe

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.210
it was [INAUDIBLE],,
I forget that Google

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.460
started in Mountain View.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.560
In Mountain View-- well, here
in Richmond, one of the--

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.420
I write about this
a lot in the book--

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.260
in addition to the
shipyards, there

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.409
was a Ford Motor
plant in Richmond

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.920
that was making Jeeps and
tanks during World War II.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.680
And as industry left the
cities, as I described before

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.750
in the mid 1950s,
that Ford plant

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.790
moved to Milpitas,
which at the time

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.120
was a completely rural area.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.900
And developers started to
build these FHA developments

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.000
in the area around
Milpitas to house the war

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.400
workers for white workers only.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.080
The Ford plant was about
25% African-American.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.780
The UAW, the union,
representing the Ford workers,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.190
negotiated an agreement
with the company

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.060
that gave every
worker in the plant

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.900
the right to relocate
to the Milpitas plant

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.754
to keep their jobs.

00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:37.795
But, of course, the white
workers could relocate,

00:35:37.795 --> 00:35:40.000
and the black workers
had much more difficulty

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.670
because the white workers
could find housing,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.490
and the black workers couldn't
because of the FHA policy.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.310
So the UAW itself decided
it would build housing

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.870
for workers.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.070
And it went through a--

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.860
it recruited builders,
it bought land.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.770
And one of the places it
bought was in Mountain View.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.800
And when the Mountain View found
out, the City of Mountain View

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.760
found out that the
UAW was planning

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.980
to build integrated
housing in its community,

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.770
it rezoned the
property for industry

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.020
and prevented the
development of housing

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.280
that the workers in Milpitas
could have access to.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.730
And this one, of course,
the zoning requirements,

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.100
changes in zoning
requirements to prevent

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.495
integrated housing also
existed throughout the country.

00:36:25.495 --> 00:36:27.370
Let me just conclude
with a couple of things,

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:31.330
then we can have a discussion.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.170
In the course of--

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.840
as I said before, I used to
spend a lot of time thinking

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.559
about education policy, so
it was sort of natural for me

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:39.850
when I was writing this book
to look at how all of this

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.540
is addressed in textbooks that
high school and middle school

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.420
students use today to
learn American history.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.840
And what I found was that
every textbook in this country

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.100
lies about this history.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.950
Not one of them tells
the truth about it.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:58.150
They either-- well, some of them
brag about the wonderful job

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.660
that the FHA did in creating
suburban homes for the working

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.230
class, never mentioning that it
wasn't the entire working class

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.360
it was creating homes for.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.640
The most popularly use
American history textbook

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.710
is something called
"The Americans,"

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.760
has one paragraph
that's subheaded

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.620
"Discrimination in the North."

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.520
It has one sentence in that
paragraph about housing.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.280
And the sentence
reads as follows.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.320
"In the North,
African-Americans found

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.870
themselves forced into
segregated neighborhoods."

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.590
That's it.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.760
That's the entire explanation.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.760
As you know-- well, you
know because you're here

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.590
that I write books.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.000
I know how publishing works.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.560
I know that
publishers spent a lot

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.380
of money hiring copy
editors to look out

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.222
for passive voice sentences.

00:37:42.222 --> 00:37:44.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.340
This is one that they missed.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.880
No explanation of who did the
forcing, why they were there.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.660
It's like, African-Americans
woke up one day,

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.701
they looked out their
window, and they said, hey,

00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.680
we're in a segregated
neighborhood.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.854
This is a crime because if young
people don't learn this history

00:38:00.854 --> 00:38:02.270
any better than
we've learned it--

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.020
and I include myself in this--

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.270
if they don't learn this
history any better than we've

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.103
learned it, they'll be
in as poor a position

00:38:08.103 --> 00:38:10.540
to remedy it as we've been.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.825
So when I say everywhere
I talk-- and I've

00:38:12.825 --> 00:38:14.575
been invited to speak
at a lot of places--

00:38:14.575 --> 00:38:18.820
is every one of you lives
in a school district.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.760
You have children, or
nieces, or nephews,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:27.060
or I see even some who
aren't yet in school.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.910
And you can make
an issue of this.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.070
You can insist that
we start teaching

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.290
this history accurately.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.900
And I guarantee you if you start
a conversation about what's

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.316
being taught in
the schools, it'll

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.980
generate a conversation in
the adult community as well.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.349
So I do have a small chapter
in the book about remedies.

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:48.390
I can certainly answer
some of that in questions.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.860
But this is not a
book about remedies.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.580
It's a book about the history
because a precondition

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.880
of the remedies is developing
political support for them,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.640
for which there is none now.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.390
And unless people
learn this history,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.240
we'll never be able to build
the political support that's

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.340
necessary to integrate
this country.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.800
So long as we think it
happened by accident,

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.330
we'll believe it has to
unhappen by accident.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.880
But if we understand
that was created

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.310
by a very powerful
government policy,

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.740
we can understand that
government policy is

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.030
equally capable of undoing it.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.715
So thank you for your
attention, and Halimah,

00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:23.330
we have to take questions and--

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:27.803
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:29.392 --> 00:39:30.850
HALIMAH DELAINE
PRADO: I will say--

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.980
I'll reiterate a point that
you had mentioned in the talk

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.396
but had a lot of
resonance with me

00:39:34.396 --> 00:39:37.020
was, for me, the most
surprising thing was learning

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.110
about the rampant history
in a historically sort

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:44.340
of open-minded
liberal [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.310
and community like the Bay Area.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.205
I will add a personal
anecdote just

00:39:49.205 --> 00:39:50.580
because it would
explain why this

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.630
had so much resonance with me.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.630
I'm from the East Coast.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.670
I purchased a home a little
bit south of Santa Cruz.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.260
And as a lawyer
doing the diligence,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.730
went through all
of the paperwork

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.800
and laughed out
loud when I actually

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.980
found the racially
restrictive covenant

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.140
in the actual document.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.379
The realtor-- because I guess
didn't share my lawyer cynical

00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:11.670
humor, I was like, oh,
someone's rolling in there grave

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.400
because I've just
bought their house--

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.650
was horrified and apologized
profusely, and said,

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.960
oh, we can cover it up.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.691
We can-- we'll take
it out of the file

00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:23.190
to make sure no one
sees this again.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:27.870
And I was like, no,
keep it in, actually.

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.350
This is history,
it's important, and I

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.720
get a dizzying
self-satisfaction about being

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.757
a black woman buying a house
that previously 40 years ago I

00:40:36.757 --> 00:40:38.340
would have been
prevented from buying.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.440
And so it has been
super fascinating

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.000
that throughout
the book you have

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.650
this revolutive truth about
what happened in the Bay Area.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:52.710
How has the Bay Area
received your book

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.000
and that truth telling?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.280
Have you had negative
reactions to that?

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.449
Have folks sort of become
a bit defensive in that?

00:40:58.449 --> 00:41:00.240
Or is it just sort of
well, that's history,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.314
and we should move on?

00:41:01.314 --> 00:41:03.480
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: I haven't
had negative reactions.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.610
But as I concluded by saying
is the negative reactions

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.040
will come when we actually
start enacting policies

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.720
to reverse it.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.760
This is now, it's
interesting history,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.240
it's horrifying history, but it
doesn't really require anybody

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.410
to make any changes in the way
they live because we're not yet

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.936
reversing it.

00:41:23.936 --> 00:41:25.310
Many things will
have to be done.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.226
People will have to make
some changes in order

00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:29.790
to create the
integrated society which

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.810
we say we're committed to.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.410
So no, I have not had
any negative reactions.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.420
The only negative
reaction I've had--

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.780
the book has been received
with a lot of enthusiasm

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.810
by conservatives, by some
of the conservative think

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:45.630
tanks of Washington because
they say this proves

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.964
that government can do no good.

00:41:46.964 --> 00:41:48.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.732 --> 00:41:53.310
And their response is well,
two wrongs don't make a right.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.786
Just because the
government did this,

00:41:55.786 --> 00:41:57.660
it doesn't mean the
government should fix it.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.690
The market should fix it.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.481
And, of course, there's
no way the market--

00:42:00.481 --> 00:42:02.850
this is so powerfully
embedded in our institutions,

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.850
that the market can't fix it.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.790
So I haven't had
negative reactions to it.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.130
No fact in the book
that I've described

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:16.890
has been challenged by
any historian or lawyer.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.284
But the truth will--

00:42:21.284 --> 00:42:23.200
we'll come to grips with
this when we actually

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.550
start implementing policies.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.120
And as you all know--

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.420
or maybe you know--
there's a big controversy

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.600
right now here in
California in the Bay Area

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.625
about there's a bill
before the SB-827.

00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:36.850
Are you all familiar with that?

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:42.880
That would prohibit
single family home zoning

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.640
in areas near
transit stops, that

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.460
would permit the
construction of townhouses,

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.910
and apartments, and single
family homes on small lot sizes

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:56.560
that moderate income
families could access.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.710
And there's no doubt that
that will go down to defeat.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.150
And it's a very,
very modest program.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.680
And it will go down
to defeat by being--

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.336
and it'll be opposed
by many people who

00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:11.710
are enthusiastic about hearing
this history I talk about.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:16.046
So it needs to be
translated into action.

00:43:16.046 --> 00:43:21.220
AUDIENCE: We talked about how
the government incentivized

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.720
people to move out into
these subdivisions,

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.710
and then that was, of course,
I guess, as an addition,

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.030
racially segregated in a
sense that only whites were

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.340
able to do it.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.423
But I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

00:43:33.423 --> 00:43:35.620
about the history of why--

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.680
why there was a motivation to
move out of this city at all.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.200
What is the catalyst
of moving people out

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.930
regardless of whether
it was racially or not

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.289
racially motivated?

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:47.830
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Clearly, it
was propaganda in favor of it.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:51.640
Other industrial countries
haven't developed in this way.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.010
Other industrial countries,
middle class families

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.280
have continued to
live in the cities.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.620
We developed in this
country a culture

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.420
of frontier independence.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.110
And single family homes
looked a lot like that,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.490
not living crowded
in apartments.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:14.350
Clearly, the homes were
better quality homes

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.260
that people were moving into
than the frequently slum

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.840
dwellings that they were moving
out of, overcrowded homes

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.686
and they were moving out of.

00:44:21.686 --> 00:44:24.100
But it wasn't a
necessary ideology,

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.480
so I really don't know.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.980
What do you think?

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.420
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.860
I'm so young.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.960
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Well,
the culture is now changing.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.890
And the white middle
class families

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.180
are moving back into cities.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.660
Not-- its impact is
exaggerated, not many of them

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.120
relative to the number
who remain in the suburbs,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.210
but there is a movement to
move back into urban areas

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.160
even after people have children.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.730
So the culture is changing.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.280
AUDIENCE: Could you talk
a little bit about it

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.250
in your research you came across
the effects of these policies

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.390
on the Great Migration?

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.480
You talked a lot about how there
was these long waiting lists.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.870
Did you see that playing out
in the sense that a lot--

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.440
it extended the Great
Migration in the sense

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.920
that people went
further than they

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.664
were planning on
going because they

00:45:13.664 --> 00:45:14.830
were unable to find housing?

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.110
Or did you find that maybe
they stayed and stayed

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.634
on these lists?

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:20.050
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN:
Most people who

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:25.310
needed housing couldn't find
it, even with public housing.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.300
They wound up being overcrowded.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.180
I'm sure you've heard
the term "redlining."

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.990
In fact, the cover of my
book has a redlining map.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.450
We think of redlining as
something that banks did.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.330
But in fact, the map,
the redlining maps,

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.879
were maps that were built--

00:45:41.879 --> 00:45:44.170
drawn by the federal government,
by the Homeowners Loan

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:48.490
Corporation, and then used
by the Federal Housing

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.890
Administration, the
Veteran's Administration,

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:54.760
to indicate areas
that were colored red

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.600
where African-Americans
lived and no mortgages could

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.770
be granted.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.170
Well, the result of that
was that African-Americans

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.770
had to pay.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.140
Even if they didn't
have public housing,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.950
if they were living in private
housing in these same areas--

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:12.910
which, urban areas-- they had
to pay much more for housing

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.980
than whites had to pay
for similar housing

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.070
because they couldn't
get FHA or VA mortgages.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:20.650
There was in many cities
a contract buying system

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:23.620
which was, in effect, buying
a home on the installment plan

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.370
where you gain no equity until
the house is completely paid

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:28.060
off.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.630
And of course, it
was more expensive.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.260
So what happened is
African-Americans

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:37.300
in these neighborhoods, even if
they weren't in public housing,

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.580
had to pay more for housing.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.400
They had to subdivide
their homes.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:48.370
They frequently doubled
and tripled up in families.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:51.681
At the same time, cities didn't
maintain these neighborhoods

00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:52.180
as well.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.930
Garbage was collected less
frequently, for example,

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.970
and so they became slums.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:03.820
And that created a
stereotype in the minds

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.150
of the white population of what
African-Americans were like.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.100
And they-- and so
"white flight" resulted

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.902
when African-Americans began to
move into their neighborhoods

00:47:11.902 --> 00:47:13.985
because they looked to
African-Americans and said,

00:47:13.985 --> 00:47:15.820
oh, their slum dwellers.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.660
We don't want slums
in our neighborhoods,

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.525
not realizing that
the slums were not

00:47:19.525 --> 00:47:22.540
a characteristic of the people,
but a characteristic result

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.150
of government policy.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.450
So even those who couldn't
find public housing,

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.770
homes in public housing,
were doubled and tripled up

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.280
in the same neighborhoods.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.871
And these became
low-income neighborhoods.

00:47:35.871 --> 00:47:37.120
And I can add one other thing.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.010
It's not just the stereotype
that whites developed

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.870
of African-Americans,
it's the stereotype

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.790
that African-Americans
developed of themselves.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.850
And one of the most
moving experiences

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.300
I had from this book
is that I got a letter

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.880
from a young man, an
African-American young man,

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.050
18 years old in New
Orleans, who wrote to me.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.640
He said that he grew up in
the black neighborhood of New

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.140
Orleans.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.200
He looked around him, he saw
that black people were poor,

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.460
that white people were rich.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.340
He thought that's the way
things were naturally.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.990
And then he read my book.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.810
And he said, when I realized
that government actually

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.560
created this, I felt that
I would have tried harder

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.460
in school if I had known this.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.050
And social psychologists
have a name for this.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.180
They call the
"stereotype threat."

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.660
But it's an indication
of how our whole--

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.350
the culture of our caste
system was created.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.950
It wasn't just a
housing policy, it

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:38.090
was a social psychology policy.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.840
AUDIENCE: So towards
the end of your book,

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.860
you cover briefly a few
interesting possible solutions

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.600
involving government.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.770
Google's a company that
earns $100 billion a year.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.530
We've got over $60
billion in the bank.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:57.210
We build a lot of
corporate buildings.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.710
We are directly involved in
decisions related to housing.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.630
We have transportation
networks that influence

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.530
how patterns of residency.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.330
Is there-- do you
envision a role

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:13.860
that corporations like
Google can play to correct

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.450
for some of this history?

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.600
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN:
Well, certainly.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.880
I assume you're not
talking about Google going

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.570
into the housing business.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.720
But there are public
policies that--

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.880
Google is an
influential corporation.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.680
And there are public
policies that Google

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.662
could advocate that would
help address this problem.

00:49:32.662 --> 00:49:34.620
One of the things that's
happening in this area

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:40.470
is that lower income workers,
particularly minority workers,

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:45.420
are having to travel
enormous distances in order

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.860
to get to work because we are
not providing mixed income

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.460
housing in any of
our communities.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.250
So this SB-827, the
bill I saw before,

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:57.450
is just a tiny, tiny step.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.190
Google could support that.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.380
It could become vocal in it.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.942
We have other policies.

00:50:03.942 --> 00:50:06.150
Many, many-- I talked about
some of them in the book.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.140
We have many policies today that
reinforce racial segregation

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.760
without actually being explicit.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.260
We don't have to
be explicit anymore

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.200
because the boundaries were set
by the policies I talked about.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.490
But the federal government runs
a program called the Low Income

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:24.510
Housing Tax Credit, which
gives a subsidy to builders

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.310
of low-income housing.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.020
All those projects
are built-- and it's

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.870
administered by the
states, and by the cities,

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:33.400
and by the counties--
and all that housing--

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.184
well, it's exaggeration--
almost all of that housing

00:50:36.184 --> 00:50:38.100
is placed in already
segregated neighborhoods,

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.540
low-income neighborhoods.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.092
Developers would rather build
low-income housing projects

00:50:43.092 --> 00:50:44.550
in already low-income
neighborhoods

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.710
because the land is
cheaper, and they

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.200
don't have to have 25
community meetings to explain

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.600
why they're doing it.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.220
And they can put the
sign up in the window,

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.050
and people who want
the housing can walk by

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.730
and see an apartment for rent.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.990
Well, the State of California,
Alameda County, San Francisco

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.970
County, could easily
administer that program

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.480
so they place the priority
on giving the tax credits

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.680
to developers who would build
in middle class communities

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.960
to help to integrate
those communities.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.660
The same thing is true of the--

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.000
I'm sure you're familiar with
it-- the Section 8 voucher

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.510
program.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:19.301
You've heard of it.

00:51:19.301 --> 00:51:22.380
It's a program that
the HUD administers

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.870
to subsidize the rents
of low-income families.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.910
It reinforces segregation today.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.930
A Section 8 housing
voucher family

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.620
is more likely to live in
a segregated neighborhood

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.710
than a family who is just as
poor who doesn't have a Section

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:41.624
8 voucher.

00:51:41.624 --> 00:51:43.290
And that's because
the Section 8 voucher

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:45.360
is structured in the way
that it can only be used

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.150
in segregated neighborhoods.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.820
It's based on the average
rent in a metropolitan area.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.417
But, of course, you
know enough arithmetic

00:51:55.417 --> 00:51:57.000
to know that the
average rent is going

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.250
to be too low to rent in
a middle class community.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.870
And so it's-- and landlords,
although they're not permitted

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.600
in California to discriminate
against Section 8 voucher

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.430
holders, it's not enforced.

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.950
That discriminatory-- that
anti-discrimination provision

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:11.970
isn't enforced.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.520
So that's another
area of public policy

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:20.130
that you could be
influential in influencing.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.110
The whole zoning
system in this country

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.080
preserves the segregation
that I was talking about.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.320
And that needs to be attacked
if we're going to address this.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.510
Suburbs have zoning
ordinances that

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:37.500
prevent anything but homes on
large lots sizes, single family

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.090
homes on large lot sizes.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.220
Many of those ordinances
were originally

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.710
developed for a
discriminatory purpose,

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.290
but they're not written with
racial language in it the way

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.400
the policy I described
earlier were,

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.962
but they need to be changed.

00:52:51.962 --> 00:52:53.670
And there have been
places in the country

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.600
where it's being done.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.880
Montgomery County,
Maryland, which

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.960
is an affluent suburb
of Washington DC,

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.720
but still with lots
of vacant land,

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.120
has a policy where any
developer in Montgomery County

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.540
has to set aside
15% of its units

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.389
for moderate income families.

00:53:14.389 --> 00:53:15.930
And then the Public
Housing Authority

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:19.540
of Montgomery County purchases
one-third of those units,

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.860
those set aside units, so 5%
for the total development,

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.320
for public housing
eligible families.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.870
And it's produced
some integration

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.111
in Montgomery County.

00:53:30.111 --> 00:53:32.940
AUDIENCE: So one of the
questions from the Dory.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.472
Labor unions are mentioned
at a few points in your book.

00:53:35.472 --> 00:53:37.680
It appears that there was
a pattern of unions tending

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.920
toward supporting integrated
housing in contrast

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.480
to the harmful effects of
government institutions.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.470
Was this pattern real?

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.210
What led unions to
be more supportive

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.755
than other institutions?

00:53:46.755 --> 00:53:49.170
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Well,
it wasn't all unions.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:51.420
For those of you who know
your American history,

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.680
you know that they were--

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.019
in the mid 20th century,
there were two branches

00:53:55.019 --> 00:53:56.310
of the American Labor Movement.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:57.960
There was the
American Federation

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.760
of Labor, which was predominant
in the construction trades.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.310
And there was the CIO--

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.960
it's now merged
in one federation,

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.060
but these were two
separate federations--

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.860
that were industrial
unions, and they

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.480
were much more progressive.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.830
So the example I gave
before of the Ford plant

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.980
that moved to Milpitas,
that was a Ford plant where

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:26.310
the union protected the rights
of African-American workers.

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:28.890
And as I say, it tried to
build integrated housing

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.280
for its members.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.660
But just to give you another
example of how pervasive

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.540
federal policy was-- and this is
not a housing policy directly,

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.460
but it affects housing.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:43.920
Another New Deal agency was the
National Labor Relations Board,

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.890
which was adopted
in 1935, I think,

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:51.000
in the National Labor Relations
Act called the Wagner Act.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.610
When Senator Robert Wagner, who
was a senator from New York,

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.040
and who sponsored
this law, the law

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.900
provides for federal government
certification of unions

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.920
so that once the federal
government certifies a union,

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.300
an employer has to
bargain with it.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.520
And the law-- when
Wagner proposed the law,

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.020
it had a provision in it that
said that the government could

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.230
not certify unions that were
racially discriminatory.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.540
That provision was removed
for the bill-- from the bill

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.010
before the bill was passed.

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:24.690
And so for 30 years after
that bill was passed,

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.290
the federal government
certified unions that excluded

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.730
African-Americans
from membership.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:32.370
The result-- and the unions
that exclude African-Americans

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:35.020
from membership were the
construction trades, primarily,

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.020
the very trades
that were building

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.472
the suburbs that
African-Americans

00:55:38.472 --> 00:55:39.180
couldn't live in.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.980
So both the African-Americans
couldn't live in the suburbs,

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.450
and they couldn't
participate in the jobs

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.250
boom that created them.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.460
So there were two kinds of
unions when it comes to race.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.400
The CIO unions were much more
integrating and progressive.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.829
And the AFL unions
were discriminatory.

00:55:58.829 --> 00:56:01.120
AUDIENCE: So I'm trying to
imagine the human experience

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.242
of these policies.

00:56:02.242 --> 00:56:03.700
And I think you
spoke, for example,

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.510
of a neighborhood called
The Flats in Atlanta,

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.746
and that there were black
and white folks that

00:56:08.746 --> 00:56:10.120
were living there,
and then there

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.400
was government housing that
was built for whites only.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.950
And so what was the experience
of a typical black person

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.120
in The Flats?

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.060
Were government agents evicting
them from their houses?

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.980
Was there-- were they
renters that were just

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:23.590
told to leave and not given
any subsidy or relocation?

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.215
What was the experience
for this folks?

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.200
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Yes.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.350
We talk a lot about
gentrification these days,

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.689
but it's a very old policy.

00:56:30.689 --> 00:56:32.980
We just had a different name
for it 20 or 30 years ago.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.810
We called it urban renewal.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.170
And it was exactly
the same policy.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.600
And no, there were no subsidies
for these families who

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.990
were evicted from their homes.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:45.460
The government, eminent
domain, demolished the homes

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.880
in order to build the
public housing project.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.980
And they were forced to
double up with relatives.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.900
And this has caused
the overcrowding

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:58.180
in African-American communities,
or find a lower-quality housing

00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.890
where they could.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:03.130
So the effect of these
policies, urban renewal--

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:10.010
people when-- after the
riots in Ferguson in 2014,

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:14.060
lots of people ask, you know,
how did Ferguson, a suburb

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.200
become majority black?

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.244
We thought suburb--

00:57:16.244 --> 00:57:17.660
African-Americans
lived in cities?

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.060
What are they doing in
a suburb like Ferguson?

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.830
Well, Ferguson
became majority black

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:28.730
because during the mid-twentieth
century into really 1980

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.310
or so, the City of
St. Louis demolished

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:34.730
African-American neighborhoods
in the central city.

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:37.082
It wasn't because whites
were buying up the homes

00:57:37.082 --> 00:57:38.540
and raising the
prices, they simply

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.430
demolished them
in order to build

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:43.070
that half of the McDonald's
sign that's, you know,

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:46.430
the Mississippi River,
the "Gateway to the West."

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:48.350
That was a large
African-American neighborhood

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:49.190
that was demolished.

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:50.900
They built hospitals there.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.060
Well, where were the
people going to go?

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.360
Well, the federal
government gave some of them

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.080
Section 8 vouchers, but
the State of Missouri

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.090
doesn't have a law that
prohibits discrimination

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.080
against Section 8
voucher holders.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.620
So there were only one or two
communities they could go to.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.790
Ferguson was one of them.

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:09.830
There was another right
near it called Jennings,

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.434
and another right near it
called Berkeley, it happens.

00:58:12.434 --> 00:58:14.600
And those are the only
places that African-Americans

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.764
could go to.

00:58:15.764 --> 00:58:17.180
And the same thing's
happening now

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.912
as a result of
gentrification in Oakland.

00:58:19.912 --> 00:58:22.370
African-Americans aren't able--
because we're not providing

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:26.495
housing for moderate income
families in most suburbs,

00:58:26.495 --> 00:58:27.710
so they're--

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.470
Antioch is becoming a new
African-American community.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:33.140
We're just shifting the black
community from one place

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.780
to another as a result
of these policies.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:41.820
So unless we do something
to desegregate the suburbs--

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.850
I'm talking about the
middle class suburbs--

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:47.270
we're going to just shift the
African-American population

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.890
around from one
place to another just

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.994
as we did in Atlanta and in
many other places at the time.

00:58:51.994 --> 00:58:53.410
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned in the FAQ

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:54.890
that Asians and
Hispanics did not

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:57.740
experience the same
targeted and persistent

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.971
residential segregation
as African-Americans.

00:58:59.971 --> 00:59:01.470
Did they still get
caught in the net

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:03.470
of the same
discriminatory policies

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.930
like restrictive covenants,
and the inability

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.780
to get federally-backed
mortgages?

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.430
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Yeah, I
would certainly not deny--

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:13.850
and I-- that's a mild way
of saying that certainly

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.510
the case that African-Americans
and Asian-Americans have

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.780
discriminate-- have experienced
discrimination in housing,

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.390
and some of it
government sponsored.

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.820
But it was nowhere
near the extent

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.780
to which African-Americans
experience it.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.196
You have to remember that
during the mid-twentieth century

00:59:30.196 --> 00:59:33.030
and these policies
that I'm describing,

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:36.590
the farthest West baseball
team was St. Louis.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.530
This was a country that
revolved around the East.

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:42.260
And the policies were
directed primarily

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.600
against the minority
in the East,

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.830
which is African-Americans.

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:48.890
There were very few Asians
living in the East and very

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.310
few Hispanics.

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:55.082
And we have a caste
system in this country.

00:59:55.082 --> 00:59:56.540
I think one of the
most-- and I say

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.915
this in the book-- one of the
most dangerous things we do

00:59:58.915 --> 01:00:01.640
is when we invent this
term "people of color"

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.500
as though African-Americans and
Hispanics suffer the same kinds

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.370
of discrimination.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.990
They don't.

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:11.100
It's not that Hispanics
aren't discriminated against,

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.950
but it's not the same
as African-Americans.

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.720
For example, third-generation
and beyond Hispanics

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.270
in this country
marry non-Hispanics.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.330
It's a very rapid
assimilation rate.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:29.759
I used to live in Whittier
outside Los Angeles,

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.300
and there was a
community where there

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:36.905
were many families that were
blended Hispanic and Anglo.

01:00:36.905 --> 01:00:38.690
There were no blacks
in that community,

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:43.960
even though it's a big black
community in Los Angeles.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.090
Hispanic homeownership
rates are much higher

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:48.437
than African-American
homeownership rates,

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.270
even though they were
discriminated against.

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.750
In California, these
restrictive covenants

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:58.390
of the kind that you had in your
house in Santa Cruz excluded

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:59.290
Hispanics as well.

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.200
But judges refused to enforce
them against Hispanics.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.200
California judges,
when a white family

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.020
tried to sue to have a Hispanic
family evicted because they

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.650
bought a home in violation
of the restrictive covenant,

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:13.780
judges in California said
they couldn't enforce it

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.290
because Hispanics were
really Caucasians.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.890
So I'm not minimizing the
experience that Hispanics--

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.680
the discrimination that
Hispanics have experienced,

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.380
but I think it's-- we have
a legacy of slavery in this

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.930
country which puts--

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.680
we have a caste system,
which puts African-Americans

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.730
in an entirely different
position than Hispanics.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.710
And it would be a
mistake to, I think,

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.240
to think that it's
just all the same,

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.550
it's just people of color.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:47.330
AUDIENCE: MLK talks in his
letter from Birmingham jail

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.610
about the white moderate.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:53.110
And I'm curious as to
how you would convey

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:57.730
a lot of the topics in your book
to that population of people

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:00.580
that is, in my opinion, it's
a very problematic group

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.600
of people that we really need
to bring forward and help

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.390
us fight this good fight.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.890
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN:
Yeah, certainly--

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.510
I don't want-- we should never--

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:12.468
I should never exaggerate,
and you should never

01:02:12.468 --> 01:02:13.360
exaggerate my book.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.610
There has to be lots
of this going on,

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:18.636
and I'm trying to make
the impact that I can.

01:02:18.636 --> 01:02:20.260
But the real problem,
as I said before,

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.820
is translating this
knowledge into action.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.600
What you called white moderates
are people in this room-- me,

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.540
lots of my white moderates
are learning this history.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.529
But in order to remedy the
unconstitutional actions

01:02:36.529 --> 01:02:39.070
of the government, that's going
to require a new Civil Rights

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.280
Movement that's going
to have to not just be

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.960
based on understanding,
but be based on activism,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.850
and demonstrations, and marches.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.890
And during the Civil Rights
Movement through the 1960s,

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:54.557
many white moderates
joined in later.

01:02:54.557 --> 01:02:56.390
It started with people
who weren't moderate,

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:58.327
and as it became
more-- and you know,

01:02:58.327 --> 01:03:00.160
I think we need in the
Civil Rights Movement

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.320
to address housing segregation.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.470
I gave-- I give a lot of talks.

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:09.760
One that sticks in my mind is
I gave a talk about a month ago

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.940
to an audience of 600 members
of white Protestant churches

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.700
in Louisville, Kentucky.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.080
People are interested in this.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.280
Whether we'll take
action is the next step.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.074
AUDIENCE: With the
right-to-work legislation

01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:28.240
that had passed in some
states, and now that there's

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.040
a push for federal
right-to-work legislation,

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.230
do you think that
segregation is a motive

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:41.400
for this type of legislation,
or just a byproduct of it?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.890
And if they're the
same, what's the benefit

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.105
for the government for that?

01:03:46.105 --> 01:03:49.120
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Well, I
think the racial polarization

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.380
that characterizes our
politics is reinforced,

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.080
if not in the major
part, created by the fact

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.320
that we live so separately.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.880
And that racial polarization
not only affects

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.570
right-to-work legislation,
it affects opposition

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:07.300
to universal health
insurance, it

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.560
affects opposition to
minimum wage increases.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.310
We have developed an
attitude in this country

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.660
where large sections
of the white population

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.600
are opposed to social
programs which they support

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.470
in other countries because they
think it benefits black people.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:28.360
And this is, I think,
a product of the fact

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.070
that we live so separately.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:33.421
So I guess I would include
right-to-work legislation

01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:33.920
in that.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.390
But it's part of a whole
configuration of policies

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:44.500
that are much more
conservative in this country

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.630
than they are in other
industrialized countries

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:48.777
because of our
racial polarization.

01:04:48.777 --> 01:04:51.110
And it's not based, again,
to take the previous example,

01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:53.470
it's not based because people
don't want to help Asians

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.770
or don't want to
help Hispanics, it's

01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:00.520
a racial issue, which
was unfortunately

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.680
empowered by the President
of the United States.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.760
AUDIENCE: My family migrated
from Mississippi to Detroit.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.550
And my grandmother
purchased our first home

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:11.050
because she could pass.

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.060
So when her and my
grandfather went

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.330
to get a mortgage because
he looked African-American

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:19.030
and she could pass as
white and was passing,

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.280
that was how our family was
able to actually purchase

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.500
the first home that anyone in
our family actually purchased.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.617
So I'm really interested
in this research.

01:05:26.617 --> 01:05:28.450
But my question is can
you talk a little bit

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:33.070
about the impact and the effect
that these racist policies have

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:38.392
had on public education
in this country?

01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:40.720
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.990
And I started out by
talking about this.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:47.180
I was an education policy writer
before I got involved in this.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.800
I didn't know anything
about housing.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.260
This is not my field.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.040
And in the course of writing
about education policy,

01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:01.600
I became convinced and wrote
about how the entire education

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.000
policy of this
country was following,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.920
the No Child Left Behind law
and so forth, was flawed.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.370
It was nonsense
because it assumed

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:12.160
that the reason
that particularly

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.405
low-income African-American
children were not achieving

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:17.530
at high levels was because
the teachers didn't have

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.880
high expectations of them,
and they weren't accountable,

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.880
and we didn't test them
enough, and force people

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.410
to get their test scores up.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:28.210
And I understood that the reason
that we have an achievement

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:31.170
gap-- which is what it's
called in education policy--

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:33.280
is because of the social
and economic conditions

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.050
that children come
to school with.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:37.150
There are hundreds and
hundreds of these examples.

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.370
I've written about many of them.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:44.830
One example is-- just a
simple example, asthma.

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.850
Low-income African-American
children with asthma

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:49.300
at four times the rate
of middle class children

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.425
because of the kinds of
neighborhoods they live in,

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:54.160
the kind of environment, that
kind of air they're breathing.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.590
If a child has
asthma, it's drowsy

01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.610
because it's sleepless,
up late at night wheezing,

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.224
sometimes absent from school.

01:07:02.224 --> 01:07:03.640
If you have two
groups of children

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.130
who are equal in every
conceivable respect

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:09.270
except one group has a higher
rate of asthma than the other,

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:11.520
that group is going to have
lower average achievement,

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.890
which is not to say that
some children with asthma

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:16.050
don't achieve at higher levels.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:18.529
You all know that there's
a distribution of outcomes

01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:19.820
for every human characteristic.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.710
So you add all these up, and
it creates an achievement gap.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.550
But what happens when you
concentrate all these children

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.200
in single schools?

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.940
So it's not just one
or two children who

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.730
have asthma, or lead
poisoning, or a stress

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:38.670
from economic instability,
or lack of access

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:42.777
to primary care physicians,
or homes in which

01:07:42.777 --> 01:07:43.860
parents are well-educated.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.750
It's not just one
child in the classroom,

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.030
or two child, or a half--
but every single child

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.510
in the classroom has one
of these characteristics.

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.070
That classroom is
inevitably going

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.630
to have lower
average achievement,

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:57.330
much lower average achievement
than the classroom where

01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:01.830
children come to school
well-fed, and nourished,

01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:06.660
and well-rested, and unstressed.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.670
So that's how I came to this.

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:11.730
I came to conclude
that the concentration

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:15.150
of disadvantaged
children in schools

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.500
was the cause of the
achievement gap, the major cause

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.602
of the achievement gap.

01:08:18.602 --> 01:08:21.060
The schools are concentrated
because the neighborhoods were

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.170
that way, and that we had
no chance of addressing

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.779
the serious economic--
educational problems that we

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:30.266
have in this country so long
as we had segregated schools.

01:08:30.266 --> 01:08:32.640
And the schools were segregated
because the neighborhoods

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.810
were segregated.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.479
So that's how I came
to this conclusion,

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.859
and why I began
this investigation.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:41.729
AUDIENCE: So I'm an
organizer in the Mission,

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:46.740
in my part-time-- or
my out-of-work time.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.470
And I organize
Mission [? Yemby. ?]

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:52.740
And our belief is that one--
a big way of stopping--

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.080
or preventing gentrification
and displacement

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.260
is that we just have to
build a lot everywhere.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.240
And I think SB-827
ties into that.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.700
So I'm curious if you
agree with that approach.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.580
And what would you add onto it?

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:08.130
What should we follow A27 with?

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:09.214
What kind of legislation?

01:09:09.214 --> 01:09:12.029
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN:
Well, when you

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:14.340
say what should we
follow 827 with,

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:18.000
you're more optimistic that
I am that it will actually be

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.640
passed that we can follow it.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:27.630
But I think that the advocates--
the opponents of the costs

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.240
of gentrification
I think mostly--

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.479
and maybe you don't-- but mostly
they miss half the picture

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:37.800
because when neighborhoods
gentrify, which means--

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.819
that's a good thing.

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:41.700
They become integrated
temporarily.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:48.090
And so the advocates of
preserving that integration

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.810
propose policies that
ensure that some homes

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:54.510
in those neighborhoods
remain accessible

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:56.970
for the former residents,
or for low-income families,

01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:58.960
or for moderate income families.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.634
But if we're going to have-- and
even if that we're successful,

01:10:02.634 --> 01:10:04.050
most people in
those neighborhoods

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:06.080
would be displaced.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.820
And where do they go?

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.270
And so for the opponents
of gentrification

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.180
to focus only on
preserving a share of homes

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.340
in those neighborhoods
for the previous residents

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.470
or people like the
previous residents

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.080
without focusing on the
segregation of the broader

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.480
metropolitan area,
which affects where

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.330
the people who will
inevitably be displaced go,

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.140
I think is a mistake.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.822
So what I would like
to see followed--

01:10:29.822 --> 01:10:31.530
if you're asking me
what would follow it,

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:36.230
if 827 ever got passed
is an inclusionary zoning

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:38.630
policy for the entire
metropolitan area,

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.437
not just for the areas
around transit stops.

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.520
HALIMAH DELAINE PRADO:
Thank you again for coming.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.728
RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: Thank you.

01:10:44.728 --> 01:10:47.470
