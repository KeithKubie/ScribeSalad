(typing)

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.037
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.006 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We started by
looking for WMDs which,

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.474
at the time, I assumed was a way

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.944 line:0%
to classify yourself on
a dating site, right?

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.078 line:0%
I remember thinking,
"Why are we searching

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.214 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
for white middle-aged
dads in Iraq?"

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.915 line:0%
(audience laughs)

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.617 line:0%
Doesn't make sense.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.420 line:0%
We've got enough
of them here right?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.723
- He is a person of color
and he's more sensitive

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.494 line:0%
to issues of bigotry and
I think he's gonna be.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.130 line:0%
You know, he doesn't
want to equate Islam

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.766 align:start size:84% position:16%
with extremist violent
people, you know?

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.833
- [Larry] Is it harder because

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.301
he's a secret Muslim from Kenya?

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.772
(Negin and audience laughs)

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'll give you
guys the opportunity

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.910 align:start size:84% position:16%
to ask me any one
of these, which one?

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.345
- Islamophobia sexism.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.047
- Islamophobia sexism?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:47.947
I say uh...

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.185
Let's get rid of uh...

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.186
(Larry and audience laughs)

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.188
That one is hard.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.222 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh my god.
(audience boos)

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.323
No!

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.258
No hold on!

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.161
No you guys, you know,
we'll be right back.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.762
I'll tell you in act four.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.565 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Narrator] Tonight's
topic is child discipline.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.934
- How far should you go?

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.603
As a dad, I think the
most important thing

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.872
you could tell your kid
is, "Shut the fuck up."

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.407
(audience laughs)

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.076
I don't think there's any
better parental role model

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start size:97% position:3%
than Fred G. Sanford, G
stands for getting my belt.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.879
I acknowledge this might just be

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.781
a jive turkey issue, I get that.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's all kinds of ways
you can discipline your kid.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.185
You throw a book at the
back of a kid's head,

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.920
that's gonna get
their attention.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.154
After it's gotten
their attention

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
they can read the
damn book, dig that.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.725
- Can you just be,
like in a store..

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.428 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, as a parent
and you see a kid

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.098
doing something wrong, is
it okay to tell that kid,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.399
"You need to stop."

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.700
- I do.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.469
- Can you discipline
someone else's kid?

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.104
- I do, but they
don't like you to.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.472 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Are you cool with someone
doing it to your kid?

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.440 line:0%
- Yes, and he's 22 so I mean--

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.408 line:0%
(audience laughs)

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.310
- As a white bald guy under 40,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.245 align:start size:84% position:16%
everybody thinks I'm
the kid snatcher.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.880
(Deborah groans)

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.683
No seriously look, you
picture me and Larry,

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.251 align:start size:84% position:16%
me and Larry Wilmore
at a playground.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.553
Granted he's got a suit, who
are you leaving your kid with?

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Health officials in
California are warning people

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
to stay away from
so-called measles party.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
The get-togethers
are meant for parents

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.463 align:start size:88% position:13%
to intentionally expose
kids to the disease

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.699
to develop a natural immunity.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Measles parties guys!
(audience boos)

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.504 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, you don't get to
participate in civil society.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.038
- I used to hate it when,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.740
you know when you have a
birthday party for your kid

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.076
and you have to make the
party favors for everybody?

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.178
And I'm like, "He's the
birthday kid, give him.."

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.813
So now the party
favor's measles?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.214
(laughs)

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.983 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Larry] That's their
version of a plus-sized model!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean, that lady was
plus-sized from here to here.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean the only thing
plus about her was here.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.460
- [Narrator] Is it odd
that a few weeks after

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.694
you move into the neighborhood,

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.229
Jon Stewart decides
he wants to move out?

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.299
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.133
- Um..

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.172
I would say that yes, it is odd.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.242
I've said all along
that Jon is a racist.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.477
(audience laughs)

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.379
Hey America, follow
the nightly show

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.282 align:start size:97% position:3%
with Larry Wilmore on Twitter,
but don't follow me home.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:05.185
I want followers but I
don't want followers.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.486
That's stalking.
