[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.850
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.650
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.640
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.930
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.460
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.080
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.100
and why they do it.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.020
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.190
Welcome to this episode of
"Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.580
Today I have a very
special guest joining me.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.570
Emeka has come all
the way from Nigeria.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.900
And Emeka, he's a program
manager in sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
responsible for
working with developers

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.106
in that part of the world.

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.480
Now, he's also been working
on this awesome project which

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.090
has been about taking developer
content that's typically

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.020
only available online and making
it available to developers

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.600
offline.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.750
So Emeka, welcome and
thanks for joining us.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.170
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Thank
you for having me, Laurence.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
you're very welcome.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.680
It's just a real treat
to have you here today.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.596
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: It's
a great day on campus

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:53.750
and it's great to be here.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell
us about this project.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.940
Is it "cay-sa?"

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.094
Is that how I pronounce it?

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.760
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
Project Kesaa, yeah.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.095
So "kesaa" is an Igbo word.

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.800
It's a language spoken
in southeastern Nigeria.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.894
"Kesaa" means to distribute
or to share something that

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:09.060
gets to everybody, everyone.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.033
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: The
project was actually

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.520
born out of the work we're
doing in sub-Saharan Africa

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.930
working with the
developer ecosystem there.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.070
And while doing
this, we found out

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790
that, yes, Google does have a
lot of great developer content.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.690
But this content
is mostly online.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.565
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.440
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: And
by developer content,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.090
I mean stuff like the tutorials,
the videos, documentation,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.640
installation files,
and stuff like that.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.530
This content is mostly
available online.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.420
But then you find out that
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.280
a lot of the people
have internet

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.700
that is either too expensive,
or unreliable, or in some cases,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.300
nonexistent.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.700
Right?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.699
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:49.800
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
So these developers

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.560
find it pretty hard to get
access to this content.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.750
So we asked ourselves,
is there a way

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.970
that we can get this content
to them in a way that is

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.220
offline-friendly, so to speak.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.450
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: So
we tested our idea first,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.475
with a small pilot where
we just had about 500 DVDs.

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:08.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.475
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: And we
got some of this content

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:11.600
on the DVDs.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.480
And we ran a pilot
with a few developers.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.430
And the response was amazing.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.220
They loved it.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.720
So we decided to take
it a step further.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.560
And we actually got
a lot of content,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.710
about 32 gigs of content, what
we call the software developer

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.590
offline kit.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.256
Nice and compact.

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.880
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
Yeah, very compact.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.310
This one is a USB format.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.440
It has 32 gigs of data.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sweet.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.815
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
And on it, we

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:42.010
had stuff like-- we had the
entire Android developer

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.760
website here.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.080
We had the Google
Cloud documentation.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.420
We had all the software
developer kits for Android

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.710
and cloud here.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.130
We had documentation
on material design.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.390
We had videos for
cloud and Android

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.870
from Google I/O and the
Google Developers channel.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.765
And also, very importantly, we
had the Udacity course videos.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: So like
the Android fundamentals,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.460
the scalable, all that stuff.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.376
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yeah,
all that good stuff.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.980
And we invited people who
were interested in joining us

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.680
in this pilot to apply
to get one of these kits.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.850
And we were actually
blown away by the number

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.870
of applications we got.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.404
We got about 4,000 people.

00:03:21.404 --> 00:03:22.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.270
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: You
know, these responses

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.532
came from all over the world.

00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:26.740
In fact, one of them I found
particularly interesting

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.590
was this guy who, he works
on a boat on the North

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.580
Sea for two weeks--

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: On a boat?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.840
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: --and he's
on land for another two weeks.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, wow.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.380
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: And
while he's on the boat,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.690
I think he writes code.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.210
So he didn't have access
to all this content,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.670
because internet was a
challenge on the boat.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.360
So he requested that we send him
the kit so that he could use it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.000
while writing code on the boat.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: Do you
know what he was building?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.530
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: I have
no idea what he was building.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.925
I would love to find out myself.

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well, if
you're watching on this,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.520
please just leave us a comment
below so you can tell us

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.545
what it was that you
built. Because we

00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:56.870
would love to know
what you did while you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.047
were on the boat in the
middle of the North Sea.

00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.380
You've had folks from all
over the world downloading it.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.814
What kind of
results did you get?

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:04.230
What kind of numbers
did you have?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.146
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: We
do know, at this point,

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.420
that at least 4,000
people are actively

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.454
using the content in
over 100 countries.

00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:11.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.910
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yeah,
so that's quite interesting.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: And that's
the one's that you know.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.520
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
That's the ones we know.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.589
Because obviously, this
content is used mostly offline.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.905
So we don't know anything
about what goes on offline.

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:24.030
But when they use it while
connected to a computer,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.760
we can tell through
Google Analytics--

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.551
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
--that it's being used.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.792
And we're going on to actually
spread this even more.

00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:32.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.326
And this content, it's like
twice a year you do it?

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:35.450
So you produce new content.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.210
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yes, we
try to do it twice a year.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.926
So in fact, there is another
one due in the next few weeks.

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:43.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice,
I look forward to it.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.726
So hopefully some of my
content will be in there.

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:46.250
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
Yeah, definitely.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.594
Definitely will be in there.

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:50.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now your
target developers, originally--

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.790
even though you reach global--
but your original target

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.530
developers were sub-Saharan,
Nigerian, that kind of thing.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.080
Could you tell us a little
bit about developers

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.163
in that part of the world?

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.040
What's the profile of
a developer there like?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.956
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: The
profile of a developer

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:02.440
in sub-Saharan
Africa is one that

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.450
has been evolving over
the past few years.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.530
So in the last six years
or so, the ecosystem

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.645
in sub-Saharan Africa
has come to realize

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:18.030
the value of the internet, not
just as a channel for reaching

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.470
their customers or end users,
but also as a growth engine

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.640
for empowering
themselves economically,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.030
and financially, and so on.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.970
Because of this explosion
in the last few years,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.914
many of these startups
who have built products

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:33.330
that are actually
gaining traction

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.550
find themselves in
a situation where

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.970
they need to get new talent or
they need to expand their team.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.350
And the demand actually
way outstrips the supply.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.260
So that's actually
what keeps me awake

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.010
at night, trying to figure out
ways to grow the talent pool,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.120
upskill more developers
for these startups to hire

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.890
and continue doing
what they're doing.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
then these startups

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.900
are a great contributor to the
economy as they go forward,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.200
right?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.520
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yes, yes.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.269
A lot of them are doing
very great things.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.420
For example, ecommerce
recently took off.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.835
In Nigeria, there's a company
called Conga, for example.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:08.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.130
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: I think
they started in the last year

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.940
and a half, two years ago.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.810
And they recently launched
their Android app last year,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.412
right in time for the
holiday shopping season.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.040
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: And it
was a really big hit for them,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.280
because it helped a lot
of people who are mainly

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.170
on their mobile phones
to place orders and have

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.455
these orders fulfilled.

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.455
LAURENCE MORONEY: Folks
that aren't aware of it,

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:32.637
in sub-Saharan Africa, the
desktop revolution kind

00:06:32.637 --> 00:06:33.470
of passed by, right?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.261
People have really gone
straight to mobile.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.680
So ecommerce is mobile first.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.250
It's mobile only rather
than mobile first--

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.370
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
Well yes, exactly.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: --primarily.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.630
So as a result then,
somebody like that

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.580
can be really successful
for the economy as a whole.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.050
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yes, indeed.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.450
Now, I understand one of
the things you've also

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.740
been working on is design,
and design language,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.400
and helping mobile developers
to design in user-centric ways.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.379
What efforts have been
putting forward in that?

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.045
Could you share?

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:57.045
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yes.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.580
So with the internet--
the evolution

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.260
of the internet as a channel
and as a growth engine-- one

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.580
challenge that has come
up in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.660
and indeed, many major
market countries,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.090
is the lack of locally
relevant content.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.060
You know, there isn't enough of
this locally relevant content

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.340
online.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.850
And for the internet
to be useful to people

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.420
in these regions,
they have to find

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.110
something that is useful to
them that was built for them.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: For
them-- yeah, exactly.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.949
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: So a lot
of the content online right now

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.050
was built here in Silicon
Valley, or in Europe,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.250
or wherever, and
wasn't built for they

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.930
user in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.770
So what we're trying to
get the ecosystem to do now

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.280
is to do what
Google does, right,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.630
to focus on the
user-- in this case,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.640
the African user-- to
build for that user

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.040
by integrating
principles of user

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.780
centered design in their
product development process.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.480
So what we did was,
starting last year,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.535
we started running a series
of UX master classes,

00:07:56.535 --> 00:07:58.300
as we call them.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.280
The whole idea was to introduce
these principles of UX design

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.230
to developers, product managers,
project managers, and so on--

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.700
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
--so that they

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.860
can apply this to the
tools and the products

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.260
that they're building.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.720
And we just had the second
iteration of that this year,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.600
where we focused on teams
that had new product ideas

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.130
and teams that had
existing products that

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.174
were trying to iterate to
get the next version out.

00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:25.215
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:26.631
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO:
And the result

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.110
has been quite encouraging.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
I understand, recently,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.440
in your country,
there was an election.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.110
And technology played
a great big part.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.943
And Android, and App
Engine, and other stuff

00:08:33.943 --> 00:08:34.860
played a part in that.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.430
Could you tell us
a little about it?

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.429
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yes.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.980
The 2015 elections in
Nigeria were quite unique

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.150
for a lot of reasons.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.620
And one of them was the role
that technology and social

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.200
played in the entire process.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.730
But before the polls themselves,
there was this concern

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.752
that there would be some
form of voter apathy,

00:08:54.752 --> 00:08:56.335
that people wouldn't
come out to vote.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: And you can't
have democracy without voters,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.620
right?

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:58.880
CHUKWUEMEKA AFIGBO: Yeah.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.520
I mean, you just can't.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.230
So one of the things
we did was to run

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.120
a campaign called the
Pledge to Vote campaign

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.810
where people went to a website
that was powered by Google

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.760
Cloud and they pledged to vote.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.160
So when you did that, you
get a badge generated for you

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.950
with your name.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.530
And you can
automatically share this

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.580
on the social platform
of your choice

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.410
and challenge your friends to
also go and pledge to vote.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.700
So that was quite successful.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.950
We also had various Google+
Hangouts where a number

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.150
of the candidates actually
engaged people, the press,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.100
the public on their manifesto
and stuff like that.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.930
So it was quite interesting,
the role that technology played.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.107
And I think the country
was better off for it.

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:44.690
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's good to hear.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.200
And I know there was a great
blog post on Google Africa.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.510
We'll post a link to it here.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.400
And so one the
things with elections

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.155
is elections are quite
close to being universal.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:55.030
But we can learn a lot
from what you guys did

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.310
in Nigeria, hopefully for
our elections next year.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.590
Emeka visited us all
the way from Nigeria.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.486
And he shared these
amazing stories

00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:03.360
of just the breadth of
things that developers

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.130
are doing, all because
of content that you're

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.230
able to give them offline.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.110
So thank you so much, Emeka.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.240
Thank you again, everybody.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.380
