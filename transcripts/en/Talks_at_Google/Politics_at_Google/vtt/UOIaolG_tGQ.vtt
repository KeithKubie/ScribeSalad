00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.210
JAN: We're here to
welcome Rana Mitter.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.680
He is professor of the history
and politics of modern China

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.040
in Oxford, and a fellow
of St. Cross College.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.090
He's also a fellow of the
British Economy since 2015.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
His research interests
include contemporary Chinese

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.510
nationalism, Republican
era Chinese history,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.810
and the second
Sino-Japanese war.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.260
He also wrote a book about
it, "China's war with Japan,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.560
1937 to 1945: The
Struggle for Survival,"

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.760
and several other books
on topics like that.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.090
He appeared on TV and
radio, has published

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.190
lots of research publications.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.010
And today he's here to give
us a very short introduction

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.880
on modern China.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Please welcome with me
Professor Rana Mitter.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.047 --> 00:00:59.630
RANA MITTER: And
it's a great pleasure

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.250
to be here at Google today.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.950
Thank you all for taking
your lunch break to come

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.180
and listen to me talking
about modern China.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.030
And thank you to Jan for
hosting us here today.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.810
I should start by saying that
I think although this is going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.990
to be a talk based on a
very short introduction

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.760
to modern China,
the book, which I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.150
think you have in front of you
or available at the front here.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.450
It's not going to be quite
as short as the introduction

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
to modern China that
was given by a very

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.310
famous historical figure--

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.610
the former French president and
war leader Charles de Gaulle,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.250
who was asked back in
the-- he was known actually

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.900
as the man who
had simultaneously

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.710
the longest nose and the
shortest temper in world

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.490
politics at that time.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490
And he was asked when he
was president of France

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.220
back I think in the
1960s, what do you think

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.247
about China, Mr. President?

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:53.330
To which he said looking
down that very long, very

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.900
distinguished nose,
and said, China

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.450
is a very large
country inhabited

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.270
by many Chinese people.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.725
Now I could leave it
there, because after that,

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.600
what is there to say?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.516
But I think I can probably
go a little further

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:10.100
than the late President
De Gaulle, great statesman

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.380
that he was, and of course
a man who re-established

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.720
full diplomatic
relations between France

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.510
and the People's
Republic of China,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.060
and speak at a bit more length
about what it is that makes up

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.945
what is perhaps one of
the most fascinating--

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.220
or perhaps I think it is one
of the most fascinating--

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.940
but perhaps the single most
important country in terms

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.260
of rapid political, economic,
and social change on the globe

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.460
today.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.302
Before I make any
sweeping statements

00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:40.760
or any further
sweeping statements,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.150
I should just find out how much
I'm likely to be rumbled today.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.414
Have we got anyone from
China in the audience?

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:48.330
Yes, couple of people.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.830
OK.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.470
Good to hear.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.460
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.224
I've just told
them that if anyone

00:02:58.224 --> 00:03:00.640
tries to leave this talk early,
then they'll hold the door

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.056
and make sure you stay for the
entire length, or something

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:04.560
like that.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.630
I want to talk
about modern China,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.750
not just in terms of
the contemporary China

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.600
that we see when
we get on a plane

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.250
and go to Beijing
or Shanghai where

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.500
I'm sure Google has all sorts
of interesting interests

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.630
these days, or Google, as of
course it's known in China.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.180
We will talk about
that side of China--

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.500
the China that's emerging
and where it's going.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.680
But I also want to
use the word "modern"

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.250
to try and get over an idea
of what kind of society

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.510
China is, what it has been,
and what it's trying to become,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.300
and get the idea of what many
of the Chinese themselves--

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.310
not all of them, of
course, not universally

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.120
amongst 1.2 billion people.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.330
But broadly speaking,
what the Chinese

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.580
themselves think
of when they use

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.820
the term "modern" to
describe their own country

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.470
and their own policy.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.150
And I want to start
with something which

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.000
is a bit of a paradox and
have that paradox running

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.650
through what I say
today, and then I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.330
hope perhaps fuel
a bit of discussion

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.560
about China after
I finish speaking.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.350
And that paradox
is the following--

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.950
China is a country
which, in a sense,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.270
is running a sort of social
and political experiment

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.100
that in terms of its
premises, in terms

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.829
of its basic
framework, combines two

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.110
things that the
modern world-- use

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.630
that term again-- the modern
world in the last 100 years

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.270
or so has not tended to see.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.320
And that is a society
that is simultaneously

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.132
very open in all sorts of ways.

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:34.590
And that sometimes
surprises people

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.140
who like to think of
China as a closed society.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.890
I don't think it is at all.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.040
But also a society that is not
liberal in its assumptions.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.880
So it is an open but
non-liberal-- if you like,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.780
illiberal-- society.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.660
And this contrasts
with the experience

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.970
that many people had
during, say, the Cold War.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.585
A period I think for Google as
a purely historical interest,

00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:58.710
since I know that you're
all geniuses who came here

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.000
at the age of about 12.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.270
But a few of you may have
vestigial historical memories

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.540
of the Cold War period when the
world divided itself to some

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.380
extent into the idea of
societies in the so-called free

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.750
world that were
liberal, democratic

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.590
in their assumptions, and open
in terms of transport, trade,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.770
and interaction,
and then a world--

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.270
the communist world,
in particular--

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.760
that was literally behind
a wall, [INAUDIBLE] Berlin,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.680
or at least very
heavily restricted

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.840
in terms of its contact
with the outside world.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.780
Now that latter form
of restricted society

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.150
doesn't remotely
describe China today.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.510
China is all around the
world in all of our lives,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.780
regardless of where
we live or what we do.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.280
It's there in the
goods that we buy,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.240
having become the world's most
important exporting country.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.910
It is, of course,
in our daily lives

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.660
in terms of the tens of
thousands of Chinese students

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.480
who start degrees every year
in this country, the United

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.324
Kingdom, or indeed in
the US or Australia.

00:05:57.324 --> 00:05:58.740
It's in the business
investors who

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.950
have meant that China
for the last few years

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.160
has had more of its capital
flow out of the country

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.860
to invest overseas than
it has attracted capital

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.520
to actually come into China.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.970
And of course, it's there in
the numerous Chinese business

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.120
people, students, software
workers, artists, filmmakers,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.520
and others who
are very much part

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.110
of that international
traffic that

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.840
goes between North America,
Europe, Asia, Africa,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.250
and the rest of the world.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.280
So definitely not
a closed society.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.860
But at home, as anyone
will also know, a country

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.950
that takes a very different
attitude towards the nature

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.330
of state and society.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.590
It is a society that still has
official censorship for books

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.050
that are published in China
in a way that wouldn't

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.910
happen in a liberal society.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.190
It's a country whose
media is also restricted

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.910
in very significant ways.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.170
And it's a country where
rights to do with law

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.100
are exercised in the context
of a ruling Chinese Communist

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.910
Party.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.529
So you may think
that's a good thing.

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:59.820
You may think it's a bad thing.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.970
But one thing it's not
is a liberal thing.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.780
And therefore, that paradox
of being open but not liberal

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.480
runs through the contradictions,
and I would say often

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.420
the difficulties, but
also the challenges that

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.200
come from trying to make
China into a country that

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.630
sits at the forefront
of modernity

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.360
in the present-day world.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.920
So to explain how we got
there and why it matters,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.540
let me take you through a short
historical journey before we

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.250
get-- oh, not that short--

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.590
before we get to
the present day.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.980
And we start with this gentleman
here, possibly, possibly

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.620
one of only two Chinese
who have world brand name

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.720
status, if that's the
right way to put it.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.030
One of those people we'll
see a little later--

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.390
Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong--
the communist leader of China

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.600
for more than a quarter of a
century between the late 1940s

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.550
and the mid 1970s.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.110
He's certainly a name who's
still known around the world.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.250
But this figure
perhaps even more so.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.660
The great Chinese
thinker Confucius.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.500
[INAUDIBLE], the Master Kong.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.620
The inventor of a set of
philosophical and ethical ideas

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.970
way back in the sixth century
BC, about the same time,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.150
broadly speaking, that some of
the great Greek philosophers--

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.130
Aristotle, Plato, and so forth--

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.310
were beginning to develop
their systems of thought

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.070
on the southern side of Europe.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.873
At the same time, some of
China's greatest philosophers

00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:34.539
were also beginning
to think about ideas

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.760
of society and ethics.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.549
And as it happened, this
particular thinker--

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.850
Confucius-- still known today
often as China's number one

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.320
teacher, began to put forward
a system of ethical and social

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.870
understanding of how the
world fitted together

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.490
that in many ways
still has a great deal

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.090
of valency, significance, and
power in the world of today.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.500
Or the China of today.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.260
So to understand briefly what
this system of thought was,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.600
how it differs from the way in
which certain Western or North

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.540
American or indeed,
other Asian societies,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.120
Indian societies, for
instance, have operated.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.680
It's worth thinking
briefly what some

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.170
of the ideas that someone
like Confucius put forth

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.230
were, because they were not
just relevant to the world

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.080
of the sixth century
BC, but still continue

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.139
to have a great deal
of valency today.

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:29.680
They are the ideas
that first of all,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.760
that correct and benevolent
behavior towards one another

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.700
is what makes a person
virtuous or moral.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.630
The ultimate aim in the
Confucian system of thought

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.150
was to become a jinsa--

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.370
a gentleman, a
person of integrity--

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.380
or even a sheng--
a sage, someone who

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.970
really had the level of wisdom.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.711
There's a famous
saying from Confucius--

00:09:50.711 --> 00:09:52.960
not one of the ones that you
get from fortune cookies,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.000
but an actual saying
from Confucius--

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.070
that says that it's not
until about the age of 40

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.990
that you can really
have mature thoughts.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.210
And for many people
it's 60 you first

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.700
begin really to understand
what the world is about.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.872
So there's another clue.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.580
Unlike our own society
in the West, which

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.950
perhaps a little bit
too much sometimes

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.080
tends to have a sort of
cult of youthfulness,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.290
Confucian values do value
the old, the elderly,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.515
people with age and wisdom.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:17.890
At the same time,
something else,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.930
which again is not
very compatible

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.850
with the modern world is
the idea that hierarchy--

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.250
relationships and
hierarchical relationships--

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.800
are not just
necessary, but actually

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.025
positively important
in the Confucian world.

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:33.400
So that could be
the relationship

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.100
between the ruler
and the ruled; or I

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.440
have to say, between the
husband and the wife,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.600
bearing in mind this was
a long, long time ago;

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.230
or between the teacher
and the student.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.440
Again, that education, that
bit of learning very central

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.030
to the Confucian worldview.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.820
In a sense, the only one of
the five great relationships

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.680
as they are called in
the Confucian world

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.390
that's purely equal--

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.610
non-hierarchical--
is the relationship

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.160
between a friend
and another friend.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.284
And in his day,
I fear that meant

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:04.450
male friend and male friend,
although obviously that

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.580
would have changed during the
time when women's status rose

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.790
in Chinese society, as it
did in many other societies

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.360
around the world.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.170
So bearing in mind that the
Confucian system of thought

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.870
for good or ill
changing in various ways

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.240
had the same sort of
cultural influence

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.690
that Christianity or Greco
classical, Greco Roman

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.060
classical norms
did on large parts

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.490
of the Western and
Mediterranean world

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.250
over the course of
some 2,500 years,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.187
from the very, very earliest
years of Chinese history,

00:11:36.187 --> 00:11:38.020
all the way through the
many great dynasties

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.760
I'm sure you've
heard the names of--

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.380
the Tang, the Song, the
Ming, and finally the Qing,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.560
until the early 20th century.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.530
But then things changed.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.400
And this is one of the
places where they changed.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.200
By the early 20th century,
China was not in good shape.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.630
For several decades in the
mid to late 19th century,

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.570
China found itself for the
first time up against an enemy

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.550
that it could not
absorb or conquer.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.980
And that was the enemy of
Western imperial power--

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.800
the British primarily at first,
but then the French, also

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.200
the Americans, and
eventually the Japanese.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.510
These were people coming
from the powerful industrial

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.590
empires, mainly but not all
from the Western part of Europe

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.770
that brought with them gunships.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.320
They brought with
them weapons, which

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.810
they could use to open
up and either colonize

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.190
or at least dominate the Asian
and African countries which

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.170
didn't have that
sort of firepower.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.630
They brought with them
also two or three items,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.120
which in a sense were
almost more dangerous

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.670
in terms of the way
they affected society

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.080
than the guns themselves.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.110
In China, one of
those was opium.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.920
Tragically, but I think
historically entirely provably,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.100
one of the first major
British encounters with China

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.480
was the forcing open of
markets to sell opium

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.810
into China, which became
a huge scourge that

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.320
affected large parts of society
for many decades after that.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.260
The so-called Opium War is a
term you may well have heard,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.530
which still live in
Chinese historical memory

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.480
in the present day.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:25.425
But also the third and perhaps
most long-reaching import

00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:28.050
into China at that time to make
a difference-- if number one is

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.050
guns, number two is
opium, you might say,

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.560
number three was
political thought.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.500
In other words, a whole
variety of ideas--

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:44.600
constitutionalism, new types
of independent thinking on law,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.930
ideas to do with
political change that

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.690
came from parliaments,
also from the relationship

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.690
between the military and the
government, coming from places

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.260
such as the newly emergent
Bismarck's Germany,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.690
the British constitutional
tradition, the French tradition

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.970
of law, and American
constitutionalism as well.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.510
All of these came into a
China which was already

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.540
battered by invasion,
forcing lots of young people

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.850
in particular to think
that if they could not

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.180
beat the West by using
traditional Chinese thinking

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.710
and methods, then
they might have

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.250
to adapt the Western system,
at least for a while,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.690
to try and fight back.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.856
The country that actually
did this most successfully

00:14:22.856 --> 00:14:24.950
was Japan, which in
the Meiji reforms

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.130
of the late 19th century
changed Japan very rapidly

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.670
from a traditional feudal
samurai society where

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.250
the most powerful weapon
was the sword to one

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.190
within a few decades that would
turn Japan into the fastest

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.955
industrializing country in
the world with warships,

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:44.510
it's own parliament,
conscript army, and eventually

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.220
colonies of its own.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.890
And China found itself on the
wrong side of those arguments.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.660
There were many
attempts at reform.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.460
But many of those
came to nothing,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.620
because the
difficulty of getting

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.570
the Chinese imperial court--

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.700
the Qing dynasty of
the time leading up

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.360
to the last emperor of China
who ruled all the out to 1912--

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.810
simply weren't able
to adapt fast enough.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.480
And this led to a
very significant set

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.515
of political changes.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.610
In 1912, a revolution
broke out of China

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.260
that led to the abdication
of the last emperor.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.280
Again, about 25 years ago,
30 years ago, Bertolucci

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.960
made a great movie,
"The Last Emperor,"

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.970
which you might have
seen or choose to see,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.149
which tells his
story in some detail.

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:28.940
It was very tragic.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.370
He was only five years
old when he actually

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.760
had to leave the throne.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.230
But even the establishment of
the Chinese Republic in 1912

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.840
did not stop the
political and social rot.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.420
China was still being
invaded from outside.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.010
People were still selling opium.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.570
It was still very,
very vulnerable

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.100
in terms of global
trade and politics.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.910
It was a country that
was being pushed around.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.810
And the kind of
pivotal moment came

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:02.135
on a date which if you speak
to any educated Chinese today--

00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:04.760
someone who's been through high
school, someone who's been-- it

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.160
doesn't even have to be
university-- and just say

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.240
one date.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.940
[SPEAKING CHINESE] May 4.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.040
May 4, 1919.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.640
This is a date which has
a whole panoply of changes

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.170
in ideas behind it.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.690
It's a bit like saying to
people of say, your parents'

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.510
generation-- the '60s,
which doesn't literally

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.030
mean in the West 1960 to 1969.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.030
It means a moment of kind of
political change, thought,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.150
liberation in America
and Paris and London, all

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.160
of these sorts of things.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.580
So in a way, the May 4 movement,
the May 4 moment in 1919

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.370
symbolized a whole set
of political changes.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.110
So just two seconds.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.810
What happened on May 4, 1919?

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.090
Well, this happened.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.639
This is sort of a
similar picture.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:53.930
I think it wasn't actually
a picture on the day itself.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.370
But it gives you an idea.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.830
This building-- part of the
Forbidden City in the center

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.910
of Beijing--

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.990
then as today right at the
heart of the Chinese capital.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.910
And in front of it,
a demonstration.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.079
In this case, a demonstration
of young people.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.160
4th of May, 1919.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.960
You have 3,000 young people
from China's, Beijing's

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.950
top universities--

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.109
Peking University,
Tsinghua University--

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.990
gathering in front of the
Forbidden City in Beijing.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.859
Why?

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.079
Because just a few
days earlier, they

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:27.390
had heard a terrible
piece of news from Europe.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.050
On the 30 of April, the
Treaty of Versailles--

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.310
the end of World War I--

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.150
was signed.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.525
Now many people
in the West don't

00:17:33.525 --> 00:17:36.140
know that China was also
a participant in World War

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.530
I. They actually fought
on the Allied side.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.890
If you've ever read the
stories of the trenches--

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.740
young men being killed
in Flanders Field, all

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.280
of that, the great story
of World War I in Europe--

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.297
people don't often ask where
did the trenches come from?

00:17:52.297 --> 00:17:52.880
Who made them?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.610
And the answer in many
cases was Chinese workers.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.700
96,000 of them
brought from China

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.772
to these unfamiliar, cold
fields in France and Belgium

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:04.730
to do lots of things--
work behind the scenes--

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.890
but certainly
digging the trenches.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.170
3,000 of them died
in the conditions

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.820
of cold northern
France and Belgium.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.390
Their graves are
still there today.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.880
So having made
this contribution,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.000
the Chinese thought that some of
the imperial possessions which

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.780
had been seized by the Germans
in the late 19th century

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.200
would be given back to China
after the peace treaty was

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.280
signed.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.120
And they weren't.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.610
They were instead in a piece
of skullduggery handed over

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.870
to the Japanese.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.960
And this made China's young
patriotic students in Beijing,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.470
when they heard the news,
very, very angry indeed.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.860
3,000 of them gathering
outside the symbolic center

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.110
of the heart of
Beijing, saying it

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.370
was time for China to take
on two ideas, two ideas which

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.010
to this day remain very
important in thinking

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.230
about what a modern China is.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.740
And one was called in
their terms, Mr. Science.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.510
The other one was Mr. Democracy.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.100
In other words, the idea
of technological modernity

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.800
and the idea of
political change,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.920
more popular participation
and democratic change.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.130
And demonstrating
for these things

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.970
not in the crowd that
day, but certainly

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.370
nearby and taking part in the
wider political atmosphere,

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.460
was a young man called
Mao Tse-Tung, who

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.070
became one of the founder
members of the Chinese

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.480
Communist Party.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.290
So in 1921, just two years
after this demonstration,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:29.030
the small group of the first
group of communists in China

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.580
would start the journey that
would eventually lead them

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.580
towards the conquest
of the whole of China,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.490
and indeed to become the
ruling party of China

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.860
they remain to this very day.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.110
So May 4 demonstration,
very important

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.070
turning point in terms of young,
patriotic Chinese thinking

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.560
about why their country
was doing so badly,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.270
and determined
that they would act

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.596
to make sure that China was not
put in that position in future.

00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:55.970
They were drinking
in, of course,

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.220
a whole atmosphere
around the world.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.680
This was a time in
the interwar period

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.380
when political culture
and artistic culture

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.090
was changing rapidly.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.510
Figures like Marinetti,
the great Italian futurist,

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.260
who put forward ideas of
speed and modernity in art.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.290
There we have one of the iconic
artworks that actually amongst

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.530
other things underpin the
eventual fascist movement that

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.860
took over Italy.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.990
So not all of this modernity was
necessarily very progressive.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:28.050
We also have the flowering
of different non-Western,

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.700
non-European people
talking to each other

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.450
rather than simply
learning from the West.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.120
So I told you in the
late 19th century,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.880
much of the constitutionalism
and legal change

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.880
came from examples in Western
Europe, as well as Japan.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.330
But the interwar period saw a
great deal more conversation

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.004
between India, China,
and Japan about what they

00:20:46.004 --> 00:20:47.170
could learn from each other.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.670
And here actually
we have an example

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.490
of Jamini Roy, one of the
great Indian modernist painters

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.030
drawing on Indian
folk art and becoming

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.480
a great influence
on many thinkers

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.600
in the non-Western world.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.590
This was also the era
of Rabindranath Tagore,

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.350
perhaps in some senses the
most famous artistic figure

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.690
in the world in the
interwar period--

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.900
a Bengali first non-Western
winner of the Nobel Prize,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.440
and a figure who
was feted in Japan

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.700
and certainly treated
with great seriousness

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.410
in China when he visited there.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.960
An example here also
of the kind of poetry

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.770
that young modern Chinese
wrote to try and express

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.800
their excitement at
the possibilities

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.010
of democratic change and
technological change that

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.720
could help modernize China.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.660
This poem here by
the poem "Tian Gou"--

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.600
Heavenly Dog-- by
[INAUDIBLE], who

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.380
became one of the most important
poets of communist China

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.370
sums up this sort of
thought with these lines.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.370
"I am the light of the moon,
I am the light of the sun,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.770
I am the light of
all the planets,

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.460
I am the light of x-ray,
I am the total energy

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.320
of the entire universe!"

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.540
And in the original,
as you see the italics

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.670
there show that the
original Chinese actually

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.670
has those words in English
put into Western letters

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.110
in the middle of
the Chinese text

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.540
to give it that
sheen of modernity.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.310
Those of you who know
a bit about poetry

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.330
will perhaps recognize these two
influences here, one of which

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.250
is the great American
poet Walt Whitman

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.920
of the late 19th century,
who very much followed

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.470
that kind of idea
of the personal

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.770
and the individual expressing
something about the wider

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.300
universe, but also
Tagore Gitanjali, one

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.760
of the most influential
non-Western poems of the time,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.900
very influential on the
European modernists,

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.590
but also catching the eye of
[INAUDIBLE] over in China,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.310
leading to a sort of
Indian-Chinese influence there.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.170
So very much a
cosmopolitan time,

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.310
a time when people were thinking
of all sorts of different ways

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.550
of being modern and changing.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.460
But the politics of China
also took a very dark turn

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.430
during this period, because
by the 1930s, the simmering

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.920
tensions between
the two greatest

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.100
nations, or at least two
biggest nations, of East Asia--

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.230
China, and Japan--
came to a head.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.030
During the early
20th century, you

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.840
could say that in East Asia,
two rival political forces came

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.580
into conflict with each other.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.740
On the one hand on
the mainland of Asia,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.880
Chinese nationalism, which I've
mentioned that May 4 movement

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.800
turning into a wider
sense that China

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.820
needs to get back its strength,
its power, its sovereignty

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.840
in terms of everything from
politics to art to economics.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.110
And Japan, yes, becoming
the most modernized nation

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.940
of East Asia, as I've
mentioned before,

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.660
but also becoming its most
powerful imperial power.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.290
And in the context of that,
slowly but surely occupying

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.990
more and more of
Asia's territory--

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:59.970
Taiwan in 1895, Manchuria
in 1905, Korea 1910.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.790
In 1931, an even more
comprehensive takeover

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.320
of the Northeast of China--

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.340
Manchuria.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.610
By 1937, China and
Japan were essentially

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.870
poised on the brink of
war, and finally clashed--

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.430
came to arms-- leading
to an eight-year struggle

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.600
for survival by China against
the Japanese invasion.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.660
Eventually we would come to
know this war as World War II,

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.580
since of course, the
European War had stopped

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.290
two years later in 1939.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.790
And then with Pearl
Harbor in 1941,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.220
the United States would come in.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.020
The whole war would
become global.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.560
But those eight years saw
up to about 14 million

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.340
Chinese deaths, 80 to 100
million Chinese becoming

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.430
refugees in their own
country, and the holding down

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.590
of more than half a
million Japanese troops

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.670
on the allied side.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.120
Once again, China playing an
important but under-reported

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.180
role in terms of
its contribution

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.860
to the Second World War.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.570
And by the end of
that time, by the end

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.930
of that devastating eight-year
war between China and Japan,

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.007
the then nationalist
government of China

00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:07.590
essentially collapsed
under the weight

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.810
of its own contradictions,
as Marxists

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.340
might say, leaving the way for
that young, eager student who

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.950
I mentioned briefly
in 1919 having

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.320
an interesting time thinking
about politics in Beijing

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.730
in 1919.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.240
Well, he had come a very long
way in the 25 to 30 years

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.020
after that.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.590
He had become part of the rising
power of the Chinese Communist

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.340
Party.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.240
And by 1949, that
man, Mae Tse-Tung,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.030
had become the
ruler of all China.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:42.740
So in doing that, he had taken
up one idea and taken it with

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.350
him, which would be very,
very important in terms

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.300
of rethinking the way that China
thought about being modern,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.030
because when those
May 4 demonstrators--

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.379
those young patriotic
men and women--

00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:57.170
demonstrated in front
of the Forbidden City

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.350
and started thinking about
Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.640
the one figure--

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.900
the one figure who many of
them turned against violently

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.440
was Confucius.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.590
They saw Confucius,
the traditional sage

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.170
who for 2,500 years
in one way or another

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.300
had underpinned Chinese
thinking as not the solution,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.340
but the problem.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.680
The person whose
ideas of hierarchy,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.550
of benevolence, of trying to
keep a sort of ordered society,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.810
had held China back.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.090
And they said, well,
if Confucian thought

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:30.620
gets us invaded by the West
and leads China into disaster,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.050
then we need a very
different way of thinking.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.210
And Chairman Mao-- Mao
Tse-Tung's thinking,

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.340
and the thinking of the
Chinese Communist Party

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.430
was perhaps the most radical
break with Confucius that

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.800
existed in China's history.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.960
They argued that
Confucius was a purveyor

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.960
of feudal thinking,
old-fashioned thinking that

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.370
held China back.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.160
They argued that some of his
ideas such as benevolence

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.070
led simply to a society that
could never move forward,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.300
and that sometimes terror and
the use of violent tactics

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.940
were necessary and
even praiseworthy

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.630
in terms of creating a new
type of Chinese society.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.470
And that tendency found
its ultimate expression

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.800
in this event that
you can see just

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.350
behind Mao's head here, which is
the Chinese Cultural Revolution

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.750
of the 1960s and '70s.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.620
This was the culmination of the
period when Chairman Mao sought

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.330
to consolidate his own rule.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.330
He had come to power in 1949.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.220
And there had been various ups
and downs in China in the years

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.490
after that, including the
attempt at the Great Leap

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.540
Forward, a massive program
of economic modernization

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.510
that went horribly wrong and
led to the starving to death

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.770
of tens of millions of people.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.820
So having seen
this go wrong, Mao

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.466
doubled down in
effect by the 1960s,

00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:50.840
argued that what
China needed was

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.980
to overthrow every single
part of its former system

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.140
of government and
society, and instead

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.420
launched what he called a
great proletarian Cultural

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.290
Revolution, something which
would smash beyond repair

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.380
much of China's old
culture and old customs

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.970
to basically set it on a path
of a new renewed modernity.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.470
And those who know
even a little bit

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.910
about the cultural
revolution will

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:18.800
know that it was a tremendously
violent, tremendously--

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.320
will know that it was
a tremendously violent,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.160
tremendously disruptive
period in Chinese life

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.520
when many great artworks
and statues and museums

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.920
were smashed up beyond
repair because they were part

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.200
of the old culture, where
people who had education or knew

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.400
about the pre-revolutionary
society of scholars

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.770
or as academics were
paraded in public

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.740
and forced to confess
their crimes or their sins

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.950
because they were not part of
this bright new revolutionary

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.890
culture.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.220
It was an overthrowing
of everything

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.130
that old China had been
in a desperate attempt

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.070
by Mao to try and
cleanse any remnants

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.064
of the old Chinese society.

00:29:00.064 --> 00:29:01.730
And it was inevitable
in that atmosphere

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.410
that one particular figure
would indeed become a victim.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.400
And that was Confucius.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.580
So Confucius having
underpinned Chinese society

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.479
in many ways for 2,500 years
then gets a severe kicking,

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:18.020
intellectually
speaking, through much

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.140
of the 20th century as the
May 4 generation turned

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.660
against him in favor of Mr.
Science and Mr. Democracy.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.200
And by the 1970s in the middle
of Mao's Cultural Revolution,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.040
Confucius is being
condemned as a black hand,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.920
as they put it, a
really kind of appalling

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.940
remnant of the old society
that must be driven out

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.240
to enable China to progress.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.190
And this is a cartoon
book here from 1974,

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.670
which as the caption says, tell
the story of working people's

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.990
struggle against Confucius.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.990
There was even an official
campaign against him.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:56.750
It was actually aimed against
the then just-departed

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.270
recently killed defense
minister Lin Biao.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.810
But it was called the
Campaign to Criticize Lin Biao

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.670
and Criticize Confucius.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.000
So Confucius was being
put in the same breath

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.840
as Lin Biao, a man who happened
to be at that point Mao's worst

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.920
political enemy.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.540
So absolutely the
lowest point you

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.230
might say in the 20th century
for Confucius and his thought.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.320
That was 1974.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.380
Two years later, Mao
Tse-Tung died after 27 years

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.530
at the top of the world's
largest and most populous

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.590
communist state.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.270
And there was a
scuffle for succession.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.030
But the man who
eventually came to power

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.550
was a man who would essentially
dominate Chinese politics

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.110
for the next 20 years,
well into the 1990s.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.590
And his name was Deng Xiaoping.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.370
Deng Xiaoping has
some claim to perhaps

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.740
be the single most
important reformer

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.040
of the Chinese 20th
century, maybe in some ways

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.290
even more than Mao, because
the China we see today,

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.380
the China that is
the second biggest

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.330
economy in the
world, the China that

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.660
has geopolitical influence, is
Deng Xiaoping's China, not Mao

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.300
Tse-Tung's China in many ways.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.720
And that stems from
a variety of things.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.045
But let's pin it down to
one particular decision,

00:31:14.045 --> 00:31:16.420
because I think that's the
one we want to concentrate on.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.850
Deng Xiaoping took the fateful--

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.260
not fatal, but fateful--

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.160
decision that China's
communist economy

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.120
could not sustain the kind of
economic growth and prosperity

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.070
which he wanted China to have.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.010
And so he gave permission
essentially for China

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.370
to liberate its own economy,
to reintroduce markets,

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.484
to begin to shut down
the collective farms

00:31:40.484 --> 00:31:41.900
and the state-owned
factories that

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.320
were an absolute central part
of the Chinese planned economy,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.420
and to begin the very
long and very bumpy

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.030
road which China has by no
means finished traveling

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:55.370
or even now that would make
China an anomaly in that it

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.700
would be the world's
biggest country

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.990
run by a Communist Party,
which was overseeing

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:06.710
a system of almost
unbridled capitalism.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.500
And that particular
paradox is one

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.350
that has shaped the
China we see today.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.010
It's the China that
has created what

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.760
you see in this picture,
which is on the one hand

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.840
the world's fastest growing
economy in historical terms

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.850
between, let's say, about 1980
when China's economy was really

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.790
in global terms
very small, to 2010,

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.500
when you have China becoming
essentially the world's third

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.720
or second biggest economy.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.750
You have at various points
double digit growth year

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.800
after year after year--

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.950
11%, 10%, 12% growth, even--

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.420
during those years.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.310
And it's off the back
of people like this.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.000
Young women, often, working in
factories producing garments,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.060
plastic goods, toys,
you name it, furniture,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.010
that was sold all around
the world at a time

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.090
when the credit boom
in the Western world

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.610
suddenly meant there were
lots of dollars and pounds

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.000
for people to be spending
money on Chinese-made goods.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.490
So that led to this
huge wave of prosperity

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.600
on both sides in
the 1990s and 2000s.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.860
Many prices were paid to
bring that situation about.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.630
China developed what
it still has today--

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.690
a population of 150
to 200 million people

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.387
who have no official rights to
special benefits in the place

00:33:25.387 --> 00:33:27.470
where they work because
they're migrants, internal

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.090
migrants within China.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.380
They're not illegal.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.330
But by moving away from
their place of birth,

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.830
they don't have the right to
healthcare, pensions, education

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.690
and some of the things that
residents in particular cities

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.530
would have.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.990
But the pay is good enough
and important enough to them

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.941
that they move anyway.

00:33:42.941 --> 00:33:44.690
Now that population
is obviously something

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.720
like two to three times the
size of the whole population

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.770
of the UK.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:53.690
It would be a large country's
population in many places.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.190
And yet it's only
a small proportion

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.740
of the total Chinese population.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.210
In addition, China
over those years

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.910
has become much more
economically unequal

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.870
than it was under Mao.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.910
In Mao's day it was poor.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.760
But it was also
relatively equal.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.150
Now China has one of the
highest Gini coefficients--

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.860
the measures of economic
inequality-- of anywhere

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.630
in the world.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.330
Rural pressures
also became greater,

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.197
although China is urbanizing
fast, a few years ago--

00:34:20.197 --> 00:34:22.280
about three or four years
ago-- for the first time

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.199
in its history,
more Chinese people

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.480
lived in cities than
in the countryside.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.260
But that's still the best part
of 650 to 700 million people

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.630
living out in the countryside
with the need for all

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.510
the things that people
living in a modern society

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.500
desire and have a right to--

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.800
healthcare, pensions, welfare.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.600
And providing rural frameworks
for these very expensive

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.150
public goods has
become a real problem

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.239
in terms of the Chinese
Communist Party's

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.960
current policies, because in a
society where governments have

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.880
voted en route, you obviously
have the choice of kicking out

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.280
the government if you don't
like what they're providing.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.030
In China, much of the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.130
is based on its
economic performance.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.390
As long as the growth rate
continues to bubble along,

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.430
as long as people's standards
of living continue to improve,

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.130
which broadly speaking
they have done

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.410
in the last quarter
of a century or so,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.990
there is probably
enough residual goodwill

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.000
within the system
for people not really

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.570
to have that much concern
about the direct mechanisms

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.250
of political control.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.040
But if those economic
benefits go down,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.770
then the future of the system
is clearly much more fragile.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.840
At the same time,
China has started

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.540
to develop many of
the accoutrements

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.640
of modern societies
elsewhere in the world,

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.820
even though it maintains
a very different sort

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.505
of one-party or authoritarian
political system.

00:35:46.505 --> 00:35:48.380
So remember what I was
saying before about it

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.420
being open, but not liberal.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.180
Well, one of the aspects
of openness-- just one--

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.070
was a willingness
to take on board

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.500
the increasingly
internationalized culture

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.490
of pop talent shows.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.360
You may or may not have
followed the classic example

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.920
of this-- the
Supergirl [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.620
competition, which made a
big splash in the mid 2000s

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.199
in China.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:08.990
It was won by a woman
who's become actually

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.420
a quite a big Chinese pop
star in her own right,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.030
called Li Yu-chun, who
sang a version of "Zombie"

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.459
by The Cranberries, if you
want the details of what

00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:17.000
she won with.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.040
But this was a very
interesting exercise,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.690
which wasn't repeated directly.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.640
Because of course,
what they asked people

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.970
to do on this TV station
with all these singers

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.970
was for people to get
on their mobile phones

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.620
and text in which of the
candidates for a Supergirl

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.276
singer they preferred.

00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.650
Now someone in
the Party may well

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.200
have noticed that getting people
from all around the country

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.817
to vote for their
preferred candidate

00:36:41.817 --> 00:36:43.400
might or might not
be a brilliant idea

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.520
to put in people's minds.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.990
So that particular system was
not repeated in later years.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:53.170
But the culture that you
see here of young pop stars,

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.090
rock music, very individualized
style of clothing,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.460
is as far from the
old Confucian norms

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.780
as you could possibly imagine.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.690
And certainly the
individualistic style

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.000
of international
consumerism is very much

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.610
part of Chinese modernity.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.790
We also of course-- and bearing
in mind we're here at Google--

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.900
should point out that China
has a very loud, very lively

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.270
internet culture.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.310
And anyone who says that
political and other kinds

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.340
of social discussion
are repressed in China,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.742
it's certainly accurate.

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.700
There is a much more
restriction of what people

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.850
say in China than in the UK.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.740
But it would be
entirely wrong to think

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.270
that this means
that there is not

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.090
a very lively discussion
about politics and society

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.040
in general still going on.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.410
And the place where it
goes on most strongly

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.690
is on the Chinese net.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.880
It goes on actually also
through [INAUDIBLE], WeChat.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.380
And it goes on through
a whole variety on QQ

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.690
and a whole variety of
different social media formats.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.920
But basically the wired
population of China

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.710
has not only increased
hugely in size,

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.600
more than the US
population by miles--

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.920
500 million and
counting, probably--

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.400
but has also created new
forms of social engagement

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.950
that involve a different
sort of state society

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.300
relationship going on.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.024
Just one example-- it was
slightly more of a thing

00:38:15.024 --> 00:38:15.940
a couple of years ago.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.580
But it's still very
much there, which

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.840
is something called [INAUDIBLE],
the human flesh search, which

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.550
I hasten to add is not some kind
of cannibal zombie Holocaust

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.400
horror.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.239
It is, in fact, a form
of social engagement

00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:30.780
through the internet,
in which people

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.530
put up videos about injustices
that have been created

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.970
or committed by local officials,
and ask for people to basically

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.190
have these taken to
court, or for action

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.260
to be taken against
corrupt officials.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.176
And the central authorities
have been actually

00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:47.490
quite lenient in many
cases about allowing

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:51.760
these complaints to go on
Youku Tudou, the equivalence

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.410
of YouTube on the Chinese
net, because they provide

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.240
a sort of safety
valve for people

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.810
to actually talk about
real issues, real problems

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.149
in their own lives.

00:39:05.149 --> 00:39:07.440
And that's something that
simply couldn't have happened

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.020
in that way without the
Chinese internet being

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.280
as strongly enabled as it is.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.510
And that goes alongside
Alibaba, Alipay,

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:19.380
and the whole variety
of very, very high level

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.840
internet-enabled
finance and commerce

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.290
that has become such a
mainstay of China today.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.240
There are, of course,
though many downsides

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.170
to the development of this kind
of technological modernity.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.180
China's environment
has now become

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.730
acknowledged by the
Chinese government itself

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:42.240
as one of the most
pressing problems

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.760
in terms of China's
modernization.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.380
Yes, it's the second biggest
economy in the world.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.640
But that produces with
it a whole variety

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.560
of problems when it
comes to actually dealing

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.224
with the aftermath
of that technology.

00:39:55.224 --> 00:39:57.390
What I'll say at this point
is that on the one hand,

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.310
China is one of the
world's great polluters.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.370
On the other hand, it also has
put more R&amp;D and investment

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.880
into green energy technologies
than possibly any other country

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.522
on Earth.

00:40:06.522 --> 00:40:07.980
And with recent
news that we've had

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.740
that the Trump
administration in the US

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.690
is cutting its engagement
with green energy issues,

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.880
it may yet be that
China actually ends up

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.830
taking the lead globally
on this question,

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.840
particularly if there's
any attempt by the US

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.560
to go back on the protocols
of the Paris climate change

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.170
accords.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.130
So China's moment
on the environment,

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.610
although, there are too many
scenes that look like that,

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.780
may well be coming.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.370
In addition, we
have a whole variety

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.370
of political changes
in language that

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.300
reflect the contradictions
that still sit very

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.860
much within Chinese society.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.360
The idea that it
wants to modernize,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.985
that it wants to be
open, that it wants

00:40:51.985 --> 00:40:55.940
to have a technological basis,
but also that the party wants

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.050
control.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:58.910
The one-party state
has no intention

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.700
of creating a liberal
multi-party democracy.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.500
The Chinese Communist
Party rules.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.020
And according to the Party, will
continue to rule indefinitely.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.320
So that led under the
previous president--

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.810
you see a picture of
him here, Mr. Hu Jintao,

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.970
along with very young pioneers--

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.010
to an interesting
revival of language.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.830
And the language came very much
from the stable of Confucius.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.560
After half a century
or more of Confucius

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.770
being downgraded or condemned
by Mao as a feudal character,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.460
now we're back in a world
where Confucian language--

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.580
the language of
harmony, of hierarchy,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.580
of solidity, of benevolence--
is brought back by the Chinese

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.440
Communist Party in a big way.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.240
So one favorite
phrase of Mr. Hu--

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.750
[SPEAKING CHINESE]--
the harmonious society,

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.460
a very Confucian-sounding
phrase,

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.200
became a standard part of
the political rhetoric.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.450
A statue of Confucius,
you see one here.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.150
They are now very, very
widespread throughout China.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.540
And certainly if you go to Qufu,
the birthplace of Confucius

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.580
in Shandong Province,
you will see

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.680
plenty of memorabilia,
some of it

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.190
including things like bottles of
Confucius liqueur or Confucius

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.730
chopsticks.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.400
But certainly, the brand
name value of Confucius

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.170
has really bounced
back in a big way.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.850
And this is a big
shrine for those

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.620
who wish to pay respect to him.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.150
All again very much
endorsed by the State.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.900
We have there a picture of
a ceremony on television

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.880
commemorating or
celebrating the birth

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.220
of Confucius more
than 2,000 years ago

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.740
in a sort of TV extravaganza.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.670
And we have here a scene
from a blockbuster movie

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:43.040
on the life of Confucius, which
starred the Hong Kong action

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.040
star Chow Yun-Fat, who went
from one of his earlier films

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.480
called "Hard Boiled" instead to
this idea of perhaps soft power

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.030
with Confucius being
at the center of it.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.860
So very much back
in popular culture.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.720
But let me finish this
thought and perhaps turn

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.700
to a bit of discussion by using
this sort of final example here

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.730
of why the revival
of Confucius both has

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.440
lots of potential in it, but
also causes difficulties.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.976
Because Confucius, I
think, is being put forward

00:43:16.976 --> 00:43:18.600
by the Chinese state,
both domestically

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.200
and internationally, because
he's such a useful symbol.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.340
He symbolizes many things that
are both attractive but also

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.110
useful to the Party.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.510
You know, nobody can be against
the idea of benevolence,

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.120
of good behavior to one
another, of a kind of sense

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.680
that an ordered society is
better than a chaotic society.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.830
On the other hand, a
thinker who puts forth

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.770
the idea of hierarchy
and knowing your place

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.010
is obviously attractive to a
party that still essentially

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.350
rules through an
authoritarian very

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:53.850
bureaucratic and
hierarchical structure.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.790
And he also gets used in
this case when China--

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.680
as is frequently the case--

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.630
becomes angry at
being criticized

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.100
by the outside world.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.590
An example of this came in
2010 when the Nobel Peace Prize

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.560
was given to the Chinese
dissident Liu Xiaobo, who's

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.560
actually in jail in China,
but was given the Nobel Peace

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.650
Prize for his
writings criticizing

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.600
the Chinese government.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.090
And the Chinese authorities
reacted very badly

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:21.067
to this award, which they
saw as an insult to China.

00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:22.650
So they launched
their own alternative

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:23.910
to the Nobel Peace Prize--

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.130
the Confucius
Peace Prize-- which

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.720
I have to say in
the few years since,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.270
has not really taken
off in quite the way

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.810
that they expected.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.980
One of the people awarded
the Confucius Peace Prize

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.690
was that well-known
peace lover Vladimir

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.390
Putin, the president of Russia.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.620
So I have to say the
interpretation is certainly

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.550
a bit wide in that sense.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.354
But the symbolism is,
I think, important.

00:44:45.354 --> 00:44:46.770
Because on the one
hand, launching

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.540
an international
peace prize is I

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.740
think symbolic of China's
increasing desire--

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.700
and I think it's
a sincere desire--

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.370
to be a citizen in world
order, to take part

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.530
in that world order
of Nobel Prizes

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.080
and international society
and the United Nations

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.570
that underpins wider society.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.250
At the same time,
the desire not to be

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.940
told what to do by
the West in particular

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.360
also figures into it.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.150
The idea that if the Nobel
Prize goes to the wrong person,

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.070
then you launch the
Confucius Peace Prize,

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.010
which puts forth an alternative
view of the universe.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.650
And that I think speaks to
where I started up-- the idea

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.950
that China is an
open society, and is

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.940
engaging with the world in a
way that is serious and sincere.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.740
But it's also not
a liberal society.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.860
It's probably the society
in the world today

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.650
that most strongly
puts forward sets

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.370
of values that are
antithetical and in opposition

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.702
to many of the assumptions
of liberal societies

00:45:40.702 --> 00:45:41.410
around the world.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.350
And I say the
world, not the West,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:44.970
because they are
also antithetical

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.890
to the systems in Brazil,
in India, in South Africa,

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.380
in Ghana, in a whole
variety of places

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.710
that have embedded a more
liberal, pluralist model

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.420
of politics.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.940
By way of pointing that out,
I'm not saying this is good.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.310
I'm not saying that it's bad.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.860
I'm pointing out that this
is the reality of what I

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.792
think modern China has become.

00:46:06.792 --> 00:46:08.250
And as we think of
that journey all

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.430
the way from the early 20th
century, the demonstrators

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.690
on May 4 1919 in front
of the Forbidden City,

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.700
and then think of their
sort of successors

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.820
who are the students, the
diplomats, the business

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.610
people who bring
China to the world,

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.710
and who we see when
we go to China,

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.740
I think we need to understand
that that journey about what

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.380
will make China
modern is still very

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.110
much a journey in progress,
and that all of us I hope here

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.970
sitting today may well be part
of it in one way or another.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.050
Thank you all very much.

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.400
