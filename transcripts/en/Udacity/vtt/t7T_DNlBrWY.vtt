00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And of course, the part that is easy to see is that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
this is the shortest possible tour,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so these two here cannot be true.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And also this one here cannot be true

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because, after all, this is an approximation,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it is not guaranteed to give us the optimum solution.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The question now is which one of these two here to choose.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So is it always strictly smaller

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or can it be the same?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the correct answer here is that the length of the shortest tour

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
can actually also be equal to the length of the tour

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
output by the algorithm.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's not guaranteed to be, but it can be.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And this could be the case, for example,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
if the input that we are given

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is already a tree, then the spanning tree

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
will just be the input network itself.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then a shortest tour is indeed a walk along that tree.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So in this case, you would have equality here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So length of the tour that we compute is at least as large

00:00:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as the length of the shortest tour but not always strictly bigger.
