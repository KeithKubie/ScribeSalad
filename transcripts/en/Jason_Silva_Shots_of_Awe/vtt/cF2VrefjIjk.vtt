Good afternoon
everyone, and welcome

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.310
to our session of the
Festival of Dangerous Ideas,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.009
We are the Gods, Now.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.800
I'm Ann Mossop from
the Sydney Opera House.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm one of the curators of the
Festival of Dangerous Ideas,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.940
and it's a great pleasure to
welcome you here this afternoon

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.930
to hear from Jason Silva.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.810
When we were planning
the Festival,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.400
we really wanted to talk about
the future and the impact

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.160
of technology on the future,
and because of our experience

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.390
trying to talk about scientific
topics, pessimistic topics,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.540
difficult topics,
we decided we really

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.840
needed to find
somebody who could talk

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.650
about the future of
technology in a way that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.940
was optimistic and
exciting and that

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.850
was going to get people to
think about these kind of very

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.490
complicated and sometimes
difficult issues

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.090
with a positive undertone
to what they were saying.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.420
And we were
absolutely so excited

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450
when we came across the
work of Jason Silva,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.590
and a few weeks after
we talked to Jason

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.540
and started to arrange
for him to come,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.390
we found out that he
was speaking at TED.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.860
And I was fortunate
enough to see

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.780
him speak there,
introducing a video

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.760
he had made for that
conference, and I thought, yes,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.790
this is something that's going
to be really wonderful to see

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.040
here in the Festival
of Dangerous Ideas.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.560
Jason is someone who's
hard to categorize.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.920
He's not someone
where I can say,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.420
yes, he's the author of
XYZ, and he's a professor

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.400
here and there.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.730
Jason is a philosopher,
a filmmaker, a visionary,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.360
I think.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.560
Someone who, above all,
is a really extraordinary

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.580
communicator about science,
about complexity, and about

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.540
the future.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.690
So I'm delighted that he's here
to talk to us this afternoon.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.780
Please make sure that
your phone are on silent.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.070
Tweet to hashtag
#fodi, which has

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.650
been hacked because
so many of you

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.600
are getting so involved
in the conversation

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.836
that it became a magnet
to a lot of people trying

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.210
to get you to buy
something else.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.100
But we're fixing that,
and Twitter is still

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800
going through, so
don't hold back.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.130
Jason is going to talk to us for
about half an hour, 30 minutes,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.276
40 minutes, and then
there'll be plenty

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:15.150
of time for questions
and discussion from you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.590
because I think this is
something where you will

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.220
get a lot of provocative ideas.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.164
So the opportunity to have a
conversation with Jason today

00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:25.580
is going to be one of the great
pleasures of this session.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.670
So please join me in
welcoming to Jason Silva.

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:36.220
Wow.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.100
Hi, everybody.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.470
How you guys doing?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470
Hope you guys are doing great.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.039
We are the gods, now.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.580
What a topic.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.270
Huh?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.360
And I suppose, for me, the
big inspiration behind this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.800
came after I read Ernest
Becker's book, Pulitzer

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.250
Prize winning book, the
Denial of Death, 1974.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.840
Pop culture reference
for that books,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.200
it's the book that Woody Allen
gives Annie Hall in the movie

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.250
Annie Hall, and
he says, look, you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.330
need to read this so
you can understand

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.520
where I'm coming from.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.240
And basically the
Denial of Death

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.500
said that the human
condition is characterized,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.390
characterized uniquely, by our
awareness of our mortality.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.490
In other words, we're
the only species

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.850
that is aware that
we are mortal beings,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.750
and this causes a tremendous
amount of anxiety.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.780
We would go mad if
we hadn't come up

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.010
with solutions to
the death problem.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.340
And throughout
history, Ernest Becker

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
identifies three main solutions
to the problem of death.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.981
The first one was the
religious solution

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:35.980
to the problem of death.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.300
You create a narrative in which
your soul will live forever

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.960
in the kingdom of God, and it
gets rid of the death issue

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.630
because everything will be
taken care of in the end.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.070
Now, as technology has
increasingly-- science

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.810
and technology increasingly made
religion sort of more difficult

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.600
to believe, we've had to
come up with other solutions

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.570
to the death problem.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.340
The second main solution
to the problem of death

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.620
that Ernest Becker identifies
is the romantic solution.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.240
You turn your
lovers into deities.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
She's like the wind.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.460
She's my salvation.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.080
It's the lyric to
every pop song.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.830
She is the sun.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.390
But of course, no
relationship can ultimately

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.270
bear the burden of Godhood.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.050
Eventually, your gods
reveal their clay feet,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.940
and all of a sudden, we
can't be saved by our lovers

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.470
and the anxiety about our
mortal coil kicks in again.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.040
Ernest Becker says we
are gods with anuses.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.470
We have this capacity
to ponder the infinite.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.220
We're seemingly
capable of anything.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.880
We can mainline
the whole of time

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.350
through the optic nerve with
our astronomy and with our space

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.940
telescopes, and yet we're
housed in these heart-pumping,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.820
breath-gasping, decaying bodies.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.190
So to be godly, yet creaturely,
is just impossibly cruel.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.360
The last solution to
the problem of death

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.520
that Ernest Becker identifies,
he calls the creative solution,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.230
and I think this is, perhaps,
the most interesting one

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.180
for a variety of reasons.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.190
Of course, symbolically,
to create a solution

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.820
allows us to create
great works of art,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.430
to create work that
will outlive us

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.900
and that will
outlast us to leave

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.879
a sort of symbolic immortality
and legacy of that sort.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.170
But also the creative solution
to the problem of death,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.711
I think, is the
engineering solution.

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:18.250
It's the way through
which we remake the world.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.080
It's the way in which we
transcend our limitations using

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.780
science and technology, and
this gets me really excited

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.280
because this is, ultimately,
how I see technology.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.000
Technology is a scaffolding.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.700
Andy Clark, the
cognitive philosopher,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.540
says technology is
our second skin.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.820
Terrence McKenna says it's
the real skin of our species.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.330
Through technology, we
transcend the limitations

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.060
of thought, reach, and vision.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.420
We extend ourselves.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.160
We transcend time,
space, and distance.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.000
Technology is our extended
phenotype, as Dawkins says.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.610
It's really what we are.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.150
Our skyscrapers, our
jet engines, that's us.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.760
Just like the termite colony
is temperature controlled,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.100
and it's a part of the termite
species, so to technology

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.120
is a part of who we are.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.790
Now, as Ann said,
I'm a filmmaker,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.070
and my background is I
worked in television.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.610
I worked for Al Gore's TV
network for a number of years,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.180
and I fell in love with the
power of short form filmmaking.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.010
I felt that with short form,
you could create content

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.070
that could spread,
that could be shared

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.460
in the age of social media.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.860
And when I left
current TV, I decided

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.790
to create a series of short
films, microdocumentaries,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.470
that look at the co-evolution
of humans and technology

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.270
because I feel so in love
with this idea of technology

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.430
as a means to transcend
our boundaries that I felt

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.540
like this was a narrative that
needed to be put out there

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.360
in the world because we live in
this world of doom and gloom.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.510
We live in a media environment
where, if it bleeds, it leads,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.760
and there's a reason for that.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400
My friend Peter
Diamandis, founder

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.007
of the XPRIZE at
Singularity University,

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:53.090
wrote a book called
Abundance, Why the Future will

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.732
be Much Better Than You Think.

00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:56.190
And in the book,
it talks about how

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.200
we have these overactive
amygdalas that we've inherited

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.890
from a time where we used to
live in the savannas of Africa,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.207
and it was biologically
advantageous for us to be

00:07:05.207 --> 00:07:06.790
really nervous all
the time and always

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.570
looking for danger
because it kept

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.966
us alive against the tiger, so
that the tiger wouldn't eat us.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:13.340
And we've inherited
that, but now

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.965
we live in a world
that is increasingly

00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:16.340
safer, increasingly
less violent.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.839
I don't know if you guys know
the work of Steven Pinker, who

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.360
says that the chances
of a man dying

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.410
at the hands of
another man today

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.830
are the lowest
they've ever been,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.850
or the work of Matt
Ridley, who actually shows

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.930
the measurable progress that
we've made using science

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.596
and technology and how the world
has actually never been better,

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:31.850
or the work of Hans
Rosling, who has the website

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.850
gapminder.org that went viral
a couple years ago because it

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.590
showed how every
nation in the world,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.887
by every measurable
indicator, has been rising.

00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.220
Quality of life has been
rising over the last 200 years,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.850
but we don't notice
this because we

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.725
have these overactive
amygdalas that are just

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:47.240
looking for danger, and our
increasingly wired world

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.140
is more than happy to
showcase all the danger,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.540
even though it's less than
there's ever been before.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.450
Anyway, promise to go slow.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.990
So I decided that
there was room,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.190
there was room to start a
new conversation about how

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.340
we see ourselves and
how we see technology,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.580
and I felt that online video
had become ubiquitous enough

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.570
that we could actually
create content that

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.510
was short form,
that was infectious,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.040
and that people
could then spread.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.030
And so I started
to do this, and I

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.710
created a project,
a series of shorts.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.070
I called them Shots of
Philosophical Espresso,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.750
and the point of the
content is to pull you out

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.670
of context in such
a dramatic manner

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.850
in order to force you
to gawk in amazement

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.670
at the ubiquitous
everyday wonders

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.169
that we seem to be culturally
disposed to ignore.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.070
OK, so what I'd like
to do today is actually

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.330
want to walk you through a
series of these short films

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.900
which will, hopefully,
convince you

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.190
that we are on our
way to becoming gods.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.190
The first film I want
to show you is actually

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.270
on ode to the power of
ideas, and let's play it,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.486
and then we'll talk a
little bit about the themes.

00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:58.345
You know, I love this
idea of radical openess,

00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:00.040
the free exchange
of information,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.110
the free flow of ideas,
creating spaces in which ideas

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.850
can has sex as Matt
Ridley talks about.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.050
And this is huge because it
turns out that ideas are just

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.375
as real as the
neurons they inhabit,

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:13.200
as James Gleick tell us.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.760
A new kingdom rises
above the biosphere.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.940
Denizens of this
kingdom are ideas

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.900
because ideas have retained some
of the properties of organisms,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.640
it turns out.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.350
They leap from brain to brain.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.860
They compete for the limited
resources of our attention.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.270
They have infectivity.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.770
They have spreading power.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.630
They are what Richard Dawkins
calls the new replicators, born

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.800
from the primordial
soup of human culture.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.825
Their vector of
transmission is language

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.780
and electronic communication.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.060
And though ideas are not
made of nucleic acid,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.730
they have achieved more
evolutionary change

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.960
and at a rate that leaves the
old gene panting far behind.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.690
You know, Ray Kurzweil
says our ability

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.230
to create virtual
models in our heads

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.040
combined with our modest looking
thumbs was sufficient to usher

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.226
in a secondary force of
evolution called technology,

00:09:58.226 --> 00:10:01.730
and it will continue until
the entire universe is

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.140
at our fingertips.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.330
This is unbelievable stuff.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.220
It speaks to the telescopic
nature of evolutionary change,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.710
more change in
the last 100 years

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.314
than in the last billion years.

00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:13.355
Terrance McKenna actually
wrote, "From the moment

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:15.440
that human beings
invented language,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.420
biological evolution
essentially ceased,

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.470
and evolution became a cultural
epigenetic phenomenon."

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.190
Now, we take in matter
of low organization,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.740
we put it through
our mental filters,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.380
and we extrude it in the form
of space shuttles and iPhones.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.460
The Imaginary
Foundation tells us

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.410
that what imagination
does is it allows

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.580
us to conceive of delightful
future possibilities,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.780
pick the most amazing one,
and pull the present over

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.930
to meet it.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.819
Imagine how
impoverished this world

00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:41.360
would have been if
we hadn't invented

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.830
the technology of the oil
painting in time for Van Gogh,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.955
or the technology of the
musical instrument in time

00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:49.279
for Beethoven and Mozart
to unfurl through it.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.820
With the revolutions
in biotechnology

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.300
and nanotechnology, the
free exchange of information

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.960
is allowing us to conceive
of radical new things.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.730
Freeman Dyson says,
"In the future,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.855
a new generation of artists
will be writing genomes

00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:03.695
with the fluency that Blake
and Byron wrote versus." "What

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:05.070
is great in man,"
said Nietzsche,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.720
"is that he is a
bridge, and not an end."

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.380
You know, we're on
a trajectory smack

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.940
in the middle between born and
the made, wrote Kevin Kelly.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.620
And so radical
openess, it's huge.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.020
It's a universe of possibility.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.010
It's gray infused by color.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.660
It's the invisible, revealed.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.130
It's the mundane,
blown away by awe.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.060
We need to cultivate
radical openess

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.950
as a way of participating
and accelerating evolution.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.450
Wow.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.815
Wow, indeed.

00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:36.805
Thank you.

00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:38.480
Was that loud enough?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.520
Yeah?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.734
People often ask me
why video, why art.

00:11:44.734 --> 00:11:46.650
At the end of the day,
I'm not a technologist.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.441
I'm not a scientist
even though the message

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.630
I'm putting out there
is that, increasingly,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.550
a small group of
passionate people,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.367
a small group of
passionate technologists,

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:56.450
can do what only huge
corporations and governments

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.530
could do mere decades
ago, and this is happening

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.950
on the back of
these exponentially

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.195
growing technologies.

00:12:01.195 --> 00:12:02.820
And I'm going to get
into that, but I'd

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.486
like to share with you a line by
Marshall McLuhan, which I think

00:12:05.486 --> 00:12:08.455
really sums up why I use
short form video to kind

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:10.560
of infect people with awe.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.640
And he says, "It's
always been the artist

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.460
who perceives the alterations in
man caused by a new medium, who

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.480
recognizes that the
future is the present,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.809
and who uses his work to
prepare the grounds for it."

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.100
Now, one of the things that
video obviously talks about

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.974
is the power of ideas
to transform the world.

00:12:27.974 --> 00:12:30.590
You heard me say that
even though ideas, even

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.940
though memes, are not
made of nucleic acid,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.970
they still have achieved
more evolutionary change,

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.410
more change than biological
evolution ever did.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.363
And in order to
understand this, you

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:43.363
have to understand that
this change is happening

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.400
on the back of these
exponentially emerging

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.180
technologies.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.100
Now, exponential growth is
counter intuitive to the way

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.030
our brains perceive the world.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.040
See, our brains
evolved in a world that

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.897
was linear and local,
but we now live

00:12:57.897 --> 00:12:59.730
in the world that is
global and exponential.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.470
Essentially, we have
obsolete brains.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.960
Our brains cannot make sense
of this rate of change,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.250
so we really need to
educate each other.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.580
My friend Ray Kerzweil,
who's a world famous futurist

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.080
and has an amazing track
record of predicting

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.754
these exponential changes,
he uses a famous example.

00:13:14.754 --> 00:13:16.670
It's really simple, but
I think it's important

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.910
that people take it in in
order to understand what

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.050
makes this kind of
radical change possible.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.940
And he says take 30 steps.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.640
If you take 30
steps linearly, you

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.080
go one, two, three, four, five.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.750
30 steps later, you get to 30.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.730
That's pretty simple.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.880
That's how our brains make
extrapolations about distance

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.050
and about what's coming
and about the future.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.300
Now, if you take
those same 30 steps,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.730
but you take them
exponentially, you

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.280
would go two, four, eight, 16.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.930
30 steps later, you'd
be at a billion.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.755
That's the difference
between linear growth

00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:55.280
versus exponential growth.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.860
30 steps, one to 30.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.760
30 steps, one to a billion.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.110
And that accounts for the
reason that the cell phone

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.370
in one's pocket today,
the average smartphone

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.010
is a million times cheaper,
a million times smaller,

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.900
and 1,000 times more
powerful than a supercomputer

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.590
that was $60 million bucks,
half a building in size

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.350
40 years ago.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.570
So what used to be
half a building now

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.960
fits in your pocket.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.890
So the tools to change the
world are in everybody's hands.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.680
The supercomputers of yesteryear
are in everybody's hands.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.940
A young person with a
cell phone in Africa

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.590
today has better communications
technology than the US

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.010
president had 25 years ago.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.260
This is also out of Peter
Diamandis book Abundance.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.820
So consider what that means.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.670
So it used to be
half a building.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.310
Now, it fits in your pocket.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.420
In 25 years, it'll be
the size of a blood cell.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.630
It'll be reverse
engineering us from inside.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.360
Computers trillions of times
more powerful than the ones

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.750
we have today will be
inside of our bodies.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.240
You talk about the co-evolution
of humans and technology,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.720
people think technologies this
separate artificial thing.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.380
It's in symbiosis.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.640
It's a who and what we are.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.800
It's a part of who
and what we are,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.210
and eventually, we're
going to close the loop

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.560
because the technologies
going to go inside of us.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.960
I'm very excited about
the three overlapping

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.210
revolutions we're seeing.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.120
Obviously,
information technology

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.390
piggybacking on Moore's
law, the computers

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.540
get faster every two
years, twice as powerful,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.120
half the size, et cetera, et
cetera, they're shrinking.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.580
Then we also have
biotechnology, and biotechnology

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.070
means mastering the information
processes of biology,

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.910
understanding that our
biology is software,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.780
and that software
can be upgraded.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.636
Just like we upgrade
our iOS on our iPhone,

00:15:39.636 --> 00:15:41.010
we're going to be
able to upgrade

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.110
our biological software.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.200
The famed futuristic
Juan Enriquez

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.700
says you know why this
gets really exciting?

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.840
Because when you can master
the information processes

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.380
of biology, you
have software that

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.070
can write its own hardware.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.040
Computers could never do
that, but biology can.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.330
We have the world's
first artificial organism

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.540
created a few years
ago by Craig Venter.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.070
Man creates life.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.800
Man becomes God.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.410
Alan Harrington wrote a book
called the Immortalist, where

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.080
he says, "Death has become an
imposition on the human race

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.650
and is no longer acceptable,
and any philosophy that accepts

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.250
death must itself
be considered dead,

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.060
it's questions meaningless,
it's consolations worn out."

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.430
Perhaps these technologies
are our rehearsal.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.260
Perhaps by reverse
engineering life,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.090
we have decommissioned
natural selection,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.070
as Edward O. Wilson
says, and now we

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.610
get to look deep
within ourselves

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.590
and decide what
we wish to become.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.950
Evolution has woken up.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.670
Evolution has evolved
its own evolvability.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.750
As Kevin Kelly said in that
video, "We're on a trajectory

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.400
smack in the middle between
the born and the made."

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.565
Man is a bridge, and not an end.

00:16:53.565 --> 00:16:54.940
The other revolution
we're seeing

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.170
is in artificial intelligence.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.390
We create non-biological
intelligence,

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.210
sentience that is not limited
by the inherent limitations

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.660
of biology, digital minds that
can be endlessly upgraded.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.754
People worry about it.

00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:10.170
They think the
Terminator scenario

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.753
because they're like, oh, those
things are going to take over,

00:17:12.753 --> 00:17:14.970
but those things are us.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.510
They're us.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.369
The cognitive
philosopher Andy Clark

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.190
says we need to get over
our skin bag bias, which

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.670
is this assumption that only
what is within our tissue that

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.440
is natural, and that what we
create is somehow unnatural,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.640
but that's not true.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.040
Technology is an outgrowth
of the human mind.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.480
Technology is imagination
made manifest.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.570
Technology's psychedelic.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.045
The word psychedelic
means mind manifesting.

00:17:42.045 --> 00:17:43.600
Terrance McKenna
says we live inside

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.480
of condensations of our
imagination, and we really do.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.990
Somebody dreamed of flight.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.470
Now, we fly in aircrafts
all over the world

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.930
with our smartphones, devices
made of plastic and metal.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.390
We punch a few buttons,
and we send our thoughts

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.730
through time and space,
transcending time, space,

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.690
distance.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.334
We're gods.

00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:05.000
Another thing that's
often talked about,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.541
and this next video
I'm going to you,

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.040
is this idea of mind over
matter because, obviously, this

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.670
is used in New Age
bumper stickers.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.003
Oh, mind over matter, our
thoughts can change the world.

00:18:13.003 --> 00:18:15.310
But I'm interested in
more concrete examples

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.951
of how imagination can
transform the world.

00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:20.450
And I love the
writer David Deutsch.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:21.950
His book, the
Beginning of Infinity,

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.390
really turned me on because
he's just totally out there

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.130
with his examples
of mind over matter.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.260
So I decided to
create a video that

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.800
is demonstrative of just how
our thoughts can spill over,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.270
terraform and transform
the planet and, maybe,

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.670
the universe.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.815
Next video, please.

00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:45.210
Two, one, zero.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.505
I am very much an optimist.

00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:56.205
I'm reminded of Rich Doyle's
line from Darwin's Pharmacy.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:59.520
He says, "Dreams do
not lack reality."

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.440
They are real patterns
of information.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.570
The Imaginary Foundation
says that the role

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.260
of human imagination
is to conceive

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.560
of all these delightful
futures, choose

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.550
the most amazing and exciting
and ecstatic possibility,

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.750
and then pull the present
forward to meet it.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.995
That is what we do.

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:18.686
We bring our imaginings
into existence.

00:19:18.686 --> 00:19:21.648
But I think that as
technology has advanced,

00:19:21.648 --> 00:19:24.800
we found ways to outsource
our mental capacities

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.905
to our tools so much more.

00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:28.845
Our ability to manipulate
the physical world

00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:30.470
has increased in an
exponential fashion

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.540
so we've been able to shrink the
lag time between our imaginings

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.460
and their instantiation
in the real world.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.450
David Deutsch speaks,
in his new book,

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.700
the Beginning of Infinity.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.123
He says if you look
at the topography

00:19:43.123 --> 00:19:45.590
of the island of
Manhattan today,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.140
that topography is a
topography in which

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.430
the forces of economics and
culture and human intent

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.930
have trumped the
forces of geology.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.930
I mean, the topography
of Manhattan

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.930
today is no longer
shaped by mere geology.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.595
It's shaped by the human
mind and by economics

00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:05.960
and by culture.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.767
So what David Deutsch
extrapolates is that,

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:11.100
ultimately, that will be the
fate of the whole universe.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.420
He says gravitation and
antimatter might only

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.500
shape the universe at
its earliest and least

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.410
interesting stages.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.200
But eventually, the
whole entire thing

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.782
will be subject to the intent
of substate-independent,

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:29.830
infinitely more powerful minds,
and to conceive of that, just--

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.940
it makes me feel ecstatic.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.055
That's true.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.280
Thank you, thank you.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.080
I do feel ecstatic
when I contemplate

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.940
these possibilities.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.275
Just reveling in those
possibilities gets me off.

00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:51.745
I have a mindgasm, literally.

00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:53.870
And I started to create
these videos, a part of me,

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.250
is just because I'm
a control freak.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.340
I'm profoundly haunted by
the impermanence of life

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.710
and by the impermanence
of inspiration.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.650
Inspiration is a profoundly
fleeting and profoundly lonely

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.310
experience, and I think
the goal of any artist,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.580
whether it be in paint
or in song or in cinema,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.080
is an attempt to put
people in one's head,

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.740
to invite us to smash
our sense of separateness

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.900
and to say this is how
the dots connected inside

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.940
of my consciousness.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.610
I hope that I can
communicate that to you,

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.660
and I hope that you
can understand that.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.120
I'd like to share with you a
quote by Alain de Botton, one

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.850
of my favorite
philosophers out of the UK.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.420
And he says-- and this has
to do with the power of art

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.690
to communicate, to make
people feel something

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.805
as compared to, let's
say, journalism.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:55.430
So he says, "The artist is
willing to sacrifice a naive

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.470
realism in order to achieve
realism of a deeper source,

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.690
like a poet who, though less
factual than a journalist

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.110
in describing an event, may
nevertheless reveal truths

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.840
about it that find no place
in the other's literal grip."

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.780
I'm trying to get into
the implications of what's

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.980
happening on the back of
these exponential emerging

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.590
technologies.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.280
When we reverse
engineer life itself,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.940
when biology becomes
the new canvas

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.850
for our aesthetic design,
what new forms of genius

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.940
might come out of that?

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.110
As Kevin Kelly said
in my first video,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.730
how impoverished
would this world

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.525
have been were not for the
invention, or the technology,

00:22:36.525 --> 00:22:40.050
of the oil painting, allowing
Van Gogh to unfurl through it?

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.180
What new genius will come out
with inventions we cannot even

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.600
conceive of yet?

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.820
When people worry about
disruptive technologies,

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.790
they worry about their jobs.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.440
Half the jobs that
exist today didn't

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.950
exist 50 years ago
or 100 years ago.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.200
Most of jobs that are going
to exist 20 years from now

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.760
don't exist today.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.790
What new forms of
artistry, what new forms

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.620
of human expression, what new
occupations and vocations will

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.570
emerge out of these tools
in our ongoing co-evolution

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.310
with these tools?

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.980
And what I love about using
cinema to convey these ideas

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.480
was probably described
best by Gene Youngblood

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.910
in his book, Expanded Cinema.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.630
He said that cinema,
like life itself,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.460
is a process of
becoming, a part of man's

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.790
ongoing historical drive to
manifest his consciousness

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.385
outside of his mind
in front of his eyes.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.170
Now, something perhaps
a little more practical

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.090
that we talk about on the
back of these technologies

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.374
is the issue of Big Data
and privacy and companies

00:23:45.374 --> 00:23:47.040
and corporations and
governments knowing

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.664
more and more of our
behavior and being

00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:50.430
able to take everything
we do and turn it

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.555
into an algorithm that can
maybe predict what we'll

00:23:52.555 --> 00:23:54.760
want before we know we want it.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.040
And I was quoted
yesterday in a panel

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.330
that I think things like
targeted advertisement

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.900
are just engineered serendipity.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.090
It doesn't actually concern me.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.490
I'm more about the idea
of radical openness,

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.130
and when I think of
Big Data, I actually

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.480
get excited by the new
forms of self-insight

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.930
that might emerge from that.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.060
I read recently an article
that said that apparently,

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.670
when forager ants hunt for
food, the patterns of how they

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.720
do that mirror the TCP/IP
protocols that control

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.170
information flow
on the internet.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.670
What?

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.140
I went to an exhibit at the MoMA
in New York called Talk to Me,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.330
where they showed me this
graphic animation that

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.330
showed the world, and
there was these things

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.750
that looked like weather
patterns flowing out of it.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.374
And they were like,
no, that's actually

00:24:43.374 --> 00:24:46.155
the diaspora of people
leaving conflict zones.

00:24:46.155 --> 00:24:48.130
It looked like weather patterns.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.960
I think what we're finding is
that the more we can measure

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.322
in the internet of things,
walking around with computers

00:24:53.322 --> 00:24:55.280
in our pockets that are
measuring what we like,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.738
what we buy, where we go, what
we search for, et cetera, et

00:24:57.738 --> 00:25:00.000
cetera, et cetera, when
mapped out, when we get

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.850
the long view, when we get the
big picture, what we're seeing

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.330
is these patterns keep recurring
from the nano to the galactic,

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.000
from the organic
to the man made.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.830
And we're realizing it's
all part of a continuum,

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.630
and all of it is
nature unfolding.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.450
It's complexity unfolding.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.770
It's just unfolding in different
scales and in different rounds,

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:21.860
but we are of nature.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.210
We feel like autonomous free
agents, going around our lives,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.990
but then the patterns that
work in the organic world

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.590
work in the man made world.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.612
You know, I heard
Steven Johnson,

00:25:32.612 --> 00:25:34.570
who wrote his book, Where
Good Ideas Come From,

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.830
A Natural History
of Innovation-- he

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.320
has a lot of great examples
of how he calls the coral

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.340
reef the city of the
sea because it turns out

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.800
that the patterns of biological
innovation in the coral

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.450
reef that make it
the most biologically

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.480
diverse environment
in the ocean mirror

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.510
the patterns of
innovation of cities,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.644
which are where the
most memes are created.

00:25:53.644 --> 00:25:55.560
Has to do with the
diversity and the collision

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.170
of ideas and the
amount of idea sex

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.697
that's happening in cities
as comparable to coral reefs.

00:26:00.697 --> 00:26:01.780
So what does this tell us?

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.380
If we want to
innovate more, we need

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.829
to create these spaces in
which ideas can have sex.

00:26:05.829 --> 00:26:07.870
We need to promote this
free flow of information.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.850
We need to promote
transparency so that we contain

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.227
more and more self-insight
into how we work.

00:26:13.227 --> 00:26:15.060
And so I decided to
make a video about this.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.760
This is my homage to Big
Data, and I call it--

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.450
I was inspired by Isaiah
Berlin's quote, "To understand

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.629
is to perceive patterns."

00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:26.670
So let's roll that video.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.354
To understand is to
perceive patterns.

00:26:39.354 --> 00:26:40.770
Now, of course,
what this means is

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.520
that true comprehension comes
when the dots are revealed,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.570
and you get to Steven
Johnson's long view,

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.870
and you see the big picture.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.210
This is an idea about
patterns, patterns, patterns,

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.500
recurring patterns across
different scales of reality.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.080
You know, Paul Stamets talks
about the mycelial architype

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.706
and how the information
sharing systems

00:26:55.706 --> 00:26:57.330
that comprise the
internet look exactly

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.620
like computer models of dark
matter in the university,

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.505
look exactly like the
neurons in the brain.

00:27:01.505 --> 00:27:03.911
They all share the same
intertwingled, filamental

00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:04.410
structure.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.130
It's the rise of networkism
as Big Data advocates

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.230
talk about how man made
systems are looking exactly

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.314
like natural systems, and
the more we can measure,

00:27:13.314 --> 00:27:14.396
the more we can visualize.

00:27:14.396 --> 00:27:15.990
The more we can
visualize, the more it

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.490
expands our consciousness by
seeing these recurring patterns

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.800
across scales of
reality blows my mind,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.900
and I think that
technology, increasingly,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.070
is becoming an expander
of human consciousness,

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.870
and extends our thought,
reach, and vision

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.030
and revealing so much more.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.574
It's like whereas once I
was blind, now I can see.

00:27:31.574 --> 00:27:33.240
Jeffery West from the
Santa Fe Institute

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.290
is telling us that cities
are really like organisms.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.330
Alleys are like capillaries.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.580
How is it possible
that a man made,

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.580
artificial,
technological system is

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.920
behaving like a natural system?

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.545
The more efficient
it becomes, the more

00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:46.961
it's starting to
look like nature.

00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:49.910
Really interesting, weird stuff.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.075
But it makes me optimistic.

00:27:51.075 --> 00:27:52.580
It's like what
Steven Johnson says.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.770
Look, if we can understand
all the stuff, I mean,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.040
anything becomes possible.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.710
It's the adjacent
possible standing

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.860
as a sort of shadow
future, a map of all

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.600
the ways the present
can reinvent itself.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.560
It's beautiful stuff.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.595
It is beautiful stuff.

00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:10.965
Thank you so much, guys.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.910
I love Steven Johnson.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.680
His new book Future Perfect
talks about pure progressives

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.312
and the power of peer
networks to solve

00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:21.770
problems, which I
think is amazing.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.460
But that last line about
the adjacent possible,

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.190
I think that's a great takeaway
message for us to constantly

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.920
probe, our adjacent possible.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.400
I mean, don't you
love that, the idea

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.370
that we shouldn't look
upon the world as it is?

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.340
We should look upon
the world and see

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.220
what it could turn into.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.680
Its this shadow future.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.580
We should draw the
maps of all the ways

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.960
in which the present
can reinvent itself.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.350
Now, those videos, when
I started doing them,

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.640
they were a
noncommercial experiment.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.760
I created a name.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.834
I created an art form.

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.750
I called them Shots of
Philosophical Espresso.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.170
Really, it was just an excuse
to communicate ideas the way

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.850
that I enjoyed
communicating them,

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.230
which is like with this ecstatic
excitement, this attempt

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:13.730
to immortalize and hold in
stasis inspiration itself.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.536
I think it's very
indicative of this idea

00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:17.410
that we should not go
quietly into the night,

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.131
but we should rage, rage
against dying of the light.

00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:22.130
If the purpose of the
human machine civilization

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.180
is to transcend all previous
limits and turn into gods,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.390
or as Stewart Brand
says we are as gods

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.075
and might as well
get good it, then I

00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:32.710
was going to start
by not letting

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.410
those fleeting, exquisite
moments of inspiration

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.880
go to waste, but
rather I was going

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.830
to immortalize them, which is
what I love to do, and then

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.680
share them with people
all around the world.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.245
And they've been seen
over a million times now,

00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:47.870
and I think it's
indicative that people

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.200
are hungry for this kind of
like high level discourse,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.930
but they want it
to be compressed.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.890
They say, I don't feel entitled
to ask people for their time

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.050
because I know that
we're saturated in, media

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.840
and we have what's called
cognitive bandwidth anxiety.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.840
We just can't process all
the information that's

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.110
coming at us, so that's really
the inspiration for this.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.026
But fundamentally, at
the end of the day, what

00:30:06.026 --> 00:30:09.140
I want to communicate to
you guys is a sense of awe

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.500
and a sense of wonder.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.690
One of my heroes,
Carl Sagan, was

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.354
exceptionally good
at doing this.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.020
Timothy Leary, Bucky
Fuller used to call

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.639
themselves performing
philosophers.

00:30:17.639 --> 00:30:19.430
They'd take these
intergalactic sized ideas

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.305
and then use the power
of media communication

00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:23.230
to spread those
ideas, to turn them

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.630
into self-replicating memes
that can go out into the world.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.730
And this idea of awe as a
kind of reassuring quality,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.560
an ability to contemplate
our own existence

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.800
and marvel at ourselves,
as Sophocles says,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.010
manifold the wonders, nothing
towers more wondrous than man.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.350
It's about creating
narratives that are positive.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.030
It's about awakening
the mind's attention

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.580
from the lethargy of custom
and the film of familiarity

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.310
and redirecting it, instead,
to the wonders of existence

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:53.580
because there are an
unending amount of wonders.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.020
And so I got really
turned on when

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.670
I saw this study out
of Stanford that says,

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.230
guess what, blowing our
minds on a regular basis

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.370
is actually
psychologically beneficial.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.590
Every time we push our
perceptual boundaries

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:09.740
beyond their limits, we are
reborn and refreshed and reset,

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.820
and it leaves us with
profound benefits.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.220
So I thought that's cool
because if my videos are

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.110
noncommercial shots of espresso
to inspire people with awe,

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.750
and now awe is
actually good for us,

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.420
why not make a video that
informs you with a bit of awe

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.210
while telling you what
awe is and why it matters.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.280
So for my last video, which is
called the Biological Advantage

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:37.630
of Being Awestruck, I am hopeful
that it gives you the chills.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.710
And you'll notice I
speak a lot slower in it

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.640
because it's a more
contemplative piece.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:51.990
I hope that it elicits a
sense of just cosmic wow.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.890
Watch the next video.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.910
Eminent psychologist
Nicholas Humphrey

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:12.415
has written of the biological
advantage of being awestruck.

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:14.850
"How fortuitous," he
says, "for a species

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.800
to find its own
ability to contemplate,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.170
to marvel at its
own existence, has

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.760
been evolutionarily
advantageous."

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.100
In other words, it has
been biologically selected

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.100
for because it informs
out life with a sense

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.630
of cosmic significance
that makes us work harder

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.690
to persist and to survive.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.650
In other words, awe
has helped us survive.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.970
And you know, a recent
study out of Standford

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.290
on the subject of awe kind
of validates this idea.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.430
They have found that
regular incidences of awe

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.910
leave residual benefits upon
the individual that persist,

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.122
such as increased feelings
of empathy and compassion

00:32:48.122 --> 00:32:50.487
towards others, increased
feelings of altruism,

00:32:50.487 --> 00:32:53.330
and increased feelings
of general well-being.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.190
In this study, they defined
awe as an experience

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:03.356
of such perceptional expansion,
such perceptional vastness,

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:06.690
that you literally have
to reconfigure, upgrade,

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.445
your mental schemata
just to accommodate, just

00:33:10.445 --> 00:33:13.415
to take in the scale
of the experience.

00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:14.405
This is amazing.

00:33:14.405 --> 00:33:16.000
We've all felt this before.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.360
The first time we stared
upon the Grand Canyon

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.510
or succumbed to the immersive
power of an Imax film.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.880
But perhaps the most
exquisite account

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.775
of the experience of
awe was articulated

00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:27.940
by the brilliant
Ross Anderson when

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.180
writing about the
Hubble space telescope.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.120
Pay attention.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.420
He says that the Hubble
has given us nothing less

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:44.824
than an ontological awakening,
a forceful reckoning of what is,

00:33:44.824 --> 00:33:50.430
allowing us to contemplate
space and time on a scale just

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.230
shy of infinite.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.122
Wild.

00:33:54.122 --> 00:33:58.610
He says gazing upon the famous
deep field photograph literally

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:03.581
allows us to mainline
the whole of time

00:34:03.581 --> 00:34:05.054
through the optic nerve.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.437
To fit something so impossibly
large through something

00:34:11.437 --> 00:34:16.350
so impossibly small
is incredible.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.540
He says through the
sheer aesthetic force

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.068
of its discoveries, the Hubble
distills the impossibly complex

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:30.246
abstractions of astrophysics
into these singular expressions

00:34:30.246 --> 00:34:35.669
of color and light, vindicating
Keith's famous couplet,

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:46.540
"Beauty is truth,
and truth, beauty."

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.250
Thank you.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.550
Thank you.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.389
That's cool.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:59.410
You know, even now,
this idea, this notion

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.470
that an instrument of
man, a cosmic optic nerve

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.440
floating in space can
distill the abstractions

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.810
of astrophysics into expressions
of color and light-- I mean,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.530
it just spoke so vividly to me.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.280
I'd like to share with you
one more quote about just

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.300
think of the telescope as a
metaphor for what technology

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.320
does as an instrument
of mind expansion.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.950
"In it's time," and this
is by Ross Anderson.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:32.030
"In it's time, the telescope
has transformed the night sky

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.180
from a decorated ceiling, a
fixed sphere of glittering

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.960
stick figure gods, into
a universe whose reaches

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.730
carry the seeds of this
earth and new earths still."

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.640
And I'd like to leave
you with one more

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.685
line that puts me in total awe.

00:35:49.685 --> 00:35:51.899
It's from a website
called Next Nature that

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.565
has been kind enough
to feature my work.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.004
They say that
design, and this is

00:35:59.004 --> 00:36:01.420
what's important for artists,
really, to pay attention to.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.560
"Design is about to
undergo a paradigm shift.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.580
Today, design starts at
the level of the atom.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.650
We are drifting into the
world of the invisible.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.400
Virtual realities, nano,
and biotechnologies

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.480
are increasingly
influencing our aesthetics

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.050
and providing new construction
kits for our reality."

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.780
And I think the big takeaway
here can be echoed by, again,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.690
the brilliant Alan
Harrington, who's out of print

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.460
to work The Immortalist,
I recommend to everyone.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.495
Gore Vidal called it the
greatest book ever written.

00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:36.930
And he says, "We
must never forget

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.330
we are cosmic
revolutionaries, not

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.250
stooges conscripted to
advance a natural order that

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.537
kills everyone."

00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:46.370
Thank you very much.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.970
Thanks.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.820
Thank you.
