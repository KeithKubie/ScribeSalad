00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.999
Good morning.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.999
I'm Maura Marx, the director of the Secretariat at Harvard.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.999
Before we continue we have an announcement to make this morning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400
This one is about interoperability which we have heard a lot about this one

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.999
It is about the potential of DPLA  to be a player in a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.999
truly global information infrastructure.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.999
First, thanks to [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.999
Now we ask Jill Cousins ,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.999
director of Europeana foundation.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.999
I make this announcement on behalf of Europeana and DPLA.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.999
I feel very privileged to be hereat the launch of DPLA.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.999
It is a wonderful addition

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.999
and with the energy that all of you have,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.999
and you are putting into it, it will happen.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.400
At Europeana  we have done some of the things that you are starting.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.999
You are very welcome to use all of that as you help us

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.999
move forward. It will help those of us -- both of us.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.999
I would like DPLA not to reinvent  the wheel but the car

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.999
to move forward. Gaining traction and speed.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.999
Earning from our mistakes. And make something bigger and better.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.999
For all of us to share. We already share a common goal.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.999
To make the riches of libraries, museums, archives

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.999
and audiovisual collections available,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.999
free of charge to everyone.In this mission,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.999
we have set out principles to follow between the DPLA and Europeana.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.999
The first is to make our systems and data interpretable.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.999
The second, his two most -- promote open access through policies

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.999
and actions on content, data and metadata.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.999
The third is different -- to develop collaboratively

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.999
where we can. Beginning with a droppable data model.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.999
If you can't -- interoperable data model.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.999
If you can say that, you are had.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.999
I cannot tell you the pain and years already.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.999
Based on the data and it is a beginning.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.999
To share our source codes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.999
and to cooperatively build our collections together.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.999
To prove this is not just talk.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.999
We are starting doing something very concrete.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.999
Showcasing the can't -- content and links.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.999
It is a virtual exhibition of the migration of Europeans to the Americas.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.999
and Europeana will demonstrate the potential of the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.999
combined collections by digitizing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.999
and making freely available material about the journey

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.999
from the old world to the new.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.999
[ APPLAUSE ].

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.999
This exhibition will include text,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.999
images about the experiences as they are abandoning their

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.999
homes to seek new lives thousands of miles across a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.999
treacherous ocean. Letters, photographs

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.999
and official records open unfamiliar views into the harsh world

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.999
and inhabited by Europeans in the activities of Russia to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.999
the present fillets -- villages of Ireland.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.999
Illustrating the culture shock

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.999
and immigrants of -- after a rifle.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.999
Everyone in the United States,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.999
including the Indians sent from immigrants

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.999
and everyone in Europe has some connection with migrated

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.999
All will be invited to stroll digitally through this rich exhibition.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.999
Most importantly to interact

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.999
and participate as users add their own stories and memorabilia.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.999
[ APPLAUSE ].

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.999
We are so excited to begin this work.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.999
A word of thanks to Professor.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.999
Robert for building all of the ties with the other

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.999
European partners.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.999
Back to your regular scheduled programming I give you can

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.999
21 the presidenta lot of Peggy Rudd.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.999
I have the privilege of moderating the panel of these

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.999
distinguished individuals.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.999
Each of whom has been invited from their own

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.999
perspectiveto address the question of what is DPLA.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.999
Particularly we asked them to do is to share some of

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.999
their patient of whatthe DPLA might be.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.999
Also, to offer their perspectives on the promise ofthe DPLA.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.999
The format is, each has been invited to speak to us for 5-7 minutes.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.999
I will move things along to ensure it happens.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.999
To allow sufficient,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.999
of time for their engagement with you.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.999
I also want to knowledge as was done previously.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.999
We have an audience that goes beyond this room.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.999
And eventual throw the country who are being a part of

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.999
this but in listening mode.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.999
In the room you have the opportunity to actually engage

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.999
in the way you saw earlier today. We'll go in order

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.999
and they are seated in the order which they are listed in the program.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.999
We'llbegin with Maureen Sullivan.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.999
Who-- John Palfrey. Who is the chair of DPLA Thank you.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.999
Before I do the official, what is DPLA.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.999
I want to knowledge the incoming new president who has

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.999
joined is also. One that has yet to be mentioned. Tony,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.999
welcome and thank you.What is DPLA?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.999
It has been a complex indication of questions.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.999
He honest answer is we are building it

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.999
and it is a virgin -- bridge we are walking over

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.999
and visual terms. By design,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.999
we sought to build a together rather than say,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.999
a particular version of what I speak-- might be.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.999
I want to describe five aspects of DPLA .

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.999
We can work further on what the concrete aspects of each

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.999
of those will be. Let me hit them. They are on the screen.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.999
These are the areas we know, after 18 months of our planning phase and moving forward,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.999
we will have gotten work done

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.999
and we will aim for further work from there.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.999
We talked about content in the middle of this list. That is clearly part of DPLA.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.999
We will be digitizing materials

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.999
and we will be doing it with Europeana.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.999
I hope we will work with the Internet archive

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.999
and lots of others to digitize content.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.999
I don't think the idea is that it will be one big massive

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.999
digital library in one place but rather a collection of collections.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.999
It is something we will have to figure out how to preserve overtime.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.999
Even from the perspective of low hanging fruit.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.999
If we were institutions that together spend millions of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.999
dollars digitizing every year,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.999
to do it in a common way based on common standards.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.999
We are to ask people to use a common format

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.999
and to share to make sure a copy of itis shared with DPLA.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.999
We could do a huge amount test thereby making the

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.999
existing collections and contents more interoperable and common formats.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.999
It is much more than the digitize materials.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.999
Starting from the top of the list is code.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.999
Importantly, the DPLA is computer controlled we are developing.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.999
We have made attempts to do as much as possible on open

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.999
space. It will be a set of code

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.999
and it will be like source code for libraries.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.999
There are many ways in which we are working on this effort.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.999
DPLA itself will be  repository of offensive code anyone

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.999
can take and reuse in different ways.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.999
Imagine future would be DPLA  website to access the

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.999
contents but a bunch of code that a public library might take and repurpose for its own use.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.999
They could curate collections and perhaps a library would take the code and repurpose it for their website

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.999
and bring some of the content that we have in our collection and curate it locally.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.999
A second thing that is the same mix is the data. -- Metadata.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.999
In the information there -- business it is one thing to

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.999
scan the data but it is another thing to refine it and make it usable.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.999
It is something that I think we haven't structured right

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.999
yet in the world of libraries and information.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.999
Information in the form of metadata has been too locked up

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.999
and I think we are going to make a real contribution by

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.999
having open access to metadata very broadly through this project.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.999
We have heard earlier today that efforts to make link to open data

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.999
and to make information more broadly available in this

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.999
form.The DPLA  is and will be metadata in an open way.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.999
There is a project called library class.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.999
This is the part where I think it is most playful and exciting.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.999
DPLA has the possibility that just be  a common platform

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.999
code but a series of services that libraries

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.999
and others could use to make this information richer and more available

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.999
and bring people in to allow social media [ Indiscernible- low volume ].

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.999
That might right on top of the common platform.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.999
A favorite example of this, where is Emily core?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.999
She coined the term, "scanabego".

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.999
Going to local historical societies

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.999
and saying bring out your scans.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.999
Let's do this together.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.999
There is material that has not yet put into this

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.999
wonderful cloud we are developing and metadata around it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.999
I can see this working with [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.999
I have an extremity data on the slide I will put the real

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.999
thing, community.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.999
I think the DPLA is us. We are the DPLA.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.999
It's an amazing  rich occasionally cranky, contentious community.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.999
A community that I think has public spirit the behind it and will work together. As institutions and individuals.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.999
Hopefully always with common respect and a goal in mind to build something no one institution could build on its own.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.999
When we heard from the Library of Congress

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.999
and the Smithsonian Library there is no one back into the

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.999
DPLA as well as we can.  If we structure this right,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.999
we actually have good will and trust one another and work hard.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.999
Petitions that have been made possible by Wikipedia, the Web itself,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.999
we can do the same in the library world

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.999
and that is what DPLA is.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.999
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.999
Now we have the opportunity to hear from transferring

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.999
three leads the Texas State Library and Archives commission

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.999
and on the steering committeefor the DPLA.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.999
If you liked writing-- driving "scanabego" would be a tiring job for librarians.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.999
I think it is especially important that we are here at

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.999
the national archives for this plenary session.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.999
This is in fact national archives month.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.999
We are celebrating all of the archives held at the

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.999
national state and local levels throughout our country.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.999
We do have our own declaration of independence.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.999
That is on display. In Austin Texas. It is digitized and available on the web.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.999
I think so many of us have been focusing on content as well as we should.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.999
We want to know what is this thing calledthe DPLA.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.999
What is it going to look like we it also has two do with

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.999
the tools that John was talking about yesterday.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.999
That Carl and I were hosting. Someone said,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.999
they want to see someone walking down the sidewalk

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.999
and they have their cell phone. They have a question

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.999
and they say to themselves.I am going to DPLA it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.999
Just the way they say Google it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.999
That is what we want to see.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.999
If we take as our guiding principles.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.999
Something that Chairman Leach said earlier which I really

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.999
just loved. That is the infrastructure of ideas.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.999
If we take as our guiding principle that all people in this country,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.999
should have access to this infrastructure of ideas.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.999
One of the issues we have to deal with in addition to all

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.999
of the things that Johnson. The metadata, content,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.999
tools and services, community.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.999
That just the community of those that are going to be

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.999
involvedin building the DPLA Those that are going to be

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.999
involved in sharing what is built.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.999
We have to think about access.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.999
I think many of us were present --

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.999
-- Even though I am a state librarian.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.999
We do a lot of work as to state ivories all across the country.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.999
With the infrastructure of more than 16,000 public library outlets in this country.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.999
We have a built-in infrastructure.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.999
We are very proud of that built-in infrastructure.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.999
We think in terms of access for people who are -- whose

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.999
lives are going to be improved by having access to the DPLA.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.999
We are going to be the digital literacy corps.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.999
Those of us in public ivories.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.999
Think about the work -- public libraries.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.999
I think about the work in the media centers at the

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.999
Chicago public Library.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.999
I think about the work Carla Hayden is doing here in Baltimore.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.999
I think about the youth centers that have been going for

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.999
a decade with Dell foundation funding it at the public library they are.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.999
 Libraries, public ivories are going to be the institution that ensures that not only can people discover.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.999
They can efficiently and effectively discover things in this wonderful thing

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.999
we are all going to build together.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.999
They also are going to help people evaluate what it is they find.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.999
They will ensure that they find is relevant to whatever their purposes.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.999
And help them get the most out of the digital public library of America.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.999
I think we are all committed to digital inclusion.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.999
We understand that this is a major challenge are you a

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.999
challenge now. In our country.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.999
Public libraries have risen to that challenge

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.999
and I think they will continue to you so.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.999
I would submit that what we build is going to be grand and glorious.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.999
Many of us have already built components that are going

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.999
to enrich the digital public library of America.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.999
We are all committed to bringing this to fruition.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.999
We must remember they are -- there are those in our

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.999
country that will need our special assistance for a whole variety of reasons.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.999
To make sure they can use this tremendous resource that we are committing to today.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.999
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.999
That that -- [ APPLAUSE ].

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.999

You have a tie on. [ LAUGHING ].

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.999
I grew up in the paper world.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.999
I believe we are in the transition of building a digital

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.999
America. This project is a key component to it.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.999
I believe the archivist is correct. If it is not online, it does not exist.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.999
All of the materials necessary to bring up the next generation and our own generation.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.999
Our lockup in our physical paper libraries. And not accessible.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.999
This is not good enough.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.999
This project can be a major step towards fixing this.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.999
There are two digital library projects that are now operating in the United States.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.999
They are fairly large scale. There are many smaller ones.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.999
There is a 10 million book collection offered as a

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.999
subscription service but there is a contractual litigation limitations.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.999
There is a smaller collection of about 2 million books.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.999
That is now available for free public access for the public domain.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.999
And a free public lending library which we find

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.999
and in choosing approach towards moving -- an interesting

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.999
approach towards moving ahead. What do we want?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.999
If we take this as a new starting point.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.999
Where are we really trying to get to?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.999
Let's make sure we have at the end of the day a lot of publishers. That are paid.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.999
They sure if there are a lot of authors and booksellers.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.999
Many many libraries that are not all responsible to central control.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.999
There is a diversity of everyone of these among many to

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.999
many to many. A lot of authors many of which can get paid.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.999
Last of all, let's be sure everyone can be a reader.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.999
No matter what their language, disabilities, proclivities.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.999
Everyone can be supported in this digital world.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.999
Frankly it is the world that we benefited from,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.999
growing up. Let's make sure the next generation has,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.999
even though as you look around the room.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.999
The number of laptops, it is a digital world now.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.999
Let's go and adapt to it and support it and build it.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.999
First of all, let's go and get a library that is as great as the Boston public Library.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.999
Yell or Princeton library online accessible to all.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.999
Materials that are public domain, out-of-print and in print.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.999
Those libraries are about on the order of 10 million

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.999
volumes. We cannot stop there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.999
But let's be sure we do this

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.999
and I think we can quite effectively.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.999
About 2 million books public domain 7 million out-of-print and 1 million in print.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.999
I suggest three strategies for these different go categories. Public domain should stay free.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.999
Out of print, can be digitized to be lent.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.999
Digitally lent and that is in process.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.999
And happening at scale.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.999
There is also in print. It's by e-books and lend them.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.999
They want us to be put to do this but we have billions of

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.999
dollars, collectively in the library systems to buy books. Let's go into what it is we are used to doing which is

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.999
acquiring things for our collections perfectly and lend them.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.999
If we buy 100 copies there can be 100 copies circulating at once. Buying e-books and lend them.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.999
Digitize the books that we cannot buy. And them

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.999
and give away the public domain.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.999
I am happy to say that this is happening at scale.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.999
There are now 1000 libraries that have digitize books

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.999
that are modern books. In copyright books. And lending them, digitally.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.999
Also there -- they are sharing about 100,000 books.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.999
You say, well, is that scale?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.999
I would say that it's moving by having a large number of

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.999
libraries that we are moving forward with this approach with digitally lending

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.999
and solving one of the key problems which is how do we

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.999
get the collections that are not commercially viable online?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.999
How do we support a wide number of vendors going forward? What can this project do?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.999
I trains out of this project is to help libraries by new

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.999
e-books so they can lend them.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.999
Two scanned the core collection of 10 million books

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.999
available to every citizen everywhere in the world are you since this has American in the title,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.999
at least the United States.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.999
 Third, help a libraries get the complete digital collections.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.999
It has been amazing to me. If you wanted a 10 million volume collection.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.999
The size of that collection if it were on spinning,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.999
searchable our drives is to computers about the size.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.999
A 10 million books collection downloadable server will cost about $30,000.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.999
That is within the budget of a lot of ivories.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.999
I think they will take very different use of it.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.999
There are different conceptions than having one centralized database.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.999
Which may have been necessary in the mainframe era that

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.999
is is no longer necessary. What do we get?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.999
Universal access to all knowledge. For inspiring generation.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.999
We would be doing our part so that people all over the world can learn from.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.999
How do we stand track? I always try to follow the monkey.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.999
Is it being spent towards building these goals?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.999
Or is it spent.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.999
I would -- I am always looking to follow the money

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.999
and the bits. The resulting bits are they

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.999
and a lot of libraries are one place?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.999
The thing I love is it is committee to put the bits

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.999
and in many places even if in copyright materials.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.999

Although I fully agree of those who say it is not online it does not exist.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.999
I think that is something that is only online.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.999
Perhaps only half exists. A public building,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.999
not just the data center or the warehouse.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.999
I don't need a belly, but I want it was irrational desire.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.999
I know it is not on the radar yetfor the DPLA.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.999
I wanted to plant the seed of the idea today.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.999
A monument to the ideal of having -- informed citizen.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.999
A monument to a culturally intellectually and emotionally enriched citizen.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.999
Within the city of monuments. We are in a monument today.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.999
One important note about the obad enclosing.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.999
Overture plan to reunite in the evening of the very same

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.999
day on which they part reluctantly in the morning.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.999
Are allowed to figure in the obad.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.999
It is not just for lovers who anticipate they'll painful

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.999
and perhaps permanent separation.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.999
I am confident that hours is one such obad.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.999
Our own work day will end with a gleeful fun if you with

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.999
the soul and body of a library.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.999
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.999
There have been many memorable phrases throughout this.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.999
The last one, the gleeful rendezvous with the soul

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.999
and body of a library is one to remember.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.999
We have the privilege at the start of this session of

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.999
hearing American Library Association six describe the

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.999
commitment of European genre to the public library.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.999
We have the opportunity to hear her perspectives on the

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.999
vision and the promiseof DPLA.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.999
They are entirely selfish.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.999
And I am not Californian tree if I cannot do anything.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.999
Without sites.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.999
-- Slides.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.999
It is really [ Indiscernible - low volume ].

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.999
We can get access to your stuff. [ APPLAUSE ].

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.999
I am prepared to give access to your stuff we hold you

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.999
back. There is a lot more sites. Also,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.999
I think you can improve on Europeana.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.999
It is about the data, open source and licensing.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.999
Licensing is my latest mantra.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.999
It is about being interoperable with each other.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.999
Together we can give each other on both sides of the

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.999
Atlantic more and give it to them faster.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.999
This is Europeana.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.999
This year we launched a strategic plan.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.999
This plan is for four years.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.999
It has four major strands.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.999
The reason for pushing this on you.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.999
It helps a-- we frame what I want out of DPLA.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.999
Europeana is about aggregating.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.999
It is about building the open trusted source to European

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.999
cultural [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.999
It is about facilitating and supporting cultural Heller kit -- heritage.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.999
Transfer to advocacy.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.999
It is about making the heritage available to users

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.999
wherever they are and wherever they want it.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.999
Lastly it is about engaging that user in ways to

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.999
participate with their cultural heritage.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.999
I have already heard today in this morning and yesterday.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.999
It is exactly the same mission you are trying to accomplish.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.999
When I look at these numbers I am slightly -- I was proud actually.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.999
What from 2 million in three years to 20 million.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.999
I do the numbers you are talking about

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.999
and I will have some of that. We are doing okay.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.999
We started very much as you have started.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.999
And we are moving on.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.999
The thing I am especially interested in is APIs.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.999
To distribute the contents back into the places where the user will use it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.999
I don't think I would expect them to come to DPLA.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.999
You should expect them to come to the sites.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.999
We need to put stuff through APIs. So the curators

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.999
or a school sites can actually make it work for the kids.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.999
We are not going to be able to do that.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.999
Which would have the capability unless we put it with people who can make that kind of thing work.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.999
It is about being able to take back what already belongs

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.999
to America through these APIs.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.999
This is a search on American, United States.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.999
So just three languages.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.999
It brings the kind of content that relates to the USA on

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.999
that. It is mapped and it is Christmas cards.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.999
It is a lot of archived materials especially off of the second world war.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.999
Also things like videos of people turning out [

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.999
Indiscernible Name ].  All of that belongs to you

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.999
and you should have it back in the DPLA.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.999
Facilitate.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.999
The reason I am interested in this has to do with open

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.999
data. Open licensing. We heard some of that already.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.999
We are doing a lot of work on labeling the content so

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.999
that you know it is in the public domain.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.999
We issued a charter that says what was in the public

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.999
domain in other forms should stay in the public domain in digital form to

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.999
and I need your help to make sure that goes on.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.999
That we label it with the public domain which is being

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.999
developed with the [ Indiscernible - low volume ].

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.999
We really make sure that we don't lose this for the

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.999
future. This was a search on Washington.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.999
The public domain is only 36 related to Washington.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.999
This one is from the national archive in the Netherlands.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.999
It is a song about George Washington.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.999
I think when he went to [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.999
That's where about it. Lastly,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.999
it is not -- it is about being able to engage.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.999
You may have heard me [ Indiscernible Name ] about

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.999
projects where  involved in.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.999
It is called transcendent 1918.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.999
Is based on an idea that came out of the University.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.999
With it, we go around museums and libraries

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.999
and ask people to bring you the memorabilia.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.999
They bring in all sorts of things.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.999
Photos with bullet holes through them that they got back

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.999
from their uncle who was killed. We get diaries,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.999
diaries kept I children during those period.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.999
They are digitized the stories and online.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.999
We have done that in Germany

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.999
and we are going around the rest of Europe.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.999
I would really like to be able to extend that.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.999
If you would like to take the next exhibition we do after

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.999
my migration. And hit 2014.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.999
And look at the stories beyond the world wars.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.999
This pulls in all of the items that we hold in our

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.999
institutions into the video.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.999
It is a story about a prisoner of war

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.999
and a captain in a British army who together put out a

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.999
fire. I need -- [ Indiscernible - low volume ].

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.999
In this  video you can start to: things from YouTube

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.999
and the maps of the trenches

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.999
and all of those things that you read through the videos.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.999
The aim is to make it very interesting.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.999
Why is DPLA important?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.999
We are the generation that's can give access to the past.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.999
We were brought up on books, manuscripts, pictures.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.999
We visited a museum, the libraries, archives and galleries.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.999
We know what is fair and how important it is.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.999
We -- with your kids, if we don't digitize it and put it online.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.999
For me that is the reason why DPLA  is a fantastic idea.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.999
Thank you.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.999
[ APPLAUSE ].

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.999
The person writing is Carl Malamud with  people resource.org.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.999
I'm from California

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.999
and I don't believe in color for you but I do want a soapbox.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.999
I want to thank Dave for allowing us to occupy [

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.999
Indiscernible Name ] today.  Especially to pop chart

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.999
and who has been our profit to the justice promised land

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.999
of the republic of letters.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.999
Plus they force us to-- Professor. far I have spent.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.999
I keep seeing images of reservoirs and are just.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.999
When I think of the DPLA I think of the Hoover dam

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.999
and Golden gate Bridge. If you look at the museums

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.999
and our  archives and research institutions,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.999
there is a tremendous reservoir of knowledge locked up.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.999
It is tempting to think our world of knowledge born digital.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.999
We are flooded with information that we need what Clay

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.999
Johnson calls information diet. We don't need more data.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.999
Our Internet is only flooded with some kinds of information right now.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.999
Some of the most important tools of knowledge are not available to all.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.999
Or available only to those with gold red cards

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.999
or positions of privilege in our league institutions.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.999
Knowledge in the world wants to the 1%.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.999
I can give you two examples

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.999
and I think you can think of them. The first is law and government.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.999
The law, court opinions or statutes or regulations.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.999
Public safety codes. The operating system of our society

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.999
and the rules that make democracy work.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.999
It is the code that makes America such a special place.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.999
The private houses have enclosed this was public domain and.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.999
Access to justice has become all about access to money.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.999
We give you whatever example.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.999
If you are creative. A writer or film maker or an artist. A scholar.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.999
You draw on imagery of accumulated over thousands of years.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.999
Imagery you use to create new works of art and scholarship.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.999
Creative workers the stand on the shoulders of giants. If we are to reach new heights.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.999
As any Hollywood filmmaker will tell you much of that

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.999
imagery is locked up in for project -- profit places. They have built walls and gates around them.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.999
Even our museums.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.999
Even our national step only in -- Smithsonian situation.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.999
Allowing images to use -- the used only by those who stop by a cash register first.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.999
There is a tremendous reservoir of this untapped knowledge in America.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.999
Knowledge is our countries host important renewable natural resource.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.999
It is a common pool that should be available to all.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.999
We already have many beautiful museums. We have autobus libraries. Unique research institutions.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.999
What if the DPLA, instead of creating another institution created a common

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.999
reservoir that we could help campaign two.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.999
What if the trust put everything they have into a common pool.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.999
A pool being turned could draw upon to create an even

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.999
more impressive trust? What if the Internet archive

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.999
and Library of Congress and public libraries and individuals

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.999
and local historical societies could all draw on those

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.999
deep wells and all contribute to the common pool?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.999
Is tempting for anyone institution to say, I have the answer.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.999
What if we shift the debate so it becomes,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.999
we all have the answer, here's my contributions.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.999
To see what you can do with it. Surprise me.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.999
I have one more than the four. Then I will stop beating this metaphorical horse.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.999
Metaphor is a bridge.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.999
The specific bridge is the Washington Bridge.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.999
It connects the Washington Capitol with the rest of the country.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.999
When it comes to untapped resources,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.999
Washington is the deepest well.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.999
A vast storehouse locked inside the Beltway.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.999
But the national kosher will institution.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.999
The Library of Congress, national Library of medicine.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.999
The Smithsonian.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.999
The national technical information service.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.999
The Government printing office. The national archives.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.999
The list goes on.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.999
What we have clinched a few shining examples of that potential.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.999
The American memory potential of the Library of Congress.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.999
Pioneering national -- for the most part those resources

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.999
they hidden areas it is our opportunity to build a bridge to Washington.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.999
That means we need to get much for serious about public

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.999
works projects for knowledge.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.999
We need to start on national digitization initiative that

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.999
is more than pilots and prototypes.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.999
We need a decade of long commitment to scanning.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.999
Or federal government to understand it is time to deploy

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.999
the Internet Corps of Engineers. To scan it scale

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.999
and become much more serious contributor to that reservoir of knowledge.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.999
To be at the center of that public part that makes access

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.999
to knowledge a right for all Americans not a privilege

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.999
for the 1%. If a self-appointed library

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.999
and in an abandoned church like first retail can publish 3 million posts,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.999
how can the federal government not to more?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.999
If Google can scan 10 million books to feed a search engine,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.999
why can't the federal government do the same to transform

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.999
our nation's educational system?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.999
If Westlaw can scan the it opinions of courts

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.999
and statutes of legislatures to maximize shareholder value,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.999
why can't the judicial conference of the United States

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.999
and/or nation's law schools work together to maximize

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.999
Democratic values. If we can put a man on the moon ,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.999
why can't we launched the Library of Congress into cyberspace?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.999
If we spend billions of dollars to buy access to politicians,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.999
why can't we spend billions of dollars to buy access to

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.999
knowledge and justice to promote the useful arts,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.999
car must -- car buyers -- commerce area these are the

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.999
kinds of bridges and reservoirs we can build.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.999
The kinds of public projects that can become the foundation of the digital public libraries of America.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.999
It is the opportunity we can replace.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.999
That only -- but only if we work together. Thank you.

[ APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ]

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.999
As a moderator, I will exercise the privilege of moving to audience

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.999
participation on this question.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.999
Rather than invite you to comment on what you heard from the six.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.999
Instead, reflect for a few moments on the wealth of information and ideas shared today.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.999
I would like you to consider what is the potential ofthe

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.999
DPLA ? In the communities to which you are parts?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.999
I would invite you to share that with all of us here this

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.999
morning. What is the potential you see?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.999
One other thing, state your name and be brief.

Rutgers University. [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.999
As a faculty of aIvory school.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.999
I hope DPLA will have  fellowship's

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.999
or scholarships to help the upcoming librarians learn all of the skills they need

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.999
or if we already launched courses in digital libraries,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.999
metadata, data federation. We need more

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.999
and we need to be on the front line.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.999
Thank you.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.999
I am aware of the richness among the six but there is

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.999
richness in the audience.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.999
[ Indiscernible - low volume ].

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.999
I a passionate supporter of this project.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.999
The presentations this point however have exposed an

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.999
issue that hadn't occurred to me before.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.999
I would like to make a suggestion.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.999
The proposition that if it doesn't exist online, it does not exist.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.999
This seems, if true, unfortunate.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.999
There are aspects of our cultural heritage that can never

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.999
be fully appreciated in a digital format.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.999
Graphic art. It can be suggested.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.999
But never indicated. Online. Find musical performances.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.999
Certain historical events.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.999
I appreciate -- an appreciation of the Holocaust cannot

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.999
be fully cleaned from digital materials.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.999
At a minimum it has to be the texture.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.999
If the Digital the library succeeded only. -- Fully.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.999
As a hazard I had not previously recognized that it would

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.999
suppress our appreciation of some other aspects of our

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.999
cultural heritage is -- heritage is..

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.999
There is an unavoidable competition.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.999
We would observe

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.999
and regret the extent to which our children was

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.999
appreciation for some things we did enjoy.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.999
There is an alternative path which one could build into the project from the beginning.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.999
Techniques, not just for digitizing currently analog materials for

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.999
providing access to indices were sensitized appreciation of this.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.999
It can be as simple as a guidance for where musical

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.999
performances are currently located

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.999
or something more [ Indiscernible Name ]. Fundamental.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.999
You were addressing the second question I was going to post if there was time.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.999
What would you suggest are important things to consider as this work moves forward?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.999
Critical success factors. I appreciate that.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.999
Other perspectives on the process of DPLA?

14 Gomez. Los Angeles public library.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.999
I see potential for many of the kids that are served by

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.999
Los Angeles public Library for example.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.999
To get excited about knowledge. If a nation in mourning.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.999
Pulling pieces together that are important to them in their own communities.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.999
Thank you.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.999
Zachary Davis from can -- can cannon foundation.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.999
How do we make sure public libraries continue to be a

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.999
space for learning and education.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.999
How can we transform the use of these libraries so the

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.999
building and become potential temples to knowledge?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.999
In a place of -- that is the idea.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.999
What do we do with the places so they are still usable?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.999
I will take a crack at that.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.999
I think that Susan eluded to this.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.999
In her presentation earlier this morning.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.999
I think what we're seeing is public libraries they in

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.999
fact have to evolve. Many of them are already doing that.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.999
I think one of the exciting features that I envisioned

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.999
for the digital public library of America is that it will

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.999
incorporate user created content.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.999
All of that is being fed in,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.999
if you will laboratories in public libraries across the

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.999
country. I was talking earlier about digital inclusion.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.999
I think we have to realize that when you look at a survey

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.999
that just came out. From connected nation.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.999
46% of going come families with children don't have

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.999
computers or Internet access.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.999
I think they deserve access to the digital public library

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.999
of America. I agree with Terry.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.999
 If a child is growing up in some of the major cities in this country.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.999
There isn't always a digital placement for a firsthand experience.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.999
Of a cultural event.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.999
If you are a child growing up in [ Indiscernible Name ] Texas.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.999
I promise you the only cultural heritage organization

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.999
or institution within 100 miles is the public library.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.999
I think public libraries are going to change.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.999
I think of it more,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.999
not a library without walls but beyond walls.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:38.999
I think everybody very in this country has experiences that they can share.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.999
About all the ways that their libraries are being used in

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.999
ways that, whether at Rutgers or University of Texas or Denver.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.999
Whatever library or school or high school you could never have envisioned the use of

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.999
the five very in that way.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.999
I see public libraries is being integral to the

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.999
developmentof DPLA because I think that is where user

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.999
created content is going to surface. And it's surfacing.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.999
I also think that that is the role that libraries are

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.999
going to bloody to create an environment in which people can access digital content,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.999
when there is no access anywhere else.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.999
I know I have one on this slide.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.999
Is anyone on that site leasing -- I am from Boston Massachusetts.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.999
Free for all these words that I pass every day.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.999
On the face of the bus and public library.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.999
We appreciate your comments because I signaled his fellow

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.999
that I wanted to speak as you were mentioning bandwidth.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.999
I think is a critical issue especially in oral areas. -- Rural areas.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.999
A technical aspects of working on digital public

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.999
libraries takes into account that you will have a lot of

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.999
data images and very heavy use of the bandwidth.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.999
How are we going to build the bandwidth access through public libraries.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.999
I think that was one reason why we were so glad to see [

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.999
Indiscernible Name ] with the Gates foundation.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.999
They have worked with particularly Ivory semi-state but across the country.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.999
To upgrade bandwidth in public libraries.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.999
And to sustain that over a period of time.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.999
I think that is one of the critical issues that feeds

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.999
into digital inclusion. If your library has 1. 5 Mb connection,

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.999
and you have kids pouring into your library after 3:00 in the afternoon. Trust me.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:04.999
It is not going to be long before everyone is saying,

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.999
why is it so slow? Why can't I do this that or the other?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.999
That is a key component of what we are talking about with

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.999
DPLA Stephen Kirkpatrick from [ Indiscernible Name ].

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.999
We serve many of those underserved first generation to college students.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.999
Community means a great deal to us there.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.999
I think of community in two respects.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.999
Imagine an Ecuadorian American mother who is a part-time

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.999
student majoring in finance.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.999
She belongs to a lot of communities.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.999
We want the content of course that serves all of those communities.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.999
I would also be interested in making sure that the coding

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.999
that goes into this recognizes that not just her but all

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.999
of us have multiple communities we belong to.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.999
I would hope whatever exists would allow her to shift

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.999
from her parents in the interest.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.999
And get the advantage of social searching.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.999
Then suddenly switch to the finance major

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.999
and also have the benefit of the social aspect of searching.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.999
With other finance measures. Etc.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.999
Does anyone on the panel want to reflect on this?

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.999
We all agree.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.999
.Our old -- Jon Arnold, software engineer.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.999
I have watched this developed.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.999
I want to point out two things of interest.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.999
First of all,

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.999
one of the ideas in the 1991 White House conference on

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.999
White House services which is another reference point.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.999
So are some groups talked about wasn't just scanning but

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.999
the ability that maybe having a central point where

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.999
people could send their homes movies and 8 mm

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.999
and not have to pay through the nose to get some of those

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.999
activities. Not only in our families

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.999
and families across the country but in the public ivories

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.999
have films donated operates from the turn of the century.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.999
Or from World War II. The other thing,

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.999
getting back to the question about the potentialof DPLA.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.999
I see DPLA has a huge potential for bring up resources

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.999
right now  used at the local libraries so the local

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.999
library can send its scarce resources on customizing a

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.999
property available set of content to exactly what the community needs.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.999
But the local trustees are deciding to do.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.999
Even better than not having a great pool of lots of content to choose from.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.999
The library can customize it for the community.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.999
Is one feels they are not a good fit for the community.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.999
The library can provide an audience of one by letting the person customized library for themselves.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.999
Thank you. That was great.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.999
[ Indiscernible Name ]. Recent library  science graduate. From New York.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.999
My question is not really related to the professionals.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.999
But more to, how does the private citizen.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.999
The everyday person.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.999
Get involved in this project from its beginning stages.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.999
I am not asking about the scanning part of it. But, getting involved somehow.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.999
Writing letters to Washington. Or for treating funds?

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.999
-- Contributing funds?

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.999
I'm thrilled to have this tested.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.999
We spend our last session on this topic. The answer is, lots of ways.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.999
Her imagination is probably the will limit year.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.999
I love the lobbying point and second to last.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.999
There is a big globalization question here.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.999
It goes to many of the concerns that have been expressed about the affect of this project on public libraries.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.999
The notion is, people say because you

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.999
 have a DPLA rid your for donate a local library.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.999
Obviously everyone in the room things that is a crazy statement.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.999
We know there are crazy people in politics.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.999
That is an unfortunate reality.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.999
A test of the word out about what this is

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.999
and it is a complex or supplement to the -- complement or supplement.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.999
To do that anyway that I think in the end abrogates more

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.999
resources to this knowledge pool

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.999
and the system we are talking about.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.999
I don't think there is any -- I would be so sorry if this

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.999
project led to the closure of one library.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.999
I think to the point of other comments that have been brought through.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.999
This is absolutely not about shutting libraries.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.999
That is happening anyway and it is not our fault.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.999
It is a problem in the world.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.999
Hopefully these spaces will be much richer and used for more things. Freeing up librarians time.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.999
To giving money.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.999
I think we should find a way to have a fund we all could

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.999
give private resources to. We have not done that.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.999
We should.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.999
More specifically to the broad question how you can get

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.999
involved in setting up this project? The goodness

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.999
and badness of having questions about what that itis of

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.999
DPLA.  On the other hand we are struggling with and working through it.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.999
The other hand they want our help

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.999
and there is opportunity.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.999
There are six work streamsset up for the DPLA.  Go to dp.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.999
la or Google us. Today is in parts,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.999
meant as an invitation to everyone and everyone watching.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.999
To come join those work streams.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.999
To participate in the shaping of what this should be. A range from governance to legal issues, to technical

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.999
and audience participation.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.999
There are going to be series of meetings over 18 months.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.999
That will be open to anyone who wants to participate.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.999
We will post when they happen.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.999
You can purchase at a in virtual ways or come to the meetings.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.999
They will be shared -- chaired

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.999
and a way to manage broad participation.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.999
It will take up a series of issues we know we have to deal with.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.999
One talk about what we are actually building and we have raised key issues in that area.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.999
Those who have or technical abilities will be hugely helpful.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.999
We talk about how we take the beta sprints

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.999
and built upon them into something common.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.999
Also taking the open code andnot to deal with the DPLA.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.999
On the technical aspects.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.999
We also need people who will imagine the use cases.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.999
How will these be used and which we people think we there is a huge range of

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.999
opportunities across these different projects.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.999
Over the 18 months we have -- we come back together.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.999
If we have three or people in the room, that would be great.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.999
If we have 10 times that of the want to be in here,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.999
that is going to be a big piece of the success.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.999
To all library students and everyone here, come join us.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.999
There is more than enough work to do.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.999
There is scanning and riding in the back of the bus would be fun.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.999
[ LAUGHING ].

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.999

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.999
I am honored to be a former person. Children's librarian.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.999
I've always believed children who go to the library

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.999
become parents who go to the library.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.999
What you have in the collection for children?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.999
I am talking about the emerging reader as well.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.999
I want to know, what is the by in for a parent to use the digital public library of America.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.999
I know or see the reasons for academic.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.999
It is very academic focus. I see it is great for history.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.999
When I am talking about is the 0-8.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.999
What is it about Amanda French  I as -- Digital Public

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.999
Library of America  will say this why I want to use it.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:16.999
Who want to be clear ofthe intent of DPLA.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.999
This is like the last one.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.999
A crucial thing we worked out conceptually.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.999
I think the answer is,what the library is going to do

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.999
with DPLA. How is going to mediate that ways

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.999
or make sense for 0-8 euros.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.999
That is one piece of the project. Creating the structure.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.999
The common pool. That people can code upon.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.999
And use it in ways that are richer

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.999
and more freely available.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.999
We have to figure out if someone comes to a common

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.999
website, how we make it something available.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.999
You have heard from thing she would have had trouble accessing before.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.999
There are publishers in the world who are struggling with

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.999
this question. There are things that are digital and right now in print

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.999
and in copyright that lever use are having a hard time --

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.999
libraries are having a hard time getting to the 0 to 8.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.999
We need to be a force broadly for helping that to happen.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.999
Whether in DPLA or advocacy

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.999
or working with publishers on different bottles.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.999
As a parent of young children, they be nothing.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.999
There may be some degree to which we are still binding

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.999
books are checking them out of the library and reading the book.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.999
Maybe how we want to do it in our household.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.999
In the range of possibilities is enormous.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.999
It is enormous especially because the platform right in

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.999
the community parts rightto what DPLA is.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.999
I also think it is not a replacement for anything

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.999
and we should not see it that way.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.999
It cuts to the lower age range that you're asking about.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.999
The University of Texas at Arlington did a study about

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.999
one year ago looking at students in fourth grade and seventh grade.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.999
Looking at what is it that is going to fully engage

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.999
students in the study of our state's history?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.999
What is going to yield higher grades on standardized tests?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.999
One thing they found is students performed better if they

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.999
had a greater extent of interaction with documents.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.999
Real documents. If they had first-person experiences.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.999
What we have tried to do at the Texas State Library

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.999
and many state ivories around the country have been

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.999
funding projects of their own institutions as well as

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.999
across their individual states.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.999
That is bringing history to the classrooms so that

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.999
students can experience.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.999
Rather than simply talking about our civilian conservation Corps Truong's of Texas.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.999
Parks -- drawings of Texas or parks.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.999
Any of the wealth of documents that we have.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.999
We can digitize those and make them available.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.999
So that in the enhances the experience of students.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.999
As a study our state history.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.999
Of course that is true for the study of United States

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.999
history's as well. That is used in classrooms.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.999
That we in this level, I think.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.999
Karo has one last comment.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.999
Two examples. The Encyclopedia of life.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.999

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.999
If we're successful to address Professor.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.999

For being able to identify alliance entire Sim mayors --

and museums and archives doing digitize patients.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.999
-- Digitization. [ Indiscernible - low volume ].

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.999
The phrase, if it doesn't exist online,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.999
it does not exist  is a crash faith but it might be

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.999
useful -- if they can't -- [ Indiscernible - low volume ].

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.999
Let me) to words of thanks.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.999
The first is on behalf of the panel to all of you

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.999
especially those who made comments

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.999
or responded to the questions I pose.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.999
It was a meaningful experience

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.999
and engagement in this process.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.999
You could also see from that, it is stimulating thinking

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.999
and helps advance the development of the DPLA.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.999
I want all of you in the audience to join me in thanking the six panelists for their presentation.
