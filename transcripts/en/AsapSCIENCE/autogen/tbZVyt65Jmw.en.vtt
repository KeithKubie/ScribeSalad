00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.660
Good morning body! Time for another day. Your
alarm goes off, you hit the snooze button

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.460
and lay there for few minutes between the
land of wake and sleep known as the hypnopompic

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.790
state. When you do finally get up, you’re
groggy and disoriented thanks to sleep inertia.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
Most of it is shed in 10 minutes, but can
sometimes linger for a few hours. During this

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
time your body temperature is still low, but
your blood pressure is sharply rising. There’s

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.860
a 50% increase in the stress hormone cortisol
pumping through your bloodstream, in preparation

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.529
for the stresses of your day!

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.600
Time for a shower! It’s also the best time
to shave as clot forming platelets are most

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.351
abundant right now, making your blood more
sticky. Meaning less bleeding from cuts! But

00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:41.830
it’s also the time of day when heart attacks
most often occur.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.030
7:30am swings around and it is time for coffee
and breakfast. Enjoy the smell before sipping!

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.470
75% of how we enjoy flavour is not through
the tongue, but through smell! The vapours

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.730
pass through your mouth, around the soft palate,
into the nasal cavity and to the olfactory

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.920
bulb. Mmm that’s good!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.250
Settling in at work, and your mental activity
is actually at a peak in late morning. Most

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.799
of us are sharpest 2 and a half to 4 hours
after waking. But your memory is impacted

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.380
as the day moves on. In the morning we forget
an average of 5 facts, but by afternoon we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.650
forget around 14. Nooot if you’re a young
adult though. In fact the reverse is true,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.159
with young people becoming more mentally alive
in the afternoon and evening. But, at night

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.900
our biological clock seems to turn off the
proteins involved in forming long term memories,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.930
which is why it’s best not to cram for a
test all night.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.201
It’s noon and it’s time for lunch! Your
stomach is able to expand as much as two and

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:37.229
half pints to receive a meal. Here it stays
for a few hours before it’s sent to your

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.780
small intestine. We digest meals without even
thinking about it - in fact, there is a brain

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.850
of sorts in your belly called the enteric
nervous system which performs everything from

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.030
sensing nutrients, measuring acids, and coordinating
the immune system to defend your gut.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.260
Around 2:30pm and lunch has left us a wave
of fogginess and fatigue. After a meal your

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.430
body has a short boost in energy from the
glucose, but is then followed by a wave of

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.900
insulin, the hormone that transports sugar
to your cells. Scientists believe that insulin

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.599
might pull too much from your blood, causing
an energy nosedive. However, this phenomenon

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.389
occurs even if you don’t have lunch, which
has led to much research on the power of naps,

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.549
which increase productivity and safety.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.290
4:30pm and it’s time to hit the gym. Though
many try to work out in the morning, studies

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.930
suggest that you may gain 20% more muscle
strength by working out in the afternoon.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.950
Your airways are more open, your heart works
more efficiently and your reaction time is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
at its peak. Much of this has to do with your
core body temperature peaking later in the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.870
day. Even most sports records are achieved
between 3pm and 8pm.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.989
Now you start off the evening by joining some
friends for drinks. During cocktail hour you're

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.689
actually more tolerant to the effects of alcohol.
In one study, those drinking vodka at 9am

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.909
had significnatly worse reaction time and
psychological functioning than those who had

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.609
the same dose at 6pm.

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.950
It’s around 8:30pm now and you catch someone’s
eye in the bar. Most of our mammalian ancestors

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.870
have ways of advertising their fertility.
It turns out that human women also give cues

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.230
when they’re ovulating. In fact, when looking
at pictures of women, studies show men find

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.109
women in the fertile phase to be more attractive.

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.040
You ask each other to dance - which brings
you close enough to get a wiff - after all,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.639
your sebaceous and apocrine glands release
scents through the armpit which potential

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.469
partners may find attractive. And because
humans walk upright, the armpit is the ideal

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.359
body part to disperse scent.

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.620
It’s 11pm now, which is the most popular
time for sex(ual activity). Which has little

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.430
to do with our bodies and more to do with
societal schedules. In fact, levels of testosterone

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.939
are much lower in the evening and peak at
8AM. While semen quality is best in the afternoon

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:48.329
with 35 x106 more spermatozoa per ejaculation.
As such, couples hoping to conceive have better

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.419
chances with midday sex than during the midnight
hour.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.719
As you go to sleep and finally begin to drift
off, melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.590
which begins the sleep cycle, which happens
multiple times through the night. A change

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.549
from alpha wave drowsiness to lower frequency
theta brain waves signify early sleep. And

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.829
as your sleep deepens, your brain moves to
longer delta waves. For children, sleep is

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.489
the time in which 90% of bone growth occurs.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.469
Finally, as you move into REM sleep, your
brain is as busy as it was during the day,

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.720
firing theta waves with burst of alpha and
beta. Though dreams occur in all stages of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.330
sleep, it is during REM that our dreams are
most vivid and intense. Recent brain scans

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.760
have shown that neurotransmitters like serotonin,
histamine and noradrenaline are shut off at

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.780
this point, turning off reason and logical
sense of time - which explains some weird

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.060
dreams! We dream for an hour and half to two
hours each night, meaning you spend about

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.810
6 years vividly dreaming over your lifetime!

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.289
In the middle of the night, your body actually
wakes up periodically, in something called

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.699
microarousals. These can last only seconds,
but occur between 200-1000 times per night.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.620
Though most of us in the western world sleep
all in one go, many past cultures sleep was

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.319
broken up into two periods with social activity
in between. Some studies have even shown that

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.009
we have two distinct 4 hour natural sleep
periods, which in the past would last between

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.960
8pm-12am, and then again from 2am-6am.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.360
By 4:30am, your body temperature is at its
lowest and your sleep continues to move through

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.729
the cycle. In a few hours, it’ll be good
morning body! Time for another day :)
