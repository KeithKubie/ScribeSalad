00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.040
Hey there, everyone.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.310
I've got something to show you
that's been almost a year in

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.990
the making.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.960
I've just received it today.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.590
I'm a little bit excited.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.840
Let me grab it.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.270
Here it is.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:21.340
This is a printed tartan based
on the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.090
And if that doesn't excite you,
well, you're probably

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.670
watching the wrong
YouTube channel.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.290
There it is.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.159
And if that's not good enough,
I also have a ribbon of the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.390
same design, Fibonacci
tartan ribbon.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.480
So I'm not going to bore you
with wefts and warps and all

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.890
the terminology of tartan, or
plaid, as I think people in

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.830
the US might call it.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.980
But basically, it's a very
number-based thing to make.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.140
And the rows and the threads
that have been used to create

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.320
this design are based on
the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:12.470
So we've got 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.000
And I must say it's
pretty impressive.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.710
I'm really pleased with it.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230
So I'm going to give
you a closer look.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.400
But while I do, I'm going to
play a piece of music from our

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.190
favorite musician here at
Numberphile, Alan Stewart,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.120
who's been making all sorts of
bits of music for us lately.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.440
And he's actually composed a
piece of bagpipes music based

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.250
on the Fibonacci sequence.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.740
And this is properly based on
the Fibonacci sequence in lots

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.790
of different ways.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.310
So when you're listening to it,
see how many of them you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.320
can identify.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.780
If you don't like bagpipes,
I would suggest skipping--

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.150
in fact, I'll tell you exactly
how much to skip.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.510
Basically, skip one minute and
30 seconds, because that's how

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.680
long this is going
to play for.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.340
But it is very cool.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.514
[BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.850
It was a bit of an effort
to have this made.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.610
At times, it felt like a
battle of Braveheart

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.030
proportions.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.700
But I do want to thank the House
of Tartan, who are the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.020
people who finally got
this done for me.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.190
And if you want to design your
own pattern or buy a tartan or

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.470
find out more about
it, I strongly

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.920
suggest their website.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.800
Of course, also thanks to Alan
for his piece of music.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.090
We'll have more about
that soon.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.250
So see how much Fibonacci you
saw in there, and we'll come

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.080
back to it.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.810
You're probably wondering what
I'm going to do with this.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.620
And I'm wondering the
same, to be honest.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.970
I've got a few ideas, a few ways
I might be able to share

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.260
it with you guys, the viewers.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.320
But if you've got any
suggestions, it's not too late

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.170
to put something underneath
the video.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.820
And I'll be back soon with
more information.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.500
One last thank you, and that's
to the people at audible.com

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.980
for supporting this
Numberphile video.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.260
And actually, they've got an
offer at the moment, if you're

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.370
in the US or Canada,
where if you go to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.366
audible.com/numberphile, you
can download one of their

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:20.550
100,000 audiobooks for free.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.820
I was having a look through
thinking what

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.880
one should I recommend.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.770
Should it be some Scottish
poetry or something like that?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.270
But then I saw that they have
"Alex's Adventures in

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.520
Numberland." Alex Bellos you may
have seen in some of our

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.430
early Numberphile videos.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.670
And he's got a brilliant
book about numbers.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.570
So go along,
audible.com/numberphile.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.760
Go for your free book.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.040
So thanks again to everyone at
audible.com, because they let

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.235
people like me do crazy things
like make Fibonacci tartans.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.960
I do like it.
