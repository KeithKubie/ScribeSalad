00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.429
Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to the shop. In this video, today

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.159
we're doing one of those experiments that you really shouldn't try at home.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
We're gonna be taking one of these brass cartridge casings, loading it with  an ear plug, and trying to shoot it out of a Glock

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.760
19.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.200
Now the inspiration for today's experiment comes from a YouTube channel called TWANGnBANG, and one of his videos

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.980
I discovered a couple years ago was where he was using ear plugs for target practice.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.440
Apparently if you take an empty cartridge casing with a single primer, and fill it with the ear plug, you can actually get it to

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.040
shoot at reasonable speeds.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.320
So the purpose of our experiment today is really to see if we can replicate those results using a Glock 19 handgun and some empty

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.800
nine-millimetre casings. A standard round of ammunition has three main components. It's got a primer;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.820
It's got the gunpowder inside, and it's got the bullet that gets projected out at great speed.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.160
But take away the bullet, empty out the gunpowder and all we're left with is the primer, and the cartridge casing, which amazingly is just

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.420
the right size for accepting a generic ear plug. Now before we jump into this experiment,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.040
I do want to stress that guns are not toys. This is not an experiment I want you to replicate at home;

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.920
It is here to show the power of the primer itself. The primer is the main source of ignition in a bullet,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.120
but for this video, I wanted to show you just how powerful they are, in and of themselves.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.280
So the premise of this experiment is actually very, very simple; We're just gonna take an empty cartridge casing, with a fresh primer,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.560
We're gonna take one earplug we're gonna squish that end down, push the two together, and let the earplug re-expand.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.560
We're gonna simply load that into the chamber, point it in the safe

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.700
direction, pull the trigger and see what happens. Now whether or not you're playing with toy guns or real

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.180
firearms, all the standard safety procedures do apply. Never point at people, any living thing and always treat the gun as if it's loaded with

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.320
a live round of ammunition.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.900
With that being said, let's go ahead and load our earplug bullets into our Glock 19, blow up some balloons and pull the trigger to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.680
see what happens.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.640
So here we are guys, moment of truth. We've got all of our balloons blown up and taped to the wall.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.320
I think we need to take the first shot at the green one in the middle using an orange earplug bullet.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.720
So you can see we've got no magazine. We've got one earplug bullet in the chamber. Let's make it count okay

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.880
Ok so I was aiming for the green balloon it took the green balloon out you can actually see a mark on the wall right now

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880
Where the earplug hit it oh

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350
my goodness, okay, so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.899
This might not be the smartest thing to do you can actually see it's actually put a hole in my wall an indentation

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.540
Shaped like an earplug. I went straight through that balloon and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.660
Bang on straight into the wall so apparently even though

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.910
This is an earplug it carries a tremendous amount of force

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.330
Which is wild because there's no gunpowder in there all we're using is the primer itself to project it. Isn't that amazing?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.850
Let's try another one

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.450
Alright guys for the second shot

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.729
I don't really want to damage my house much more than I have done already, so I've attached the balloons to this crafting mat

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.259
Which will hopefully soften the impact and prevent any more holes in my wall for the shot

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.840
I'm gonna go for that green balloon on the bottom left.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.480
Oh I missed I missed but where did that hit it might have been a little bit low

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.530
Alright chambers clear I

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.569
was aiming for this balloon right here I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.860
Don't know if they hit it or not, so let's load up another one and try it again

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780
Which one poped the one on the left oh

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.029
yeah, it's an orange balloon because you can see it went up to the top so I was going for this green balloon here and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.869
I think it popped the one just to the left of that orange one which is evidenced by the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.560
Shrapnel you see sticking to the ceiling right now so either these ear plugs aren't as

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.700
Aerodynamically accurate as I was hoping they would be or I'm just a very poor shot in case

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.859
We've got a couple more rounds. We can try a few more shots

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.949
And see if we get anything different this time. I'm going for the blue one and dead center. Oh

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.970
a little to the right interesting

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.709
Alright chambers clear while we're here. I'm going to go for one more

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.099
Which one did I hit oh?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.399
Look the bullet bounced back look at this. I hope we actually recovered the bullet it's got scorch marks

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.310
There's like ripped in half and it's got scorch marks in it

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.019
But that is the bullet that we just shot it bounced off the wall and rolled up my workbench here

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.828
Okay, so we've seen primers by themselves shoot earplugs off with tremendous force

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.490
I have a couple more shells here that still have the Gunpowder in them

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.899
So what do you think will happen if we add earplugs to gunpowder will that make any kind of a difference?

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.478
So I have two ear plug bullets here one green one orange and these cartridges are filled with gunpowder as well

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.910
So let's see how much of a difference the Gunpowder makes

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.340
I'm still thinking that bottom green would be a good shot, so let's go for that. Oh

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.229
Dang that was loud that was ear piercing lis loud. I still missed the green balloon

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.280
You can see it's still intact

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.649
But that was Wow like I think next time I need to put ear plugs in my ears as well as the gun

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.478
So adding gunpowder definitely more power definitely a lot louder not much more accuracy of course it might just be user error

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.949
Right over here. I can actually smell the Gunpowder I can smell that smokeless powder

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.720
It smells delicious. It smells like the fourth of July fantastic

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.919
Let's see if we can find the bullet so just found the green ear plug here. What's really interesting is

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.098
There's a hole in the top here, and it seems to be very consistent like most of them have these little holes near the top

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.320
I'm not sure if that's because it's hanging up in the barrel or something, but that's a little bit odd

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.569
That'll just be chunks missing out of the top probably have something to do with the friction of the barrel

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.788
We can see the rest of the plug is still in tact

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.750
cool

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.649
Round 2 and this time I've got your plugs in my ears

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.369
Once again, I'm going for that stubborn green one from the bottom left

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.699
Nailed it yeah. Oh my gosh, holy heck Oh

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:58.979
Oh

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.589
My goodness look at that it put a hole straight through my craft mat

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.849
Oh it actually put a hole through my wall as well or at least it dented it if you look down there

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.060
There's quite a bit of damage so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.849
From this map being bubbled a little bit apparently there was enough powder in that ear plug to go straight through this mat

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.319
Which I've cut this with scissors. I've cut it with exacto knives, and I've never been able to do any damage to it

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.259
It's self-healing but that ear plug went straight through it and left a nice little scar on the wall behind

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.859
Better do it again. Let's go for the top green

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.979
Where did that one hit oh

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.099
Look at that

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.239
This mat is destroyed. I have to buy a new one it went straight through it hit the wall

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.349
bounced off I

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.359
Was aiming for this green one apparently I was off a little bit to the left

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.750
So look at that it shredded that mat

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.139
That is unbelievable

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.539
That's an earplug all right. I got one shot left guys. I'm going for that orange one

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.669
Just to the left of the blue and right underneath the green

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.799
We got one shot to make it count, and I'm completely destroying my wall, but I'm doing it for you. Are we learning something here

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.698
Haha, okay a little bit high

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.389
So it looks like I hit a little bit high and to the left I check out that green one there

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.800
And if you look at the mat here

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.349
It doesn't look like we did any damage until you pull this forward, or push it back it actually took out that entire

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.109
Section almost as one clean circle look at that. Let's go ahead and take this down. Let's look at the damage

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.110
It's left behind on the wall

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.620
Oh

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.419
Gosh that was not a good idea

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.280
Alright so duct tape on the wall and does that

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.639
Be getting that fixed

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.829
Have to hang a picture there or something that was our first shot right there left a nice little indentation

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.060
That was our second shot that went through the craft paper and then over here. We've got another indentation now

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.970
I didn't see any damage from that last shot and just crack the board itself

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.549
But here we have a totally damaged wall and the most damaged ironically is done from the duct tape itself

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.949
That was used to tape the board to the wall so use caution when using duct tape lesson learned

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:22.100
So there you have a guy's ear plug bullets. It's a relatively viable idea and shoot him off here today

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.100
We learned a few things

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.329
First of all we learned that just because there's no bullet and no gunpowder in a cartridge

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.450
Casing doesn't mean that they're safe if you have a loaded primer on the back it can still pack enough punch to send an earplug

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.379
Bullet flying and leave a fairly substantial impression in the side of your wall

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.279
Taking time to actually aim the gun at a specific target had mixed results

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.219
Sometimes we hit the targets dead-on and other times

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:47.689
They seem to miss completely missing the target by up to 5 inches for one final experiment

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.150
we tried firing ear plugs from cartridge casings with the gunpowder left in them to see what kind of a difference that made and the

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.720
biggest difference

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.760
I noticed is how loud they were I have no way to measure how much faster those projectiles were going

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.409
But they definitely left a lot of damage on my wall and the bang was so loud it left my eardrums ringing

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.170
So the point were actually used earplugs for their intended use so there you have a guy's ear plug bullets they fire

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.159
They fire very quickly they can do a lot of damage is this an experiment you could try at home

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.589
Possibly is it something you should try probably not, but thanks for joining me for this experiment today

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:22.699
So we can see exactly what happens if you did I'll see you in the next video. Talk to you then.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.670
Might be a stupid thing to do

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:30.589
And all we're left with is the cartridge casing

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:38.149
We were shooting earplugs. I kind of wrecked the wall a little bit and check that out
