Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; Larry R. Sarratt:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.200
It is indeed a great pleasure
to be here this afternoon.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.160
My name is Larry R. Sarratt.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm the president of the Daniel
AP Murray African American

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.000
Cultural Association of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.830
I welcome you on behalf of our
first African-American Librarian

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.970
of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.890
And we welcome you to the most
beautiful library in the world.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.050
The Daniel AP Murray Association
of the Library of Congress

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.040
and the Motion Picture
Broadcasting

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.190
and Recorded Sound Division of
the Library of Congress want

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.930
to welcome you to an interview

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.800
with the awesome
Russell Williams, II.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.840
We welcome you and hope that
you will enjoy the interview.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.640
Thank you.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:19.490
[ Applause ]

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.340
Now we will have the
highlight library collections.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.640
Will you all come at this time.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.230
&gt;&gt; Harrison Behl: Hi, everyone.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.420
Everybody can hear me okay?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.720
Okay great.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.820
So, my name is Harrison Behl,
I'm a reference librarian

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.530
in the Recorded Sound
Research Center

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.400
in the Motion Picture Broadcast
and Recorded Sound Division.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.620
And we're very happy to be
cosponsoring this event today,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.200
and we're excited for
the interview as well.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.950
I thought I would just give you
an little bit of an overview

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.290
of our collections, our history,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.330
and some of what we have
available in the recorded sound,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.240
and how it pertains to today.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.300
The recorded sound collections
here at the library are born

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.540
out of deposits that were made
to the library starting back

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.030
in 1926 with early
78 RPM records.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.330
At that time, recorded sound
was part of the music division,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.390
and then in the seventies,
the record

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.790
and sound session was
split out independently

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.230
and the collections were
developed on their own.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.510
Sound recordings weren't covered
under copyright until 1972.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.380
But once they were the library
started acquiring additional

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.500
copies and our collections
really exploded.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.990
So, since that time,
the library's so on.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.300
Since that time the library is
also been actively collecting

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.360
materials that were
produced before then to build

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.110
out a representative historical
collection on sound recordings.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.030
And currently we have about 3.5
million items in our holdings.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.550
They're all stored down
at Culpeper, Virginia,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.700
in the National Audiovisual
Conservation Center,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.600
state-of-the-art
preservation facility

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.010
with climate controlled,
you know, storage spaces

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.730
and also dedicated preservation
staff and processing staff

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.430
that take care of
the collections

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.610
and make them accessible
to the public.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.270
We do that in a couple
of different ways.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.470
There's dedicated preservation
going on all the time

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.560
on large collections
that are prioritized

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.150
by our curatorial sections.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.070
That includes the
NBC radio collection,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.820
over 125,000 disks
we received from NBC,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.550
covering from the 1920s
up into the 1970s.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.150
And those are being
preserved all the time

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.890
and more are being
made available.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.020
But our preservation is
also dictated by the request

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.470
of our patrons and our users,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.790
who come into the Recorded
Sound Research Center,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.240
request materials and we can
get those digitized for them

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.580
on demand and access is
provided up here on the hill.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.960
So, we're the access point

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.080
for this huge collection
that's being taken care

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.530
of down in Virginia.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.310
We have, as you see on the back
table here, we have a display

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.150
of some of the formats that are
included in our collections.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.120
Over 120 years' worth
of ideas for how

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.540
to capture sound recordings.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.230
From cylinders all the
way up to magnetic tapes,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.840
to the infamous 8-track,
and beyond.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.700
So, take a look back there,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.720
we're happy to answer
any questions about them.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.520
And that's part of what makes
our collection so unique

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.060
and challenging is
all the different ways

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.230
that we've you know recorded
material and made it available.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.140
I'm sure Mr. Russell's
career spans quite a few

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.440
of those different formats

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.020
and quite a few challenges
have come up from that as well.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.410
A lot of your material is likely
represented in our collections

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.440
through LP releases and
things like that too.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.000
So, yeah, you're well taken
care of here, and with that,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.410
I'll hand it over to my
colleague from Motion Picture.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.480
&gt;&gt; Josie Walters-Johnston:
Hi, everybody,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.990
my name is Josie
Walters-Johnston.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.020
I'm a reference librarian in the
Moving Image Research Center,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.470
which is the sister reading
room to Harrison's reading room.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.670
We are located in the
Madison Building in room 336,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.120
on the third floor,
right across from P&amp;P.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.990
I just wanted to give you
a short introduction again,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.330
to what our reading room does.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.650
As Harrison explained, we are
split to the two reading rooms,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.110
and also the Packard Campus
down in Culpeper, Virginia.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.020
We have over 1.2 million
moving image items,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.900
that cover all sorts of formats.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.850
And along with that, we
probably have another 2 million

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.680
like paper documents to support
the research of that film

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.980
and television material.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.980
The items in our collections
expands the history of film

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.830
and television industry.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.260
From Edison kinetoscopic record
of a sneeze, which was produced

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.070
in 1894, to last season's
"Stranger Things."

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.380
So, it's kind of like a
lot, a lot of material

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.030
that we have in the collection.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.240
But we also have
feature films, newsreels,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.010
educational industrial films,
television news, documentaries,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.390
reality TV program, TV
ads, and much, much more.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.730
As Harrison said
in his statement,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.170
the majority the material that
we get in our collection is

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.470
through [inaudible] deposit.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.210
You want to register
material with us,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.730
you need to send us a copy.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.190
But then we also have things
like gift collections,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.270
and things that were
donated to us.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.350
NBC Television news
collection is a huge collection

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.650
that we have.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.860
In the back, some of
the display items,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.480
it's actually the first episode
of a series called "Wide,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.290
Wide World" from 1955,
I believe that was.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.410
So, it's kind of an
ornamental cover.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.270
They didn't all come, all
the reels did not come

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.710
in gold-plated kind of cover
things, but so we have things

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.490
like that in our
collection as well.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.060
Another very large
collection is the NET,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.590
National Educational
Television, PBS collection.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.410
Huge collection.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.430
And actually, on that
note, in terms of material

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.370
that is accessible,
that collection is now,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.690
or parts of that
collection can be accessible

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.800
through the American
Archive of Public Television.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.140
The cool thing about
that collection,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.700
you do not necessarily have

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.270
to physically be here
to get that material.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.450
You can log onto the
website from wherever

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.010
and you can watch
PBS programming.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.600
Most of it is going to
probably focus more on,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.660
like local PBS stations,
which is actually pretty cook,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.510
but there are some of the
larger programs as well.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.280
Searching for materials
in our collection,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.510
it means utilizing a bunch
of different resources.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.640
There's the Library of
Congress online catalog

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.660
of the MIRC Audiovisual
Information System, Mavis,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.190
which is an inhouse, we
still have a card catalog,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.200
we still love our card catalog.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.120
And we also have finding aids.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.230
Without getting into a lot
of detail on how to do those,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.100
I'd might be happy, if you come
down and visit, give us a call,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.730
we can talk about how
to access that material,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.390
how best to utilize
the resources there.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:14.150
As I mentioned, the majority of
material is stored in Culpeper.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.590
So, most requests for
reviewing material needs

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.890
to be made in advance.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.440
The only exception
to that is anything

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.640
that has already been digitized.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.060
If something has been digitized,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.630
we can usually give
it to you on the spot.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.230
Unlike what your experience
might be in Recorded Sound,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.960
which is almost completely
digital,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.270
when you come into listen.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.360
In the Moving Image Research
Center, you might be accessing

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.790
like several different
formats on one day.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.220
So, you might have say, coming
in tomorrow, going to start

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.070
with my 16-mm film, I'm going
to walk around to the other side

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.410
of the viewing room,
going to watch some 35.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.230
Then, I'm going to go
to the other side again,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.870
and watch a laser disc.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.340
Maybe pop in Betamax,
watch a DVD.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.300
Maybe a three-quarter
inch pneumatic tape

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.250
and then end my day
watching digital material.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.310
So, we cover all of
those different formats.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.230
And then, in addition to
the moving image themselves,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.870
we also have paper material.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.950
So, we have periodicals,
reference books, subject files,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.270
screenplays, transcripts,
photographs, lobby cards,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.920
press kits, pretty much anything

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.880
that will help supplement your
film or television research.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.840
In the back, just to point
out a couple of the examples

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.710
and material that
are back there.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.360
The first thing you'll see
is actually a press kit

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.660
from "Field of Dreams."

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.300
It's actually the press kit and
production notes are inside.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.340
And I already mentioned
there's the NBC TV collection,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.220
the "Wide, Wide World"
premiere episode.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.850
And then, items 3
and 4 are essentially

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.150
from the same collection.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.450
Our earliest collection.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.960
It's called the paper
print collection.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.350
That's a portion of it
called the paper print

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.650
fragment collection.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.930
So, this is material that was
received before there was a way

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.040
to register your
films for copyright.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.870
So, this would be
anything before 1912.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.580
So, those are back
there as well.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.620
And then, on the side,
we both have handouts

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.470
that you can take with you.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.900
There is just pamphlet
information

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.200
about both reading rooms.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.520
There's how to search, we
have viewing guidelines,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.630
there's some MI; MI?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.350
Moving image resources,
spell it all out.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.410
And then I did take some time
to go through out collection

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.780
to see what films and television
programs that we actually have

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.240
with Mr. Williams, and we
pretty much have all of them,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.150
except for I would say, I'm
going to estimate, 10 things.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.990
And so, this will include
really early stuff from 1981,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:53.250
and then all the way through his
unedited history makers there's

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.380
like three plus hours oral
history interview, so,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.260
and it's really cool
to listen to.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.520
So, I encourage everyone here
to stop by, come visit us,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.990
pop in just to say hi.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.220
I'd be happy to talk to anybody

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.520
about any questions
you may have.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.410
If you're looking for
something specific,

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.970
I'd be happy to help you.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.770
Thanks guys.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.370
[ Applause ]

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.470
Larry R. Sarratt: Thank
you, Harrison and Josie

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.890
for that wonderful
introduction of the collection

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.140
that we have in the back.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.280
Here, at the Library of Congress
we have just about anything

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.280
that you want to research is
here in these three buildings.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.160
I mean when you say you want to
come to the Library of Congress,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.360
you really need to know which
building you're coming to.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.130
Because we have three buildings
and mostly everybody go

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.800
into the most beautiful library
in the world before they come

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.350
to the Madison Building, or
either the Adams Building.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.320
So, we have just about anything
you want here at the library.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.400
At this time, we're going
to have our introduction

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.890
by Iris Taylor, she's
our treasurer

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.510
of the Daniel AP
Murray Association.

[ Applause ]

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.640
&gt;&gt; Iris Taylor: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.760
Good afternoon everyone.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.060
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.850
&gt;&gt; And welcome to this
delightful program.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.800
Over a year ago, on Dr.
Martin Luther King's birthday,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.140
I attended a dear
friend's, Dr. Cheryl LaRoche,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.900
annual MLK luncheon celebration.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.210
While there I met an
amazing person named, Joy.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:41.930
Joya, and we chatted
and of course I talked

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.890
about the Library of Congress

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.460
and the Daniel AP Murray
African American Association,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.610
and Joya said, "I know
the perfect person to come

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.620
to the Library of Congress.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.150
He is down to earth, very
nice, very kind, and so forth."

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.730
Then she mentioned the film,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.530
"Glory" I'm thinking
Denzel Washington.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.280
I said, wow.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.760
You never know who you may meet.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.440
I say all that because today,
I have the pleasure and honor

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.600
to introduce Mr. Russell
Williams, II who is native

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.390
of Southeast Washington DC
and also a former employee

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.760
of the Library of Congress.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.000
He received interdisciplinary
bachelor's degree

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in film production, art
history and literature

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.250
from the American
University in 1974.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.110
Soon after that, he
worked at WRC NBC-TV

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.130
as an engineer during the week
and comanaged Spirits Known

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.640
and Unknown, a radio
workshop on campus

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.030
for minority communication
students that was unique

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.820
in the public radio network.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.450
Williams moved to
the Los Angeles,

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.010
California area in 1979.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.710
In Los Angeles he built
a reputation for getting

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.510
to the oral center of the
scene and preserving it as well

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.140
as marry it to the visual.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.740
His career has spanned
live network television

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.040
with a list too numerous
to announce.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.120
If you picked it up in
the back, oh my goodness.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:39.460
Including the Watergate hearing,
radio production, theater,

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.020
multitrack recording,
film documentary,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.870
and feature film
sound recordings.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.380
His quest for perfection has
garnered him two Academy Awards

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.010
in the category sound
for the movies "Glory"

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.480

Versus Salim Ajami,"
and "12 angry men."

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:12.510
He is the first African-American
multi-Academy Award winner.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:19.950
[ Applause ]

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.420
Mr. Williams of his many years
of experience in the industry

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.600
and apply those blessings
to produce in a career.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.790
He is very passionate about.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.090
He has worked jointly with Isis
Films director Bobby Holland

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.780
on videos, commercials and
behind the scenes documentaries.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.080
This seasoned veteran

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.700
of the motion picture
world has spent more

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.850
than 30 years applying his
trade on all but two continents

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.170
and in all 4 of the 50 states.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.270
His credo has been
getting the most

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.610
with the least clutter
and confusion.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.810
In 2002, Williams
relocated back to Washington,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.890
DC where he now serves
as a distinguished artist

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.640

at the American University.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.670
Let's give a resounding applause
to Mr. Russell Williams,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.510
who will be interviewed
by Luis Clavell.

This is a great honor to be here
with Professor Russell Williams,

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.430
II, and I thank the Daniel
AP Murray African American

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.410
Let's get right to it.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.710
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.890
I just want to apologize
I couldn't get Denzel here

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.190
for you today [laughter].

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.280
He was busy.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.700
But he sends his love as always.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000

Don't worry prof,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.300
you're looking pretty
good yourself.

&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: Thank you, man.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.900
Thank you.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.200
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Let's
just get right into it

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.100
because we had a chance to talk
to one another through the week

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.260
and I'm so excited to start.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.970
Let's talk about DC.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.170
Let's talk about Southeast
Washington, DC and your parents,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.850
who I think had a
very fundamental role

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.320
to play in your life.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.680
I love the stories
of your mom and dad.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.770
And just to start to
talk about the DC of old.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.070
The old Southeast.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.140
The southeast where kids
were raised by members

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.120
of the community
and their parents.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.590
People cared in a certain way

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.320
and compassion I think was
there, if I remember correctly.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.090
So, if we could start there.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.610
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
Well, Luis thank you.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.740
And thank everybody
who came out today.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.510
There's some other distinguished
Southeast residents

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.620
and kids in the room.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.610
One I want to point out right
off the top is a retired federal

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:25.070
Judge Gerald B. Lee, who
is a co-manager [applause]

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:30.980
and co-creator of
spirits known and unknown.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.230
And I have a very dear
first cousin sitting

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.960
in the front row, Althea.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.510
Would you wave at everyone?

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.410
Rolled in from Nevada
last night, rolling back

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.520
to Nevada this afternoon,
she just wanted to come here

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.680
and bring the family love.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.260
I have other family members
here, but Southeast that we grew

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.240
up in was a very
tightknit community.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.470
It's not the Southeast
that you typically see

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.770
on television today.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.150
Generally, it's bad
news if Southeast shows

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:08.810
up on TV these days and it's
a really unfair portrayal.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:14.010
Everybody knew everybody
else's kids, Luis, everybody,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.990
all the kids knew
everybody else's parents.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.330
So, just because you went around
the corner and broke a bottle,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.470
or maybe, you know threw a
piece of paper in the middle

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.280
of the street, or something
in someone's yard and ran

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.910
around the corner assuming

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.940
that you had gotten
away with something.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.430
I'm sorry old ma Bell, on
those rotary telephones,

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.090
you young people Google
that see what it looks like.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.110
You know, there's no
digital devices back then,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.410
just Google it.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.590
And mom or dad or
somebody would be standing

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.500
out on the porch waiting
for you to get back.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.730
Were you at Mr. Clavell's place
and did you break a bottle

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.540
in front of his house,
and you know.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.050
So, we knew that
all eyes were on us.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.930
We also knew that
you were penalized

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.430
if you disrespected your
elders, you were penalized

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.040
if you disrespected
other people's property.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.540
We were also taught that
regardless of one's station

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.490
in life from an economic
standpoint, a job, or title,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.540
you had to respect everybody.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:20.110
And everyone could take a piece
of you if you step out of line.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.550
That's at church,
that's at school.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.850
You know what I'm saying,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.150
that's one of the
neighbors up the street.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:31.840
I remember distinctly, I think
second grade, I hit somebody

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.260
with a spitball, first
thing in the morning.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.570
Okay, boom, teacher
took me out by the hand,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.560
making sure that I
felt pain on the way

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.880
to the assistant
principal's office,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.160
this was at Davis
Elementary School, by the way.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160
Then the assistant
principal took a piece of me,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.770
and then they did the most
horrible thing I could imagine,

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.800
they called my mother at home.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.250
And mother, who at that time
wasn't driving had to walk

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.640
to school to get her
recalcitrant son.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.390
Walk me back, tuning
me up all the way.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.550
So, that was probably
10;30 in the morning,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.030
so I'm thinking okay I'm done,
right, but here comes about 5:30

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.330
or 6, here comes my dad.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.440
And it starts all over again.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.530
I only had one job to do,
that was to get As and Bs,

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.400
and if I'm in school
clowning and being disruptive,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.090
that's not the son that he
and his wife wanted to raise.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.130
And even as a high
school student at Wilson,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.020
if I'm standing at the
bus stop on Benning Road,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.930
my old Davis principal would
roll by and say, "Williams,

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.760
are you still getting
As and Bs, have you been

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.060
in any kind of trouble?

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.360
I'm going to check on you.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.660
I'm going to check with
your dad, to make sure."

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.070
I mean this seemed like
a lifelong connection,

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.000
that was the southeast
that we grew up in.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
The people I pointed out and I'm
sure others that are in here.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.500
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Yeah, well
we'd really like to get some

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.430
of those qualities back
into the community.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.150
and part of the value
of speaking

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.890
with you today is
having a master's class

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.440
with a master teacher.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.430
And I think that as we listen,
the young people and people

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.170
with children in the
audience, as well as people

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.060
that are your age can
reflect on the experience.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.910
Maybe we can get
back to some of that.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.880
Let's talk about say,
high school and Wilson.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.640
I know that you played band
and were talking about sound.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.190
Sound design and a
great within that genre,

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.480
so was Bennett Wilson
the first area of sound

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.290
that you entered into?

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.190
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Well I
will have to go back a few years

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.790
when I was actually
about 10 years old.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.810
I was attending a church in
Northwest with my parents

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.350
and for some reason
I want to say

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.190
of the choir was
singing spiritual,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.970
the title is 'Hear a Voice a
Praying,' and it was acapella.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.460
And they were in
good form that day.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.710
And I got a little misty
eyed, and some of the elders

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.430
who saw me in the
congregation ran to my mom

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:56.110
and said I think Russell's been
called to preach [laughter].

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.320
No, but I do want to
take piano lessons.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.550
So, about 10 years old, I
started taking piano and one

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.860
of the pictures that's
going by is me standing

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.220
between two ladies, one of
those ladies was my first piano

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.130
teacher Claretta Proctor.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.940
And that's also a shot
of me right on there now

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.560
at a recital that just passed.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.180
So, playing piano
was the first thing

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.770
that really made me
a critical listener.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.410
Playing piano also was the
first time that I realized,

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:32.500
I'd heard this whole story about
music can calm the savage beast,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.260
but you know that's stuff
that old folks say to you,

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.560
it doesn't really mean anything,

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.150
they're just saying
that stuff to you.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.360
Just to get your
out of their face.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.180
So, for some reason, I
can't remember what it was,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.780
I was very upset with my mom
one day, and I said okay,

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.200
and she was watching
her soap operas.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.650
I said, I'm going to ruin her
day, I'm going to go downstairs

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.360
and start banging on the
piano, so loud that it's going

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.020
to interrupt her watching
the soap opera, right?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.950
And I kind of wore myself
out doing that and I said,

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.700
well I'm down here, I
might as well do my lesson,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.930
which wasn't anything really
complicated at that point it was

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.340
like de, da, de, da, de,
da, de; na, na, de, da, de.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.500
You know it wasn't anything
like Rachmaninoff of Bach

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.460
or anything, but literally about
three or four minutes later,

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.900
I couldn't remember
what I was angry about.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.710
And so that was the first
time I realized how music can

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.010
transport you.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.240
I would blame the 1959
"Ben-Hur," which I saw

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.090
as a 7-year-old for
really showing me the power

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.100
of music in film.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.470
Because I know I was sitting
next to my parents, and I said,

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.830
I don't know what this
movie is going to be about,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.670
but it sounds very important.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.310
But, you know 10 years old
was when I could put my hands

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.100
on an instrument
for the first time.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.150
So, that led to going to Wilson
by my Piano teacher's suggesting

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.740
to get onto an orchestral
instrument

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.400
as well as playing piano.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.560
That's when I really developed
an appreciation for rangers

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.680
and composers and
things like that.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.720
And as far as I was concerned,
I was going to be a music major.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.640
And then my master pianist
made the mistake of telling me

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.340
about some of his co-eds at
Peabody Conservatory, a couple,

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.610
three had jumped out of a window

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.230
because they had
failed the final exam.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.630
I said, you know what?

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.310
Maybe not, maybe not.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.610
You know, I want to
keep my love as music

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.490
as something that's no
pressure involved, you know.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.170
And so, that's when I kind of
started thinking about something

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.210
in the communications field by
the time I got to American U.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.510
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Well,
that's interesting,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.620
I can see the less
dangerous approach.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.350
But then, after the piano, I
think you picked up the tuba,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.060
which seems like a dangerous
instrument, back again.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.360
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Well,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.660
it was dangerous riding
on the Maryland bus.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.690
You all remember the WMA
bus, now that's real DC folks

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.330
if you can remember DC Transit.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.440
But then on the other side
of town was this orange kind

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.010
of brownish bus called
WMA, which was kind

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.890
of like the second
cousin from a bad marriage

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.410
in terms of transit systems.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.580
And by that time, I was
at Kramer Junior High,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.730
and Ms. Lockhart, who
was our band director,

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.460
orchestra director actually.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.140
Said, oh I'm so happy
that you want to pick

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.810
up another instrument,
and she had this room full

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.830
of instruments that
nobody was playing

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.940
and so she was suggesting
maybe a clarinet,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.620
or maybe a violin or something.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.920
And I'm thinking,
no I don't want

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.990
to take another hard instrument.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.370
And is said what's that orphan
in the corner over there.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.670
It was a tuba.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.880
It was kind of bent up, and
it needed some Brasso on it.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.180
So, she said, oh that'd be great

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.480
because I don't really
have anybody playing

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.050
in the low register.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.020
And I knew already, I could
pick up the tuba parts probably

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.200
by Monday, and just sound
the note on the piano,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.590
find it on the tuba,
and you know,

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.360
I could already read music.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.680
So, that was a done deal.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.520
Right, except I said okay so
where's the case [laughter].

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.190
Oh, there is no case.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:47.540
Okay, so here's pudgy
Russell on the bus with a tuba

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.570
and so you all can go on and
figure out the comedy routines

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.560
that spawn from those
trips back and forth.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.110
But anyway, you know, I
weather that as a lot of other,

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.180
you know, banter
in southeast, DC.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.470
I mean I think growing up in
southeast made it really easy

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.160
to merge into professional
work was when people think

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.270
that they've cut you,
they've insulted you,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.980
they said something
that was going

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.400
to you know get you
off of your mark.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.350
And I'm like, no, you got to,
you need to go to grad school.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.530
You go to middle
school in southeast,

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.020
then you can learn
how to insult people.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.010
This isn't even an
inconvenience, you know.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.000
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell:
I see your point.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.150
I also remember you talking
about your dad, and the lessons

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.560
that you learned from him.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.940
I would imagine at that
time, when you're going

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.490
through high school
your relationship

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.050
with him was very connected.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:41.360
Can you talk a little bit
about what he did and what kind

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.890
of influence he had on you

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.190
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Well,

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.740
you know I'm probably
not unusual in this room,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:54.430
especially at with my tender
age 30 times 2, plus 5.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.730
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.750
Now, y'all don't rush me.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.340
I'll get there, but
I'm not there yet.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.310
So, I actually, I had two dads.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.940
So, I had Russell
Williams, senior.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.380
And unfortunately, I'd lost
my birth mother the day

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.170
after I was born.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:17.630
So, standing there in the
emergency room was James Harshaw

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.480
and my mother's next
oldest sister, Ruth.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.520
And they were childless, and
they made the commitment right

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.860
at that moment to say, you
know, we'll raise your son.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.000
Because Russell Williams
is working the night shift

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.190
at Union Station as a reg cap.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.690
So, basically, it was tag team.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.770
He was a Taurus, Russell
Williams the first,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.260
James Harshaw was a Taurus, and
I want to say Ruth was a Taurus.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.770
It was actually you know I was
getting it three different ways.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.620
So, James Harshaw was
a master carpenter,

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.100
he worked at the
government printing office.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.030
And he also, you know,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.850
like pretty much any other
African American male

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.460
or female back then, they had
two or three other side jobs.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.040
He drove a cab, you
know on days off.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.820
He also, because of
being a master carpenter,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.190
he would get together with other
buddies, a next-door neighbor

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.190
who couldn't be here today,
her husband was a painter

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.530
and down the street
we had a mason,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.880
and around the corner we had
someone who did electrical work.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.260
And they did a lot of
recreational rooms.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.560
You remember those, the you
know the knotty pine walls,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.090
and the drop ceilings
and all of that.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.720
And you know, I'm sawing
wood and doing this kind

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.790
of stuff saying, I'm never
going to be a carpenter,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.090
[inaudible] carpenter job.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.560
But, you know, I
learned the trade.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.600
I learned how important
it was to be precise.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.120
I learned how important
it was to make sure

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.420
that the customer satisfied.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.260
So, that was that was one of
the lessons from James Harshaw.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.570
And I use that lesson

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.790
about learning a trade
later on in life.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.320
Russell Williams, senior
he loved the blues.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.140
His motto or his saying,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.280
regardless of when all the
other voices, my half-sisters

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.370
and everybody were
in the room partying,

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.550
and discussing the pros
and cons of this, that,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.910
and music artists of this style.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.370
And they would get
all up in arms.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.390
He'd say, look, he said
don't sweat the small stuff.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.610
And so that was, you would
hear him say at least two

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.610
or three times a visit,
don't sweat the small stuff.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.310
He was only focused
on the big picture.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.620
So, there weren't too
many folks I could go

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.060
to to have a pity party.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.740
You know, Mr. Harshaw would say,
well, you know that's a problem.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.710
But you know what half the
people are glad you have

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.040
problems, the other
half don't care,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.390
so which group are you
going to complain to.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.690
That was his way of saying,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.990
you have to work
this out on your own.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.290
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Fantastic.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.590
I want to get back
to some of the things

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.190
that Mr. Harshaw told you
before you went to NBC.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.360
Because I think that's
fantastic.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.290
But I think this is
a good point to start

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.590
to talk about the library.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.890
Is that okay?

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.190
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: Absolutely.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.680
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: All right,
well Professor Williams,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.170
you've been an employee
of the library before.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.290
Could you describe that
experience a little for us.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.630
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
There's a gentleman who is not

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.840
with us today, meaning he's
still on the planet but not

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.340
in the room today,
Lowell Vincent Muse.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.570
He was also part of the spirits
known and unknown workshop.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:10.370
And he was working part-time
here at the Library of Congress.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.140
By this time I was an undergrad
at American U. And he mentioned,

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.730
hey, you know, the LOC has these
part-time gigs, I think it was 4

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.370
to 8:15 or 8:30, every
day, 5 days a week.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.870
So, you could get your classes
out of the way, come down here

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.960
and make some good old
government money, right.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.540
And in my parents'
generation coming

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.980
from the Carolinas you know
you had reached the mountaintop

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.720
when you have a federal
government job.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.260
All right, you could
basically relax.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.750
And just know that you put your
kids in college, you could buy

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.030
that boat that you wanted, or
you know, buy a vacation home

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.590
or something, or whatever
you wanted to do it right.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.310
So, I said, great.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.670
I applied for the job, it was in
the stack and reader division,

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.210
does that still exist?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.850
No stack and reader anymore?

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.440
Okay, all right, but you
know what I'm talking about.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.180
I was handling the PZs.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.200
A lot of the literature
books, right, okay.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.650
Yes, and running over to their
conveyor belt to put, you know,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.370
books down that would
end up in main control.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.320
And as would happen as you
were going down the corridors

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.780
of the Jefferson Building
every now and then,

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.940
I'd look up at the job
board, and I saw this job

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.570
from what was then
called the music division.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.870
And it talked about, well
first of all you need

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.770
to understand professional
audio gear, I'm like well yeah,

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.620
I'm on the radio,
so that's a start.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.230
A quarter inch tape
recording, yeah I can do that.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.470
Equalization, so on,
and so on, and so on.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.510
And this would be a
fulltime job, you know,

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.440
in the preservation of
old materials like you see

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.140
in the back of the room.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.780
In our era we were working
with the 16-inch planners from

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.300
"Major Bowes Amateur Hour."

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.860
I know you've read about
it, but none of the people

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.560
in this room have
actually heard Major Bowes,

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.740
I mean nobody's that old.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.110
But you can hear
recordings of it,

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.070
that's what I was
doing at first at LOC.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:15.710
And that lasted until
probably the spring of 1973,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.880
when the opportunity to
take a temporary sink

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.930
or swim job at Channel
4 came up.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.300
TV engineers are what they
call summer relief engineer.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.620
So, you were working for union
scale, and you would be working

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.010
on whatever WRC, NBC
was putting on the air,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.060
but the caveat was
you got a chance

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.660
to make three on-air mistakes.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.520
That third mistake ends up
on air, you are a memory.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.930
That means see you,
bye, nothing person.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.330
So, I gave up one delivery.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:52.710
The second one actually was
because I had trusted Pepco

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.820
to keep power on all night,
even during a thunderstorm,

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.510
of course, that didn't happen.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.600
So, I was late for
work one time.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.220
I never had that problem again.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.500
And so, I got through
the rest of my summer

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.070
without getting to that third.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:11.930
They had a term for it,
the initials were DS.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:14.900
So, I got out of there
without that third DS.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.460
But my parents are
very disappointed in me

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.410
because I was leaving a
could of been permanent job

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:24.720
for the federal government, to
take a chance on a temporary job

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.500
in this crazy TV business.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.790
And I said well, as politely as
I could, I said well understand,

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.710
you guys came up from the
cotton fields, one of the things

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.800
that you did by coming up from
the cotton fields was give me

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.560
the honor of not having to
pick cotton at all except off

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.590
of a hanger in the closet.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.950
Also, you've all
given me a platform

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.540
that I can hopefully
write my own ticket,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.830
as opposed to just following
completely in your footsteps,

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.670
so I said that's what my
mission is is to go further

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.970
than you've allowed me to go,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.910
and further than you all
could go in your era,

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.810
I've got to push it further.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:06.770
So, I took the job at NBC, and
that was a successful summer,

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.950
but it showed me that I could
make it in show business

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.310
and that sounds like a
kind of egotistical remark.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.030
But there was this little thing
called the Watergate Hearings

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:19.560
that was going on in the summer
of '73, and I worked along

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.230
with a lot of the other
crew people there,

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:26.180
we worked 22-hour
days 5 days a week.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.340
All right?

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.310
So, that means you would
bring some clothes in with you

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.850
on Monday and a bar of soap.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.990
You would sleep on a bench
between midnight and 2 a.m.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.620
and 2 a.m. you were
back on the stage,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.510
lighting "The Today Show."

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.590
That's when I knew, okay I
can put up with the hours,

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.170
I can put up with
live television,

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.620
because if you make
a mistake on live TV,

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.290
there is no bringing it back.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:52.950
That era was Barbara Walters as
the cohost of "The Today Show."

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.800
And Frank McGee was
the other person.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.140
John Chancellor was
the nightly news guy.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.510
So, that was the era.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.310
And I still had one
year at American U

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:02.830
to finish, but I was like, okay.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.930
As far as I was concerned, it
was going to be broadcast TV.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.270
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Fascinating,
and let's talk more about NBC

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.640
and Watergate, because I think

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.720
that that's a very
important area.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.020
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
That's not relevant today.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.610
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: I
think it could be.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:20.420
Could be. Could be the way that
things get lost even in emails,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.000
reminds me of the few minutes

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.180
of the phone calls
that were also lost.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.440
So, during the time
that you started at NBC,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.480
I can remember you
telling me a story

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.610
of some advice that
you'd gotten.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.840
It started out never
use a hammer

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.880
when a screwdriver would do.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.390
And I just wanted you to
kind of like turn the corner

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.630
on that story and
let us know about how

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.470
that advice really
helped you to get

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:50.420
through another very
interesting situation at NBC.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.190
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Well,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.150
getting the job NBC
number one was a miracle.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.480
Because I ended up going
to the interview directly

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.290
from the Jefferson
Building on my lunch break.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:07.430
And I was tipped by a young lady
up there named Easter Winters

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:13.400
who is the chief engineer's
executive assistant.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.120
And she called me at work and
said you know the interview

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.220
that you had set
up for tomorrow,

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.280
by tomorrow all those
jobs will be filled.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.770
Can you come this afternoon?

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.020
I was like oh, because I didn't
have a suit on like I have

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.320
on now, I had on a nice dashiki.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.190
You young people Google that.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.360
You can see what I'm
talking about, you know.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.350
So, here I am going to
the most conservative

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.700
of the then three networks,

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.510
if you can imagine
that in a dashiki.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.060
I didn't like my chances.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.370
And I told Easter, well, maybe.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.670
She said, no, no, no.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.180
If you come tomorrow it will be
a purely ceremonial interview.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.670
Today is the thing.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.950
Went up there, met a
gentleman name Mr. Kirkham,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.250
chit chat, chit chat, chit chat.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.660
I tried to just blind him with
my personality and good looks,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.480
so he wouldn't see the
shirt I was wearing.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.750
You know? And you know, told
him all the things I had done,

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.430
the Library of Congress, WAMUFM.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.170
I did not have a first class
FCC license, which is one

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.610
of the things he wanted.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.120
And we had a good interview,
but now we're on our way

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.930
out the door, we're about
to get to the corridor

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.750
and I haven't closed the deal.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.670
And just before he gave me
that last little shove back

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.990
into the hallway, I
said, oh yeah and how's

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.590
that new PCP 90 working out,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:36.570
which was the then brand new
minicam that RCA had created,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.300
he says, you know
about the PCP 90?

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.450
I said yeah, absolutely,
it sounds like,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.760
and this is where I use my
American University education.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.210
I said this sounds
like it's going

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.550
to revolutionize
the newsgathering

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.250
business [laughter].

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.930
I was praying that
something was going

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.290
to get through to this guy.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.810
And he said, okay, he said,
well would you like to see it?

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.560
I said it's here already?

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.540
He takes me back to the shop,
he shows me this camera,

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.780
we're sitting there like,
pardon me, two ladies looking

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.430
through the maternity room
glass at this brand new camera,

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.420
and then he whispers two
words that I'll never forget,

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.720
he said well when can you start?

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.580
I said well, I'll be
back here at 5 o'clock.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.930
He said, no we'll
call you in two weeks.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.480
So, cut to the story that
Luis is referring to.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.650
So, because it's a union shop,
because it's a seniority shop,

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.460
the people that NBC had
at the time in its employ,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.040
that they couldn't be fired
because of their seniority,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.800
but they had some
questionable credentials.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.620
Two or three of these gentlemen
were card carrying clansmen.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.930
Not rumored to be, actually.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.160
And one of those
gentlemen was the supervisor

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.340
of projection island, which
is where I was working,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.370
and you know he did a
fair job of telling me how

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.420
to turn the projector on
and off, how to thread it

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.720
and so forth and so on,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.430
but he wasn't giving
me any real details.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:03.220
And eventually after three weeks
of trying to appeal to his ego

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.090
and other tactics to try to get
him to kind of loosen up on some

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.830
of that information
he had stored up here,

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.590
one of the black
technical directors,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.070
a gentleman named Carl Bailey,

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.110
I think he was the first
black TV TD in the country.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.130
He said, man you don't have to
worry about him, just go back

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.830
to the maintenance
shop, get the book,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.130
get the maintenance manual.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.670
I was like yes.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.970
And he said, then
you can come back

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.290
on your lunch hour
and you can read.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.590
I said no.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.890
He said no?

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.190
I said no, no.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.070
I'm going to bring that
to my workstations.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.370
Yeah, okay bring it
to your workstation.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.980
I said no, but listen
to what I'm saying,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.160
bring it to my workstation,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.110
with his orientation
there's no way he's going

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.110
to walk past me seeing
me reading something

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.940
and not come check on
what I'm reading, okay.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.050
That's the bait.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.390
And then I took another
piece of my AU education

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.230
and brought my little legal
pad with me and a pen.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.930
I knew when he was
coming back from lunch.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.930
I had the book open, I'm
writing my notes down,

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.320
I'm being a very good
college student here.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.360
And he comes up over my shoulder
and he asked me was I trying

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.660
to get a job in maintenance?

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.960
I said, well no, I
said well, you know,

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.900
here's something you
don't know about me.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.980
So, I had already set up three

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.270
or four code messages
in this reply.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.140
Number one, my dad's
a master carpenter.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.790
So, that means he has a
trade, you have a trade.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.940
The worst whooping, I got from
my dad, I've been disciplined

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.040
and you know what discipline
is, you probably handed out some

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.950
of yours yourself, am I write,
was then I used a hammer

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.550
and a screwdriver to do the
job of a hammer and a chisel.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:33.140
And my dad said to me, boy,
which code number three, right?

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.280
If you can't use my tools in a
proper manner, don't touch them.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.800
I make my living with my tools.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.500
And then I turned to
him and I said sir,

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.200
I said these tools back here
are a lot more expensive,

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.840
I just want to make sure
I know what I'm doing.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.940
Victory [laugther].

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.380
From that point on he showed
me every screw adjustment,

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.150
every circuit breaker,
every lubrication point,

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.870
how to run the 35-mm projector,
which meant that when he was

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.060
out of the building, I was
the only person who'd do

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.460
"Meet The Press."

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.290
Because at the time, that was
the only national commercial

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.290
that Channel 4 only
national commercial

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:11.590
that Channel 4 ran locally.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.740
All the rest of them
would run from New York.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.710
But you know, I try to mention
that story to folks today,

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.440
because folks that
you don't agree with,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.410
you don't understand, or
don't agree with there on,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.720
if that is the door
you have to go through,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.430
you have to go through
that door.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.670
So, I said there's got to
be a way I can get this guy

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.520
to understand, I'm not here to
pour molasses in the equipment.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.830
I'm not here of spray paint
NAACP over that projector.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:41.260
I just want to be an NBC
engineer, have a white shirt,

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.390
RCA pocket protector,
little air hose

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.830
to blow the dust
out of the gate.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.120
And put my 8, or 9, or 12
hours in and collect my check.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.480
Now, he never invited me over
for dinner, but that was okay.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.780
That was okay.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.330
From that summer on,
he basically made sure

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.370
if there was any question about
that shop that I needed to ask,

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.390
come ask him, because he
knew where everything was.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.690
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Fantastic.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.680
I think there is a
huge secret to success

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.070
in what you just told us.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.110
And your life represents
that for us.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.300
So, we are honoring you today
and I'm just really reminded

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.120
of that with a story like that.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.770
Is it okay if we get to
1979 and going to LA?

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.070
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
Yeah, let's roll with it.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.370
Let's roll with it.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.940
These people are only getting
older out there listening to me.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.820
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: It's
1979, what's going

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.850
on with what are you thinking

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.150
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: Well, at that time,

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.810
and this is well before Homeland
Security had come along.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.030
There were a lot more
feature film shooting in DC,

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.700
at least portions of them, one
of them I remember seeing is

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.240
"Being There" with
Peter Sellers.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.240
I just saw Peters Sellers
walking down 14th Street

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.540
and some other locations.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.920
And so, by this time, I had
also worked at Channel 7, local,

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.360
which was shooting news on film.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.700
And so, that was my first
professional experience working

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.000
with film.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.980
So, I said you know,
maybe it's time to think

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.370
about taking the Neste plunge
and going to Los Angeles to see

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:19.660
if I could get into
big show business.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.090
From "Ben Hur," I recognized

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.230
that sometimes you don't
recognize the miracles

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.750
that are right in front of
you, but miracles still exist.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.980
So, in the same pile of mail
that I got a no thank you

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.090
from AFI, when I applied
to their directing program,

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:39.470
good old Uncle Sam gave me
a nice income tax return.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.500
I said, you know what, there's
more than one way to get to LA.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.620
So, there was this airline
back then, called TWA.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:50.760
You all Google it, you
young folks, Google it.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.250
I had planned to go to LA, and
I took a 90-day leave of absence

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.820
from WMAL radio, which
was my permanent job

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.450
at the time, to try LA.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:07.580
I was also headed down the
aisle in September of that year.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.600
And I had wedding plans already
in place, deposits had been put

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.620
down on a rehearsal hall
or something like that,

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.560
why are you laughing, Sam?

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.020
I'm trying to tell a story over
here and you're interrupting me.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:26.200
And as things do happen in
your life from time to time,

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.750
at the time, the betrothed
and I were both going to LA,

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:32.120
because she was working
here for WETA

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.460
and planned to go to KCET in LA.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.430
And of course, I was just going
to go to anybody out there

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.190
that would get me a paycheck.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.900
And then at the last minute

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.450
or she decided she
didn't think she could be

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.820
that far away from her folks.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.480
So, maybe we could get
married, but then maybe wait

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.270
until the next year
to go out to LA.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.050
And I was like, I'm certainly
not liking the sound of that.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.370
Especially since I'm already
unemployed for 90 days.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.400
There is no going back on that
you know leave of absence,

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.220
they've already hired
somebody else to cover me.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.430
So, I said well, you know what
think about it, and let me know,

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:12.810
but I said, my future,
somehow I see LA in my future.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.530
And so, she didn't move on
her position, so I said,

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.700
well I think we're going to
have to tell your parents,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.000
we're not getting married.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.300
Well, why aren't we getting?

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.650
Well, you want to; I mean
how are we doing this?

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.590
So, as it turned out I
had to go to Baltimore

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.440
in her parents' kitchen and
very wisely tell her parents,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.720
well I didn't deserve a woman
as wonderful as their daughter.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.410
And I didn't go in and say
that she was just a coward,

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.700
and just didn't want
to take that next step.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.000
That wouldn't have been smart,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.560
that were so many butcher
knives, and other you know,

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.180
things that could
have been projectiles

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.480
in the room, you know.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.330
So, we got through that and
we were all cool after that.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.590
But that's when I realized

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.460
that I was laser
focused on this career.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.940
And as it turned out,
had I waited a year,

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.140
just so you all can jump
to the next chapter,

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.080
had I waited a year, then
that would have been right

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.990
at the beginning of the
Screen Actors Guild strike,

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.610
which shut Los Angeles
down for months.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.450
I couldn't have even gotten
arrested, and we're talking

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.370
about LAPD, I couldn't have
even gotten arrested out there.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.950
So, timing is everything.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.490
And so, I went at the
right time, it worked out.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.850
I guess, otherwise,
Luis wouldn't have me

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.990
up here boring you
with all these stories.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.440
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Well, I'm glad
you selected your words properly

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.160
for the young lady's family.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.460
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: Oh yeah,

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.760
I mean you know I was like,

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.460
oh you know I might need
this neck some other time.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.690
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Well,
great you still have it.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:49.640
What did a break look like
for you once you were in LA?

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.780
What did that moment look
like when you said, well yeah,

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.070
I'm on the right track now.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.240
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Luis,
that's a loaded question.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.550
First job off the plane, now
I want to see a show of hands

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.730
and you young people don't
even bother to answer,

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.590
because I know you're
not up to this.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.960
Who's ever heard
of Rudy Ray Moore?

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.730
Okay, I don't see anybody with
a full head of hear [laughter].

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:18.420
Okay, Rudy Ray, the actual
first person I worked for in LA

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.610
at the Dunbar Hotel
on Central Avenue

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:25.440
where he was living
in the basement.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.460
And just to show you that
I could remain optimistic.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.760
I mean because he
was a nice cat,

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.690
don't get me wrong,
really nice guy.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:41.080
But his jokes were
you know, yeah.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.070
So, basically when I
realized that I may,

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:47.400
have I made the right decision,

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.890
one of the first
jokes I recorded

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.690
that he said was how do you keep
the flies out of your kitchen?

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:58.670
Well, it's real simple,
you keep the bucket

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.850
of in the living room.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.720
And so, immediately
I started [laughter].

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.930
You know, and one
of my assistants was

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.230
like what are you doing?

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.530
I said, well I'm just trying

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:14.830
to make sure this is
the actual bottom.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.550
That there's no other
level below this,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:21.060
so I can only go up from here.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.550
So, that was the
actual first job.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.230
And then, if you got a job,
it was three or four days

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.250
in a row, okay that's great.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.360
Two weeks in a row,
okay that's great.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.970
It took me seven years to get
into the labor union out there,

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.880
which is not the same
issue as it would be today,

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.850
because the rules have changed.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.030
And I worked for a lot
of different people,

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.840
a lot of low-budget
producers and directors.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.460
I would say one of the
first big brakes I got was

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.950
through a director
named Alan Meyerson

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.190
who I had worked
another 2 or 3 days,

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.770
22 hour days for flat $100.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:57.920
And like a lot of people out
there will tell you, kid,

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.220
you know when I get
some real money,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.520
I'm going to call
you again, you know.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.820
How many times, if
you had a quarter

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.070
for every time somebody told
you that, you'd be staring

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:07.420
down at Bill Gates saying, see?

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.490
See? But he did call.

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.990
And that job turned
out to be five months

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.390
of work, and I was like ah.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.070
I bought a new van,
bought a lot of new gear.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.800
You know, I was respectable all
of the sudden, I started looking

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.490
at housing prices, you know.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:27.450
But it's really one job at
a time, and it's really,

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.190
my first three years were more
like, they weren't calling me.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.540
They were calling the
person that they knew,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.690
and the person they knew
may have been busy and said,

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:36.990
you know what there's
this new kid

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:39.950
out here named Russell Williams,
he'll do a good job for you.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.370
Give him a shot.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.710
So, it was three years before
anybody was actually calling

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.010
me directly.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:48.340
They were calling Luis,
because they already knew Luis.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.290
And you have to understand
regardless of gender, age,

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:57.420
religious preference,
ethnicity, the scariest thing

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.320
in a highly competitive
field is someone

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.430
who is an unknown quantity.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.210
And once you find a team
that works together well,

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:09.440
you probably, you know the
whole Yankees that we all hated

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.730
when we were outside
of New York,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.690
the reason that they
stayed the old Yankees

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.390
because they very rarely
took on any new talent.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:20.000
Because they had Murderers'
Row and all those other folks.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.060
So, to get into that
league, you could have been

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.930
in the major league baseball,
but you weren't going

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.310
to be the Yankees
unless you were the best.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.090
So, that's how most people
think of their careers

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.000
in the entertainment
industry and other fields

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.300
that are highly competitive.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.830
That's what makes it
so hard to break in,

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:36.300
in addition to whatever else
they may bring with them.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.510
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Well baseball,
will lead us right into "Field

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.600
of Dreams" then right?

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.380
So, I guess that was
a pretty decent break.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.680
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: That was the,

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.040
I mean of the low budget, no
budget films that I did leading

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.740
up to that, that
was the first film,

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.390
when I read the script I said,
not only is this a great script.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.060
And then as the casting started
to fall into place, I'm like,

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.710
wow, I'm going to be working
with great actors too.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.080
And I'd already worked
with the director.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.770
That's one of the places
I learned loyalty, Luis.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:09.660
Was the only reason that "Field
of Dreams" was offered to me,

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.420
the director Phil
Alden Robinson,

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.600
who was also the screenwriter,

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.510
which he was much more
comfortable doing,

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.200
is working as a screenwriter.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.800
He told Gordon brothers, now
you all may not know the Gordon

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.330
brothers, but you
know the franchise

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:25.840
that made them rich was a
franchise called "Die Hard."

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.680
And that was 1988 as well.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.350
So, I must have seen "Die
Hard" 1 at least 6 or 7 times

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:34.420
in Dubuque, Iowa, because what
other movies were going to come

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:39.430
to Dubuque, okay at
that particular summer.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:43.300
Phil told them that the only way
that he would consider directing

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.790
"Field of Dreams" was if he
could bring all the people

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:51.240
from his first movie, which did
you know, marginal business,

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.180
but they were impressed
enough with it

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.050
to give him that particular job.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.080
And they said, yes, if that's
what it's going to take for you

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.060
to call action and cut.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.320
So, bring all his people
back into "Field of Dreams,"

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.550
also essentially, got me
"Dancing With Wolves,"

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.310
because that was the first time
I worked with Kevin Costner.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.070
And Kevin did a similar thing.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.080
He took people from different
movies that he had worked

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.080
with that he liked
and broth them

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.180
to his directorial debut
out in South Dakota.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.890
But I was really like
honored to work with people

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.350
like James Earl Jones, to meet
Kevin who was a really cool guy.

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:28.030
But, from going to the movies
with my mom and dad for many,

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:31.020
many years, I'm sitting
there behind the console,

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.060
and I'm looking at this guy
with this gleam in his eye,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:38.030
and his jaw, and I'm like
man that's Burt Lancaster.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.860
I mean, I'm working
with Burt Lancaster?

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.750
And that's probably the only
time that I've been on a set,

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.330
because we don't have
the benefit of the music

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.990
and whatever visual
effect that you'll see

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.680
in the finished product, but
when Burt Lancaster walks

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.790
across that first baseline to
become the doctor and attend

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.380
to Kevin Costner's little
girl, I have tears in my eyes,

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.620
and I'm thinking; I say wait
a minute, wait a minute.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.360
What the heck is wrong with
me, I said this is not a play,

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.660
you know what I'm saying?

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.120
But I mean he was
just that good.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.580
You know, and I really
thought that all those years

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.680
of not knowing whether this move
to LA was going to really be

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.640
for anything, I said, okay.

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.380
And I think the first
week I was there,

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.680
or first month I was there,

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.080
I said this is going
to take 10 years.

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.210
So, this was basically 9
years into that 10-year plan.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:33.530
And one of the other things
that I realized leading up to

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.900
that was, and I will
tell this to everybody,

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:42.010
that don't discount the
nay-sayers that creep up on you.

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:45.510
Sometimes it might even be
your parents, or besties.

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:47.240
You know, somebody, your
coworkers, and you have

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.170
that dream and you
want to like go out

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.060
and do something,
and they're like ah.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.980
And you know, they may have
the best of intentions.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.480
A lot of those guys I worked
with at WMAL radio said man,

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.780
you're a fool if you
think you're going

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.570
to get any work in Los Angeles.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.210
Okay, well I'm that
kind of fool.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:07.230
I got 90 days to find out
[laughter] whether your version

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.820
of me is right, or my
version of me is right.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.500
But the nay-sayers
are important,

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.650
because if they can talk you
out of pursuing your dream,

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.260
you weren't going
to do it anyway.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:21.340
Let me repeat that, you
weren't going to do it anyway.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.550
Because even if everything
works out fine,

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.150
there's still going
to be resistance.

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.580
You still have to be the best,
which means that you've got

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.390
to put in the extra hours,
you've got to be competitive,

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.590
you've got to do all this new
work to learn this new field.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.600
So, that's with nothing
else interfering with that.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.670
And of course, when
I went to LA in '79,

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.590
it was not an original idea.

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.630
So, there's a long line of
people that get off the plane

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.570
at LAX thinking they're going
to do something in showbusiness.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.940
So, just look at that
line, and say okay well,

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.750
be here for a little while,
but that's how we vet you,

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.340
that's how we get
rid of the people

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.640
who are really not serious.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.270
You know, if you get a
law degree, you still have

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:04.490
to pass the bar before
you can practice.

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.720
So, that's a vetting process.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.020
You get a medical degree,

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.500
you have to pass the state
boards before you can start

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:13.630
chopping people up,
that's a vetting process.

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:17.370
But you have a grad degree in
film, or you know, television

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:23.710
or radio, and okay, so,
all right, see that corner

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:27.520
on the far end of the
room, 18 hours you'll be

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.370
in that corner making sure
nobody walks into the shot

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.460
for $100 a day flat, a tuna fish
sandwich and a glass of lemonade

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.320
and three or four weeks later,
if you're still smiling,

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.730
that's an indication
that you're serious

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.550
about being in this business.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:43.060
All other people
run out of breath,

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.230
and mad that's not what I had in
mind, or I thought I was going

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:49.150
to come in and there was going
to be a red carpet there.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.110
Well, yeah, maybe is Halle Berry
was on the same flight with you,

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.170
but that's how we vet you.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:56.760
So, don't run out
of breath too soon,

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.460
it's going to be
a long marathon.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.760
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Understood.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.190
And your long-term planning is
really added in in everything

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:05.740
that you're saying, prof.
Well, let's talk more

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.460
about being the best,
and the academy.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.390
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: What,
did Denzel come in [laugther]?

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.570
Oh, oh, you're talking about me?

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.670
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Yeah, we've got
a certain version of that here

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:17.360
with us today as
a matter of fact.

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.580
So, you have the two Oscars,
you've got the two Grammys.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.880
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Emmys.

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.180
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Emmys.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.480
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: I'm
working on Grammys as soon

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.780
as I learn how to sing.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.890
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: So, Oscars
Emmys and you're a member of the

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:33.460
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: That's correct.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.520
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: So that's some
phenomenal areas to talk about.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.480
Of course, last year the
Academy basically tried

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.780
more inclusiveness.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.080
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Right.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.920
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: We heard things
from when Chris Rock was host

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.950
that brought us to
a greater awareness

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:52.950
of what was going
on in the Academy.

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.940
Let's talk about
what that means.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.550
And you know, I'm going to
just set you loose on it,

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:01.660
because you know, I want to make
sure we get around to a couple

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.410
of other things, especially
the questions at the end.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.920
So, the other thing that I was
hoping that you would touch base

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.880
on was that the Motion
Picture Academy's Museum is

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.490
opening soon.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.250
And of course, they
are thinking about ways

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.130
to represent minority
contributions.

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:22.120
So, with all that said,
what can you tell us

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.010
about the standards
of excellence.

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:26.310
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Okay.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:31.880
Well, with hashtag oscarsowhite
happening I think two years

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.450
in a row, that really,
Cheryl Boone Isaacs

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:38.780
who was the first
African American woman

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.720
to be the Academy president,
and she had been on the board

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.950
of governors for, I think
easily 15 to 20 years.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:50.440
She came into the
business almost at the top.

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.320
She came in in the PR realm,
and the first movie she got

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.480
to work on, no like me,
was "Close Encounters."

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.330
That's how she came
into the business.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.630
So, she saw the hashtag.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.820
She heard the outcry.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:12.140
But let's talk about why the
Academy looks like it does.

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.090
First of all, the
film business started

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:16.610
in the Jim Crow era
in the United States.

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:21.170
So, it was very difficult for
anybody with a permanent tan

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:25.400
to get on the set to
build a career long enough

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.180
that you could be
invited or be nominated

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.670
for one of the two statues.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.160
There's only two ways
to get into the Academy,

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.730
that have to be nominated
for an Oscar, or two people

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:39.580
in the branch that you're
representing, be it camera,

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.460
sound, costume, acting,
directing.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.430
Two people from those branches
have to send a letter saying,

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:47.730
you know what, we want

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:50.290
to consider Roselyn
Williams as a new member.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.620
And the membership
committee of that branch.

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.510
There's 17 branches.

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.720
Each one of those branches
has a different set of rules.

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.850
So, imagine my surprise on,
I think it was March 26th,

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:09.880
of 1990 that not only was I
nominated and won the Oscar,

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.920
but then they said, but I'm
not automatically invited

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.100
into the Academy yet.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:21.180
And that's when, southeast
DC came out of my mouth,

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.480
and I said now wait a minute is

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.560
that the black rule,
or is that the rule?

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.970
And they said, no, no,
no it's in the rule book.

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.270
And I said what's
the rule book say.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:31.990
So, in other words, you
needed 8 years of credits

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.690
to be considered,
in addition to,

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.900
and that's still
on the rule book.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.120
So, sound, for some reason
has the longest requirement

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.140
of experience of any
of the other branches.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.330
If you're in the acting
branch, just the fact

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:47.630
that you got nominated,

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:50.130
generally is enough
to get an invite.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.430
So, that's one.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.430
But now, let's put this
in the realm of sports,

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:56.410
because I think it's a lot
easier for people to understand

01:00:56.410 --> 01:01:00.880
that the Academies, plural,
meaning Music Academy,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.010
Television Academy,
Motion Picture Academy,

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:06.360
what they really do
is keep people out.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.990
That's what they really do.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.930
Okay, the same way the Hall of
Fame doesn't accept everybody,

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.800
be it football, or baseball,
who's played the sport.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.720
Okay, even someone
like Karl Malone

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.600
who had 18 great seasons playing
basketball, he never got a ring.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.510
But we can accept
that in sports.

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.650
Because, one, we know the score,
we know all the statistics.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:31.540
And most of that
process is transparent.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.910
We don't really see
the Academy's process.

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:35.900
I don't know whether
"Glory" won by 1 vote,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.940
or 10 votes, or 1000 votes.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.330
So, I'm fairly sure that
process will remain opaque,

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.630
and so people don't trust it

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.930
because they don't
know what's going on,

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:46.210
if anything, behind the scenes.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:51.770
I would also say that the whole
concept of it being difficult

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:55.330
to win an Oscar, Emmy or
Grammy is going to remain.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.170
You know, they're not handing
them out at Home Depot,

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.300
or at Starbuck's when you
get that extra tall latte.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.820
It's supposed to be a
hurdle that you jump over.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.720
So, that makes people upset
because they're thinking,

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.340
well how did this film not get
recognized, da, da, da, da, da.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.810
It's a lot of that is math.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:20.670
Okay. If there were 350
or so movies this year

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.060
that were eligible for Oscar
nomination, let's say each one

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.080
of those movies had at
least 10 actors in it, okay.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.900
And of course some of
these actors appear in more

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.770
than one movie per year,
but you're talking more

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:35.680
than 3000 roles, which
have to be whittled

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.300
down to only 20 nominations.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.090
So, best, best, and
supporting, supporting.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.390
So, it's almost as
bad as thinking

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:46.820
that Powerball is a
sure thing [laughter].

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:52.640
Okay, and I can think of
a lot of actors that are

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.190
in the so-called tribe
that didn't win Oscars.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.270
Directors like Hitchcock
never won an Oscar.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.570
You know what I'm saying.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.690
So, a lot of times,
we may look at it

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:05.820
as this is directed
towards people of color,

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.510
but what it really is, is that
mathematically it's difficult,

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:13.620
and then, because of the way the
membership looked at the time,

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.650
maybe it was going to be
more difficult for you

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:20.020
to determine whether, say
Don Cheadle's role in "Devil

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.890
In a Blue Dress" was
him in character,

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.240
or that was just Don Cheadle.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.390
See, now we know Don Cheadle's
got a whole lot of range.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:29.690
But at the time, you know,

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.040
I think some people
were kind of befuddled.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.090
Is that kid really that
good, or is that just him?

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:38.510
So, with the real push to
diversify, and also add a lot

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.700
of younger members,
the Academy is hoping

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.320
that the representation
in the nomination

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.020
which has been fairly good
this year will continue

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.070
to go in that direction.

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:56.880
But say, in my branch, I can
say with almost 100% surety,

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.910
there are only five African
Americans in the sound branch,

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:05.020
and maybe 6 people
of Hispanic descent,

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:08.720
of a branch that's
about 450 people.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.530
Okay, so part of that
is that what do we want

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:16.830
to do in the business.

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:22.730
Do we want to do sound, or do we
want to act, direct, you know?

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:25.880
So, if no one is pursuing
a career in sound,

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.250
then that can't be
blamed on the Academy.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.750
If I wanted to blame somebody,

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.940
I might maybe drop
the Image Awards,

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:37.390
because the Image Awards very
rarely highlights people's

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:42.650
accomplishments behind camera,
so that kids like me trying

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.410
to figure out what to do in
showbusiness would know, oh,

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:46.890
wow, I could be a
cinematographer.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.510
Okay, because you know, nobody's
going to hire me as an actor.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.310
Or, oh, maybe I could be
a production designer.

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:53.570
Or maybe I could
do visual effects.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.280
And the only reason that I ended

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.050
up even considering African
Americans working behind camera,

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:02.470
was because in 1967 when
I went to see "In the Heat

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:05.990
of the Night" on the big screen
for the sixth or seventh time,

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:07.290
I said wait a minute,
wait a minute,

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.320
I said Quincy Jones
did the score.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.070
I said, so what the African
Americans are working

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:13.370
behind camera?

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.110
Now, in front of the
camera, that was no headline,

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.620
we had been there
since the silence.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:20.490
But, behind camera in an
important role like that,

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:21.940
I said okay, note to self.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.240
Now, it didn't mean

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.720
that I immediately started
packing my bags, you know in '67

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.430
and started working towards LA.

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.420
But, at least I knew
the seed was there,

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.080
I knew it was possible.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.960
And so, when I did get a
chance to shake Quincy's hand,

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.170
many years later I
told him I blamed him,

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.690
I said you're the
reason I'm out here.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.430
I just want you to know that.

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:45.300
You're the reason I even
put that up, you know,

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.600
that thought in the air.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.640
So, that I think is a little
bit about the Academy.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.570
But you all are free
to try your hand at it.

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:58.020
I'll help you with
your acceptance speech.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.420
And I'll point you to people in
your field who can mentor you,

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.300
because that's very important.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.600
And you can go on
and get your own.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.550
Because I'm tired of being only
one of three African Americans

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.850
that have multiple Oscars.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:11.740
We need a whole lot more folks
in that crowd [applause].

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.740
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell:
Absolutely, well said, sir.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:20.200
I know that we're kind
of rounding the corner

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.960
on our time together, but I know

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.090
that some nominees
came out last night.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:30.040
"Shape of Water," and "Get
Out" which one is going to win?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.910
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
Oh, for best picture?

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:40.140
I'm fairly, fairly confident
that "Shape of Water"

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:46.770
because not that "Get
Out" isn't an impressive,

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.170
not only directorial debut,

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.210
but it just changed the whole
conversation in the room.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:59.340
But I want to say that
"Shape of Water" I think,

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.480
by and large is the
kind of movie

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.430
that has Oscar bait
written all over it okay.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.560
One movie for sure
that I was disappointed

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.590
that did not hit the best
picture nine, because we have

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.640
up to 10, and I said so what
happened with that tenth one?

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.380
It could have been "Mudbound"

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.180
which I thought was very
well directed, very nuance.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.480
Beautifully shot.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.500
The first woman to ever be
nominated for cinematography.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.350
After all these years,

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.100
I mean the first woman I met
doing cinematography I met here

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.370
in DC in '78, was a lady
named Karen Grossman

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:31.820
who was here in town from LA.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.680
And I'm thinking, you know.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.580
But, Dee Rees, who directed
"Mudbound" also got nominated,

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:45.160
I want to say for adaptive
screenplay, co-nominee.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.830
"Get Out" I think
is going to do well.

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.910
but I'm kind of thinking
at this moment,

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:54.630
"The Shape of Water" is going
to be the film this year

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.930
in terms of best picture.

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:58.070
And that's one thing I wanted
to mention before we move

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:02.020
on to the Q&amp;A is
that in the branch,

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:05.110
I can only nominate in sound.

01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:06.890
If my wife was in
directing branch,

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:08.540
she could only nominate
for directors.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.050
If my cousin, here, was in the
production designer's branch,

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:13.310
she could only nominate
for production design.

01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:16.490
But then, we all get to
nominate for best picture.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.820
So, that's why best
picture nomination is really

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:22.020
to me more representative
of the actual academy

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.590
than the actual branch
nominations, which could be kind

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:26.910
of more insider trading.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.770
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Well,
thank you very much,

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.720
Professor Russell Williams, II.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:35.510
I'd like to thank you on
behalf of everyone here,

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:39.470
Danial AP Murray African
American Historical Association,

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.450
all of the library
employees that have benefited

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:44.440
from you being here so early.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.780
People like me can now walk

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:49.230
through the halls
quite confidently.

01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:54.860
I also would like to ask
you, what's next for you?

01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:00.340
And then we'll open it up for
the questions and answers.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.700
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II: Well,
let's see, I've been teaching

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.910
at American for 15 years.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:07.380
And I really have enjoyed trying

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.460
to mentor some of
the new talent.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:12.390
I have some AU students and
former students in the room,

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:14.510
could I see some hands.

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:16.510
Oh, baby.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:21.130
[ Applause ]

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.850
Now, not all of these students

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:25.950
in the room got A's
from me [laughter].

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:30.550
But the fact that they
understood that I was saying,

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.200
okay bring your game
up a little bit more,

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.160
I'll make that phone
call for you,

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.250
means that I hopefully
did something right.

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:43.160
I'm still very much
interested in big show business.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.040
So, anything above the line now.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.340
Above the line, below the line.

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.760
Below the line means
the creative labor.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.610
Sound, camera, wardrobe,
makeup and hair.

01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:53.190
But above the line is
writing, producing, directing,

01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:55.940
and sometimes your
top-flight cast.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.480
I'm always looking
for opportunities

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.930
and things in that realm.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.230
You know?

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:04.690
My wife and I want to have
a house in the Vineyard,

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:07.620
we want to have another
house in Palm Desert.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.320
So, it may be hard to accomplish
that on an academician salary.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.180
But, I'm always looking
for opportunities

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.630
to bring the younger generation
in and turn them loose.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.690
But I can only do that
if they understand naval

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:26.430
observatory time.

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:29.050
That's lesson number one.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.650
Thank you.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:32.950
&gt;&gt; Luis Clavell: Absolutely,
well thank you very much, sir.

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:34.250
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams,
II: Thank you, Luis.

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:37.490
Ladies and gentlemen, the 2018
Trailblazer Legend Award winner.

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:41.510
Professor Russel Williams, II.

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:52.650
[ Applause ]

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:56.760
&gt;&gt; Darren Jones: Good afternoon,
everybody, I'm Darren Jones,

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.480
the program director for
the Murray Association.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.640
In the interest of time,
we're going to be able

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.890
to take two questions,
because we don't often,

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:08.590
in fact we've never had a
two-time Academy award winner

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.790
accept our invitation
and come here.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.840
And we are on a time schedule.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.320
We want all of you, if you have
an opportunity to grab a bad

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.730
in the back as you leave
out, but we also want you

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:24.510
to take a picture with Mr.
Williams, if you so choose.

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.050
So, if there are any questions,
we're going to be able

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.450
to take two, and then
we're going to move

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.780
on to our award presentation.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.790
Right here in the front.

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:37.090
&gt;&gt; Melvin Whitten:
Great think you so much,

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:39.430
my name I Melvin Whitten,
I'm an entertainment lawyer

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:42.040
and we're really good friends,
but what I wanted to ask you was

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.060
at Howard University
School of Law we had a motto

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.160
that was called lifting
as we climb.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.380
So, as you climb, you know,
how do you lift and reach back

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.400
and bring others forward.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.720
&gt;&gt; Russell Williams, II:
Thank you, Mel, good question.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.970
At our spirits known and unknown
workshop which started in 1971,

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:02.650
our motto was each
one teach one.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:06.600
And that motto has served
me well, my cofounder,

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.690
Gerald Bruce Lee and hopefully
all the people who have come

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.990
through that workshop.

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:14.170
And even when I was working
in the industry, you know,

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:17.070
I would look for people who were
interested in what I was doing

01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:20.690
or if they weren't interested in
what I was doing specifically,

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:23.600
to point them to the
people that can mentor them.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.180
But at the same time, I
was also vetting them.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.960
You know, something
like Sergeant Waters

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.120
and "A Soldier's Story" it's
like okay, we're not looking

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.420
for a bunch of fooli9shness,

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.810
because it's image
is everything.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.520
All right, and especially in
the time I started working

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.470
in the business, I had a couple
directors say, man, you know,

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:43.870
he said your crew's all black.

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:45.170
I said yeah.

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:46.470
He said, well that's
kind of unusual isn't it?

01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:48.750
I said, well, I thought my crew
should reflect the department

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.360
head like everybody else's crew.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.050
And he said, oh yeah,
yeah, you know [laugther].

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:55.950
You know what I'm saying.

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.940
So, I mean you have to try
to give them a little truth

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.340
and not make it assaulty.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.580
But you know to me, Mel,
it's always been important,

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.270
because trust me,
there's no way that I'm

01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:11.310
on this stage telling
my story except

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.890
for people giving
me the opportunity

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.190
to come through the door.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.920
And people taking a
chance on me Paul Kirkham,

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.460
Paul Fime who was at ABC.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.620
This guy named Bill Cooper
took me under his wing

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.920
when I came out to LA.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.580
And that's another thing,

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.480
if you haven't figured
this out already.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.330
All your mentors may
not look just like you.

01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:34.110
Okay, but if someone's
willing to take the time

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.880
to show you what
made them successful,

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.870
or even if they were an abject
failure, show you how not to go

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.060
down the road that they went
down, which is very important.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.300
If I see another
movie of someone going

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:49.850
through the do not
enter bridge out,

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:52.030
went over the bridge,
went over the cliff.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:53.650
Crash the car, then
they crawl back

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:55.720
up on their fingernails
to the road.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.680
It's like no, no can't we have
a movie where it shows you how

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.300
to recognize the signs
before you go over the cliff.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.810
That's the movies I want to see.

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:06.410
Next question.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:08.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a
pretty quick question.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.780
Russell and I go back many,
many years and a third friend

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.980
who goes back with us as well.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.390
I started a production company
some years ago and picked

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:20.470
up the phone and called the two
of them and they got on a plane,

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:23.690
and we did the 25th
year anniversary

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:26.310
of the Congressional
Black Caucus.

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:31.650
From Bill Cosby to Gladys Knight
and whoever else were all in it.

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:35.740
And I only had the
nerve to take savings

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.890
and buy cameras and equipment.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.800
They had the nerve to trust
in me and come to do that.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.600
So, this is a lesson to all of
you students that are in here.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.770
I was a student in
that business.

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.530
And this man, really
made a difference for me.

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:54.980
So, I've actually had a
company, and then sold one.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.240
So, I'm only saying that to
you, to let you really realize

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.130
that maybe you didn't get an
A in the class [laughter].

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.840
I did. Follow the lead.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.070
He's there for you.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:10.870
&gt;&gt; Darren Jones: Thank you.

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:14.960

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.530

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:17.830

And we have other gifts.

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.160

Library of Congress

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.230
and not get a book, right?
