00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.542
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So Andy, when you were talking to Susan, you mentioned nearsightedness. Now,

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:04.721
what did you mean by that?

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:08.748
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, people who are nearsighted have a hard time seeing things that are far

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:12.782
away. They can only see things that are close, or near to them.

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:15.888
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, Andy, are you nearsighted? You have the.

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:19.160
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. When I take my glasses off I really can't see a thing.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.060
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, why does that happen?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.745
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Before we get into that why don't we learn a little bit more about the eye.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.196
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, just take a look at this diagram.

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:30.058
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Well, I've definitely seen this before. Can you tell the viewers at home

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:31.090
what's going on?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.760
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. So, this is our eye, and the job of the eye is basically to take light

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.288
which enters here and focus it onto the back of the eye, back here.

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:42.348
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is it kind of how a magnifying glass focuses light?

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:47.074
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, sort of. Now, a properly functioning eye with good vision will take light

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:50.434
that enters, and bend that later or focus it on to the back of the eye here,

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.526
which is called the retina.

00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:56.302
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what about an eye that's not functioning so well. Well in that case the

00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:59.292
lense, this part here that actually bent the light and focused it, isn't doing

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.829
it's job right. And people who are what's called nearsighted, the light

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.643
actually gets bent too much by the lense. So, maybe the focusing point would be

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:12.716
somewhere here, which is not where the retina is. So, this results in blurry

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:13.299
vision.
