00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.900
[scurrying]

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.270
Well, I'm up.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.370
It is 0 dark 30 and
the mice are just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.570
freaking going to town, man.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.730
Just [mouse sounds] just
all over the place, man.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.170
They are just driving
me bat [bleep] crazy.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.930
Oh!

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.870
God, they're just insane.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.470
Oh my gosh.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.000
Oh, the little bastards--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.770
I wish I could stomp
their little guts in.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.970
Oh, I was ready just--

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.930
I had to get up, man.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.900
I was ready to
destroy my shelter--

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.600
I mean, just destroy it.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.830
I was going to go off.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.600
Oh.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.100
Little bastard mice running
me out of my own bed.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm going to make a
fire, get my hands warm.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.600
I'm just frustrated.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.070
I'm tired.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.100
I'm hungry and I'm
hungry and I'm hungry.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.700
I'm hangry.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.430
Little bastards!
God.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.570
I have been dealing
with the mice

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.800
for up to a month now of
them waking me up and pitter

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.830
pattering around my shelter.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.530
But now they're sleeping because
they like to party all night

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.470
and sleep all day.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230
You know, it's these little
things they don't-- they

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.430
don't tell you about.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.800
They don't tell you about
the mice when you're--

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.570
when you go to survival school.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.600
They just say,
just survive, man.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.800
Just survive They didn't
tell me about the mice.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.430
All right, well, I"m pulling
out all the stops today, boys.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.730
Wake up, mice!

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.930
Wakey, wakey!

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.070
Wakey, wakey, mice!

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.330
You wake me up,
I'm waking you up.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.370
You want a little bear spray?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.700
I hope that it just filled their
little lungs with toxic fumes.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.200
There.
That's that.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.530
That's all of it,
you fricking things.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.800
I should air horn them too.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
[air horn]

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.170
That's fun.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.370
Smells kind of peppery and
refreshing in my shelter.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.430
A little pepper?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.570
Is it a little peppery
in there for you, folks?
