00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.020
- [Voiceover] What is the
solution to the equation above?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.750
So we see to solve 4k.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.520
So one thing that we could do,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.550
well there's a couple of
ways that we could do it,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.050
one way is we could multiply
both sides of this equation

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.820
times 4k minus three.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.750
So let's just do that.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.110
4k minus three.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.880
It gets the 4k minus three
out of the denominator

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.890
because 4k minus three
divided by 4k minus three

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.420
is as long as we assume 4k
minus three isn't equal to zero,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.490
that's just going to cancel
out and be equal to one.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.540
And so this equation
is going to simplify to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450
4k minus three, times two

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.920
and we can actually distribute this two.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.950
So this becomes two times 4k is 8k.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.390
And then two times negative
three is negative six.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.290
So 8k minus six is equal to,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.690
well all we're left with is 11 over one,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.650
or we could just write 11.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.490
And so adding six to both sides,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.050
could add six to both sides,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.250
and so those add up to zero.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.090
You're left with 8k is equal to 17.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.650
Now we can just divide both sides by eight

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.280
and we get k is equal to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.190
17 over eight.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.770
k is equal to 17 over eight.
