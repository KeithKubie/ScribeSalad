00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So this is the hypothesis. It's often called the null hypothesis or H₀.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Null is kind of a funny word but that's what people commonly call it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And there's a contrary hypothesis that evaluates this hypothesis--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we'll just call it the alternate hypothesis or H₁.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So on the right side, I'm going to write examples for what this hypothesis could mean in this case.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So here are five different choices and if you listen carefully, can you tell me

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which of these five choices and there's exactly one would correspond to the null hypothesis

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that this medication works exactly as advertised where p is the probability of losing weight.
