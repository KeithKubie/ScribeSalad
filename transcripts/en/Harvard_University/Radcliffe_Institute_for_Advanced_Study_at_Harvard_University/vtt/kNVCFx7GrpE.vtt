00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.330
- So we're going to
move a little farther.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.410
We're going to go from
Earth to space now.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.480
And so our next panel
is going to come up

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.375
here, join me on the stage.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.860
And while they're
coming, I'm just

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.500
going to take my
prerogative, because I'm

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.210
going to let Dave
Charbonneau, who's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.294
my colleague from the
astronomy department-- he's

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:27.710
a professor in the astronomy
department and also a Harvard

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.835
College professor here at
Harvard University, which

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.910
means he's an exceptional
teacher, which you're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.100
going to see how great he
is in just a few minutes.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
But I'm going to
take my prerogative

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.930
to ask him a question
before he actually starts.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.940
And it's about clarifying
what we mean today

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.530
by the undiscovered.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.350
And so I'm just a tiny
bit older than Dave

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.232
so that when he was a graduate
student here at Harvard,

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:50.690
I was actually on the committee
that decides whether or not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.974
students can do particular
projects for their PhD thesis.

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:55.390
And some of you
may know that Dave

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.530
is extremely famous
for having discovered

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.900
the first so-called
transiting exoplanet, which

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.110
means a planet that passes
between us and its host star

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.590
and makes the star go a little
tiny bit dimmer by like one

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.362
millionth of its light.

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.070
And the technique that
he used to do that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.890
was something that
should absolutely work.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.940
But nobody had
ever made it work.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.860
But everybody knew that it
would work, maybe, someday.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.130
In other words, it
was not undiscovered,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.095
it was undiscovered.

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.470
So in other words,
it was sitting

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.340
there waiting to be discovered.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490
But it wasn't a technique
that you wouldn't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.870
think would ever, ever work.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.830
It just hadn't worked yet.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.150
But then the planets that
were found around other stars

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.970
are every variety
of bizarre, which

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.910
is what you're about to
hear about in this session.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.820
And so for you, Dave, I want
to know whether you consider--

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.510
you don't have to
answer now, later--

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.370
but your original discovery
as undiscovered discovery

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.740
or just plain
discovery by the almost

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.640
traditional scientific method.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.900
So I'll just leave it there
and turn it over to Dave

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.670
to introduce everyone
else in the session.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.822
Thanks.

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:03.189
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.970
- All right, so if you
look at the written

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.850
record of human thought,
it's pretty clear

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.360
that for at least 500 years
and arguably for 2,500 years,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.140
humans have wondered whether
there were other worlds that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.620
were inhabited and whether
or not we could somehow

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.290
come into contact with those
worlds and explore them.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.060
And what I want
to begin by saying

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.750
is that this is a very special
moment in human history

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.580
where we're going to do
something very special, which

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.470
is that we have
for the first time

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.190
the technological ability
to actually go and answer

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.190
that question.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.820
And so there's a great
deal of excitement

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.460
worldwide amongst astronomers
and astrobiologists

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.290
that really within
the next 10 years

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.260
we might detect the
presence of life

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.240
on planets orbiting other stars.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.040
And so we're going to talk about
these exoplanets here today.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.820
We have two of the
world's experts

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.990
and leading thinkers on
this really great question.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.850
Our second speaker is going to
be Professor Lisa Kaltenegger,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.890
who is the director of the
Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.480
where she is also
professor of astronomy.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.340
And there are few souls,
on this planet at least,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.720
who have thought more
deeply and for longer

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.250
than what it would really take
to infer the presence of life

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.410
through telescopic observations.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.690
So among many of the
exciting questions

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.680
that Lisa has investigated
are what would the earth look

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.350
like to an alien astronomer?

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.090
And how did the
Earth's appearance

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.570
change to that alien astronomer
as a function of time?

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.680
The Earth has not always
appeared as it now does.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.360
Could we detect the presence
of geological activity

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.500
like volcanoes if you were
a remote astronomer gazing

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.570
across the vastness of space?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.420
And which stars we
should begin by looking

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.240
at as we go and do
this exploration

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.520
with our telescopes.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.980
Our first speaker, though,
will be Laura Kreidberg.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.030
And Dr. Kreidberg is a junior
fellow in the Harvard Society

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.160
of Fellows.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.920
And maybe to set up a
bit of a juxtaposition

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.120
for the purpose of this talk,
whereas Lisa is the theorist,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
Laura is the observer.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.040
And Dr. Kreidberg is
really a world leader

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.960
in using novel techniques
and pushing observatories

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.890
to achieve unprecedented
levels of precision

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.560
to go out and actually figure
out what these planets are made

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.860
of and what are the properties
of their atmospheres

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.060
and whether or not
they are anything

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.250
at all like that of the Earth.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.650
And so I'm very excited
about this discussion.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.752
And I'm going to call on Dr.
Kreidberg to lead us off.

00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:19.056
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.340
- All right, thank
you, everybody.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.640
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.120
And I have the honor of speaking
about a topic that really ties

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.670
together all of the themes
of today, which are life,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.290
the earth, and space, which
is the question of is there

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.780
life elsewhere?

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.040
And as Dave said, humans
have been thinking

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.660
about this for a long time.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.150
I would guess before
recorded history,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.980
humans have been
thinking about this.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.450
But the place I'd
like to start is

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.110
in the early 1960s when
an astronomer named

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.430
Frank Drake developed the
first scientific framework

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.070
for talking about the
possibility of detecting

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.070
inhabited planets in the galaxy.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.942
And so he wrote down
this famous equation.

00:06:08.942 --> 00:06:10.150
It looks like it's not there.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.483
Well, I'm not allowed to have
equations in talks anyway,

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:13.990
so that's fine.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.870
So the way Frank Drake
thought about this

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.620
was he started by
saying, OK, well,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.220
how many stars
are in the galaxy?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.260
Presumably you need
the star as a source

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.430
of energy for your life.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.400
And then he said,
how many of those

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.340
stars host planets, in
particular planets that

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.930
are likely to be habitable?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.390
We'll come back to that later.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.080
And finally, how often
does life actually

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.900
arise on those potentially
habitable planets?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.870
And if it does arise,
can we detect it?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.380
And so the goal was
to get a number--

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.780
number of potentially
detectable inhabited planets

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.040
in the galaxy.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.480
And this all sounds fine.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.740
It's a very organized
way of thinking about it.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.340
The problem was that
in 1961, nobody knew

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.970
what any of these terms were.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.380
And the way it was
approached was the way

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.840
we were all taught as
young scientists, which

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.270
is to develop a
hypothesis and then try

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.860
to figure out an
experiment you could

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.000
use to test that hypothesis.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.210
And so if your
hypothesis is that there

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.630
are other stars in the
galaxy that host planets like

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.570
the earth, then your
experiment is can you detect

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.235
these Earth-like planets?

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:24.860
And so folks went
through this exercise

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.270
of trying to figure out how
we would go about doing that.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.120
And so the most natural
first question is to say,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.184
can we just take a
picture of the planet,

00:07:35.184 --> 00:07:36.850
maybe block out the
light from the star?

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.950
And it turns out that
this is very, very hard,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.180
that the earth is 10 billion
times fainter than the sun.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.920
And not only is it
much, much fainter,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.240
it's also very close to it.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.040
And so the analogy
is that this is

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.790
very similar to trying to detect
a firefly next to a lighthouse

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.890
at a distance of a
couple of hundred miles.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.090
And so this was ruled
out as impossible.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.640
OK, good.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.530
So another idea was
to try to search

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.540
for a transit of the planet.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.180
This is when you get
lucky with your geometry

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.710
and the planet goes directly
in front of its parent star.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.910
And when it does
that, it blocks,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.230
as Alyssa said, a tiny
fraction of the stellar light.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.540
The challenge is that
for an earth-sized planet

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.520
around a sun-like star,
it's only one part in 10,000

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.520
of the stellar brightness
that gets blocked.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.980
And that was considered also
too difficult to detect.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.409
Not only is it difficult to
detect, it's fairly improbable.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.130
Only half a percent
of the time would

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.220
you expect this chance alignment
to work out in your favor.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.450
And it only happens once a year.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.590
And so even if you
did somehow build

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.410
a detector that could see it,
suppose next year you went back

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.780
to try to detect
it again and you're

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.970
observing from the
ground, could be cloudy.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.870
It could be daytime.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.200
You might not be able
to see it at all.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.040
Folks also thought about
trying to detect the influence

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.430
of the planet on the stars.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.220
So planets have some mass.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.340
And we normally think of
the star as fixed in space,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.630
but the planet is
orbiting around.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.830
But really the planet's gravity
tugs on the star a little bit,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.780
and it makes it wobble.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.540
And so you could
imagine that maybe you

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.960
could detect that wobble
by observing the spectrum

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.440
of the star, the color.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.500
And when the star is
moving towards you,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.130
its light is a little
bit blueshifted just

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.880
by the Doppler effect,
the same thing that

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.830
makes a siren sound
higher pitched

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.730
as it's coming towards you and
lower pitched as it moves away.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.150
And then as the
planet moves away--

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.900
as the star moves away
from you, its light

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.610
would be then redshifted.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.160
The problem here
is that the size

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.470
of the signal, the
amount of motion induced

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.560
by the earth on the sun
is only 10 centimeters

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.310
a second, which was far too
difficult for any detector

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.440
at the time to ever see.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.380
And so even though this is
such an exciting question,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.340
everyone was saying, oh, there's
no way, this is too hard,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.110
except for a handful of very
persistent, very stubborn

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.610
people.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.530
One of these was Paul Butler.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.280
And he described what it
was like to try to search

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.920
for extrasolar planets in 1986.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.080
And what he said
was, "When asked

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.020
by other astronomers,
what are you working on,

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.210
one could not
respond, I'm searching

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.770
for extrasolar planets.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.020
Depending on the person,
they might laugh in your face

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.600
or slowly move away from
you like you were pitching

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.540
an alien conspiracy theory."

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.760
But nevertheless, they tried.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.230
They kept going.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.650
And this is an amazing,
amazing figure.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.170
This is the discovery data
for an extrasolar planet

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.790
that was completely unlike
anything that was ever

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.050
seen in the solar system.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.030
So this was from a team of
astronomers who were using

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.950
the Doppler wobble technique.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.210
And they measured the velocity
of a star called 51 Pegasi.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.740
And this is what they saw.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.900
They saw these
characteristic wiggles

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.520
that are exactly
what you would expect

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.700
if you have a planet tugging
your star back and forth.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.890
The crazy thing about
this is that the amplitude

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.270
of that signal was 100
meters per second compared

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.600
to 10 centimeters a second
for what you would expect

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.510
for an earth-like planet.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.740
And so I love this quote
from a colleague of mine,

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.620
Emily Levesque, where she
said, "The real exciting sound

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:27.320
in science is not Eureka,
it's huh, that's weird."

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.660
And that is exactly
what we're seeing here.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.730
So the inference
here is that in order

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.380
to have a signal
that large, you have

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.800
to have a planet comparable
in size to Jupiter

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.850
orbiting its parent star
in about three days.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.980
And this was considered
absolutely crazy.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.720
There's no way a planet
could form there.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.820
We think that the
material that goes

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.302
into forming
Jupiter-like planets

00:11:51.302 --> 00:11:53.510
would all be vaporized at
temperatures as high as you

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.340
would get so close to the star.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.997
And yet here it was.

00:11:57.997 --> 00:11:59.580
And even still, there
were detractors.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.255
People thought this was
so nuts that maybe it

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:04.380
was something on the star,
maybe it was star spots,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.110
maybe it was just something else
until about five years later

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.020
when Dave, who we're
fortunate to have here today,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.410
decided nah, we have to prove
this for real, and went out

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.700
and searched for
transits of the planets.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.170
And so I'm glad that Alyssa
was amenable to letting him go

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.220
do this as a graduate student.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.720
Yeah.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.470
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.970
Yeah.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.580
So this was viewed
with some skepticism.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.680
Is that right, Dave?

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.355
- There's a whole back story.

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.990
But I do like that plot.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.500
- And so this was the
absolute unmistakable proof

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.130
that these signals have
to be caused by a planet.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:51.680
So this was a star that had a
detected radio velocity signal.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.850
The star was wobbling.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.530
And then Dave went out
and looked exactly when

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.310
he expected the planet to
transit in front of its host

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:05.140
star and saw this characteristic
dimming of about a percent.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.300
And so this was the
push that everybody

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.280
needed to say, oh,
maybe there actually

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.380
are planets around other stars.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.420
And they might not have
to be like the planets

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.860
in this solar system.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.390
And so the floodgates opened.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.870
And there are now
over a dozen searches

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.050
using both the transit
technique and the stellar wobble

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.670
technique that have been going
on for over two decades now.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.750
And so I'll fast forward to what
our picture of exoplanets looks

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.650
like today.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.800
And this is what we found.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.230
This is the plot showing
the pace of discovery.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.140
This is the number
of known planets,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.150
number of discovered
planets detected every year

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.400
between 1995 and today.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.740
There are almost 4,000 of them.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.550
We know now that the average
star hosts at least one planet

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.090
typically.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.200
Some have many more.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.500
And the diversity of
planets is much greater

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.880
than we ever could have
imagined from the solar system.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.730
So not only did we see these
hot Jupiter-like planets,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.790
the very first ones
that were discovered,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.540
we also see many planets
that are intermediate in size

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.980
between the Earth and Neptune.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.550
We have no solar system
analog for those planets.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.790
We see many, many, many
planets on orbits interior

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.370
to that of Mercury, which is
the closest planet to the sun.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.310
We see planets
orbiting stars that

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.040
are very different from the
sun, stars that are larger,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.900
stars that are
smaller and cooler.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.240
And as the excitement
about this grew,

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.420
so did our technological
capabilities.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.730
And so that original
question of are there other

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.820
Earth-like planets
suddenly became something

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.500
that was within our reach.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.960
And what we now know is that
roughly 10% to 20% of stars

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.530
host an Earth-size
planet with temperatures

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.680
appropriate for liquid
water on the surface, which

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.310
is the canonical
definition for the places

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.040
we're most excited
to try to find life.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.956
And so here we are.

00:14:59.956 --> 00:15:01.330
We're at this sort
of crossroads.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.810
Going back to the
Drake equation,

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.110
we now know what a
bunch of the terms are.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.070
We know that there's about 300
billion stars in the galaxy,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.310
that almost all of those stars
host at least one planet,

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.050
and that very,
very many of those

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.680
planets are
potentially habitable.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.250
And so the question
for me is what do we

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.560
do about these last two pieces?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.870
How often does life develop?

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.180
How can we go about
detecting that life?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.180
And there are a couple
of ways to go about this.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.550
We're going to hear later
in the afternoon from Jill

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.385
about technosignatures.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:36.760
I'm going to talk
about something

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.260
a little bit different, which
is searching for biosignatures

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.410
in the atmospheres
of these planets.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.880
And this is a little
bit of a gamble.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.410
So I really liked what Stuart
talked about this morning

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.330
about searching for a
black cat in a dark room.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.660
That definitely feels like what
I do in my day-to-day work.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.120
But it's not exactly--

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.990
it's not a bumbling search.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.450
We make these guesses
to say, oh you know,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.730
maybe the cat is sitting
on top of the dryer

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.380
because it's warm up there.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.090
That's where we would
expect a cat to normally be.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.440
And so when I think about that
undiscovered in science, to me

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.800
it feels a lot like a
sort of calculated gamble.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.660
I grew up in Nevada.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.170
I know about gambling.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.430
And so the gamble
that I'm taking

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:31.047
is to study some earth-sized
planets in the habitable zones

00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:31.880
of their host stars.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.290
But these planets are very,
very different from the sun.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.990
And that's because they're
orbiting much smaller stars

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.154
that are a lot cooler.

00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:43.070
And there's a lot of
advantages to doing this.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.490
We know that small
stars are actually

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.220
much more common than
sun-like stars in the galaxy.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.430
So this figure shows
the sun would be one

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.380
of these bright yellow circles.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.950
These are all of the stars
within about 10 parsecs,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.420
so very nearby to the sun.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.079
And you can see that most of
them are quite a bit smaller.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.420
Not only are small
stars more common,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.970
the habitable zone
is also closer in.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.160
So if you're searching
for transiting planets,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.280
the transits are more frequent,
the transit probability

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.970
is higher, and most importantly
the planet is much larger

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.130
relative to the star.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.960
And so they're easier
to characterize.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.859
And excitingly, we've started to
detect a lot of these planets.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.110
It's so exciting that it
made the Google Doodle, which

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.651
I think is a sign
that you've made it

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:38.120
as a scientist when your results
end up on the Google homepage.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.700
So I really identify with
the moon in this animation.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.110
So yeah, we now know
of about a dozen

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.680
nearby terrestrial planets
orbiting these very small stars

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.930
where we have some hope of
studying their atmospheres

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.263
and searching for signs of life.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.560
However, there are some
caveats that I should mention.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.450
And this is why
this is risky, which

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.110
is that small stars are very,
very different from the sun.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.210
They are bright in
the ultraviolet,

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.150
so they emit a lot of
high-energy radiation

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.360
in their young lifetimes that
can be very dangerous to life

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.810
trying to develop on the surface
of the planets orbiting them.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.570
It could also evaporate the
atmosphere of the planet.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.320
So we're not sure whether
planets around these stars

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.770
can even hold on to
atmospheres at all.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.550
They have powerful flares
that could also disrupt

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.450
the development of life.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.550
And finally, the planets are
expected to be tidally locked

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.290
to the stars.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.180
That is to say they have a hot
day side and a cold night side,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.340
just like the moon is tidally
locked by the Earth's gravity.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.760
And in this situation,
you can imagine

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.791
that you're not going to
have a smooth temperature all

00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:52.540
the way around the
surface of your planet.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.790
You'll have a really hot part.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.920
You'll have a cold part.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.230
You might worry about
your atmosphere freezing

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.290
out on the cold side, so you
get a snow cone situation

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.400
where there's ice on one side
and rock on the other side.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.500
And so there are a
lot of detractors

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.270
who argue against
searching for atmospheres,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.410
searching for signs of
life on planets like this.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.090
But I think that's silly.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.820
And so this is what I do.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.010
I'm interested in trying
to measure the compositions

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:24.920
of the atmospheres.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.860
This is a little
animation showing how

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.910
we would go about doing this.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.870
And the idea is that when the
planet is in front of the star,

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.850
a tiny fraction of
the starlight will

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.010
filter through the
planet's atmosphere.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.490
And it can get
absorbed by molecules

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.140
that are present there.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.800
And depending on what
the molecules are,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.070
they have different
opacities, different levels

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.600
of transparency at
different wavelengths.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.430
And so if we measure the size of
the planet in different colors,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.230
we can work backwards
and figure out what

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.700
the atmosphere is made out of.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.110
And just to illustrate with
a more close-to-home example,

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.250
this is what the Earth
looks like in the infrared.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.500
That's the moon
in the background.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.150
And if I move to a
different wavelength

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:17.070
where ozone is very
opaque, it looks like this.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.650
You can see these
small differences.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.830
And so that's what we're
looking for in the atmospheres

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.820
of these other planets.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.280
This actually works.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.580
This is my one science
result that I'll show you.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.530
We don't have yet
the sensitivity

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.050
to look at planets
that are this small.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.810
But this is a planet
similar to Neptune.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.940
And we detected water
in its atmosphere.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.440
So those two big bumps are where
the planet radius is larger

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.680
because water vapor is absorbing
and blocking the stellar light.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.280
And so what we
expect is very soon,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.830
not with telescopes that
we have available yet,

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.810
but in the near future
with James Webb, which

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.180
is the successor to the
Hubble Space Telescope,

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.250
that we're going to
start to be able to make

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.620
these measurements for
Earth-sized planets

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.450
around the smallest stars.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.270
And so this is a
result from a paper

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.990
I wrote with my office
mate, Caroline Morley.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.510
And we were sitting
around, and we were saying,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:21.670
OK, we have no idea what the
atmospheres of these planets

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.880
are going to be like.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.090
And so to deal with
that uncertainty,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.690
we said, well, we could use the
solar system as inspiration.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.960
We have different
kinds of atmospheres

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.970
for the solar system planets.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.779
And so here we were
like, well, maybe it

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:38.320
has an atmosphere
like the earth that

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.380
has a lot of water
vapor in it or maybe it

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.570
has an atmosphere
more like Venus

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.230
that is dominated by
CO2, carbon dioxide,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.920
or instead it
could have methane,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.030
which is a situation we see on
Titan, one of Saturn's moons.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.230
And so we made a
prediction for what

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.230
the signal should look like for
these different atmospheres.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.330
And we found that
this is something

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.600
we will be able to detect
using the James Webb Space

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.430
Telescope with a fairly
reasonable amount of observing

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.930
time.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.888
And so this is something
we can look forward to

00:22:09.888 --> 00:22:12.790
within the next
five years or so.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.380
And normally when
I talk about this,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.799
I feel like I have to--
like I'm on the job market

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:19.090
and I have to have some sort
of punch line where I say,

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.730
oh yes, and this will tell us
that the planet is inhabited

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.230
or not.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.620
And for the purposes
of this talk,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.030
I'll be honest and
say we have no idea.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.570
We have absolutely no
idea what we will find.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.390
But we're trying to design
an experiment in a smart way

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.690
where we can learn at least
the very beginning of what

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.030
kind of chemical inventory
these planets might

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.870
have so we can start assessing
whether they host life or not.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.900
And so to end, I'll leave you
with a quote from Frank Drake.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.300
I had the honor of meeting
him a couple of years ago.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.330
And the question I had for him
was knowing what we know now,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.090
what do you think the chances
are of discovering life

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.140
elsewhere?

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.840
And he said, "100%."

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.960
But I'll add the caveat
to that, that in order

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.650
to find that life, we have to
keep an open mind about how

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.910
and where we search.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.669
Thank you.

00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:16.092
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.850
- So thank you to Laura
for this great introduction

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.390
to what we're trying to do,
what we're trying to achieve.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.210
And Dave already mentioned this.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.620
If you just take a
second to think that we

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.070
are the generation that might.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.837
We have the technological
possibility,

00:23:52.837 --> 00:23:54.420
but we don't know
how hard it is going

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.470
to be to actually spot life,
if they're unique signatures.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.450
That's what we're
going to talk about.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:05.340
But we are the first generation
in all of human history

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:10.110
that has the chance to
figure out if we are alone

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.000
in the universe.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.940
It's us.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.900
I think that is one of the
most amazing times ever.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.760
And sometimes people pick when
they would like to be born.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.970
And I would pick
now all the time,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.040
because living in
the time where are

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.360
we going to get this connection
to the cosmos, where we're

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.090
going to look up at the stars
and not just statistically

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:40.130
right now say 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, right?

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.680
One out of five
stars has a planet

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.481
small enough and at the right
distance-- not too hot or too

00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:46.980
cold.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:53.360
So maybe, just maybe, that
could be also inhabited there.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.770
It's potentially habitable.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.790
Whether there's life is
another complete question.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.190
But we have the
technological means

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.440
to actually figure this out.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.940
And whatever else
you might think

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.540
is going wrong in our life,
this is not one of these things.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:14.370
We are the explorers of
our centuries, I would say.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.830
And I'm sure it was
great for Columbus

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.040
to actually find the New World.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.570
But we have an S on him.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.570
We have new worlds,
thousands of new worlds

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.180
that we are discovering.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.640
And so in the context
of this meeting,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.320
I wanted to add
another aspect to this.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.210
So [INAUDIBLE] science
with new techniques,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.100
and Laura was saying
that with new telescopes,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.640
we could [? get ?] more detail
and more detailed information.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.540
But I like this Schoppenhauer
quote where he actually says,

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:54.310
"The task is not so much to
see what no one yet has seen,

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.540
but to think what
nobody yet has thought

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.110
about that that everyone sees."

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.390
So what I want to
do and what I'm

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.370
going to try to do right now--

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.110
so first I'm going to show you
a couple of amazing artists'

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.270
impression to
visualize our data.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.740
This is one of them.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.030
So what you actually have here--
hopefully this will run, yes--

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.780
is just a representation
of how diverse

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.030
these other solar systems are.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.330
So what you see here
is actually-- oops,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.430
this did not work.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.610
Each of the circles
represents one

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.340
of the hundreds of planetary
systems that we have detected.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.600
And yes, grant you,
the planets are not

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.430
that big compared to the star.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.770
But the planet
compared to each other

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.390
are these big dots
that go around.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.830
And you see some just
need a couple of days

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.600
to go around their star.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.550
So if you ever
wanted to be older,

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.740
celebrate a birthday
on 51 [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.370
B. It only has a year
from Monday morning

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.680
to Friday afternoon.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.310
Incredibly hot.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.690
That Jupiter is evaporating
right now because it's

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.980
so close to its sun.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.229
So if you look at it
in a billion years,

00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:14.020
it will look different
because it will have

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.990
lost part of its atmosphere.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.080
But with more and
more observation time,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.190
we are finding planets
that are more and more

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.180
in a temperate zone and
especially, as Laura

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.910
was saying, around
these cool stars,

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.130
because of course
stars [? work with ?]

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.930
nuclear fusion in the core.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.840
But you can think
about it as a bonfire.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.500
If you have a big bonfire,
a big star like our own sun,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.230
you have to be a certain
distance away to be warm--

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.880
too close, you're too hot.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.250
But if the star is
smaller, you need

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.950
to be closer in for the
same amount of warmth

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.720
to get to you,
radiation to get to you.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.547
And so we looked.

00:27:56.547 --> 00:27:58.380
That's what you should
always do in science.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.570
And we were looking
for patterns.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.070
And it turns out that these
small stars are the most

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.050
abundant in the universe.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.240
About 75% of all stars are
these small, red stars.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.200
And they tend or they make rocky
planets incredibly efficiently.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.800
So mother nature in a
way did us a great favor,

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.200
for us astronomers and
for a search for life

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.630
in the universe, that
where we can actually

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.350
find planets that could
potentially be like the earth,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.620
she made more of them.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.930
And so we were off
to a very good start,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.090
because it could have gone
completely the other way.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.810
And so what I want to
talk to you about today is

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.140
that with all of this,
with thousands of planets

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.090
that we've already discovered
around other stars' alien suns,

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.030
now what are we looking for?

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.910
And Laura gave you this
beautiful introduction to,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.730
well, let's say the whole
atmosphere's CO2, right?

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.910
Then if I look at
it, part of the light

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.200
will be blocked out because
it will hit CO2 molecules.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.590
And a certain energy
will make a certain atom

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.220
or certain molecules
swing and rotate.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.750
It has to have a certain
energy that's a certain color.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.300
So think about it this way.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.380
The light from the star
hits the planets air,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.520
gets filtered through it, and
then comes to my telescope.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.850
So if there are
molecules and atoms

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.350
in this air that the light
can hit, that it can strike,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.840
less of the light comes
out on the other side.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.680
So I'm on my telescope looking
at this, and I'm a theorist,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.070
but as soon as we find these
exciting planets where there

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.450
are biosignatures,
I will also use

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.390
the data, as Laura has amazing
done already and David.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.420
But what I'm saying
is that by what's

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.690
missing in the light getting
to my telescope, that's

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.230
what tells me what the
chemical composition

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.540
of these other worlds are like.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.360
And with the next telescopes
that we're building,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.870
we actually can start to
figure out whether or not

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:10.520
these small, rocky walls
could be anything like ours,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.660
but of course not
just ours right now,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.600
because the earth has
changed through time.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.600
And when I teach this
in Astronomy 101,

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.260
I have a big intro class
that I love to teach.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.020
And I say, what is one thing if
anybody ever came with a time

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.260
machine and said, you
can go back to the past

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.200
or up to the future, what's the
one thing you need to bring?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.310
And it's usually a camera.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.870
I'm like congratulations,
you're opening

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.310
the door of the time machine.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:45.480
And you did, because the gas
or the atmospheric composition

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.790
of our planet was
completely different when

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.640
it was young than it is now.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.920
We had no oxygen
initially, for example.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.890
What was going on
while the dinosaur

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.320
roams is different than
what's going on right now.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.890
And probably in the future
things will be different, too.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.710
So I tell them to take a
gas mask or their own oxygen

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.590
plus a camera, because yes,
I would like a picture.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.690
And no, you cannot
make a time machine.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.650
[INAUDIBLE] that.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.480
That's just my
theoretical question.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.220
But let me bring you back
in time a little bit.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.570
41 years ago, we've
actually sent out

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:27.150
our first message in a bottle,
human kind's message to space.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.740
That was Voyager 1
with the golden record.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.010
And Carl Sagan at
Cornell led the team

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.790
that put together a
representative idea of what

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.225
the music and the
art of humankind

00:31:41.225 --> 00:31:45.100
would be in this
message in a bottle.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.820
And so we sent this mission out.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.960
It had a scientific
mission, Voyager 1 in 1977.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.700
It went to the outer planets.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.310
It told us a lot of
exciting science.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:01.330
And then it took a last swing
by and basically made its way

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.430
towards the next star
with our message on it

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.470
and a very cute
quote to music lovers

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.370
everywhere on it
and a description

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.090
of how to build a record
player in case some aliens came

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.050
across it.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.120
And I won't say much
more, because Jill

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.550
is going to talk more
about technology signatures

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.170
and intelligent life.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.040
But to say before
Voyager did that, left

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.070
Earth's solar
system, it basically

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:35.140
looked back one last time to
look at our own world, our home

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.190
world.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.340
That's what Carl Sagan
named the pale blue dot.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.310
And he wrote a beautiful
piece about it.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.900
But if you look up here on
the right, the small dots,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.960
that is us.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.180
And he said, everybody
who's ever loved,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.490
everybody who's ever lived.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:58.000
And he goes in big
detail on about this love

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.040
for this one world, the one
world we know can sustain life.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.560
And I will go with
the session before us.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.550
Please let it sustain life
for much longer, because we

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.850
have found other worlds.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.860
But we can't tell you if any of
them is a good vacation place.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.390
And we have no way to get there.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.450
So on the flip side,
you really don't

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.430
have to worry about
anybody coming here either,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.640
because these things
are light years away.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.580
And so if you take
our whole solar system

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.840
and it's the size of about a
cookie, then the next star,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.970
this next alien sun--

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.190
and the amazing thing
is even that one

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.440
has a planet that could
potentially be like ours--

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.660
is two football fields away.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.570
So travel is not
a possibility yet.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.050
However, these worlds teach us.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:53.520
They can teach us also
about how worlds evolve

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.950
in the first place
and when we can

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:00.360
start to analyze the small
ones, how worlds like our Earth

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.940
can actually evolve
in the future,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.570
give us an insight
into a long-term future

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.820
of habitable worlds like ours.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.790
So even if you don't care if
there's life anywhere else,

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.250
you kind of should care in
the long run what happens

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.889
to our own planet hopefully.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.719
And that is one of
the other answers

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.870
that we can actually
help with, because we

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.050
have more examples,
thousands of other worlds

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.361
where we can start to
understand the atmosphere

00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:28.069
and the dynamics.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.350
So if you have this tiny
dot, what you'd like to have,

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.480
of course, is a
picture like this--

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.600
oceans, continents, clouds.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.179
But it's too far away.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.810
So what you can do is you
can look at the light.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.480
Instead of actually
splitting out into sectors--

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.790
this is where there's a coast.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.929
This is [INAUDIBLE] oceans.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.889
You can split it
up into its light,

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.800
so from red to blue for example.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.040
And just have a look, it's
a spectrum like a rainbow.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.710
So basically when
there's a raindrop,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:09.310
it splits the white light
from the sun in its colors.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.010
And then as I said
before, you look and see

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.310
which colors are missing.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:18.050
And so this should be a smooth
curve, but it's really not.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.420
And so where there's
something missing,

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.780
it's not smooth, like
a bite out of an apple.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.330
That tells you where
the energy of the light

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:31.760
was just right to make the
molecules swing and rotate.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.040
We're looking in the
infrared right now.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.720
And that's unique, because
of course an oxygen, O2,

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.670
looks different
than, for example,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.190
an ozone molecule, three Os.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.790
So a different kind of
energy is needed for it

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.800
to start to swing and rotate.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.410
So by figuring out
what's missing,

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.830
you can see here the makeup
of the air in our own planet.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.630
So you see ozone.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.790
You see methane and
water and also CO2.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.410
And the combination of ozone
and oxygen, either of the two,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.270
with methane, a reducing gas,
is the telltale sign for life

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:17.590
as we know it, because we can't
produce it with biology alone.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:23.440
Oxygen and methane will
react to water and CO2.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.160
So if you still see oxygen
and methane in the air,

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.850
what that tells you is that
something is producing it

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:33.240
in huge amounts right now.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.630
And for oxygen, we have
no other explanation

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.190
than that being life.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.460
So that's our way to say
OK, if you look at the Earth

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.520
from far away, this is
how you could figure out

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.120
there's actually a
biota, life on it.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.110
And this spectral fingerprint
or this light fingerprint

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.720
is unique for the planets
in our own solar system.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:00.130
What you see here is
Venus, Earth, and Mars

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.700
and then down here two of
the other exciting places

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.460
in the solar system we're
interested in for life,

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.360
Titan on the left and
Europa in the middle here.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.910
But how do you translate this?

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.810
Of course we can use
it as a template.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.000
And that's what we
study and what we do.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.820
But how do you
translate that further

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.000
to a planet that is
nothing like or that's

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.900
not a carbon copy of
planets in our solar system?

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.130
And this is where the theory
of understanding planets

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.850
and atmosphere, interiors of
planets, how they interact

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.850
with the air, how they
interact with the heat coming

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:41.550
from the star comes in
in our undiscovered--

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.980
in this idea of this
undiscovered box

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.280
of what could be out there and
what we should be looking for.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.850
But as a first step, we can
just use our planet again

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.310
as a Rosetta stone, Earth.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.860
We know that it
differs through time.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.740
About 4.6 billion years
ago, it got formed.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.720
And if you put this on a kind
of a 24-hour clock if you want,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.320
about 3 AM is when life
started on the earth.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.420
And about lunchtime
is when it started

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.880
to release oxygen in the air.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.900
So before that, I don't
have a way to identify it.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.740
Even so it was there, it
only made methane or CO2.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.410
And that I can also
make geologically.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.240
So it's not so much
that it's not there.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.750
It's more that it doesn't
leave us with a unique sign.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.630
So in this undiscovered
parameter space,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.990
we not only have to find
worlds that could be like ours

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.570
or could host life like ours.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:44.790
We also have to find worlds
that we can identify such life

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.790
uniquely, because we'll go
with Carl Sagan here again.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:51.330
He said, "extraordinary
results better

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.950
have extraordinary
evidence behind them."

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.840
And so this is a view of
how our planet changed,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.030
again an artist's
impression, of course.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.720
But you see from
early on to now.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.920
And that brought with it
a change in biota as well.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.980
So intelligent life, I
took Einstein for that.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.400
So we're going with we
have intelligent life here.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.170
But I'm going to
wait for Jill's talk

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.294
and see whether or not she
agrees with that assessment.

00:39:20.294 --> 00:39:26.210
But all this again translates
into this light fingerprint.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.880
Our planet looked different
when it was young.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.050
It looks different now.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.240
And it will look
different in the future.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.400
But it's something
that we can catch

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.830
with these advanced telescopes
that we're building.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.320
And it won't be easy whatsoever.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.940
And I would like to
tell you that it's

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.540
going to be easy to do
with this new 6.5 meter

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.580
telescope, the James
Webb Space Telescope.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.090
So it's going to be
about four times my size

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.470
in space, what's great.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.630
However, it's going
to be at the limit

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.640
of our technical
capabilities to find it.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.420
And this is, of course, why
we need excellent observers

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.760
like Laura and Dave
to make this work

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.460
to let us find these features.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.850
This is what one of the
telescopes looks like.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.730
It's one of the extremely
large telescopes envisioned

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.230
to be in Chile.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.110
It's a 40 meter
telescope on the ground

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.580
because you have to take out
the atmospheric disturbance

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.440
on the image you
collect from the ground,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.120
so it needs to be bigger.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.540
And this is the telescope,
the James Webb Space Telescope

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.090
we should be launching in 2021.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.280
And while saying
that, we have just

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.630
launched this year an
amazing small telescope,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.280
the test satellite
that is actually

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.330
not just giving us statistics,
because I said count to five,

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:45.200
one out of five stars has a
planet that could be like ours.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.490
This test satellite that we
just launched in April this year

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.130
actually started taking
science data in July.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.370
And it's telling you
which of these stars

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.490
actually does have the
planets that could potentially

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.120
be like ours.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.040
And it's going to give us our
closest travel destination.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.990
Even so, this is going
to be in the far future.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.570
But in the last
couple of minutes,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.660
what I wanted to show you
is now this is undiscovered.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.840
And this is out-of-the-box
thinking that we need

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.080
to actually find life in
different environments.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.530
We can use Earth
as a Rosetta stone.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.010
But we basically
are not just going

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.080
to use life on earth like
plants and everything you see.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.880
We use life in the deep oceans
or we use life like water bears

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.860
that basically survive
kind of everything.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.590
They even took them to the
International Space Station,

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.330
put them out, no shelter.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.610
Three days later, they put
them back in, put water on,

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.580
and it was like da, da, da,
da, da, I'm fine, right?

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.540
So life is incredibly
diverse and versatile even

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.950
on our own planet.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.530
And in our search,
we need to put that

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.600
into our search strategy.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.680
We cannot just look for a planet
that's exactly a copy of ours,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.650
because even with billions
of planets in our own solar

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.700
system, the chances to find one
that's exactly like ours right

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.360
now is probably not as high
as you'd like it to be.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.400
But if it's just a
little bit different,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.540
we already know of life
that can survive there.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.790
So if you, for example,
walk through Yellowstone,

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.700
all these beautiful
colors is actually

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.884
biota that lives in
different conditions.

00:42:22.884 --> 00:42:24.550
And this is just a
really funny cartoon.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.440
It's like, what do you
mean extreme, right?

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.290
Because what's extreme for
us, for other life [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.480
of the earth, for other
biota is perfectly fine.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.910
It's where they strive.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.450
So the analog for what
conditions allow for life

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.720
on the earth are much
bigger than what we usually

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.200
think about, because we don't
think about these extreme forms

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.530
of life.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:50.210
And so one of my PhD students
put together a color catalogue

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.770
of life for going to many, many
different places on the earth,

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.710
taking this biota, and
then saying how would

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.940
it actually look like if you
saw a planet that was dominated,

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.150
let's say by an algae
bloom or by something else?

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.210
And it changes the
color and probably also

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.110
the atmospheric composition.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.910
So this is, in a way, the
undiscovered and thinking

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.180
outside of your box or at
least find other people

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.020
who have different boxes and
put all of that information

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.680
together.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.060
And of course, the star also
has a huge influence on it.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.210
Whether or not that life
gets hit by red light

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.804
or by white light is a different
influence in its evolution.

00:43:32.804 --> 00:43:34.220
And we don't know
much about this,

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.070
because we only have
our own Earth that

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.960
was hit by white light.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.080
But these small stars,
as Laura was saying,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.310
are also incredibly active.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.530
So what would life have to
do to survive like huge UV

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.030
on the surface?

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.760
And Laura was talking
about life on the surface,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.770
because of course
life can [? shelter ?]

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.050
on the water or can
[? shelter ?] on the ground.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.520
And then it doesn't
matter how much

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.080
UV radiation hits the surface.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.590
However, we were trying
again to think out

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:08.060
of the box in our research and
were saying, what does life do?

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.830
What are the different
strategies of life

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.260
if you hit it with a lot of UV?

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.780
And these are algae
that you see here

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.190
that when you hit it, actually
it starts to biofluoresce,

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.400
because it lives in
symbiosis with algae.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.110
The corals start
to biofluoresce,

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.420
because they live in
symbiosis with algaes

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.350
that can survive UV radiation.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.030
And so it's not to
say at all that that

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.190
would happen on another planet.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.370
But it is a strategy
that life on a very high

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:42.170
irradiated environment could
take to actually mitigate

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.660
this harsh UV environment.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:49.116
And actually biofluorescence
on the earth, we use it.

00:44:49.116 --> 00:44:50.990
We don't use the corals,
because there's only

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.270
0.2% of all the surface of
the life of the earth that

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.830
has corals.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.710
But this is how we actually
judge whether or not

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.130
plants are healthy.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.750
We use fluorescence, because
plants also fluoresce.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.750
Most of the things on the
earth actually fluoresce.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.000
And if you go to
[INAUDIBLE] aquarium,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.430
it's a little hard
to see, up here

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.010
you see this
biofluorescence corals.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.130
So most of the aquarium,
if they have UV light,

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.800
these biofluorescent
corals are the ones

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.420
that if they were to make up
these other kind of worlds,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.900
if that was an evolutionary
path that could work,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.370
a really interesting
idea would be

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.760
you'd have this huge
flare on the star

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.520
and the planet next
to it would light up,

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.760
because it breaks down
the harsh UV radiation

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.130
and gives you additional
visible light.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.610
So the way to think about
it, this undiscovered,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:52.490
is also to think stretch
your imagination,

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.600
because we have this incredibly
diversity of worlds out there.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.690
And using Earth
and all its facets,

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:04.070
not just anything we think about
every day, as a Rosetta stone,

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:08.780
is our one way to get at least
a little bit close to the answer

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.180
of how we could
find life out there.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.680
And that's my last slide.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.220
This is NASA's
artist travel poster

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.530
to a planet like TRAPPIST-1.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.860
But I love the quote that an
author from San Francisco,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.970
and he's contemporary, wrote
about our survey in the stars.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:30.710
And he says, "One day, from
the shores of a new world,

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.480
we'll gaze at the sea
that took us there.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.380
And the waves will be stars."

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:41.840
And that will be far,
far in the future.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.260
However, what we
are doing right now,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.080
these discoveries
we're making right now

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.920
is enabling humanity
or anybody who

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.847
comes after us to take
this next adventure.

00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:55.680
Thank you very much.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.998
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.610
- OK, so we can kind of keep
this a little conversational.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.332
And one thing in the theme--

00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:14.790
there's so many great things
to talk about with exoplanets.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.350
But really to get at the
theme of the undiscovered,

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:24.450
one thing that keeps me up
at night as an astronomer

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.180
is the role of our tools.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.800
So we use telescopes.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.430
That is our tool of choice.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:37.050
And if I think about a
lot of the important steps

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:41.100
forward in exoplanets, we
talked all about atmospheres.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.530
The first discovery
of an atmosphere

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.290
was made with the Hubble
Space Telescope, which

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.590
was conceived of and designed
and launched before we knew

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.962
of anything about exoplanets.

00:47:50.962 --> 00:47:52.920
There was no concept that
people would ever use

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.902
the Hubble for that purpose.

00:47:54.902 --> 00:47:56.610
Similarly, if you
think of the first time

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.920
we measured light from planets,
that was done with the Spitzer

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.670
Space Telescope.

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.260
Same story again.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:07.590
So I just wanted to get
your thoughts on how--

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.070
the point is, should we design
our experiments to really

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:14.760
go and detect something very
specific or is there a danger

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.880
and should we build much
more general purpose

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.200
observatories, but by
nature they will not

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.600
be as penetrating on
a particular topic

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.450
and what the dangers are of
over-designing tools in a field

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:30.307
that is largely undiscovered?

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:31.390
- That's a great question.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.500
I think that-- so someone
earlier brought up

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:39.110
the metaphor of searching
for your keys under the lamp

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.727
in the easiest place to look.

00:48:40.727 --> 00:48:42.810
And I think there's something
to be said for that,

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.020
because there's--

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.090
and that was actually
presented as a negative.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.400
But for us, the observing the
atmospheres of these planets

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.340
that are so small and so
far away is so technically

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.550
challenging that usually my
approach is to say, look,

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.910
I'll take whatever I can get.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:03.090
Let's design something
that would give us

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.540
a reasonable chance of
learning about the atmosphere

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.330
of a planet like this and keep
an open mind about what exactly

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.090
the signal is that
we're trying to see.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.110
So not-- so more
specifically, not just the I

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.360
want to detect oxygen on
an exact earth analog.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:19.860
- Right.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.510
But let me push on that a bit.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:30.580
So Lisa, you showed all this
kind of great diversity of life

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.360
on the earth.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.749
The truth is when we are
designing our experiments

00:49:33.749 --> 00:49:35.290
to go and look for
life, we're really

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.020
looking for life that's
identical to that on the earth.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.000
I mean, it's got to
be a rocky planet.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.500
It's got to be the
same temperature.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.540
It's got to have
oxygen and methane

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.430
and water in the atmosphere.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:51.190
And is there a danger
to basically looking

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.450
for a mirror of ourselves?

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:55.210
And what would it take
to go and recognize

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.430
life that was fundamentally
different than life

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.440
on the earth?

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.740
Is that something that
we could aspire to do?

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.300
Are we basically shackled
in that, we could only

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.550
ever recognize life that's
so similar to the earth

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.510
that that's the only
thing we can look for?

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.120
- So I think there's two
parts of that answer.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.220
And one part is that what
we learn from planets

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.929
is that they are very diverse.

00:50:16.929 --> 00:50:18.970
So what you don't want to
do, what you definitely

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:22.570
don't want to do is
basically limit yourself to,

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.750
let's say, with this one,
I can find one molecule,

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.180
because I've now put all
my eggs in the basket

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.510
that oxygen is what
will define life,

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.700
because we'll figure out oxygen
you can make by splitting water

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.470
or by splitting CO2.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:39.310
So giving you the
context is key.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.450
And so if you can get as
much wavelength as you can,

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.700
that is your first information.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.160
Split the light as far from one
side to the other as you can.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.570
Get some information
on the temperature,

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:56.710
plus get a conformation
on the reflected light.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:01.990
However, I think with this
big, multipurpose telescope

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.770
on one side, there is the
small explorer missions that

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.750
are key to our success,
because for example,

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.020
if I want to know how
much radiation really

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:15.790
hits my planet, I might not
need this huge, huge telescope,

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.010
but this small
dedicated telescope that

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:23.320
does this one just perfectly or
[INAUDIBLE] basically looking

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.340
all the closest nearby
stars to give me

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.800
the answer on which
of our closest stars

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.140
have potentially
habitable world.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.300
I think the key
thing in science is

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.130
that we developing our tools.

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:39.220
And we'll always want to
have one big thing that

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.550
can do a lot, but we need
to keep it, I would say,

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:44.650
wavelengths [INAUDIBLE]
or energy wise as wide

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:48.589
as we can and then have these
complimentary small missions.

00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:50.380
And the second point
that I haven't got to,

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.030
but very shortly.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.940
If I know what to
look for, then I

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.480
can say this I can
only explain with life.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.725
I can find other life.

00:51:59.725 --> 00:52:02.560
We're looking for things
that look weird, right?

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:07.330
However, I won't be able
to tell you I know for sure

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.810
that this is life, because we
can't make life in the lab yet.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:14.830
So what I mean is like
if silica-based life--

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:17.920
carbon has a lot of things
going for it, water too.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.070
And we're looking
at this warm place

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:25.210
around the sun similar to what
the earth gets in energy, only

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.285
because the idea is that
if you have a huge ice

00:52:28.285 --> 00:52:33.170
layer like for Europa, if
their gas is produced by life,

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.210
it gets trapped or it can get
trapped under the ice layer

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:38.650
and will never
make it to my air.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:41.620
And the only thing I can assess
if I can't go there and drill

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.900
a hole in the ice is the air.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.560
So I'm trying to make my
planets be where they're not

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.876
going to freeze over.

00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:50.500
So I think there are
a couple of things

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.360
that go into this equation.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:52.990
- OK.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.837
So I think what we want to--

00:52:54.837 --> 00:52:55.420
this is great.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.625
I think what we want
to do is ask people

00:52:58.625 --> 00:53:00.250
with questions to
come forward, to make

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.880
sure to use the microphones.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.350
And we'll give you
a moment to step up.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.263
- Hi, I'm Rachel
from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:11.263 --> 00:53:14.100
So the stars that we're
looking at for having life,

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.500
they're light years away.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.320
So technically we're
looking into the past.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.740
So should we be
comparing our Earth

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.040
from the past and our atmosphere
as it was from the past

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.470
to those atmospheres,
because it has the potential

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:31.060
to change like we have changed
over the billions of years?

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.560
So yeah.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.060
- Right.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.280
And may I--

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.840
I can see a long
line of questions.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.230
I see we have 10 minutes.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.200
Can we do like two or
three sentence answers?

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.241
And that way we can really
kind of keep it going.

00:53:40.241 --> 00:53:41.050
So--

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.460
- So the good
thing we have going

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.860
for us is the closest star,
the more light I get from it.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.900
So I can only see things that
are only about 100 years away

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.490
that have planets around it.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.340
But your question
is exactly right.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.350
We see it like it
was four years ago

00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.170
is the closest star, six
years, 10 years, 50 years ago.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.690
And it could have
changed meanwhile.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.120
But, fingers crossed,
they figured out

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.740
how to do climate
change and we're not

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.926
going to be too late when
we find signs of life.

00:54:07.926 --> 00:54:08.426
- Thank you.

00:54:08.426 --> 00:54:09.160
- OK, thank you.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:09.724
Next.

00:54:09.724 --> 00:54:10.390
- All right, hi.

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.056
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:11.056 --> 00:54:12.860
And I'm also from
[INAUDIBLE] High School.

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.440
So in sci-fi movies
that you see today,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.730
you usually see that the
aliens are more technically

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.140
inclined more than we are.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.880
So what's to say that we're
not the ones that have the best

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.970
technology and not them?

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:26.822
- I think that's--

00:54:26.822 --> 00:54:28.280
yeah, I think that's
a great point.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.860
In my mind, there's
no clear indication

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.170
that intelligence is
actually evolutionarily

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:34.460
favorable at all.

00:54:37.757 --> 00:54:38.840
- Oh, I think I would go--

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.154
- That's absolutely true.

00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:42.070
- I think I would go for
the other way, sorry.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.850
Just a quick question.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.090
If there really life
everywhere could be,

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.190
then we're talking
about one in five stars.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:51.950
We're talking about 40
billion planets out there.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.032
And I have high hopes with
stars being older and younger

00:54:55.032 --> 00:54:56.990
that some of them are
going to be further along

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.600
and some are going
to be less along.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.500
The question is how
long they survived.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.560
But I'm an optimist.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.851
I think we're going to make it.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.400
- I'm Tatiana, also
from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.860
And I've seen things on YouTube
talking about this Great

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.830
Barrier and if us
as humans, if we've

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.020
crossed that Great
Barrier and we've been

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:19.340
able to overcome that and that's
why we've been able to evolve.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.370
What's your opinion on that?

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.200
Do you think we've actually
crossed that barrier?

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.464
- I think there's a very
fun sci-fi novel there.

00:55:27.464 --> 00:55:28.880
There's actually
a really good one

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.700
where Reynolds is talking about
this, where he says, well,

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.840
you don't live long enough.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.600
So once you're at
this threshold,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.700
then some alien will
come and bring you there

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.110
so everybody can meet.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.390
But I said I'm an
optimist by training.

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:48.770
I think life-- the problem
is we sometimes think of us.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.780
Whether we're going
to make it, finding

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.460
another alien civilization
and communication with that,

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.510
I'm not sure.

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:55.940
However, that life
is still going

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.894
to be around when somebody
else comes looking for us,

00:55:59.894 --> 00:56:00.560
I'm pretty sure.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.680
It takes a lot to kill life
on the planet, fortunately.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.490
It doesn't take that
much to kill us.

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:06.740
So we better be a bit careful.

00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:10.490
- Hi.

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:11.400
I'm Colleen Ellis.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.200
And you'll never
guess where I'm from.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.310
So in our astronomy class, we
learn about really, really big

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.000
numbers.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.790
And it's a lot of
17-year-olds disassociating

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.460
and having existential crises
at 8:00 in the morning.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.370
How do you as professionals
deal with such large numbers

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:27.330
day in and day out?

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.790
- So I teach a class of
250 undergrad students.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.040
They're just coming into
Cornell and love my class.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.480
And so sometimes they also--

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.440
so the existential
crisis will stay.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.496
It's just going to
become different.

00:56:45.496 --> 00:56:47.760
This connection
[? is to the ?] stars.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.441
Everyone can always look up
and you'll see those stars.

00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:51.940
They're always going
to be with you.

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.720
Nobody can take those away.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.610
In the Sahara Desert
when you have nothing

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.190
or when people have nothing
else, no TV, no technology

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.770
or something, they
still have the stars.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:04.730
And so to me, it provides
me a beautiful context

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.190
to the universe
and how I fit in.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.680
And I'm trying to
tell them that.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.180
And the other thing
you can do, it's

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.920
a really cheap birthday present.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.690
Figure out which
star is, let's say,

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:18.020
20 years away, print that
out, give it to your friend,

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.280
costs nothing, and it's
a beautiful present, just

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.640
a life choice.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.150
- Thank you.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.858
- And I'll just--

00:57:22.858 --> 00:57:24.540
I'll add to that really quickly.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:28.250
It's not something you
ever really get used to.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.200
So I really like
something that Ceili

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.750
said this morning or last
night about the first time she

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.010
saw the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.230
And she said she cried
for like 15 minutes.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:39.290
That happened to me the
first time I went observing

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.980
and I saw all of the stars
in the night sky in Chile

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.040
in one of the best observing
sites in the world.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.010
And I had to take a minute
to go outside and just sob,

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:51.830
because you can--
it makes it so real

00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:54.050
how many stars and
planets there are.

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:57.980
And so the sheer number
of inhabitable planets

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.609
in the world or in the universe
is something that you never

00:58:00.609 --> 00:58:01.400
really get used to.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.270
- I'm Alex from
[INAUDIBLE] High School.

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:10.220
And do you think that
non-carbon-based life

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.510
forms could exist?

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:13.290
And are you looking for them?

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.510
And another question,
do you think

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:17.600
that a life form
would have to be

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.440
bipedal to achieve
space flight and go

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.980
to other solar system
or another planet?

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.410
- So great question.

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:29.820
Let me answer that second
one just very fast.

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.940
Nope, because I
think that's more

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.800
to do with sci-fi
movie budgets and they

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.570
had to fit somebody in there
who had two feet and two legs.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.510
It was cheaper than do CGI.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.490
But the first question
is a very good one.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:44.450
What about life that's
completely different than ours?

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.070
One thing to think
about it this way

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:50.120
is life as we know it is
incredibly good in using what's

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.770
around to live or to evolve.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.110
So that's mostly when you
look at the universe, that's

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.690
hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:03.020
So for life to actually
not use carbon and water,

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.980
a couple of things
would have to happen.

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.210
So for whatever reason, even
chemical, they are favorable.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.240
But if you go to a temperature
range like on Titan

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.460
where it's so cold that
water would freeze,

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:19.830
you need another solvent if life
always has RNA, DNA, molecules,

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:21.020
vasculars.

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.150
The problem is I don't
know what to look for.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:27.250
So we're designing our missions
for life as we know it.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.750
We know it involved
the case of one.

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.880
If we ever find life on Titan,
we'll do it for a case of two.

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.540
But right now, case
of one, and then

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.790
we keep our eyes open for
anything weird, because that's

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:40.850
going to be probably
where even the more

00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:43.280
interesting discoveries are
going to come from, things

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.210
we can't explain.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:48.528
And then we'll start a whole
new sort of new research area.

00:59:48.528 --> 00:59:49.028
- Thank you.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.550
- I'm David Allen.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.950
This is the third
session in which we've

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:03.470
heard how social taboos in
the particular discipline

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:06.800
have prevented data
from coming forward,

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.500
important data that then
eventually lead to taboos--

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:15.035
excuse me-- led to
really breakthroughs.

01:00:15.035 --> 01:00:18.140
This may not be an
existential crisis.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.100
And we see this kind of
herd-following behavior

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.570
very much outside of
scientific disciplines.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:29.060
But today is about
the undiscovered.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.350
And it's been operationalized
as celebrating failure

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.790
and the benefits of failure.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:39.440
In fact, this
problem of taboos was

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.990
addressed in the first
session in talking

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.370
about how do you grant tenure
to somebody who's failed.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:55.310
Let's imagine that this is a
problem of the social climate

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.850
in a discipline and,
as I said also, outside

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.350
of scientific disciplines.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:03.800
But that's what we're
talking about today.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.820
If you'd reflect
in your own domain,

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.940
and if you please beyond
that and other sciences

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.770
or even otherwise,
how might we address

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.260
this what appears to
be a problem if we're

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:25.100
going to be serious about not
keeping important data hidden?

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.080
- I think one of the
first things I would say

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.950
is science is not
never, ever disconnected

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.090
from the human endeavor.

01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.770
We're all humans first.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:35.280
And then we train as scientists.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.571
So there will always be this
thing where, like, oh this

01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:38.180
can't happen.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.580
But then with enough
evidence, we change our ideas.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.654
We say, OK, because
other than that,

01:01:43.654 --> 01:01:45.320
we would have never
done this discovery.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.720
Everybody would have
pushed it under the rug.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.150
There's enough mounting
evidence to say OK.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:55.370
So my human intuition that this
cannot happen is now overrun

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:59.660
by my analytical training that
I have to look at the facts.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.580
But science is a human endeavor.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.461
And it takes time for that
to come through, I think.

01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:05.960
- Yeah, I'll just
add to that that I

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.450
think this is a really serious
question that you've raised.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:10.550
And in my mind, the
best way to address it

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.540
is by educating kids.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.350
I wish that every funding
agency had the attitude that you

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.580
have about risk taking.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.650
But the reality is that we're
accountable to our taxpayers

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.910
who often have--

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.600
who are taught a
mindset about science

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.840
that you have to have your
hypothesis and test it.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.210
And so being uncertain
and doing risky things

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.910
and trying to
explore the unknown

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.570
is something that we're not very
comfortable with as a society,

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:41.410
I would say.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.310
And so changing
the way science is

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:46.549
taught so that the next
generation of voters

01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:48.340
and taxpayers is more
comfortable with this

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.360
is, I think, what we should do.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.880
Looking at you,
high school kids.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.540
- So human beings are our
real topic [? thing. ?]

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.040
- Yep.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.440
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.150
- Thank Laura and
Lisa and Dave for

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.040
that fantastic conversation.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.890
[APPLAUSE]
