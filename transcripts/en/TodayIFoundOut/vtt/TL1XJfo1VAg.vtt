00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:13.789
With a 
brand recognition rate somewhere close to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.050
99% in the States, it’s pretty safe to say
that almost everyone reading this has at least

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.490
heard of Juicy Fruit gum, if not also chewed
it at some point.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.550
The question we’re looking at today is-
exactly what fruit is Juicy Fruit supposed

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.490
to taste like and does it actually contain
any dehydrated juice from that fruit?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.260
Now you’d think that answering this question
would be as simple as picking up a pack of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.640
Juicy Fruit gum and reading the ingredients
list, but as with most things in life, we

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.270
discovered it’s just not that easy.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.640
For starters, the ingredients listed on a
pack of Juicy Fruit are incredibly vague;

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.430
the only real piece of useful information
you can glean from a pack itself is that the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
gum contains “Natural and artificial flavors”.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.660
Helpful…

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.460
This also isn’t helped by the fact that
Wrigley, the company who make Juicy Fruit,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.109
are similarly coy about discussing what goes
into their product, often choosing to refrain

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:12.710
from mentioning any specific fruit in regards
to its flavour and excusing this evasive behaviour

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.039
by stating that the flavour is a trade secret.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.119
That said, with a little digging, you’ll
find that, in the past, Wrigley has explicitly

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.170
said that Juicy Fruit contains notes of “lemon,
orange, pineapple and banana” in response

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.210
to emails from curious customers asking for
more specific information about Juicy Fruit’s

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.210
flavour.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.509
Again though, this isn’t entirely helpful
in discerning whether or not the gum actually

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.819
contains fruit juice, since (always awesome)
science has made it possible to synthesize

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.939
almost any flavour we want.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.299
JackfruitCuriously, there is a fruit out there
known to taste almost exactly like Juicy Fruit-

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.310
a lesser known fruit from the shores of Africa
and Asia known as Jackfruit.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.119
Jackfruit tastes so much like Juicy Fruit
gum that it is often one of the first things

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.359
mentioned when it’s discussed by Western
media and there is a small, but nonetheless

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.799
dedicated subset of people who believe that
it is the key secret ingredient in the gum.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.120
However, although Jackfruit tastes like Juicy
Fruit gum, this isn’t because Juicy Fruit

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.110
contains any juice from the Jackfruit (a dead
giveaway being that there are no records of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.580
Wrigely importing the fruit or juice).

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.850
The real reason the two taste and smell so
similar is because they both (probably) contain

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.599
a chemical called, isoamyl acetate.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.250
The reason we have to say “probably” is
because, as noted, Wrigley won’t confirm

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.599
what exactly goes into making Juicy Fruit,
which is their right as a company, but experts

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.290
are still pretty sure that isoamyl acetate
has something to do with Juicy Fruit.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.060
One of the most compelling arguments for isoamyl
acetate being the primary flavouring agent

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.709
behind Juicy Fruit is that, like Jackfruit,
the chemical is said to smell very similar

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.709
to it.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.790
Even in literature that doesn’t mention
Juicy Fruit by name, isoamyl acetate is said

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.909
to have an indistinct, almost indescribably
“fruity” smell that contains hints of

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.549
banana, peach and other similar sweet fruits,
which is pretty much the exact same way people

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.579
who haven’t eaten Jackfruit describe Juicy
Fruit.

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.829
Making this argument even more tantalising
is that, historically, one of the few ways

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.070
to obtain isoamyl acetate in commercially
viable quantities was as a by-product of whiskey

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.070
production.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.019
When Wrigley first began producing Juicy Fruit
gum in 1893, they did so from a factory in

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.060
Illinois, the biggest whiskey State in America
at the time.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.680
Suggesting that, perhaps, Wrigley sourced
isoamyl acetate, and hence Juicy Fruit’s

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.079
unique flavour, from the many factories producing
whiskey nearby.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.040
juicy-fruitPerhaps the most damning piece
of evidence of all about Juicy Fruit’s flavour

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.110
being the result of artificially created chemicals
instead of real fruit is that they themselves

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.549
used to explicitly advertise the “artificial
flavor” of their product as a unique selling

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.620
point up until a few decades ago.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.769
You see, early packs of Juicy Fruit starting
around the 1940s carried the slogan “The

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.510
Gum With the Fascinating Artificial Flavor”
which they used as a way of enticing customers

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.510
to try it.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.060
It is only in recent years, with the trend
to avoid artificial chemicals in consumables,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.569
that Wrigley has shied away from advertising
the fact that Juicy Fruit’s unique flavour

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.650
is, in all likelihood, the result of artificially
created chemicals rather than a cocktail of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:30.430
chemicals directly extracted from fruit.
