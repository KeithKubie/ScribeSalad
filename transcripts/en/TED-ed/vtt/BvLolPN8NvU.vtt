00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:08.708
A whip-like straw.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.045
Powerful, crushing blades.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.605
A pointed, piercing tube.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.079
There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.821
but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.058
And that’s extremely useful to scientists

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:26.003
because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild,

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:30.434
they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:33.349
Scientific classification, or taxonomy,

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.345
is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels:

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.513
kingdom,

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:39.414
phylum,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.558
class,

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:41.563
order,

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:42.595
family,

00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:43.696
genus,

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.485
and species.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:50.941
The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to,

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:56.431
while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.973
The chewing mouthpart is the most common.

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:00.503
It’s also the most primitive—

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:04.225
all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.565
before evolving into something different.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.647
It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles

00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.832
with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods,

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:16.215
like leaves or other insects.

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:19.894
You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order,

00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:22.909
grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.589
dragonflies of the Odonata order,

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:28.657
and beetles of the Coleoptera order.

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:34.321
The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak.

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.210
This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.997
to suck up liquids like sap or blood.

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:43.075
It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:45.850
that liquefy food for easier sucking.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.103
Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:51.403
and include bed bugs,

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.271
cicadas,

00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:53.056
aphids,

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:54.546
and leafhoppers.

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:55.819
The siphoning mouthpart,

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.602
a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak,

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:03.139
also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.355
that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers.

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.534
Insects of the Lepidoptera order—

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.204
butterflies and moths—

00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:13.681
keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.682
when they’re not feeding

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:18.674
and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar.

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.258
With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube,

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:23.935
this time ending in two spongy lobes

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.564
that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.683
The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:35.084
and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action.

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.469
House flies,

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.570
fruit flies,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.573
and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order

00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:43.373
are the only insects 
that use this technique.

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:44.736
But, there’s a catch.

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.763
Biting flies within Diptera,

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:47.834
like mosquitoes,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.676
horse flies,

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:49.750
and deer flies,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.251
have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart.

00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:58.564
And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.789
and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.365
for lapping up nectar.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.115
On this type of mouthpart,

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:08.626
the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating.

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:12.374
For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order,

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:17.162
they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:20.574
Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules.

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:23.508
The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example,

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:27.107
have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions,

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:30.510
like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.460
before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.274
with siphoning mouthparts.

00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:38.449
Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.930
help scientists—and you
—categorize insects.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.852
So why not break out a magnifying lens

00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:47.051
and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden,

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.255
biting your arm,

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:50.051
or just flying by your ear.
