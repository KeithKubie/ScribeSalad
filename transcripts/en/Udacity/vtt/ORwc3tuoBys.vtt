00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.990
So now you know the process
of building an engaging game.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.930
And you have insight into how game
design can keep players returning

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.060
to your game.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.968
&gt;&gt; So what do you think with
key takeaways from this lesson.

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:13.420
&lt;&lt; I think the most important
thing I learned is,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.050
that there's no one way to monetize a
game or get your players engaged in it.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.590
But to make a great game, you always
want to keep your audience in mind and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.970
choose the best game pace for them.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.570
Building a game so
it gets more difficult over time and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
involves friendly competition is a great
way to keep your game interesting.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.960
&gt;&gt; And keeping players interested and
having high player retention

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.930
is the main way a game will
make money and not fizzle out.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.300
&gt;&gt; Besides game pace we also
made sure that our game was

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.870
easy to use across devices by saving
all our data into the cloud and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.640
building in an easy restart mechanism.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.310
&gt;&gt; And finally we talked
about how to get a fan base

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.940
who can help you promote your game
through social networks and outreach.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.190
&gt;&gt; A couple of times we've also
mentioned ways to make money in your

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.110
game through in app ads,
purchases and so on.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.210
But we'll talk about this in
more detail in the next section

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.440
which is all about
monetization strategies.
