00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.620
Walt Guy's biography is on the website.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.550
I hope you've had a chance to look at it.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:25.920
I will just say briefly that I guess, of all
the lecturers coming, that Walt is the only

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.150
one who is still actually working actively
for NASA.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.440
He is head of the Automation, Robotics and
Simulation Division, division chief at the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440
Johnson Space Center.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.210
But that is not what he's talking about there.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.480
He's talking about the job that he used to
do for about 20 years which was head of environmental

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.510
thermal life support and crew systems.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
And, of course, the crew system includes all
the space suits and the good stuff that I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.951
was fortunate enough to get to use.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:59.670
So I've got a personal debt of thanks to Walt.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.739
Aaron, I think you wanted to say a couple
of things so I will pass the microphone to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.739
you.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.340
Yes, I would like to say a few words about
Walt.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.710
We've worked together for many years.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.440
And Walt Guy has the very unique capability
of being not only an outstanding engineer,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.119
a technical person, but he also has a very
unique capability of being a great or outstanding

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.800
project manager, program manager.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.380
No matter what task you gave Walt, he could
deliver the product on performance, on schedule

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.380
and on time.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.670
He has that unique capability.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.369
And he's done that from the Apollo Program
through the Shuttle Program.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.830
And I think you're really in for a treat to
hear Walt talk about the environmental control

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.830
systems.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.580
He has a lot of information to offer you so,
without further ado, let me turn it over to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Walt.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.580
Thank you, Aaron.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.920
As Aaron said, we worked together over several
programs over a long period of time.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.640
I was noticing the picture.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.660
I'm sure that wasn't put there for me.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.970
But my current responsibilities are the robotic
arm you see there.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.970
That is a shuttle arm.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.000
Of course there are station arms also.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.220
Grapple fixture over here on the left.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.170
And the little jet pack on the tumbling crewman
there is part of my current responsibilities.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.280
The 20 years that Jeff mentioned, I was responsible
for the development of the Shuttle spacesuit.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.880
So it was like it was meant for me anyway.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.420
What I'd like to do is talk about the design.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.300
I know in the syllabus it said environmental
control systems.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.780
So where did all the rest of the stuff come
from?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.580
If you go back in perspective, the Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo Program had the classical thing

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
that aerospace calls environmental control
systems.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.980
It was basically a cabin system.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.840
It took care of the living quarters for the
crew.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.160
But in the Shuttle era the responsibility
of that system expanded to include more than

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:21.840
just the cabin and, thus, the very long hard
to say name.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.040
These are the subsystem elements of the environmental
thermal control and life support system.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:39.860
The first area I am going to -- These are
the areas, the subsystems.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.620
The first area is the cabin atmospheric revitalization
system.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.030
This is a long way of saying to take care
of the atmosphere in the cabin.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.220
Humans are pollutants and this is the system
that takes care of that.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.620
The cabin atmospheric pressure and composition,
this is obviously to maintain the pressure

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.360
and enough oxygen for breathing.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.440
The third is the cabin thermal control, and
that is the classical environmental control

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440
system.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.330
But, for Shuttle, we've added some functions.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.460
One is the water and waste management subsystem.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.889
There are some hygiene functions required,
there are some recharge of the spacesuit's

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.660
backpack, management of the fuel cell water
system, the fuel cells of the electrical power

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.820
supply and provide a lot of extra water.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.930
Also, the vehicle at this point, has a dedicated
active thermal control system that takes care

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.970
of all of the systems in the vehicle, not
just the cabin systems.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.830
And then last is the airlock support subsystem.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.350
This is the EVA crewman's portal to space.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.331
And so the environmental thermal control and
life support system covers all these areas.

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:58.710
What I will do is go through each one of those.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.151
The first is the cabin atmospheric revitalization
system.

00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:10.290
Its functions are CO2 and trace gas removal,
humidity control, environmental cooling and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.780
atmospheric circulation and ventilation.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.900
Again, I will talk each about these.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.699
But I do want to mention that there is a uniqueness
about space and that there is no convection

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.470
so circulation is important.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.340
Also, because of the fact that there is no
convection, getting rid of the body heat,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.480
the latent heat requires a ventilation of
the crew.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.410
So each of these areas ended up as part of
the system design.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.371
This is an overview silhouette of the Orbiter.

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:52.230
I will use this throughout the presentation.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.150
As you can see, part of the system we're talking
about now, the atmospheric revitalization

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.590
system is located upfront where the crew is.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.710
It is beneath the floor.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.580
And we will be talking about the systems in
the remainder of the Orbiter as we go along.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.590
This is a simplified schematic.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.770
I would like to start at the cabin fans.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.620
These are redundant.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.510
Each fan will do the job.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:26.479
The next in line is the CO2 scrubber followed
by the cooler, the cabin heat exchanger.

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.130
There is a bypass around that for control
of the amount of cooling that is needed.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.419
As you are aware, the Shuttle can fly with
few or many crewmen.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.630
It turns out, as time has gone on, we fly
pretty much a full compliment.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.169
But the original design was to fly a small
number of crewmen.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.830
Also, this does give you temperature control.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.420
The same heat exchanger provides the condensation
of the water from the atmosphere.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.510
Therefore, you get humidity control.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.300
And then that is collected.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.670
The gas continues on.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.040
It is now chilled and is provided out to the
flight deck and the middeck to the crew.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:14.040
Then the gas from the cabin is then drawn
back in through some flight deck avionics

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.440
and back through the fans.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.290
So this is the basic systems schematic.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:27.910
I might pause here a moment to sort of explain
the role of the government in the development

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.509
of the Shuttle.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.840
As you know, the prime was Rockwell.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.860
It was their job to build the vehicle.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:45.320
But the government philosophy, management
philosophy was to have ownership of the technical

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.570
aspects of the design.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.650
So we had basically no excuse.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.320
If it didn't work it wasn't because the contractor
did something wrong.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.020
We had to have ownership.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.150
In fact, Aaron, as the project manager, would
probably look to us first as the reason for

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.630
a problem as opposed to Rockwell because we
were the conscience of the program so we should

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:17.710
have made sure they didn't do it wrong and
provided whatever technical insight to Aaron

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.750
to make sure he made the programmatic decisions
to make sure things were not done wrong.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.881
Very early in the Shuttle Program, I was responsible
for an engineering organization.

00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:35.020
And that engineering organization wanted to
own the design of the environmental thermal

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.690
control and life support system.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:48.960
We acquired a chamber.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.360
This is a near atmospheric chamber.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.740
It is a square so it is obviously not shaped
like the Orbiter cabin, but the volume was

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.740
appropriate.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.300
And it did allow a sealed environment for
testing.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.269
It would take a couple of PSI delta Ps.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:07.939
That's about all it would take.

00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:15.700
We developed a -- [COMMENT FROM HOFFMAN],
No, that was a different one.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.369
OK.

00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:24.209
We developed an environmental control system
or an atmospheric revitalization control system

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:27.189
and placed it inside to do early testing.

00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:30.459
As you can see here, this is the fan package.

00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:32.949
The CO2 scrubbers are here.

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.429
Heat exchange package over here.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:44.589
And you can tell we're not current in terms
of calendar-wise.

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:52.720
The CO2 and trace gas removal, the requirements
were to maintain less than 7.6 millimeters

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720
of mercury.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.920
This is certainly to provide a habitable environment
for the crew.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:03.300
This is higher than sea level but the medics
agreed that that was a completely adequate

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.790
level for CO2.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.920
The CO2 absorption came from the humidified
cabin gas so the system had to accommodate

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.239
that as a feed stream.

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:18.980
The absorbent selected was lithium hydroxide.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.420
The equation was a lithium hydroxide reacted
with the CO2 to produce lithium carbonate,

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.420
water and heat.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.040
And this was a single use system.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.439
It turns out that the lithium hydroxide was
an old solution.

00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:42.129
The previous spacecraft had used the same
solution, but pretty much their solution was

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:45.689
unique purchased production of lithium hydroxide.

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:51.470
When we entered the Shuttle era, we were hoping
for a long duration.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.199
And the idea was to use the commercial products
to get away from special production.

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:57.579
And so we looked around.

00:10:57.579 --> 00:11:01.959
And the Navy was producing a screened special
production run for their submarines.

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:04.769
So there was a lot of use there.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:07.009
And so the production was reasonably upo.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:09.129
We decided to use the Navy grade.

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:13.689
And so we brought it in and put it in the
test bed that I just showed you and did some

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:15.959
tests, and it didn't work worth a darn.

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:25.800
You notice the loops here show that our use
of the canister was much more rapid that we

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800
had hoped for.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:35.540
The nice beautiful deep loops here are a process
that we developed to screen the Navy LiOH

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.619
so that we didn't have to create a new production
capability but were able to test the LiOH

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:47.730
that came off their production line and get
a LiOH that was much more humidity tolerant.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:55.550
The key here turned out to be not the chemical
itself but its ability to produce good performance

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.769
over a wide humidity range.

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:07.720
So we were able to screen that and make that
a viable non-special production run LiOH.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.140
The lithium hydroxide, I said, was an old
solution.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.970
All previous spacecraft have been pretty short
mission.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.389
And even the Shuttle was a short mission.

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:23.029
But the specification for Shuttle said that
it should have a capability of going 28 days,

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:30.429
and 28 days is not a short mission, at least
not in Shuttle parlance.

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:35.939
The engineering part of the organization said,
well, why don't we go with a regenerative

00:12:35.939 --> 00:12:36.939
system?

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:41.399
SkyLab had just been successfully flown with
a regenerative system, something that wouldn't

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:46.850
have all this expendables because 28 days
worth of lithium hydroxide for seven crewmen

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.389
fills everything up with lithium hydroxide.

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:51.899
There is no room for anything else.

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:57.089
So we began to look at a regenerative system
that could be used.

00:12:57.089 --> 00:12:59.449
Actually, it was proposed as part of the original
Shuttle development.

00:12:59.449 --> 00:13:06.000
But, at that point, the 28-day mission was
considered a special case and the design case

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.170
was the shorter missions.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.470
And, in fact, there were even projected to
be a lot of short missions.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.249
The idea that the Shuttle was a space truck.

00:13:14.249 --> 00:13:17.519
It would take stuff up, dump it out and come
home.

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:20.541
And so the lithium hydroxide was a lighter
system than a regenerative system.

00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:26.299
The lithium hydroxide was placed into the
vehicle as a basic design.

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:32.170
But, when the Space Lab era came along, we
needed longer missions.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:42.600
We flew about four or five times in this 13
to 16 day range, and those missions did require

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.410
a lot of lithium hydroxide.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:51.259
And so it was proposed to use an absorbent
that was regenerable, and the one that was

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:53.940
selected was a solid amine.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:03.369
The absorbent is a polymerized ethyleneimine.

00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:07.299
Its designation is RNH, and I don't really
know why.

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:09.930
The absorption actually comes in, in two steps.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:16.660
First there is a reaction with water to create
the Freon.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:24.730
And then that is then reactive with the CO2
to give you another free ion, but the CO2

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.730
is now captured.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:30.689
The desorption then with the heat and vacuum
gives you back your original amine.

00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:36.769
So if you pack this in a bed, and what we
used was an expanded metal foam heat exchanger

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:44.749
that you could fill all the holes with the
solid amine and put the passages adjacent

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:50.120
to each other so that you could use the heat
of absorption to do your desorption on your

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.279
other side.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.060
And all you would need to do is expose it
to vacuum.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.010
It was a very simple system.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.660
It worked fine for the three or four missions.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.190
I'm not sure how many missions it was used.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.190
But it was an adjunct.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.839
It was added in, put onto the floor, and then
it was taken back out when it was no longer

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:08.899
needed because it was just wasted load.

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:09.899
Yes.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:16.600
For the lithium hydroxide, the product LiCO3,
is that a solid form or a gas form?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.850
No, it's a solid lithium carbonate.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.529
And that goes in the canisters that you remove?

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.529
Right.

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:23.600
When you remove the canister it's a big lump.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:31.370
OK.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:37.139
Finishing up the CO2 and trace removal, we
go to the trace removal and use the simple

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.251
system of activated charcoal.

00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:43.640
And, in fact, it is packed into the same canister
that the lithium hydroxide is packed into.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.899
It is a single use.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:54.480
There is a configuration, I believe, now operationally
where the entire canister is activated charcoal

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.319
so it can be used for cabin gas cleanup.

00:15:56.319 --> 00:16:01.629
So, if you had an issue that you needed to
clean the cabin up, you could do that with

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:06.429
a canister just of charcoal.

00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:12.509
The next area is the environmental cooling
and humidity control.

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:16.049
I mentioned on the schematic that we have
a cabin heat exchanger.

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:21.769
The front part of the heat exchanger basically
is your reduced cabin gas temperature.

00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:25.439
The backend of the heat exchanger is where
the condensing occurs because we get the gas

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:29.689
below the dew point and, therefore, the water
drops out.

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:35.499
The heat exchanger has the characteristic
that, as the water collects at the outlet

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:44.779
of the heat exchanger, there were some holes
drilled, actually, in the thin passages so

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:45.939
the water can be sucked out.

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:50.489
And it has the nickname "slurper." So it slurps
the water out.

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.209
It takes about 2% of the flow.

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:58.669
So, as the cabin fan produces the flow through
the heat exchanger, about 2% is siphoned off

00:16:58.669 --> 00:16:59.669
in the slurper.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:10.589
And that carries the water to the centripetal
water gas separator.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.140
This is a device that basically spins the
airstream.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.230
It's an airstream with water and trained.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.620
It spins the airstream.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.940
The water goes to the outside.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.750
It is collected in a trough and there is a
pitot tube in the trough that the water impinges

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.071
on, and we get about a 40 PSI delta head with
that.

00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:33.650
It's just a pump basically, a pitot pump.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:40.150
The atmospheric circulation and ventilation
is the next part of the system.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.190
As you know, we're still in atmospheric revitalization.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.780
There are the redundant fans that I mentioned.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.660
Each fan will do the job.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:55.790
There is also flight deck and mid deck duct
system.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.830
It looks very complicated but there are only
several points I want to make here.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.390
This is the atmospheric revitalization system
I mentioned before.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.000
As you see, it is below the floor.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.570
This is the mid deck here.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.860
This is the flight deck.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.140
So it's below the floor of the mid deck.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.651
The gas exits the heat exchanger.

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.520
It goes up.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.710
There is some aft mid deck ventilation exhaust.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:29.420
It goes on up to the flight deck and exhausts
on the flight deck.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:38.040
Also there is a section that goes on the forward
side of the cabin through the forward control

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.050
console and blows in the face of the crew.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:53.930
The return is back through some avionic areas
to provide cooling, and then back down to

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.690
the system.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:01.270
This is a complicated picture, but really
it is a very simple flow system.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:07.200
This becomes important later in our discussion
because good mixing turned out to be a really

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.200
important parameter.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.800
Not just cooling.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800
OK.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800
The second.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800
Remember we had six?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
This is the second element.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.850
This is the atmospheric pressure and composition
control.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.470
The first job is the 14.7.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:32.270
The Shuttle selected sea level, the idea being
we could not have a lot of special designed

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.000
equipment.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.030
Shuttle was intended to be a less expensive
spacecraft than the previous ones.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:44.010
And so a sea level atmosphere gave us no questions
about human survival and gave us a lot of

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:50.270
opportunity for using more standard equipment
and not specially designed equipment.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:56.890
There was a requirement, though, for a PSIA
total control, but this was only for an emergency

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.890
de-orbit.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.610
The problem statement is that you got a hole
in your cabin.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.080
Don't know how you got it but you have it.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.850
And the idea is the system has to be able
to sustain the crew for a de-orbit.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.930
And I don't know who made up the number but
169 minutes is the number.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.490
We have an emergency return, 169 minutes.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:24.660
The system has to be able to accommodate that
keeping the total pressure at or above 8 PSI.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.771
So there has to be enough flow capability,
enough consumables to do that.

00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:32.181
The half-inch hole was a programmatic decision.

00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:39.990
I cannot speak for where the number exactly
came from, but it probably had to do with

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.600
meteoroid debris kind of analysis that said
what type of hole you could expect.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.760
Anyway, that was the design for the system.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.700
The next aspect or element of the system is
the O2/N2 partial pressure control.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.200
At the total pressure of 14.7, we wanted sea
level which is about 3.2 PSI oxygen.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.280
At the 8 PSI, we wanted it to be survivable
but the oxygen could be less.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.190
Obviously, people live in Denver so that works.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.130
There are also crew breathing masks which
can be used in conjunction with low oxygen

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.910
partial pressure.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.110
The cabin had to have both positive and negative
relief.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.880
It had to store the oxygen and nitrogen, and
it had to provide pressurization for the water

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.880
management system.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.330
Remember earlier I talked about the more pervasive
requirements?

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.750
The water and waste management system now
is placing requirements on the atmospheric

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.140
pressure and composition control.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:51.130
This is a silhouette again where basically
here you see the oxygen tank, which is 3300

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.130
PSI oxygen tank.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.150
There are nitrogen tanks on both sides.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.500
These are high pressure tanks all 3300 PSI.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.470
The relief valves are shown here.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.810
And there is an O2/N2 supply panel which has
all of the valves and regulators and everything

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.350
on it.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:19.650
This system, however, though, gets most of
its oxygen from the cryogenic tanks.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.750
So that is only just shown as an inlet.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.831
These tanks are basically part of the power
control system.

00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:30.270
Electrical power is hydrogen and oxygen fuel
cell.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.210
We use a lot less oxygen than they do so the
storage was integrated.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.720
And then we use the oxygen for most of the
uses.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.080
It comes from the main tanks.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080
This is a schematic.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.520
I will start right there.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.680
This is the cryogenic system.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.380
This is the main cryogenic system.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:58.050
This is not part of the tankage of the pressure
and composition control system.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.050
It goes through a restrictor.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:05.840
This is stored in a super critical state so
the delivery is somewhat limited.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.840
And so this goes through a restrictor so that
we don't decrease the pressure too fast in

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
the cryogenic tank.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:17.190
It comes on down through a regulator that
regulates down to 100 PSI.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.800
And that comes on down to two regulators.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.210
One is the normal regulator, the 14.7, and
the other is the 8 PSI regulator, both of

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:31.480
which are available depending on which cabin
mode you're in.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.220
If you go over this way you will see the nitrogen.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.840
The nitrogen goes through its own regulator,
and it is regulated at 200 PSI.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.460
And that's important because that is contrasted
to the 100 here.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:49.540
Next the nitrogen goes through an on/off valve,
a solenoid that is connected to partial pressure

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.060
sensors of oxygen.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:58.690
And, if you're making up cabin gas, you have
to make a choice as to whether you want nitrogen

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.890
or oxygen.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.500
And that choice is made by this system and
a simple on/off valve.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.540
There is no sophisticated control system.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.490
This is a simple on/off valve.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:14.440
If the cabin needs pressure but doesn't need
oxygen then this valve is open and the 200

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.991
PSI basically backs down the oxygen system.

00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:21.950
There is a check valve here, no oxygen flow
because you get nitrogen.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:27.680
At the point that you need oxygen, this valve
closes, then there is no 200 PSI anymore.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.830
Therefore, the 100 PSI provides oxygen to
the regulators.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.500
It is a very simple design.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.730
Off the top of your head, what kind of failures
did you have during qual test that really

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.730
bothered you?

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:50.210
The regulators were produced by Carlton, and
the regulators were derivatives of regulators

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.250
they had been building for years.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.500
So the regulator functions really were pretty
good.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:01.230
But the early problem we had was the pressure
tolerance wandered and didn't have as good

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.230
a pressure tolerance.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.450
And they did make some mods to correct that.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.980
But the more significant issues got into flow
issues.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.820
Their test capability was pretty limited.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:17.330
And when you're talking about very high flow
cases you have to do something with the gas

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:21.420
to make the regulator think that it is in
an operational environment.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:27.130
And so we did a lot of testing, and I will
show you that in just a second, for the high

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.130
flow cases.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.600
Let's see.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600
There is a redundant system.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.360
It is not shown in this schematic but there
are two of these, just like this.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.611
This is the pressurization for the water and
waste management system you see here.

00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:48.441
I would say there is a crossover to the redundant
system so that you can do mix and match.

00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:54.700
If you have a problem in both systems, you
can mix and match the capabilities.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.600
Also, the oxygen system provides the emergency
breathing system.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.380
It also provides oxygen to the air lock for
recharge of the backpack.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.380
We will talk about that later.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.010
And I believe that's it.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.320
So, for normal pressure, we have 14.7.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:17.750
And you have the automatic pressure regulator,
basically on/off valve and the regulator.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:25.450
The partial pressure is controlled by the
3.2 PSI which is the solenoid that controls

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.450
that.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.080
It is a very simple system.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:36.380
The oxygen partial pressure does have another
set point at the PSIA goes down to 2.45 PSI.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.510
And I will show you that in a minute.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:44.270
For cabin pressure relief, the problem statement
really is why do you need relief?

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.600
Well, what if one of those lines breaks?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.770
You've got 3300 PSI tankage.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.480
It is all plumed together.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.900
The crew, God forbid, step on a line and break
it, and now you've got all this nitrogen rushing

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.900
in.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.600
You don't want the cabin to explode, right?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.520
So you need a relief valve.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.630
And the relief valve was set at 16.2.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:11.810
And, again, that is one of the high flow cases
that we ended up testing.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.070
The system was designed with three relief
valves.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.341
Any tool will do the job.

00:27:15.341 --> 00:27:17.930
That is just a redundancy philosophy.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:23.220
Sometimes you will see two items where either
one does the job.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.300
In this case, this is a very critical issue
so there is a double redundancy here.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:34.971
For the negative pressure protection, there
is an 8 PSI delta relief valve.

00:27:34.971 --> 00:27:36.710
In fact, there are three of those.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.380
You don't need the two to operate, but there
are three.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.600
This is for the return that I just showed
you.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.620
If you come back with a hole in the cabin,
the cabin is at 8 PSI, you cannot reverse

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.620
flow through that hole.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.890
That is not going to work.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.500
You don't want the cabin imploding on the
crew so you've got to make up, as you come

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.740
in the lower altitude, obviously the higher
pressure, you've got to get that gas back

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.740
in the cabin.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.310
So that's what that is for.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.310
OK.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:14.300
This is the other pressure vessel that was
used as a test site.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.400
This was called the Environmental Test Article.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.490
Rockwell gave it that name.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:27.130
What they planned to do with this device,
when they built it, was to do all the wiring

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.840
runs and the plumbing runs in there.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.220
It was going to be a mockup.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.490
It turned out they built a rather beefy tank.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.470
In fact, maybe they got one very inexpensively.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.400
I'm not sure how they ended up with it, but
they got it.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.340
They did do all the secondary structure, so
it had the right shape inside.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.740
And so it turned out they didn't end up using
it.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.360
They went onto other methods.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.150
And so it ended up leftover in the program.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.770
We convinced Aaron that he ought to give it
to us, and he did.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.240
This is what it looks like in cutaway.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.330
You see here all the secondary structure,
it was in boxes but we put it all in.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.590
Foamed it in so that the volume was right,
so the cabin volume was essentially perfect.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.381
It had the flight deck.

00:29:14.381 --> 00:29:15.381
It had the mid deck.

00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:17.671
It had the lower deck for the environmental
control system.

00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:21.430
But we also asked Aaron to give us the cert
hardware, which he did.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.340
So we had the cert hardware underneath the
floor.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.190
And the pressure control system we're talking
about, actually, is on this back wall.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.690
That is a picture of it.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.270
What we did is faithfully run the lines.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.710
In fact, we even use the same line material,
same fittings, same everything.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:47.180
So we faithfully duplicated inside this test
article the volume and the geometry and the

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.290
system.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.720
All the ventilation ducts you saw, all those
were in place.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:59.900
We will come back to it later, but you'll
notice on the back wall of this test facility

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.200
there is an airlock hatch.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.720
And later on I will tell you where that goes.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:14.150
But this is the control panel and the nitrogen/oxygen
system.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.210
This is test data.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.110
We did some testing to see how the system
worked.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.211
This was testing of basically the on/off oxygen
control system.

00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:27.100
Let me see if I can walk through this simply.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.340
We're working total pressure here, oxygen
partial pressure here.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:36.280
During this first interval the oxygen is on.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.470
What we're doing here is we're breathing it
down.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:45.910
And, when we hit the lower limit so that the
regulator wants to do something, then the

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.350
oxygen partial pressure starts up because
the regulator comes on.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.350
Now, the total pressure is maintained because
that is what the regulator is supposed to

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.630
do, maintain total pressure.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.370
But as it maintains the total pressure it
is doing it with oxygen and, therefore, the

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.070
partial pressure is going up.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:07.309
When it is satisfied, that is enough partial
pressure of oxygen, then the solenoid valve

00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:09.530
opens and you see the nitrogen come on.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.650
Now, you remember the nitrogen feed was at
300 PSI versus 200 PSI.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.460
So there is a little jump.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.650
That is just a mechanical artifact of the
regulator.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:23.570
If you change the inlet pressure it regulates
slightly differently because it is a balance

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.059
system.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:27.070
You see a little jump there.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:32.140
And then, during this period, the pressure
is maintained.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.790
But we're breathing off the oxygen because
we've got the oxygen fenced off now.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:40.860
And then when the pressure is satisfied and
the solenoid goes back the other way then

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.090
we again start the oxygen again.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.450
So the system worked quite well.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:49.330
If you notice the tolerance band spec-wise
was pretty wide, the system operated on a

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.010
very narrow brand so we were very pleased
with that.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.120
Normally that is important.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.659
Not only because it shows you that you do
have a good sensitive system, but you cannot

00:31:59.659 --> 00:32:04.309
-- Mechanical hardware, electrical hardware,
either one never operates down the middle

00:32:04.309 --> 00:32:05.309
always.

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:06.610
There is drift.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:12.860
You need a little tolerance in your band here
to have a decent system design.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.860
Yes.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.950
Does this change a lot when you have the crew
performing high metabolic activity?

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.650
The cabin is so large that it really doesn't
know.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:26.450
The cycles would be different, obviously,
because you consume more oxygen, you would

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.450
need more oxygen.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.370
So the on/off cycle would favor longer oxygen
cycles.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:37.150
But, in the big picture, there is really not
a lot of change.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.640
What was this time period?

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.510
It looks like this was about three hours maybe.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.730
That might go to two hours for a cycle.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.860
I mean not really very much.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.860
Sorry.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:55.000
Does microgravity have much effect on circulation?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.050
There is no circulation in microgravity.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.890
It just lays there.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:10.910
You push it or it doesn't go.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.690
Diffusion is a driving force, so if you're
really, really patient, even at zero G you

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.530
can wait, but you cannot stay alive that way.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:29.080
But, yes, you do have to have ventilation.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.990
Still in the atmospheric pressure and composition
control.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.880
This is the emergency breathing equipment.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.710
We used plug-in face masks.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:44.570
There are some uses for the mask that require
a carry on bottle to give portability, but

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.429
the vehicle does have plug-in capability.

00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:49.059
The masks were purge-type masks.

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:54.780
You're probably not familiar much with masks,
but there is a mask called a rebreather which

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.120
basically your lung power does all the work
and you only purge enough to keep the CO2

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.920
down and you keep rebreathing.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:07.090
And then the purge-type is every breath is
a fresh breath, and you then exhale and the

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.740
gas goes out in the cabin.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.109
And that's the type that this is because the
cabin needs the oxygen.

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:13.280
I mean it's not going anywhere bad.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.389
It is OK that it's not completely spent.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:16.530
It's good.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:22.269
That's like a scuba mask, right?

00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:23.879
I don't scuba.

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:24.879
Sorry.

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:28.139
But I think the answer is yes.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.738
With scuba, you take in the air and then you
blow it all out.

00:34:30.738 --> 00:34:37.579
I mean there are scuba rebreathing systems,
but the typical scuba gear is not.

00:34:37.579 --> 00:34:42.339
Rather than raising your hand, if you make
a noise of some kind.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:43.339
Sorry.

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:46.869
I don't mean to ignore you.

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:52.540
The mask can be used in a contaminated environment
and the mask can be used if the concentration

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:58.999
of O2 is low to give you a better oxygen level.

00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:03.160
This is the PSIA test that we did.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160
Actually, a series of tests.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.549
But this is data from one.

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:08.881
As you see, we started up in the 14.7 range.

00:35:08.881 --> 00:35:10.239
We simulated the hole.

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:13.150
The pressure immediately starts down.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:22.849
The partial pressure of oxygen we let degrade
to about the 2.2 range.

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:24.779
This is a different set point.

00:35:24.779 --> 00:35:27.130
Remember I told you on the oxygen sensors
we have two set points?

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.539
This is the second set point.

00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:32.039
And so we have the lower oxygen partial pressure.

00:35:32.039 --> 00:35:33.339
The system came down.

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:40.589
The PSIA regulator, which is always online,
captured the pressure decay, caught it, and

00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:45.099
the solenoid valve popped back and forth to
keep the oxygen OK because we're losing now.

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:47.019
We're going out this half-inch hole.

00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.789
And the system worked just fine.

00:35:48.789 --> 00:35:53.900
This did have the crew on the masks because
that is livable, you can live there, but the

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.900
mask is a better environment.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:01.559
This is a mask case.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.809
This was a requirement that came on later.

00:36:03.809 --> 00:36:05.060
The design is the design now.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:13.470
The vehicle exists so we have to now operate
the vehicle with accommodations for operationally

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.489
what we want to do with it.

00:36:15.489 --> 00:36:20.630
And a new requirement developed and was imposed
on the vehicle.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:25.059
And that requirement had to do with the space
suit for the EVA operation.

00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:28.880
The Shuttle spacesuits are basically 100%
O2.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.900
And the classical way of going EVA from a
sea level environment was a four hour prebreathe.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:44.569
Actually, as much as six hours depending on
how conservative the medics were at the time,

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:50.230
that number varied around some, to prevent
bends.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:56.210
But it was determined that if you accommodized
at 9 PSI for about 12 hours then you only

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.249
required a really short prebreathe.

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:04.809
And the suit-up time, which gave you 30 to
40 minutes, actually gave you sort of a free

00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:09.200
tune-up to your prebreathe as part of your
suit-up operation.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.950
And so that was viewed as a much better way
to do EVAs than the previous way.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.720
The masks are useful but are not very comfortable.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.660
So, if you have to keep them on for a long
period of time, they're not very comfortable

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.059
at all.

00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:29.589
Also the medics were very concerned about
mask leakage, that if there was any nitrogen

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:33.249
inflow that that could break the prebreathe.

00:37:33.249 --> 00:37:35.190
But our system isn't designed for 9.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:41.529
We have a 14.7 and an eight, but we don't
have a 9, so we needed a manual procedure.

00:37:41.529 --> 00:37:45.259
But before that could be accepted there were
some issues that had to be evaluated.

00:37:45.259 --> 00:37:50.099
And we had to do testing on each of these
issues.

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:52.829
The first is the flow rate acceptability at
9 PSI.

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:57.650
Obviously, the less dense gas you're not going
to get the same mask flow rate.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:01.910
And we had to make sure that that ventilation
was going to be adequate.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:06.279
And testing proved that it was.

00:38:06.279 --> 00:38:07.690
The next is a thermal acceptability.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.440
There are really two aspects to this.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.119
One is the fan itself is cooled by the environment,
so if the environment doesn't provide as much

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:17.430
cooling to fan itself it could overheat.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:25.040
Also, the electronic equipment, some of which
is air cooled, the less dense gas could be

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.309
a problem there.

00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:28.809
It turned out that could be controlled with
load control.

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:33.559
That could off load power and make that acceptable.

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:38.549
The CO2 performance at 9 PSI, we needed to
make sure that was OK.

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:42.440
It turned out that, of course, the 9 PSI case,
we don't care about the lithium hydroxide.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.190
The purge flow is so great there is no CO2
problem.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:50.150
But at 9 PSI for 12 hours you have to get
performance out of the lithium hydroxide.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.059
So we checked that and that worked out fine.

00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:55.569
And the last item was the ventilation adequacy.

00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:57.170
We do have a press and depress.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.070
You've got to come down to 9 and you've got
to go back.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.799
And both of those adjust the gas mixture.

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:05.619
And so we wanted to prove that that was OK.

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:10.829
And so we went to the facility that we were
talking about and ran this profile.

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:17.299
Now, this profile was created by our-- yes?

00:39:17.299 --> 00:39:25.769
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:27.119
Well, that's what I just said.

00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:28.119
Yes, it does.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:33.069
The air-cooled equipment is going to run hot.

00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:39.310
If you want to cool that equipment, it will
become a little clearer later, but the equipment

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.200
is in equipment bays.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.299
And so, with the less dense gas, you need
to have some of that equipment turned off

00:39:46.299 --> 00:39:49.249
so that the cooling that is available is adequate.

00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:52.541
So you do load control, get rid of some of
the electronics.

00:39:52.541 --> 00:40:01.839
And, therefore, the air that's left, the atmosphere
that is left can cool the equipment.

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:02.839
And then when do you increase the pressure
back to normal after the EVA?

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:03.839
After the 12 hours.

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:07.770
No, actually it's before the EVA.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.039
Well, I'm not sure what they do now.

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:14.040
When you're all finished with your EVAs then
you bring the cabin back.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.680
Because, typically, you do multiple EVAs.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.130
And so, from one day to the next, you just
keep the cabin at, actually, we use 10.2 now

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:28.819
rather than 9, but I think you have to certify
it for 9, right?

00:40:28.819 --> 00:40:31.180
This was an early certification for 9.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.180
Yes.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:38.700
But wouldn't it have been easier to simply
design the whole system for 9 from the beginning

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.279
if you had [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?

00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:44.710
Well, this was not a Shuttle requirement.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:50.440
This was an operational requirement that occurred
after the Shuttle specifications were set.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.160
You're correct.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.410
If we knew it ahead of time it would have
been much easier to do it all for 9 PSIs,

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.079
exactly.

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:01.369
It would have just been a third condition.

00:41:01.369 --> 00:41:04.470
But, as Jeff pointed out, we changed our mind.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:09.989
The first was 9 and now we're at 10.2, so
we're not consistent.

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:12.069
As we learn, we change our mind.

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:17.229
And the 10.2 was selected later.

00:41:17.229 --> 00:41:22.829
Our mission operations people that do the
crew time lining and all, they created this

00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:23.829
procedure.

00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:24.829
And so we tested it.

00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:26.339
This has a simple depress cycle.

00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:27.640
You come from 14.7.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.220
You hesitate at about 11 and replenish the
oxygen.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.029
You do that twice.

00:41:34.029 --> 00:41:39.559
You then do manual control down at the 9 psi
level.

00:41:39.559 --> 00:41:49.750
You notice the oxygen partial pressure here
is always maintained by these adjustments,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.269
and also during the manual period you select
what you want.

00:41:53.269 --> 00:41:58.430
And then when you come back, the procedure
was to increase the nitrogen and then finish

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.190
the top off with oxygen.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:07.190
That was thought to be completely acceptable
because the oxygen level, at this point, is

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.190
completely viable.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:14.240
And so doing the nitrogen first and topping
it off with oxygen was thought to be an acceptable

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.319
way to operate.

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:22.690
So we did the test and this is what happened.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.329
We were all nice and comfortable with our
oxygen partial pressure.

00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:32.170
And you see the area next to where we were
repressing.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:35.729
We depleted the oxygen substantially.

00:42:35.729 --> 00:42:40.559
And the mid deck and even the flight deck,
we depleted the oxygen.

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:43.150
And I've only shown you half the data.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:47.720
If you look at the rest of the data, you see
where the oxygen went.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.479
These equipment bays that I mentioned earlier,
the avionics bays and other equipment bays

00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:58.089
are basically isolated volumes from the cabin.

00:42:58.089 --> 00:43:04.029
So, as the pressure comes up, what you're
doing is you're pressurizing these areas with

00:43:04.029 --> 00:43:11.369
cabin gas, which is oxygen and nitrogen, you're
pressurizing these areas with nitrogen only.

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:14.700
Basically, you are depleting the partial pressure
here.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.999
You're increasing the partial pressure here.

00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:17.999
You remember partial pressure.

00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:19.009
You just count the molecules.

00:43:19.009 --> 00:43:21.019
That's all you have to do.

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:27.059
Basically, we're putting more oxygen molecules
here and we're taking them out of these areas.

00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:30.970
And, therefore, they are going down.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.109
This is just a picture of one of the bays.

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:35.269
You see all the empty space around the equipment.

00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:38.690
That is where the gas is.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:43.440
We came up with an alternate procedure which
is to simultaneously put the oxygen and nitrogen

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.039
in together.

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:49.050
And, of course, there is the 9 back to 14.7.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.590
And you notice that solved the problem.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:56.999
There is still some dip at the supply area
because the mixture is lean.

00:43:56.999 --> 00:44:02.970
We need from 9 to 14.7, 5.7 PSI total pressure
increase.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:08.279
But we only need 2.5 up to 3.2 oxygen.

00:44:08.279 --> 00:44:11.589
This is a mixture, but it's a lean mixture.

00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:18.030
So there is still some slight loss, but the
only area that came under an issue is near

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.630
the inlet where the O2/N2 supply panel is.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.640
And, of course, you can just avoid that area.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.599
Well, I should say that that area happens
to be right around the bathroom.

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:34.500
And so, before we repressurized the Shuttle,
the commander would say anybody who has to

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:41.369
use the bathroom use it now because for about
ten, fifteen minutes, while we're depressurizing,

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:44.640
it's off limits.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.640
OK.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.789
Next item.

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:52.509
This is the water and waste management area.

00:44:52.509 --> 00:44:55.740
This is one of the six items.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.119
We have potable and waste water inventory
management.

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:03.170
We're continually producing potable water,
as you know, and waste water.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.400
We have to dump them, we have to use them,
so that is part of the requirement of this

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400
system.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:16.119
We have to store water for drinking, food
prep and waste water storage.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:19.200
It has to be dumped to space.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.650
Commode and urinal for human waste collection.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:26.650
And we provide water for an evaporative heat
sink, which we will talk about later, called

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.210
the flash evaporator.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.210
Yes.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.479
This is an outstanding example of systems
engineers, this total system that Walt is

00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:33.479
talking about.

00:45:33.479 --> 00:45:39.280
We can really see the interaction between
all the systems and the spacecraft.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.112
This really is a systems engineering problem.

00:45:44.112 --> 00:45:50.009
Potable water, we take all the fuel cell byproduct
water and use it.

00:45:50.009 --> 00:45:53.029
So it is basically in a fluent to the power
system.

00:45:53.029 --> 00:46:00.140
We do have a launch storage capability for
water and we do provide sterilization.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.269
The sterilization is iodine.

00:46:02.269 --> 00:46:08.670
We started out designing a silver ion system.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:15.130
It turned out that we had manufacturing problems
and the company ended up going out of business,

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.450
so we reverted to iodine.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.029
The Lunar Module used iodine.

00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:25.549
Waste water, the condensate from the cabin
humidity control and urine and the urine pretreat.

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:32.349
Urine has to be pretreated to bind the urea.

00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:33.619
If you don't, you get a lot of ammonia.

00:46:33.619 --> 00:46:37.150
It uses a chemical called Oxzone.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.999
It's an acid.

00:46:39.999 --> 00:46:44.829
I'm not really sure what it is.

00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:46.729
This is where the system is located.

00:46:46.729 --> 00:46:50.680
This is one of the simpler schematics.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.519
The water tanks are here.

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.021
The water comes from the fuel cell.

00:46:55.021 --> 00:47:08.880
As I said, by the way, the delivery is about
150 degrees and 60 psi.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.869
So there is a lot of hydrogen dissolved in
the water.

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:16.989
The water is collected in the fuel cells on
the hydrogen side, so there is a lot of hydrogen.

00:47:16.989 --> 00:47:19.839
There is a hydrogen separator here.

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:22.890
Otherwise, your tanks would end up full of
hydrogen which is what you don't want.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.460
You will get water in the tanks.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.220
The hydrogen separator is a silver palladium
metal.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.839
It is catalyzed.

00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:34.200
It is basically porous to hydrogen but not
to water.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.410
If you expose the backside to the vacuum it
pulls the hydrogen off and the water goes

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:39.410
through just fine.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:48.859
I will say that there still is a rather high
gas content in the water that you drink.

00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:53.720
And that gas, of course, evolves once it gets
inside your stomach with predictable results.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.049 --> 00:47:56.049
Yes.

00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:59.920
In fact, all sorts of systems that Jeff could
explain.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.700
They have slinger systems and all sorts of
systems to get separation because it is not

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:10.489
really possible to get all the gas out of
the water.

00:48:10.489 --> 00:48:11.829
OK.

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:13.240
There is a dump system.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.569
There is a potable waste dump to vacuum.

00:48:16.569 --> 00:48:22.119
There is also a vacuum vent, which I will
show you what that is all about.

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:25.710
And then the flash evaporator that I mentioned,
and I will mention more later, is in the back

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:32.079
of the vehicle and it has a redundant water
feed system both sides.

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:33.319
This is a schematic.

00:48:33.319 --> 00:48:34.700
Start at the same place.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.529
Water from the fuel cells goes through the
hydrogen separator and then into this bank

00:48:39.529 --> 00:48:40.910
of tanks.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:41.989
The tanks are pressurized.

00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:45.119
They are yellow bellows tanks.

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:47.190
On the back side of the bellows is nitrogen.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:52.219
On the forward side, of course, is the potable
water.

00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:56.440
There is a hydrophobic filter on the downside
of each tank.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:02.029
If a bellows were to leak, you don't want
water into your nitrogen system.

00:49:02.029 --> 00:49:05.109
So this is a filter to prevent that.

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:07.869
I mentioned the twin flash evaporator feeds.

00:49:07.869 --> 00:49:09.229
There they are.

00:49:09.229 --> 00:49:11.960
This is the dump nozzle here.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.839
The potable water system provides water to
the crew so there is a regular water interface

00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:18.339
and a chilled water interface here.

00:49:18.339 --> 00:49:21.450
I believe that is it.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:32.539
I remember there were more problems with Apollo
than there were with Shuttle.

00:49:32.539 --> 00:49:35.630
49:30 I don't have those sorted mentally.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:36.630
I'm sorry.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:37.630
I don't remember.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.819
I'm not sure.

00:49:40.819 --> 00:49:48.190
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.190
Maybe that was on Apollo.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:55.420
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:00.380
Basically that means you put your water into
a plastic bag.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:04.749
And now you can actually swing it around like
so.

00:50:04.749 --> 00:50:09.339
And so the water will go to the outside and
the gas is in the inside.

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:18.549
So that actually separates them and you can
squeeze the gas out through a valve.

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:24.269
On-orbit trash storage, there is an overboard
bleed for odor control.

00:50:24.269 --> 00:50:26.950
It's a very small overboard bleed to vacuum.

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:34.700
And the human solid waste collection and storage
is also vacuum dried and stabilized.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.979
This is a waste management picture.

00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:38.980
The subject we were just talking about is
the vacuum vent.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:44.180
That vacuum vent does vent the commode area
where the feces are.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.069
That vent also provides a vent for the water
separator.

00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:53.749
It also provides a vent for airlock depress
for EVA.

00:50:53.749 --> 00:50:56.039
So this is the vacuum system.

00:50:56.039 --> 00:51:01.049
The urine is collected and trained in a liquid.

00:51:01.049 --> 00:51:05.569
Well, let me say that different.

00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:12.700
The urine, after it has been separated from
the gas stream, is stored in a waste tank,

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:21.259
as is the humidity from the cabin atmospheric
revitalization system.

00:51:21.259 --> 00:51:30.559
And then that is pressurized from the pressured
composition control system and is dumped overboard.

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:31.960
This waster is not used for anything.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.890
It is basically dumped just to do inventory
management.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:44.180
The next picture explains a little better
about the commode and the urinals themselves.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:50.319
The urinal originally had a unisex interface
cup.

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:58.499
It turned out that didn't work very well,
and so later flights there was a custom male/female.

00:51:58.499 --> 00:52:05.519
And later there were even some more customizing
for the crew, I believe, but I don't have

00:52:05.519 --> 00:52:06.940
the details on that.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:14.289
The urinal itself, obviously for urination,
there needs to be some way to make the urine

00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:15.729
go where you want it to go.

00:52:15.729 --> 00:52:19.769
And those were done in fan separators.

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:23.559
So there is gas pulled in the cup.

00:52:23.559 --> 00:52:29.400
And in training the urine, the urine then
comes down and goes through the separators.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.799
This is also a centrifugal-type separator.

00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:35.190
And then that is sent to the head that is
created here.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:43.789
Then puts that waste water urine in the waste
system.

00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:52.819
The EMU spacesuit, it also has a condensate
drain after each EVA, and it also goes through

00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:55.670
this same system and into the waste tank.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.259
The commode.

00:52:57.259 --> 00:53:00.910
Basically there is a seat.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:06.269
The seat has a small opening.

00:53:06.269 --> 00:53:13.680
The commode itself is basically a cylinder
or a tub.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.229
And there is a slinger in the bottom.

00:53:15.229 --> 00:53:19.710
So the slinger basically distributes the paper
and the fecal matter on the outside wall in

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.269
a thin layer.

00:53:21.269 --> 00:53:30.980
The vacuum then can dry that so that it deactivates
it so it does not end up either any odor or

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:35.779
creating any kind of bacteriological issues.

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:41.400
But the entrainment of the fecal material
so that it, in fact, hits the slinger, is

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.401
done with an air flow.

00:53:42.401 --> 00:53:46.259
The air flow comes in around the seat itself.

00:53:46.259 --> 00:53:49.430
That requires good contact with the seat.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.059
It also requires positioning.

00:53:52.059 --> 00:54:01.549
Positioning turned out to be an early issue,
or reliable positioning, and so a trainer

00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:07.769
was put together that had a camera here.

00:54:07.769 --> 00:54:17.460
And the trainer, I might add, was discretely
located in a non-observable place so that

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:23.059
it could be used in privacy, the comings and
goings, and also the use of the facility itself.

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:29.079
And they told us it was not hooked up to a
tape recorder.

00:54:29.079 --> 00:54:30.079
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:33.519
Just to elaborate on that.

00:54:33.519 --> 00:54:37.789
Basically, the problem is it really is a rather
small opening.

00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:42.779
And it just doesn't feel natural to know where
to put yourself down.

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:47.069
And it actually did lead to significant messes
on orbit.

00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:48.119
I won't go into any more detail.

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:55.469
But the idea is that you would position yourself
the way you thought it should be, and then

00:54:55.469 --> 00:54:57.891
you would turn on the lights.

00:54:57.891 --> 00:54:58.891
And there is a TV screen in front of you.

00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:01.880
I'm not making this up.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.519
So that you could see how close you are to
the bull's-eye.

00:55:08.519 --> 00:55:13.869
Enough said.

00:55:13.869 --> 00:55:16.770
The cabin thermal control is another one of
the subsystem elements.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.749
It is a circulating liquid cooling system.

00:55:20.749 --> 00:55:23.650
It provides the heat sink for the atmosphere
itself.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:29.359
It also provides the ability to reject that
heat to the spacecraft cooling system because

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.519
you've got to get rid of it out of the cabin.

00:55:31.519 --> 00:55:36.650
It has some avionics cold plates, some air
cool avionics, support the crew in the airlock

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:40.329
and a portable water chiller.

00:55:40.329 --> 00:55:43.259
This is the location.

00:55:43.259 --> 00:55:53.440
You will notice the avionics bays are listed
here with their little circulation systems.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.329
The liquid system then services each of those,
the chill or the condensing heat exchanger.

00:55:57.329 --> 00:56:02.160
And this is the place that the cabin system
connects to the spacecraft system, on the

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.160
aft bulkhead right here.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.299
We will see the other half of this system
in a little bit.

00:56:07.299 --> 00:56:12.059
This is a schematic that is very complicated
looking but it is fairly simple.

00:56:12.059 --> 00:56:14.819
Let me show you the air piece first.

00:56:14.819 --> 00:56:16.809
Look at the black lines.

00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:17.809
Those are twin fans.

00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:21.989
It goes through the air-cooled avionics through
the heat exchanger to get rid of the heat.

00:56:21.989 --> 00:56:27.190
There are some cold plated avionics in each
bay, so you take care of the cold plated and

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.930
the air-cooled in this bay and in this bay
and in this bay.

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:37.019
Now you've got all of the electronics taken
care of.

00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:39.670
I should have started this up at the pump.

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:40.670
Sorry about that.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.869
Here is the pump and we will come down.

00:56:42.869 --> 00:56:48.489
It also takes care of the forward and overhead
window mounts around the window for thermal

00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:49.489
control.

00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:54.959
And the hatch is just a way to keep those
thermally stabilized.

00:56:54.959 --> 00:56:58.890
Back in the early flights, we had something
called DFI, development flight instrumentation.

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:00.910
It was a special instrumentation package.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.249
It was also liquid cooled.

00:57:04.249 --> 00:57:07.410
And then this is the heat exchanger to the
spacecraft system.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.700
It is a Freon system.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.560
This is where the main heat is rejected right
here.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.599
On the other side of this you've got cool
liquid.

00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:17.640
It turns out this is water.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:23.529
We go through the liquid cooling garment which
is the spacesuit cooling garment, the water

00:57:23.529 --> 00:57:28.759
chiller, go through the cabin heat exchanger
to cool the cabin and condense the water out

00:57:28.759 --> 00:57:29.839
and then back to the pump.

00:57:29.839 --> 00:57:32.220
I failed to mention the IMU.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.299
It has triply redundant fans.

00:57:34.299 --> 00:57:36.359
It pulls air through it.

00:57:36.359 --> 00:57:40.450
And that is also cooled by this gas stream.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:46.759
Anyway, this is the cabin thermal control
system.

00:57:46.759 --> 00:57:54.459
These functions, I just said each one of them
so I won't repeat them.

00:57:54.459 --> 00:57:57.319
Cabins circulating liquid cooling loop.

00:57:57.319 --> 00:58:00.819
As I mentioned, water is the coolant.

00:58:00.819 --> 00:58:03.700
Water is actually a very good coolant.

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:09.229
And, if you have any requirements that push
you that way in your designing thermal control

00:58:09.229 --> 00:58:11.519
systems, you like water.

00:58:11.519 --> 00:58:14.239
Water is completely nontoxic so it can be
around the crew.

00:58:14.239 --> 00:58:16.999
Leaks don't make any difference.

00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:19.009
It has a very high CP.

00:58:19.009 --> 00:58:20.369
It's a really good fluid.

00:58:20.369 --> 00:58:22.369
The problem with water is freezing.

00:58:22.369 --> 00:58:25.520
You don't want to freeze it and you don't
want to get it so hot that it turns into steam.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.950
But if you can stay within the boundaries
it is a good fluid.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:29.359
And that is what this is.

00:58:29.359 --> 00:58:33.299
Redundant pumps, I showed you that on the
schematic.

00:58:33.299 --> 00:58:37.849
The liquid gas heat exchanger, I showed you
that before.

00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:42.690
Cold plates for electronic cooling and the
window hatch mount.

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:49.039
The circulating gases that I mentioned for
the avionics, the cabin gas was used as a

00:58:49.039 --> 00:58:50.039
coolant.

00:58:50.039 --> 00:58:54.009
You saw the redundant fans and the doubly
redundant fans.

00:58:54.009 --> 00:59:01.359
I mentioned earlier, and someone commented
on it, that the promise early on was the Shuttle

00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:10.410
could be a less expensive development activity
if we used off the shelf avionics, the kind

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.410
that aircraft use.

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.119
And that's a good promise.

00:59:14.119 --> 00:59:22.459
It turned out that that's not a very good,
not as good a solution for thermal control

00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:23.519
as liquid cooled.

00:59:23.519 --> 00:59:30.609
Liquid cooled is a much more efficient way
of providing a heat sink to electrical equipment.

00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:35.339
When you blow the cabin gas through it then
you end up with the problems of if you change

00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:38.019
the pressure in the cabin, which we talked
about.

00:59:38.019 --> 00:59:41.299
That can effect cooling.

00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:43.349
Also you have to put out a lot more power.

00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:48.799
You have to blow a lot more gas than you do
power to move the liquid around, so it's not

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:49.859
a very good thermal solution.

00:59:49.859 --> 00:59:55.500
And actually the promise of less expensive
avionics I don't think was actually fulfilled,

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:59.569
although that's somebody else's topic and
not mine, because I think everything was pretty

00:59:59.569 --> 01:00:00.700
well custom.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:09.180
It did potentially complicate the thermal
control system for a good goal.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:14.619
And how well that goal was met, somebody else
will have to speak for it.

01:00:14.619 --> 01:00:17.819
Another one of the subsystem elements of the
spacecraft.

01:00:17.819 --> 01:00:21.369
Well, we usually take a two minute break when
we're about halfway through.

01:00:21.369 --> 01:00:22.369
Certainly.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:42.849
Why don't we take our two minutes now and
then we will pick it right back up?

01:00:42.849 --> 01:00:54.259
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:58.609
From an engineering standpoint, it is much
better to cool with liquid.

01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:01.599
If you use cold plates, it is much more efficient.

01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:06.279
You get a good reliable heat sink.

01:01:06.279 --> 01:01:11.190
And you can then design your thermal conduction
paths so that out of the avionics box you

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.950
make sure the heat goes to the cold plate.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.950
And you use a lot less power.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:23.170
You can pump water a lot more efficiently
for the cooling capability than you pump gas.

01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:36.790
Is that what happens on the Shuttle now or
do you have a mixture?

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:43.960
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.440
This is the air-cooled part of the loop and
here are the cold plates.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:57.170
Let's get the class back.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:00.709
Thank you very much.

01:02:00.709 --> 01:02:07.160
I am sorry.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.619
Did you see what I was pointing at here?

01:02:09.619 --> 01:02:10.819
Yeah, you put both.

01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:12.729
Yeah, and this is one bay.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:17.930
And they have both cold plates and the air-cooled
here, here and here.

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:20.829
There they are.

01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:28.359
Of course, when you go outside the vehicle
there is no more air so all the external equipment

01:02:28.359 --> 01:02:30.450
is cold plated.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.450
Was there another question?

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:40.299
What kind of design changes would you have
to make in order to go strictly to completely

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:41.920
liquid cooled electronics?

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.549
Well, if you're trying to use off-the-shelf
and it is air-cooled already, there is a cabinet

01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:48.290
right there full of it.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:50.969
If it is air-cooled already then you have
to stay with that concept.

01:02:50.969 --> 01:02:55.190
If you're custom designing then, from the
very beginning, you say I'm custom designing

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:56.880
this to be liquid cooled.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.680
And then the internal design is such that
there are conduction pads to the base plate

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:07.000
so that it can be cooled.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
OK.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I guess previously to that all of our spacecraft
were liquid cooled.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Apollo was, wasn't it?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yes.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.170
Because you had to be able to take those spacecraft
down the back?

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:18.770
Right.

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:25.180
We evacuated the cabin both in the Command
Module and the Lunar Module.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:31.089
And Gemini, too.

01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:35.549
This is the spacecraft active thermal control
system.

01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:36.989
This is the vehicle level.

01:03:36.989 --> 01:03:45.589
So now, even though we're still under this
ETCLSS, we are not talking the classical environmental

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:46.910
control anymore.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.029
This is a bigger picture.

01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:56.329
Also the reason the word active is stuck in
here was a left over from previous programs,

01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:57.819
too.

01:03:57.819 --> 01:04:02.819
For example, on Apollo we had several heat
rejection systems.

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:04.239
Not a single one.

01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:08.130
And we also did a lot of passive thermal control
on Apollo.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:12.380
We had a mission mode called "barbeque" which
is basically you roll the vehicle very slowly

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.739
so you normalize the environment.

01:04:15.739 --> 01:04:19.650
If you leave the same side toward the sun
all the way to the moon that side gets really

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:22.069
hot.

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:27.039
This is the active system to get away from
heaters and/or vehicle level control.

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:30.749
There is an on-orbit.

01:04:30.749 --> 01:04:32.509
We have a radiative heat sink.

01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:35.489
We also have an evaporative heat sink on orbit.

01:04:35.489 --> 01:04:39.839
During ascent and entry we have two heat sinks,
both of which are evaporative.

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:42.949
We have a circulating liquid system.

01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:47.910
We take heat from the cabin, from the fuel
cells, hydraulics, all the cold plate avionics

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:53.319
and electronics, and payloads, we do cooling
for payloads.

01:04:53.319 --> 01:05:10.640
All of these are the functions of the active
thermal control system.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.729
This, as you notice, is a lot busier than
some of the others have been.

01:05:13.729 --> 01:05:16.559
You will notice the radiators here on the
side wall.

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:18.249
This is the doors.

01:05:18.249 --> 01:05:20.150
When closed up there are no radiators.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:23.640
When opened the underside of the payload doors
are your radiators.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.789
And this is on both side, obviously.

01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:31.940
That same heat exchanger that I showed you
before that interfaces with the cabin is right

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940
here.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.309
The cabin load is dumped there.

01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:40.569
Fuel cell load is dumped here.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.700
The fluid is a Freon 21.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.279
There is a Freon 21 pump package.

01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:47.029
The payload heat exchanger is here, I believe.

01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:50.469
Mid body cold plates.

01:05:50.469 --> 01:05:53.549
Aft cold plates.

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:57.499
Each radiator side has its own flow control
system.

01:05:57.499 --> 01:06:01.630
The evaporative heat sinks, one is the flash
evaporator that I've shown you a couple times

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.630
before.

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:03.910
I will describe it a little better in the
minute.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.910
It is here.

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:06.650
It uses water.

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:11.859
There is an ammonia boiler here that is also
an evaporative heat sink.

01:06:11.859 --> 01:06:17.839
And when we're on the ground there is a GSE
connector for the GSE heat sink.

01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:21.440
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.209
More than you would ever know.

01:06:23.209 --> 01:06:31.559
In fact, this is the most complicated, integrated
thermal test ever run at JSC.

01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:33.630
And I will show you a picture of it in a minute.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:36.979
We actually tested all of that together.

01:06:36.979 --> 01:06:38.099
And it all had to work together.

01:06:38.099 --> 01:06:39.749
And it gets worse as we go along.

01:06:39.749 --> 01:06:43.349
I will show you all the integration factors
as we go along, but it changes from mission

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:44.349
mode to mission mode.

01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:46.640
It changes within mission modes as to how
the system works.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.239
And I will try to describe that.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.989
OK, so this sort of gives you the feel now.

01:06:52.989 --> 01:06:58.630
Keep in mind, geometry is going to play an
effect here as to how you plum the system

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.299
up.

01:07:00.299 --> 01:07:07.640
So Freon is running through all of those lines
there to the radiators?

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:13.530
It will be a little clearer in a minute.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.890
This is a schematic.

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.749
Let's start at the radiators.

01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:18.640
On a good day, this is doing the job for you.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.680
All the radiators are getting you nice cool
liquid.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.530
The radiator uses a bypass system, so you
will see the bypass around the radiators.

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:34.859
It is good to remind yourselves that heat
load can be tremendously different.

01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:44.010
And the high level mission phases, a lot of
electronics, a lot of crew activity, the vehicle

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:48.609
is alive and pumping out the power and, therefore,
pumping out the heat.

01:07:48.609 --> 01:07:53.140
If you ever did one of those 28 day missions
we talked about, which was a spec requirement,

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.670
you can imagine this vehicle is almost quiescent.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:58.130
It is doing very little.

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:00.069
You're trying to link them the mission.

01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:04.390
So you're doing hopefully experiments or something
in SpaceLab.

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.959
You're doing something else.

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:08.569
The vehicle is not working for you very hard.

01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:09.569
Just as an example, we have five computers.

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:10.569
And we use all five during ascent and entry,
the active phases for safety, but once you're

01:08:10.569 --> 01:08:11.760
on orbit, when you have a long mission like
that, you actually power down all but two

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760
of the computers.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.760
That is just it.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.760
And there are a lot of other systems which
you power down.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.760
And that way you're limited in missions by
the electrical energy which is limited by

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760
the amount of hydrogen and oxygen you can
carry for fuel cells.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:40.670
So, by powering down, you extend your mission.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:41.670
And, of course, you will also reduce the heat
load.

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:43.600
And, when you reduce the heat load, you've
got to find some way to make that same radiator

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.690
work for you at a very low heat load.

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.040
So it has the capability of getting rid of
a lot of heat.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.210
If you don't want it to get rid of that much
heat, because you don't have it, then you

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:54.330
have to go to bypass system.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.600
Anyway, the next thing in the loop is the
GSE heat exchanger.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.981
On the ground you don't have radiators working
so you use the GSE heat exchanger.

01:09:01.981 --> 01:09:04.400
Then there is the ammonia boiler.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:11.440
When you reenter the ammonia boiler gives
you the ability to operate with an evaporative

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:22.040
heat sink prior to the connection of the GSE,
and so it is part of the thermal control system.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.371
The next is the flash evaporator.

01:09:23.371 --> 01:09:27.870
And you'll notice there are two flash chambers
here.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:30.540
One is called the high load and one is called
the topper.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:33.190
And I will talk about that a little more later.

01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:37.500
Then the nice cool liquid, however it was
cooled, all these cool it.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.170
However it was cooled is then available for
the vehicle.

01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:44.150
And there is one more little heat load, and
that is the cryogenic oxygen that we're bringing

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.480
in.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.350
We also warm it up with this coolant loop.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:52.890
So the flow then goes to the aft cold plates.

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:57.620
And then the flow also goes to the cabin heat
exchanger and the payload heat exchanger.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.800
You notice these are either or.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.560
And that's because sometimes you don't even
have a payload heat exchanger use so you don't

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560
use it.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.060
Sometimes you have a lot of use for it.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:11.310
And maybe, for example, SpaceLab and Space
Station have kind of an arrangement.

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:14.580
You wouldn't be in the cabin as much so you
can divert that.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:19.030
It allows you to use the capacity in either
of two places here.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:23.830
Then you come on down and come through your
pumping package, there are redundant pumps.

01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:37.060
Then you go the fuel cell heat exchanger because
now you've used the nice cold fluid up.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:40.190
And so the fuel cell can stand the warmer
temperatures.

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:41.371
Also some cold plates.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:47.580
Now, it might have occurred to you, it occurred
to me, why did we waste our nice cold fluid

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.040
on these cold plates?

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.310
Why didn't we put those cold plates down here
so we could have had more cold fluid for our

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:54.490
cabin heat exchangers?

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:57.110
And the answer is geometry.

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.670
Those are way in the back.

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:00.890
The cabin is in the front.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:06.590
After you've come forward from the flash evaporator,
which is in the back, to the cabin, you don't

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:08.490
want to go back to pick this up.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.110
You wouldn't want to have to go back to the
back of the vehicle and then back forward

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:14.250
again, so this is a geometry problem.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.250
We have cold plates here.

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:16.250
We also have cold plates here.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:17.580
They come forward.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:22.341
The hydraulics heat exchanger is the last
thing on the loop and then back to the radiators.

01:11:22.341 --> 01:11:26.020
We will talk about that a little more.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:32.190
The functions of the active thermal control
system.

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.561
Collect the waste energy from all the systems.

01:11:33.561 --> 01:11:34.640
We just talked about that.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.330
And rejected radiatively to space.

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:38.520
That is our first choice.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.140
Our first choice is to use the radiators.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:45.941
It turns out that the radiators in some heat
load environments don't do the job.

01:11:45.941 --> 01:11:52.000
You have a high load and a bad environment,
you cannot get rid of all the heat.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.130
Also, we are producing a lot of water, so
something constructive has to be done with

01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:58.130
this water.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.440
The fuel cells are pumping it out because
every time you make a kilowatt you've got

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440
more water to use.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.790
So we decided to augment the space radiators
with the evaporative heat sink at these high

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:08.140
load cases.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:16.630
This gives us an ability to accept a radiator
system that cannot really do the job by itself

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:21.510
but make it completely adequate for some of
the low heat load cases, but in the high heat

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:24.860
load cases then it is augmented by water.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.600
Now, when you want to get rid of water and
you don't have some of this bad environment

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.650
you can actually throttle the radiators down.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:36.150
And, if you throttle them down, then you force
the evaporative heat sink to come online and

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.150
do the job for you.

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:41.310
In other words, you change the set point on
the radiator.

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:43.750
Normally we use 40 degrees set point.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:49.500
If you change it to 56 degrees and let the
water take you from 56 back down to 40 then

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.340
you artificially get rid of water.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.850
It is a good water dump system.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:13:00.710
During ascent, over 100,000 feet we use the
water boiler.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.710
The flash evaporator.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.100
Not a water boiler.

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.600
That's a Freudian slip, I guess.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.650
The Apollo had what's called a water boiler.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.650
It was a nightmare.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:13.770
We said never will we do that again, so we
ended up with a different design for the Shuttle.

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:20.330
The reentry system below 100,000 feet is ammonia.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:26.250
It will carry you all the way to the ground
and on the ground until you get the GSE.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:30.040
Water won't carry you because water won't
evaporate less than 100,000 feet, but the

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.560
ammonia will so that's the reason it is there.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.480
Let's talk about the radiators themselves.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.751
The two payload bay doors are a mirror image
of each other.

01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:44.621
They are radiators on each side that are exactly
mirror image.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:52.900
I don't know what happened there.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:14:01.290
Anyway, this is supposed to say that the radiators
on these two sides are mounted and are plumbed

01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:04.120
in two separate cooling loops.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.020
The reason for that is there is always a redundant
loop.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.120
Obviously, you have to be able to take a failure
and still have a good system.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.940
If you run both loops through both radiator
sides and you took some sort of collision

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.870
hit then you could wipe out both of your cooling
loops in one hit.

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.930
And so that is unacceptable.

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:28.370
By plumbing the systems up with mirror image
radiator systems on different loops then you

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:31.640
can still use the capacity together.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.730
But if you lose one side you still have half
your capacity left.

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.290
And plus you have your evaporative heat sinks
to make up the difference.

01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:43.850
So we can survive with a door out.

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:46.410
I mentioned the dual set points before.

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:49.270
I also mentioned the bypass thermal control.

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:52.230
I mentioned the dual set points, 40 and 56.

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:53.620
40 is our normal.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:59.960
If you're trying to burn up some water you
go to 56 and you use the difference in water.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.000
The radiators, we have two different kinds
of radiators.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.180
We have the single-sided that are on the back
of the vehicle and some two-sided ones on

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.180
the front of the vehicle.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:18.870
The reason for that is when you open the door
you expose the underside of the door.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.520
If you have radiators on the underside of
the door then you've exposed your radiators.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:30.420
But if you lift the radiator panel off the
door, because the doors go way down, then

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.730
you can see the underside.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:36.440
It's not as good, you don't get a full view
of the heavens, but it does get rid of heat.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.320
And so we needed that extra capacity.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:47.500
On the front four panels they are the two-sided
and on the back four they are single-sided.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.980
The radiators themselves are made out of a
honeycomb aluminum structure.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.900
The tubes were imbedded in the structure so
that the surface was smooth, and that was

01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:01.850
because we wanted to use a silver Teflon tape
for our thermal control coding.

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:08.180
For previous vehicles we always painted the
radiators, painted them white.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:13.121
If you look at the alpha epsilon white paint,
it is pretty good.

01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:19.710
I think Apollo was 0.18 alpha and epsilon
about 0.92.

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.040
That's pretty good.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.480
The market had moved along.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:30.800
Technology had advanced and there was not
the silver Teflon out there.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.790
And what the silver Teflon does is the silver
gives you the reflection which is good and

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:41.250
the Teflon gives you the radiation which is
good, so you get the best of both worlds.

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:51.900
Silver Teflon was about 0.05 epsilon and about
0.88, 0.9, something like that.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:57.120
You lost a slight amount in epsilon and gained
a lot in alpha, so basically you could ignore

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.470
the sun which is what you'd like to do, is
ignore the sun.

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:04.770
It turned out the silver Teflon had some issues.

01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:07.560
We tested the radiators.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:17.140
The radiator was not a slam dunk with eight
panels, four of which are two-sided.

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.940
Effectively you have 12 panels.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.880
You have fluid going through those in parallel
tubes.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.210
You're trying to guaranty that the fluid all
goes where it's supposed to go.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:34.581
And, therefore, the viscosity of Freon, which
is very low, analytically said it was all

01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:35.581
right.

01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:40.510
But we wanted some testing to prove it so
we did test the entire radiator system.

01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:42.550
And, in that test, all the silver Teflon fell
off.

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:49.350
It is a really good thermal coating but it
doesn't seem to be very practical.

01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:52.500
It turned out that the problem was adhesive.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.900
We did a little adhesive work and the materials
people came up with a Permacel that worked

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.170
perfectly.

01:17:58.170 --> 01:17:59.370
They have never come off again.

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:04.480
In fact, we get 10, 12 years out of the radiators,
lots of time.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:14.750
The problem that the Permacel couldn't solve
was beneath the tape you could get very small

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:19.270
little out-gassing of the materials.

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:21.150
Almost all materials outgas some.

01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:23.980
Basically, we would put bubbles underneath
the tape.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.151
We went to a perforated.

01:18:27.151 --> 01:18:31.250
There are millions of little holes in this
tape.

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:35.540
And it is placed on the vehicle and it stayed
on just fine.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:40.520
It wasn't very long, though, that people began
to worry about the focusing of this silver,

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.440
that the doors are curved upward.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.030
And so there is a focal point there that is
a very, very hot point.

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:49.350
And there was concern that that's really not
a good thing to have.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:54.980
If we could make the surface less specular
and more diffuse without losing the alpha

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.510
and epsilon we would have a better design.

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:57.881
And so they dimpled it.

01:18:57.881 --> 01:19:04.250
Now we have Permacel dimpled, perforated silver
Teflon tape.

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:10.820
It works great.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.560
The flash evaporator.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.210
Water is the flash evaporator's evaporant.

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:19.850
This was a brand-new design.

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:22.310
The water boiler on Apollo was no good.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:24.840
It was a problem.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.080
The flash evaporator is a very simple concept.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.520
You have a chamber.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.960
You run your coolant around the chamber that
you want to be cooled.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.940
And you spray water on the walls of the chamber.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.250
And, if the pressures are all right, the water
will flash.

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.360
You won't get ice.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.980
It will go straight to steam.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.750
Steam will go overboard and it will all be
wonderful.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:51.560
And if you can convince a program manager
of that good luck.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.180
Anyway, the way to convince a program manager
is to show him good test data.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:20:02.730
During the development, we developed this
process of spraying the walls and not getting

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:06.630
water carryover which will obviously freeze
up your steam duct.

01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:09.170
Which you don't want.

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:17.760
But, as the design evolved, we had to get
more sophisticated because we needed this

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:23.210
flash evaporator to burn up the extra water
when we didn't need the fuel cell water.

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:26.010
And we did that with that 40 to 56 set point.

01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.170
And so we needed a small evaporator that could
handle that.

01:20:30.170 --> 01:20:33.290
It was called the "topper." It tops off the
radiator.

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:37.480
But when the doors are closed there is nothing
else to get rid of your heat, now you need

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.980
a loss of capacity.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.680
And so the second chamber was the hallowed
chamber.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.360
Together they do the whole job.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:52.320
When the radiators are working only topper,
you can come home with this system functional

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.190
and make it home.

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:57.830
It turns out we never did freeze up the steam
duct so that part was good.

01:20:57.830 --> 01:21:02.500
It turns out that we had some freezing in
the chamber.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:11.050
And, in fact, we had to develop a process
that acknowledged that that could occur.

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:12.050
And how would we flush it?

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:15.070
It is called "flushing." And so we did develop
a process.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.590
And it has never failed.

01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:18.350
The flushing process always works.

01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:23.140
And we have had on several occasions, I probably
cannot count them for you, but four of five

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:31.050
times maybe over the Shuttle flights we've
had some freezing inside the cavities.

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.450
There is a non-propulsive overboard vent.

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:38.100
That was the one going out both sides for
the topper because it could be used for very

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.750
long times during the mission and you might
be pointing or whatever you might be doing.

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:46.350
But when you're coming home the high load
is just a big out the side of the vehicle

01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:50.580
type duct.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:53.400
The ammonia boiler, its heat sink is ammonia.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.440
As I mentioned before, it evaporates all the
way to the ground where the water won't.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.270
The redundant boiler is here.

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.450
Up here there are no redundant boilers.

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:05.060
These two chambers have redundant everything.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.960
They have redundant feed water systems and
redundant control systems, redundant spray

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.120
nozzles, redundant everything, but the chamber
is a chamber.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.120
You get what you get.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.461
They are redundant boilers is the way the
ammonia boiler gets its redundancy.

01:22:19.461 --> 01:22:26.290
It was designed to be utilized during entry
and on the runway until the cooling is available.

01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:29.100
It turns out that we don't do that anymore.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:35.510
It turns out operationally we learned that
if we cold soak the radiators before we shut

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:41.561
the doors and then bypass them and come home
on the flash evaporator that there is a lot

01:22:41.561 --> 01:22:43.410
of heat capacity still left in those radiators.

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:46.950
There is a lot of fluid out there and it is
cold.

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:54.510
And so we can actually go all the way to wheel
stop on the radiator.

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:58.340
And so at 175,000 feet we start flowing the
radiator.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:04.650
And at 100,000 feet the flash evaporator is
off and we cold soak all the way home.

01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:12.380
And after wheel stop the ammonia boiler cranks
up.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.070
I mentioned the Freon 21, the low viscosity.

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:18.190
We got an excellent performance out of that.

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:21.791
The low viscosity is really, really important,
as much parallelism as we have.

01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:23.640
I didn't really give you the numbers.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.690
In the single panels we have 26 tubes.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:32.550
In the two-sided panels, I believe, there
are 66 tubes.

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:33.550
Lots of tubes.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.550
Lots of parallelism.

01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:40.970
It is awfully easy to get flow instability
in a thermal system like that but the Freon

01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:41.970
loop does great.

01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:48.120
We have redundant pumps, all liquid heat exchangers
and cold plates.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.333
This is that chamber that I told you.

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:54.620
If you can look right down here, this is one
person.

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.190
In fact, there is a radiator panel.

01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:59.310
This was during buildup.

01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:04.330
Twice we tested the flash evaporator in this
environment once as part of the integrated

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.990
system with all the radiators and once by
itself.

01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:12.350
And twice we tested the radiators, one as
part of the integrated system and once by

01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:13.350
themselves.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:16.490
So we did essentially three large tests.

01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:21.050
And the one that had the entire system in
it, had all the cold plates, had everything

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:26.210
in it, as I said, is the most sophisticated
thermal test we've ever done at JSC.

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:29.480
And it proved that the system could work.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.560
It also proved that we had to tune the flash
evaporator nozzle because it was wrong.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.850
But we did get the data, we did prove it was
wrong and we got it re-machined.

01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:42.660
A machine out of columbium, somebody else
will have to answer why.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:47.730
And so it was a problem for Aaron to go get
us another one, but it fixed it and it was

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:48.730
successful.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:53.480
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.900
You can have a command module and a service
module and a stack configuration in side that

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.340
chamber.

01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:03.400
And it had a solar and full vacuum.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.690
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:07.770
It was a manned chamber then.

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.980
It is not now.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.870
After Apollo-Soyuz, it hasn't been manned
since then.

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:16.250
It's still available for testing but is not
manned.

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:20.850
It has a sister chamber 100 feet that way
where all of the EVA testing is done.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.550
A good example, I think, of how the Shuttle
Program built on a lot of Apollo-- The same

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:39.420
thing at the Cape where a lot of the launch
hardware was adapted is the Shuttle Program,

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:55.852
you know, you heard about the budgetary constraints.

01:25:55.852 --> 01:25:56.852
The Shuttle Program never could have afforded
to build something like that.

01:25:56.852 --> 01:25:57.852
But luckily a lot of this equipment was built
during Apollo when the money was much more

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:58.852
available.

01:25:58.852 --> 01:25:59.852
If you have been keeping count, we're getting
toward the end here.

01:25:59.852 --> 01:26:06.820
I did want to mention, before we left the
main orbiter systems, that there was some

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.990
rotating equipment life testing that we did
for the program.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:13.170
The equipment we're talking about here is
the cabin fan, the water gas separators, the

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:17.340
avionics bay fans, cabin coolant and the vehicle
coolant pumps.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:22.260
The life requirement was 100 missions, and
that was calculated by somebody to be 20,000

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.260
hours.

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:28.900
If you could show 20,000 hours of successful
operation, you had the design life of the

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.980
hardware.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:34.700
We set up a laboratory to run the equipment.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.900
It was obviously a low-maintenance lab.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:42.960
We collected data and checked in the room
occasionally to see if everything was all

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960
right.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:49.590
It turned out that all the equipment passed
the 20,000 hour requirement.

01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:52.650
We did learn something, though, that some
of that stuff was so noisy.

01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:55.080
Oh, it was noisy.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:04.550
There was some work done on some muffling,
but the hardware itself was all good.

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:05.550
We are at the end.

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:06.550
Yes.

01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:08.710
Were there noise requirements [AUDIENCE QUESTION]?

01:27:08.710 --> 01:27:12.040
Yes, there was a cabin noise spec.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.530
And, yes, it had to be met.

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.590
And I don't remember how it was met.

01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:17.870
We put mufflers on some of the equipment.

01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:23.920
Maybe some insulation inside of the ducting,
I'm not sure.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.830
If we have time, COHEN: I will tell a little
anecdote here.

01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:30.600
I chaired the Change Control Board.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.740
[NOISE OBSCURES]

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:40.330
The medical organization came to see me and
said that the cabin was very, very noisy and

01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:45.370
it was going to really do a detriment to the
astronauts.

01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:53.911
And it was very expensive in terms of dollars
and weight to really get all the cabin fans

01:27:53.911 --> 01:27:59.190
and cabin environment down to the level they
wanted.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:00.190
I thought for a moment.

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:03.260
I go out to California a lot.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:08.760
I go out to Rockwell and stay in motels that
are on the Los Angeles freeway.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:16.080
And I said you don't see me worried about
my ears in staying in those freeways and not

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.490
being able to sleep and having all that noise.

01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:22.980
And the doctor looked at me for a moment and
said, well, you're already deaf.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.060
And I said what did you say?

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:30.740
But we did have to make some modifications
of it to actually reduce noise.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.480
Let me interject one item.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.220
I think somebody asked the issue about the
IMU.

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:41.880
We decided to pick the IMU off the shelves,
and it was air-cooled, to really do it right.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:48.050
If we would have done it right, we would have
picked an IMU which was compatible with liquid

01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:49.910
cooling rather than redesign it.

01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:53.910
But we decided to stick with the IMU that
was air-cooled.

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:56.541
Whether that was the right decision to make,
I don't know.

01:28:56.541 --> 01:29:00.100
It seemed like it was because I think we've
only had one problem with an IMU.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.580
I don't think we've had many problems with
the IMU.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:06.920
But that is a little anecdote that I thought
of.

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.130
That's a program manager's trait.

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:14.550
Probably the air-cooled IMU was a less expensive
option.

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:21.840
It might have cost a little in terms of thermal
efficiency, but that is only energy power.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.670
And power was available so it was a good tradeoff.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:31.400
This is the last of the subsystem areas.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.850
This is the EVA airlock support.

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:38.590
The Environmental Thermal Control and Life
Support System does support the airlock.

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:45.870
It maintains the cabin pressure and composition
during the airlock repress and depress.

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:53.130
This is really a requirement back on the ARS
and the pressure and composition control system

01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:58.930
because airlock use basically dumps cabin
gas and then you repress the airlock.

01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:04.910
It is a requirement that you cannot upset
the cabin while you're doing the EVA function.

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:08.570
We also provide the service and cooling umbilical.

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:12.610
If you have any kind of mental picture of
being in the airlock, the crew is connected

01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:18.040
with cooling and oxygen through an umbilical
so they don't use the consumables in their

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.140
spacesuit.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.970
And so that is provided by the ETCLSS.

01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:27.590
Heat rejection, the crew wears a liquid cooling
garment.

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:33.360
And the cooling for that is done by the vehicle
until you go EVA, of course.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360
Then the recharge.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.930
We supply the backpack O2 recharge from the
900 PSI cryo.

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:42.590
We supply the water to recharge for the sublimator.

01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:49.360
NASA is overrun with acronyms.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.340
EMU is extra vehicular mobility unit, which
means nothing but spacesuit and backpack.

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.570
So the spacesuit and backpack uses an evaporative
heat sink and it uses a sublimator.

01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:05.950
And the idea there is it's a device that exposes
a layer of ice to space and then it sublimates

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:12.080
and you get your cooling from that as opposed
to putting a liquid water on a surface and

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080
flashing it.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.110
Anyway, that has to be serviced.

01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:18.890
That water is provided from the system.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:22.650
And then the condensate that the crew brings
back, EVA, that's a sweaty job.

01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:25.190
That condensate goes back into the system.

01:31:25.190 --> 01:31:31.920
So the airlock support is another part of
this system.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.440
In fact, that is the sixth part.

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.940
So we are through.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:37.630
This is a picture of the airlock.

01:31:37.630 --> 01:31:38.630
Not really the airlock.

01:31:38.630 --> 01:31:42.550
This is the test chamber that we built to
put the equipment in.

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:46.390
You'll notice it has the right hatch in it.

01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:51.550
And, if you can recall back an hour and a
half ago, I showed you a picture where there

01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:56.920
was this hatch basically on the backside of
the test chamber.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.450
We hook those together.

01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:03.200
Because, as I said, as you depress and repress
the airlock it affects the cabin.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.770
So we needed a test environment that had both
those simultaneously.

01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:10.570
But the difference is this has to go all the
way to vacuum.

01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:14.070
So we connected this to our vacuum system.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:18.790
And, when the crew is inside this, it is a
manned vacuum test.

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:26.870
And when the crew is inside the other test
chamber it is basically sea level or, at most,

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:30.450
8 PSI would be the lowest it would ever be.

01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:36.700
And I think the last picture is a spacesuit
inside the airlock.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.860
And this is just a little cutaway showing
the airlock.

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:43.540
This was mounted on the back of that chamber
you saw earlier.

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:56.880
If you bring that picture back up, I will
talk to that for just a minute and then we

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.580
will have some questions.

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:07.870
Before every flight, one of the things that
we do is that every EVA crewmember takes his

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:15.040
or her spacesuit into that EVA test chamber,
into the airlock test chamber so you actually

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.960
get a chance to take your own suit down to
vacuum.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:26.920
And particularly, before you do your very
first EVA, it is really a confidence builder

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.480
because the physical sensations that you get
in a suit -- And remember you're at about

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:35.990
a 4 PSI pure oxygen environment.

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:39.090
Your body, the inside of your mouth feels
a little different.

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:44.740
There are funny sounds with the fans inside
the suit.

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.750
The sorts of things that you don't want to
experience the first time when you actually

01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:50.950
go outside into space.

01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:58.480
It is much better to do it here in a controlled
environment where if there is a problem -- Actually,

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.411
you are supported because of the weight of
the suit.

01:34:01.411 --> 01:34:04.580
It doesn't look like there is anybody in this
suit.

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.260
But, when you're in this suit, you're actually
supported by a cable to the ceiling of the

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.940
chamber which is on quick release bolts.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:18.760
You're suspended up here.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:27.480
And, if you ever have a problem, they can
release this, repressurize the chamber within

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.270
about 30 seconds.

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:32.790
I think that's the limit for a manned rated
chamber.

01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:38.750
You're going to be able to repress in about
30 seconds and then just lift you out, suit

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:43.081
and all from the top, and get you out of your
suit and get you to the medics.

01:34:43.081 --> 01:34:47.210
This is just an inverted bell jar.

01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:49.530
The hatch is not sealed.

01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:56.670
When you depress it just like pulls it out
and seals due to the pressure difference.

01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:59.600
You just lift the top off.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:06.480
Yet another example of the extensive testing
that we go through before every mission.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:14.790
I might add one more thing, which I forgot
actually to add earlier.

01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:23.140
The manned rating is a term used in manned
spacecraft which means that you've specifically

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:31.440
tested it and said that its design is worthy
of supporting a human.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.810
The airlock had to provide that function.

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:37.330
So Aaron was faced with man rating the airlock.

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:42.610
And manned test capability is very scarce.

01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:48.400
In fact, JSC may be the only place anymore
that can do it.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:54.060
Anyway, we volunteered to do that as part
of our test program as a programmatic requirement.

01:35:54.060 --> 01:36:00.560
Not as testing or watching or confirming anything,
but as a prime part of the test program was

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560
the manned rating of the airlock.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.730
And that was done in Houston.

01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:05.970
That is an interesting thought.

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:14.500
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the
problems we had in the early part of the Manned

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:23.770
Space Program was doing some chamber runs
McDonnell-Douglas with a two-gas system where

01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:28.860
we actually lost the heat [NOISE OBSCURES]

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.990
in the chamber and almost lost a test subject.

01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:37.840
And that was when Apollo decided to go to
100% oxygen.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.884
And that is what led up to the fire on the
pad.

01:36:38.884 --> 01:36:39.884
It went to 100% oxygen at 16 pounds per square
inch with an invert over the hatch for another

01:36:39.884 --> 01:36:40.884
reason.

01:36:40.884 --> 01:36:45.600
And that is really if you can realize that
100% oxygen at 16 PSI everything burns.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.600
Stainless steel is not self-extinguishing
at 16 PSI.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.600
And, of course, that's what we were up when
we had the Apollo I fire on the pad.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.050
It was a function of doing some test work
with the combined atmosphere.

01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:54.890
So you have got to be careful that sometimes
you don't over-react the thing.

01:36:54.890 --> 01:37:15.035
Then we went back to a different type of atmosphere.

01:37:15.035 --> 01:37:18.200
Did you have a question?

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.550
The systems you've been describing today seem
to take up a lot of space in the Orbiter like

01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:23.830
other systems.

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:34.610
How did you negotiate and manage other subsystems
for the space and the volume in the way that

01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:35.840
you wanted?

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.290
That is a good question but you're asking
the wrong person.

01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:41.720
We are the government.

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:45.720
We hired a contractor to design the vehicle.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:52.621
Now, the design aspects of it, the philosophy
of it, the functionality of it we were very,

01:37:52.621 --> 01:37:55.840
very integral with.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.410
We watched, we audited, we said that looks
smart, but we didn't go and say put that cold

01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:02.710
plate here and put that heat exchanger there.

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:05.020
The vehicle integrated design was Rockwell's.

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:07.130
Let me tell you how it was done.

01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:09.940
Actually, in those years we didn't have CAD/CAM
systems.

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:14.250
What we did is used everything on mockups.

01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:16.320
We did mockups.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:21.120
The system was laid out of what to do and
the functions of what they had to do and the

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120
plumbing.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.590
And this was all laid out on a mockup.

01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:28.210
And basically that was how it was negotiated
in terms of what you need.

01:38:28.210 --> 01:38:32.020
In today's environment you wouldn't do that.

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:34.170
You would use electronic capability.

01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:36.300
You would use your CAD/CAM systems.

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.860
You would actually draw it up on your computer.

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.440
In fact, the 777 was built that way.

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.590
The 777 at Boeing, they didn't use hard mockups.

01:38:44.590 --> 01:38:46.640
They used electronic mockups.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.720
And that is what we would do today.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.970
And it would be much easier.

01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:50.810
You would probably call all the engineers
together.

01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:55.410
You would sit down and show how the equipment
was laid out, get a satisfactory buyoff on

01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:58.600
it and do it much more rapidly and much more
quickly.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:04.360
In the future, what you will be doing is actually
use a CAD/CAM system or CAD system to actually

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.670
negotiate the space you need for it.

01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:09.531
That is a good question.

01:39:09.531 --> 01:39:15.710
And it was based on purely that you would
get drawings, mockups, go out and lay it out

01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:17.360
in a soft mockup or hard mockup.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.290
You would get the engineers to come out, the
manufacturing people to come out and say this

01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:23.080
is how it is going to look and then get a
buyoff on it.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.650
Today you wouldn't do it that way.

01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:27.550
You would do it all electronically so it would
change.

01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:29.490
Well, let me ask you a question.

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:35.430
Of all the work you've done in the Shuttle
what was your biggest concern in getting ready

01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:36.600
to fly or during the flight?

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:47.210
What did you have the biggest concern about?

01:39:47.210 --> 01:39:48.660
I was young and confident.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:54.531
I don't know that I had a specific area that
I was really concerned about.

01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.040
Like these people right here, right?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.540
Young and confident.

01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:03.630
I did recognize, though, but it did result
in the integrated tests that I showed.

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:09.300
I did recognize that we had the most highly
integrated thermal control system ever conceived.

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:12.840
And it had, as I said, modes within modes.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.860
It changed modes with respect to the vehicle
phases.

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:19.700
It changed modes with respect to operation.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:22.820
We had 9 PSI that went to 10.2 PSI.

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:23.820
We had 8 PSI.

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:29.440
We had thermal control loops, ammonia boilers,
flash evaporators, so I did recognize the

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.440
sophistication.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:41.680
In fact, we proposed early on to use that
large chamber in an integrated vehicle test.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:49.380
Not we, me, but the big we looked at an integrated
test like the Command Service Module was tested.

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.130
And that was viewed to be impractical.

01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:53.380
It was cut it off at the bulkhead.

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:58.030
You could do the forward cabin part and then
do the aft section, but that was viewed to

01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:59.030
be impractical.

01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:02.130
But it still was a very integrated design.

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:08.140
All the systems engineering that was there
created that inner-dependency.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:13.240
And I think I was smart enough to know that
there was certainly some potential risks there.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:23.940
Remember in the very beginning of this I talked
about ownership of all the technical aspects?

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.450
We had ownership.

01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:32.950
We believed that what we had done was prudent,
appropriate, and we believed it would work.

01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.010
It wasn't like you bought something and you
hope it works.

01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:39.740
Can you say a word of what you think, this
is looking in your crystal ball, about the

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:40.740
CEV?

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.220
Do you think it's going to have a very similar
type system or have you thought about that?

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.220
Well, we hope so.

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:52.970
Our new administrator has sort of back to
the grassroots philosophy, or at least right

01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:53.970
now.

01:41:53.970 --> 01:42:00.280
And so we hope that the CEV will be developed
with a lot of government involvement, that

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.570
the government will have ownership again of
the technical aspects of the design.

01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:13.080
If that happens then I think a lot of the
experience that is around and a lot of the

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.540
free-thinking and the independence that the
government can bring to that, there is another

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.630
school of thought that says keep the government
out of the way and let the contractor go do

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:21.840
their thing.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.720
And, obviously, you wouldn't get that position
from me but there are people that believe

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720
that's the right way to do it.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.150
Do you think the system will look pretty much
like this or similar to it?

01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:37.630
Well, similar, yes, I do think so.

01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:46.050
I believe that the very tight schedule for
the CEV is going to put a lot of pressure

01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:49.420
on the program manager to go with the tried
and true.

01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.840
So I don't think there is going to be innovation
that has risk with it.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.490
Maybe there will be innovation that is good
engineering, but I think the innovation with

01:42:58.490 --> 01:43:00.700
risk will be very much minimized.

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:05.690
Because taking Shuttle offline in 2010 there
is going be a lot of pressure to get this

01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:06.690
vehicle finished.

01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:17.660
I think that is going to breed some conservatism
on the design side.

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:31.030
We talk about considering operation while
you're doing the design, but there were always

01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:32.660
things once the design was made.

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:38.590
Well, like you mention, once we came up with
a requirement for a 10.2 cabin we had to develop

01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:39.590
workarounds.

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:44.220
And one of the other things that after the
system is designed, we then start to figure

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.210
out how can it fail and work on malfunction
procedures.

01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:54.440
And I know that the malfunction procedure
for loss of two coolant loops that was probably

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.640
the worst simulation case that we ever had
to deal with.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.930
I am curious to get your opinion.

01:44:01.930 --> 01:44:08.780
Walt described how we have two independent
cooling loops so that in principle one failure

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.890
won't take them both out.

01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:14.480
Now, I don't remember what it was, but they
did discover a single point failure somewhere

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.000
in there which I think was corrected but where
you could have lost both of the cooling loops

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.780
with a single failure.

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:26.890
The only failure I remember is one that John
Young used to worry about.

01:44:26.890 --> 01:44:34.170
It had to do with if you did lose a radiator
that that could bleed your accumulator down.

01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:40.280
And so they did add an isolation valve so
they can isolate the radiator side.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.830
But the idea was to obviously not lose your
fluid with a single hit.

01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:50.170
That even though you have a nice completely
functional thermal control system it is useless

01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:52.370
because it has no fluid.

01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:58.650
We did have an emergency de-orbit procedure
for loss of two Freon cooling loops.

01:44:58.650 --> 01:45:03.390
And, of all the things that we practices,
that was the hairiest because it was absolutely

01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:04.560
time critical.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.480
At this point, you have no way of getting
heat out of the cabin so you cannot ultimately

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.520
cool your electronics.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.400
The cabin gets hot, your electronics get hot
so you have to do an immediate de-orbit.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.460
Hopefully you're within range of a landing
site.

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:27.780
And then you turn off all the equipment that
you can possibly turn off, including most

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.780
of your computers.

01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:35.990
And, when you're riding down through entry,
you basically watch the temperature of the

01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.990
computer.

01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:42.030
And, as each computer would get up to its
failure temperature, you would then switch

01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:47.940
on the next computer, transfer the data, you
know, turn off the computer which has just

01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:52.250
about failed, and hopefully you could make
it to the ground.

01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:59.350
And I know the instructors that would lead
us through this exercise said that the information

01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:03.930
they had gotten from the thermal analyst was
that nobody was really sure whether we could

01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:04.930
make it.

01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:06.890
I don't know what your opinion was or not.

01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:07.890
We practiced it.

01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:11.940
But obviously, I think I've told you, nobody
has ever died in a simulator.

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:18.530
But you never know whether the thermal model
that they use in the simulator is really going

01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:23.450
to duplicate the way the Shuttle is going
to behave in an absolute emergency situation

01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:24.690
like that.

01:46:24.690 --> 01:46:28.420
We survived in the simulator but I don't know
what your feeling is.

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.670
Well, we do address the thermal model accuracy.

01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:38.190
We do specific testing to validate the thermal
model so we do have pretty good confidence

01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:39.190
in those.

01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:43.951
But the real issue in overheat is that when
does a piece of equipment stop working in

01:46:43.951 --> 01:46:45.040
an overheat situation?

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.430
I mean there is no magic number.

01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:51.860
It is not like at 143 degrees it is OK and
144 it is not OK.

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:57.280
And it varies with age, it varies with equipment
and it varies with a lot of things.

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.570
So there wasn't really a precise answer as
to how long you could keep everything functional

01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:04.260
and come home.

01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:05.260
Yes.

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:08.360
You talked earlier a little about oxygen and
nitrogen mixing in the cabin.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.970
I was wondering if there is a way to really
study that on the ground since you're not

01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:13.880
in a DoD environment.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.780
How do you know there are not pockets of nitrogen
sitting around that an astronaut can stick

01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:19.960
his heat into?

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.960
Very good.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.210
I just forgot to mention that earlier.

01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:55.670
The testing that we ran, we had to set it
up very carefully.

01:47:55.670 --> 01:48:00.520
If you notice, there is a flight deck and
a mid-deck, so obviously buoyancy is going

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:01.750
to mix that stuff for you.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:07.390
What we did is set up a thermal condition
where less than one degree thermal gradient

01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:10.570
everywhere in there had to exist before we
ran the test.

01:48:10.570 --> 01:48:17.440
And that was to guaranty that we had no help
from the naturally induced circulation.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.900
But you are absolutely right.

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:24.140
That test would have been a useless test without
neutralizing the gravity effects.

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:32.660
And actually the first time that I did the
spacesuit test in there we actually used the

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:33.660
10.2 protocol.

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:42.110
So I actually had to go in the day before,
take the cabin to 10.2, spend the night and

01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:45.040
then we could do just a 40 minute prebreathe.

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:53.020
For most of the other tests, when you go in,
in order to avoid the inconvenience and expense

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:56.790
of staying through the night, you go in early
in the morning.

01:48:56.790 --> 01:49:00.900
And then you're coming right from a sea level
environment.

01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:07.950
So, before you go down to 4 PSI in the suit,
you actually have to prebreathe pure oxygen

01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:09.200
for four hours.

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.040
As Walt said, that was the alternative.

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.540
You basically just get in your suit.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:20.260
You can either bring a book and read your
book or they will pipe music into you if you

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.150
want to give them a CD, or I guess there was
an audiocassette in those days, or they have

01:49:25.150 --> 01:49:26.920
a little black and white TV monitor.

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.350
And you just sort of sit there for four hours.

01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:36.100
And the problem is you're not allowed to go
to sleep.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.060
That would be the easiest thing, but they
want you actually to move around because when

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:44.590
you're moving your muscles you're actually
then doing a better job of de-nitrogenating.

01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:45.710
So you have to stay awake.

01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:52.381
And if you don't say anything for more than
about 10 minutes they will pipe something

01:49:52.381 --> 01:49:55.360
in and say, Jeff, are you awake?

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:58.760
But this was a very, very useful facility.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.591
I mean they used it for all different sorts
of things.

01:50:01.591 --> 01:50:07.550
And I guess that was the one new facility
which was built for the Shuttle specifically.

01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:08.550
Yes.

01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:12.950
Jeff mentioned several times the 10.2 and
I talked about the 9.

01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:21.460
The 9 was the original design, but the issues
with the 9 PSI had to do with the oxygen percentage

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.130
got too high.

01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:26.550
And so there was much concern about flammability.

01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:33.910
The idea was if you could raise the pressure
up some to 10.2 then that would be less of

01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:35.630
a flammability issue.

01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:44.380
But then the problem became at 10.2 that the
suit at 4 PSI was too much of a drop.

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:50.160
If you're in the bends while diving, somebody
mentioned diving earlier, scuba, you could

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.160
usually use a two to one.

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.330
If you don't reduce pressure more than half
you're probably OK.

01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:58.340
You're probably not going to get the bends,
but half of 10.2 is not 4.

01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:01.260
And the suit is at 4, so there was that issue
again.

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:08.340
They raised and bumped the suit up a little
bit and got it up to 4.3 and went to 10.2

01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:12.130
and developed the prebreathe protocols that
made that acceptable.

01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:13.430
That is sort of how it balanced out.

01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:15.200
That was another operational move later.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.990
And, as Walt said, you're spending enough
time, once you get in the suit and you purge

01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:25.180
all the nitrogen out, and so you're sitting
in a pure oxygen environment, you've got to

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:30.430
do a bunch of tests and check out communication
tests and cooling tests.

01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:36.400
You basically are not losing much time by
having to spend 40 minutes prebreathing.

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.070
The whole thing worked out pretty well.

01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:43.470
And it will be an interesting question on
how they designed the CEV because the CEV

01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:47.880
has to be compatible with docking to the Space
Station which works at a sea level environment.

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:53.800
But, on the other hand, if you're going to
take the CEV into a situation where you want

01:51:53.800 --> 01:52:00.040
to do a lot of space walks, you probably want
to be able to operate it at more like 8.5

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:08.740
or 9 PSI so that you can go right into a spacesuit
without an extensive prebreathe.

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:12.450
And, of course, people are always trying to
figure out could we design the spacesuit to

01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:14.110
work at a higher pressure?

01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:17.130
But then you give up maneuverability.

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:23.670
We will talk about that in another lecture
that I will be giving on EVA systems.

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:24.670
Walt, thank you very much.

01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:25.670
I enjoyed it.

01:52:25.670 --> 01:52:25.671
