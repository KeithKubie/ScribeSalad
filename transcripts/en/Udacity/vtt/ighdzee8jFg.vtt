00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.070
Dependency injection is
a way to design software so

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.700
that code, like a function does not have
its dependencies hard coded into it.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.422
Instead, the information that the
function needs is given to the function

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:12.435
when it's called.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.440
There are a number of reasons for this.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.930
It decreases the coupling between
a function and it's dependencies.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.800
It can decrease the complexity
of that function.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.870
And it makes it easy to configure
the function if it needs a new or

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.790
different dependency.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.140
This topic can be a little
convoluted to work through though.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.337
So I've got some friends
to help me explain it.

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:32.723
We've got Brittany.

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.336
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Cameron.

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.715
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:36.691
&gt;&gt; Kogure.

00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.154
&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt; Walter.

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:39.623
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.760
&gt;&gt; And Mike.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.262
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:45.874
&gt;&gt; Here's what a typical day looks
like in a dependency injection world.

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:46.848
[SOUND].

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:47.960
&gt;&gt; Hey, what's up, Brittany?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.280
&gt;&gt; Hey, Cameron, what's going on?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.600
&gt;&gt; Well, I've got a lot of tires,
any kind, any shape, any size.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.140
&gt;&gt; Great, and where do you sit?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.380
&gt;&gt; Over there.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, thanks.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.920
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:01.360
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.141
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; I just got in and I've got that-

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, what do you got for me?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.180
&gt;&gt; Blue bricks?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, of what sizes?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.567
&gt;&gt; One by the ones.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.680
I think there's like a two by two.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.619
There may have been
like a bridge four by-

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.380
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, you have it all.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320
Got it.
Where do you sit?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.960
&gt;&gt; Over there.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome, great.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.350
Thank you.

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:24.050
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.020
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.995
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Reporting for duty.

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:27.689
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, okay.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.730
What do you have?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.240
How much do you have?
And where do you sit?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.210
&gt;&gt; Red bricks.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.010
A whole bucket full of them.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.380
Over by the wall, third from the left.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Thank you.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.803
&gt;&gt; Man, another prop for a course.

00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:54.150
[NOISE].

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.248
No.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:59.431
Hm.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.283
Hey Brittany.

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:03.350
&gt;&gt; Hey what do you need babe,
because whatever it is, I got it.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I need a prop for
an upcoming course.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.250
I can do it, but I still need some
red bricks, some blue bricks,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.270
and some tires.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.750
For the blockades I'll need-
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.520
I got it don't worry
I'll be right there.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.852
Okay blue bricks plus red
bricks plus Walter, tires.

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:17.155
Okay.

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:18.213
Quick we need blue bricks.

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:24.317
&gt;&gt; Walter, Walter, Walter,
we need red bricks.

00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:29.943
My god [NOISE].

00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:31.003
Let's go.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.055
&gt;&gt; You need tires?

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:40.647
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; All right, let's do it.

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:42.027
&gt;&gt; Let's go, okay.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.790
Okay.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.180
He's got the red bricks.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.940
We got wheels right here.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.280
We got the other bricks right here.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.223
Okay, are we good?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're good.

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:58.664
&gt;&gt; Okay, I gotta go back to work.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brittany.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:04.526
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; So

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:07.490
that was a fun little skit to make.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.320
But dependency injection is an important
architectural software pattern, and

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.780
I want to make sure you
understand what's happening.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.380
Instead of being in charge of all
of the bricks and the tires myself,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.300
I just depended on these outside
resources to be provided to me.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.470
Brittany, the injector
in our real life app,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.130
knows where all of the information and
services are.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.880
Whenever an app needs some service or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.990
information it tells
the injector its requirements.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.990
Then the injector fetches
those requirements and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.090
provides them to the calling code.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.660
Then the code uses those
services to accomplish its task.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.981
Dependency injection is
heavily used in Angular.

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.942
We'll make use of it ourselves in
the next video on Angular services.
