00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.680
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.470
Good morning.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.550
Thank you so much for attending
our literacy conference today

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.260
here on reading promotion in the
battle to keep people reading.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.290
It's great to see all of you
thanks to our participants

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.250
as well as our attendees.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.630
It's my pleasure to introduce
to you the new director

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.510
of the Center for the
Book, John Van Oudenaren.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.560
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.860
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Thank you, Guy.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.290
Welcome to all of you here.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.070
I'm new as you know to
this Center for the Book,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.180
so I' going to be
learning from all of you.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.470
I follow in the illustrious
footsteps of John Cole,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.770
who I believe is here.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.480
And [applause]-- And I
benefited from the help

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.780
of Becky Clark [assumed
spelling]

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440
who has been enormously helpful
in this transition period and,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.970
of course, Guy [applause]
who has organized this event.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.270
I like the title.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.280
I don't know who came up with
that but reading promotion

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.930
in the battle to
keep people reading,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.250
those of us who worked a
lot with Dr. Billington

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.580
over the years, he always
talked about battle plans.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.910
I don't know whether-- I haven't
worked enough with Dr. Hayden,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.520
you know, whether
she uses that phrase,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.250
but Dr. Billington would always
say we need a battle plan

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.870
for this and a battle
plan for that.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.010
So if it's a battle to
keep people reading,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.030
one of the things I would think
would be possibly emerging

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.660
from this meeting would be
something like a battle plan

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.570
or at least elements that
would go into a battle plan.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.690
So it should be a
very interesting day.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.140
This conference is an
outgrowth of the Library

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.200
of Congress Literacy Awards
which are now in their 6th year.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.670
And the Literacy Awards are made
possible by the generous giving

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.970
of David Rubenstein, who's
one of the leading patrons

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.620
of the Library of Congress.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.220
So we want to acknowledge his
help even though he is not here

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.540
this morning.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.630
And we also want to
give special thanks

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.740
to the Advisory Board
of Literacy Awards.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.160
They will be meeting
tomorrow, but I think most

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.890
of the members are here
this morning as well

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.650
and will be participating
today [applause].

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.430
I also want to say a few words
to introduce Dawn Stitzel.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.180
Dawn Stitzel is the new program
manager for the Literacy Awards.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.350
And I think a lot of you have
already had some email contact

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.400
with her especially the
members of the Advisory Board.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
But maybe if Dawn is around
maybe she could say a few words?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:25.240
[ Applause ]

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.540
&gt;&gt; Dawn Stitzel:
Thank you, John.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.840
And it's a pleasure to be here.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.710
I've been recently
given the responsibility

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.660
of overseeing the Literacy
Awards program for the Center

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.510
for the Book and the
Library of Congress.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.280
I've been on the job
about five weeks.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.960
And so-- So today, I'm
actually here as a guest.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.550
Today's event was planned
by Guy and other folks

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.850
at the Center for the Book.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.100
And I'm just sort of soaking it
in and look forward to speaking

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.270
with you throughout the day
to kind of think of ways

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.000
that we can amplify the impact

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.910
of the Literacy Awards
program moving forward.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.920
And I'm just so grateful for
all the help I've received

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.430
from the Advisory Board members
who I've had a great deal

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.600
of contact with already and
also a special call out to,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.590
excuse me, Becky Clark who's
been fantastic in helping

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.870
in the transition of
conveying the information over.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.850
So, again, yeah, reach
out to me [applause].

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.150
Please reach out to me

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.810
if I don't have a
chance to speak with you.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.510
Again, I really want to talk
about ways and get ideas

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.810
for our moving forward.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.610
Thank you.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.980
[ Applause ]

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.280
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Thanks, Dawn.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700
Well, I think with that, we
can probably get started,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.130
turn it over to Guy who will
be or MC for this morning

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.990
and who will do whatever
additional thank yous are

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.540
necessary and called
for with regard

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.850
to all the people
who've made this happen.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.350
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Thanks, John.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.650
Thanks, John.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.970
OK. We're going to get started.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.610
We have a first panel today,
which is going to be moderated

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.070
by Lesley Farmer of the Library

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.170
of Congress Literacy
Awards Advisory Board.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.250
She's also a professor,
College of Education

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.340
at California State University,
standing committee on literacy

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.660
in the International Federation
of Library Associations.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.940
Please welcome, Lesley
Farmer who will introduce you

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.510
to the rest of the panelists.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.290
[ Applause ]

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:36.360
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: So I'd like
the panelists to come on up now.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.050
Thank you for being here for
helping to spread the word

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.120
about literacy and
not only that,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.610
but take really important
action and efforts to make sure

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.920
that everyone has the
opportunity to read

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.120
and be able then to
improve all of our society.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.610
OK. So we'll have each
our distinguished folks

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.810
introduce themselves.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.110
There we go.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.520
So we'll start with Lois Bridges
of just a couple of words

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.920
about why you're here.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.150
&gt;&gt; Lois Bridges: Well, It's a
tremendous honor to be here.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.830
Hi everyone, I'm Lois Bridges.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.670
And I'm the VP publisher
of Scholastic Professional.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.310
And I have the deep
honor of serving

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.010
on the Literacy Awards program.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.310
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: [Inaudible].

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.610
Hello. I'm Loreiene Roy.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.730
I'm a professor at the
School of Information,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.730
University of Texas at Austin.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.450
I'm Anishinabe enrolled on
the White Earth Reservation,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.750
member of the Minnesota
Chipewa Tribe and I'm also

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.310
on the Advisory Board.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen:
I'm Steve Krashen.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.380
And I'm kind of depressed
[laughter].

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.340
Yesterday on the metro, a young
lady offered me her chair,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.640
her seat.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.300
I'll get over this.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.880
Anyway, I want to explain one
of the things that's on my bio.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.420
It says I have a black
belt in Taekwondo.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.750
It's true, but I
got it on the basis

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.970
of the written examination,
so much for literacy.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.400
Yesterday at union station, a
young man hit me up for a dollar

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.330
that was OK, and we
had a conversation.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.590
He said the best-- I
didn't tell him what I did,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.360
I didn't tell him why I was
here nothing, the best thing

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.880
that happened to him in
prison, the prison library.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.760
Howard-- He said,
You've ever heard

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.640
of Howard's Inn [laughter]?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.310
Isn't that wonderful?

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.610
We're doing good work.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.220
Let's keep it up [applause].

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.520
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: So I suppose
if we're going to battle

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.660
with words, we've got a tai chi
expert right here [laughter].

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.430
So I really want to take
advantage of this brief time

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.830
and understand we are not going

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.490
to be doing the full Howard's
Inn or equivalent of a nation

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.220
of readers, but at least we want

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.380
to just start opening the
windows, the doors in terms

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.740
of some of the issues
because that's something

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.560
that we should be talking
about all our lives.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.780
So first we kind of like to get
the idea of like what are some

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.720
of the facts out there

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.860
and fortunately you also
have a wonderful publication

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.310
by Scholastic that
gives you, you know,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.240
some of the background
information.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.270
So Lois is going
to just start us

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.430
out with getting the framework.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.730
&gt;&gt; Lois Bridges: OK.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:37.760
Well, on your table as Lesley
said you should see the sixth

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:50.740
edition of the Scholastic' "Kid
and Family Reading Report".

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.890
This comes out every other year.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.630
And I'm just going
to highlight a few

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.930
of the key findings for you.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.230
Let's see.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.900
Let's automatically go-- I
just want to mention that if

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:11.870
for the sixth edition, we
survey 2,700 families and kids,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.600
it is a nationally
representative sample

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.320
and the people that we
interview didn't know

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.340
that we were with Scholastic.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.650
And the idea behind this
report really is to try

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:34.040
to understand the attitudes
and the behaviors of families

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.670
as they connect with reading.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.780
So the first thing I want

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.920
to mention is the critical
importance of choice.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.170
It turns out that choice,
the books that we choose

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.130
to read reflect your agency
and identity as a reader.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.430
And I think that all
makes sense to us.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.730
Those of us with rich reading
lives have a clear sense

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.030
of the kinds of books
that we like to read,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.330
the authors that we
love, the genres we like.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.630
And that's a big part
of discovering yourself

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.930
as a leader, as a young child.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.230
So we were happy to see that
when it comes to reading

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.530
for fun, 63% of kids
say they get

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.830
to choose their books for fun.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:06.180
Let me turn to my-- And in
response to the statement--

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.480
oops, [inaudible],
lined up with the--

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:14.810
I am more likely to finish
reading a book that I picked

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.210
out myself, 88% say yes.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.910
If I get to choose the book
myself I'm more interested in it

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.500
and I'm going to
finish reading it.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.590
OK. Just a quick word about the
disparity of books in the home

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.020
and Stephen will likely
have different statistics,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.630
it'll be interesting.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.450
Scholastics found that the
average number of books

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:45.750
in the home were 104 but there
are almost twice as many books

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.830
in the homes of frequent readers
versus infrequent readers.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.350
And by frequent readers,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.740
I mean kids who are reading
every single day five

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.900
to seven days a week, moderate
readers one to four days a week

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.510
and infrequent readers
less than a day a week.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.100
So you can see that-- oh
and one thing I wanted

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.980
to mention is how did the books
get in the home to begin with?

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.350
And the number one reason is
because kids ask for the books.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.980
So you can see that if
you're a frequent reader,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.360
if you have a sense of yourself
as a reader you know what books

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.810
to ask your parents for.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.350
But and this of course
as Stephen will have lots

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.540
of information about this,
if you have the means

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.930
to purchase the books,
or you have access

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.290
to a public library that's
open, it's easier for you

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:48.420
to bring those books
into your home.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.950
So again, sorry, got wind up,

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.820
reading frequency
is largely steady.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.700
There's a slight drop

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.550
in frequent readers
from 2010 to 2016.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.850
That's good news.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.130
We here so much about how
kids no longer like to read.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.200
And that's not what
we found at all.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:16.450
In 2010, maybe 37% of
kids thought that reading

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.300
for fun was very important.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.610
It did drop slightly to
32% but for the most part,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.700
kids are reading
and enjoy reading.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.130
What about kids use on
the importance of reading.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.540
Again, it's holding steady.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:46.460
In fact it even went
up a bit in 2010,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:53.190
only 50% thought
it was important

00:12:53.190 --> 00:13:02.760
and 2016 that went up to 55%.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.140
So that' good.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:13.640
And I will say that we are
keeping our eye on younger teens

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.160
because we did notice that
in terms of their interest

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:25.190
in reading books for fun,
there has been a drop.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:32.270
In 2010, 61% enjoyed
reading books for fun.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:39.270
And that dropped to 50% in 2016.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.580
So we're going to keep our eye--

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.160
we're actually in a process
right now putting together

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.460
another report.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.840
And that's a group we really
want to check in with.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.640
OK. Now, this is
something interesting.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.760
Fifty-seven percent
of kids, age six to 17

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.270
who are infrequent readers
say it's hard for them

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.870
to find books they like to read.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.680
And that makes sense
if you don't read,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.980
you don't necessarily--

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.280
you haven't necessarily
established an identity

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.580
as a reader.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.880
And so, you-- you know, it's
hard for you to find books

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.180
that you like to read.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:24.170
And I'm reminded of a quote I
like a lot from James Paterson.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.000
You may recognized him as--

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.090
actually, I think he
is the number one--

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.300
he has more books on the New
York Times' Best Seller list

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.870
than any other author ever.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.060
And he said that
there is no such thing

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.890
as a kid who hates reading.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.290
There are kids who love
to read and there are kids

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.980
who just haven't found
the right book yet.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.720
And so, it's our responsibility

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.660
to help kids find
the right books.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.410
And one quick little
story, Annie Ward,

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.190
assistant superintendent of
Mamaroneck School District,

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:11.100
which is just north of New
York City is doing something

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.400
so fabulous.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.340
I just have to tell
real quickly.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:21.660
How many of you are
familiar with Stitch Fix?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.330
Does anyone in here heard that?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:30.180
You fill out a profile of
the kinds of clothes you

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.450
like to read and then they put
together a custom box for you.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.130
Well, in Mamaroneck district,
the kids are filling out list

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:46.030
of the kinds of books they
like to read and working

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.580
with the librarian, volunteers
are putting together custom,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:57.230
I could almost cry,
custom book boxes that show

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.750
up at the kid's house.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.160
Can you imagine how
amazing that is?

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.470
So those kids are going to begin
to regard themselves as readers.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.770
Let's see.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:14.290
Oh yeah, so-- but this is
interesting parents even though

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:19.150
kids know that it's hard
for them to find books,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.540
parents haven't quite
caught up with that.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.720
Forty-one percent of
all kids said it is hard

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.020
to find books to read.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.540
Only 29% of parents
seem to realize that.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.840
So that's what we need
to pay more attention to.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.790
And then just quick
update on Reading Aloud

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.320
because that's really
how it all begins, right,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.220
really good news
about Reading Aloud.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:52.380
Five quick points, first of
all, more parents are beginning

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.580
to read to kids from
the moment of birth.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:07.660
So that's gone up in just--
since 2014 from 30% of parents

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:14.470
who are doing that, now 40% are.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.360
Also they're reading everyday
of the week, not just once

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.300
in a while but everyday
of the week.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.610
And they're reading more books,

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:28.320
not just one book
that multiple copies.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.560
Now we do find that as kids
get older, usually age five

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.910
or age eight, parents, you know,
the kids are reading themselves,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.830
so parents think they don't
need to read to them anymore,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.650
so it tends to diminish.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.310
But the good news is
that it's going on--

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.960
oh, and choice as we
talked about choice,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.150
right from the very beginning,
little guys are getting

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.450
to choose their own books.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.750
So that's good.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.050
And the word on reading aloud,
why do people like to do it,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.350
because it is an absolutely
exquisite way to spend time

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.650
with your child and
it's just such great fun

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.950
to share books that you love.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.250
And then one last slide
on this summer slide

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.550
and I'm sure Stephen has
information about that.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.850
But we found that on average
of kids who are reading

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.150
about eight books a year, I mean
eight books over the summer,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.450
excuse me, but it really
depends on your means.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.750
So kids from families where they
have less may not be reading

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.050
books at all over the
summer, 21% no books at all.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.350
If you come from
a family of means,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.650
then only 8% are
not reading books.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.950
So income level makes
a huge difference.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.250
And I just can't with this
sharing one beautiful quote

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.550
from a parents in Texas.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.850
She said, "You're never alone
if you have a good book.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.150
A good story, fiction
or nonfiction,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.450
can open up the imagination
for problem solving

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.750
and critical thinking,
or just for working

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.050
through the tough spots in life.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.350
A truly good story sucks you in,
and opens up a whole new world."

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.650
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: Great.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.950
Thank you so much.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.250
&gt;&gt; Lois Bridges: Yeah.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.550
[ Applause ]

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.850
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: So know
there's also some great research

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.250
that Dr. Krashen has,
himself, you know,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.450
conducted as well
as synthesized.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.570
And if you didn't have a chance
to get his three-page synthesis

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.940
up at the break,
you can do that.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.630
So there's a lot
of facts out there.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.400
And now we want to
tell the story

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.250
of why we have this
particular reading habits

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.330
and how we can improve
that situation.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.380
And it can be as simple
as students that--

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.460
and young people not even
understanding the term reading.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.890
If they think that reading means
just, you know, the textbook

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.160
and a basal one, you
can see why, you know,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.350
some students may say,
I don't like to read

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.770
or I'm not a reader
where, you know,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:11.130
they haven't really been
told that book is, hey,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.680
reading is everywhere, it's
your billboard, it's your menu,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.380
it's your game and instructions.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.960
So just reconceptualizing,
reading is a really good start

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.990
but again, Dr. Krashen
has lots of info.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.620
So we're going to be doing as
to kind of a whip between him

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:34.860
and Dr. Roy in terms of what's
one factor in this situation

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.690
and how do we address it.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.210
So, Dr. Krashen, you can start.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: OK.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.090
Michael and Greg, could
you guys do me a favor?

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.740
One per customer, three sheets.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.040
Pass it around.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.340
Right there.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.640
Thank you.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.990
Earn your salary, OK?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.290
Good. OK. Good.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.110
We're supposed to
talk about one thing.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.410
I have a formula.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.920
And the formula is on
the top of the handout,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.530
which you don't have a copy of.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.810
The big deal is poverty,
poverty, poverty.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.430
Martin Luther King, "We are
likely to find that the problems

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.730
of housing and education,

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.440
instead of preceding the
elimination of poverty,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.210
will themselves be affected if
poverty is first abolished."

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.060
Everything that has happened
since Dr. King said this

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.330
in 1967, every last bit
of research supports this

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.580
from many, many different
directions.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.150
Poverty means less
access to books.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.300
Less access to books means
not much reading is happening.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.720
The more reading you do,
the more literate you get.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.020
This is my formula.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.320
Thank you very much.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.250
I'll see you next-- oh,
let me give you the rest.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.640
Let me do the first part.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.790
Poverty means less
access to books.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.090
People living in poverty
as Lois has reported

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.510
from the Scholastic data that
far less access to books--

00:20:52.510 --> 00:21:31.170
[ Inaudible ]

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.880
-- middle class communities

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.800
to poor communities
in Philadelphia.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.780
Poor children have practically
no access to books anywhere.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.790
Good section on libraries,
public libraries

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.330
in the middle income schools
were open more evening,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.570
state open longer far
more juvenile books.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.380
Wonderful quote from
Neuman and Celano.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.330
[Inaudible] I'll read aloud,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.730
"Children in middle-income
neighborhoods were likely

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.250
to be deluged with books.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.240
However, children from poor
neighborhoods would have

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.240
to aggressively and
persistently seek them out."

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.860
I'm just giving you a few
examples from a vast literature.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.340
The more access to books
contrary to popular1 opinion,

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.730
the more children read.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.610
Oh let's not give them books,
they won't read them anyway.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.290
Well, you've seen what happens
when the new box of books comes

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.840
to the fourth grade class,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.560
the children rush
to see what's there.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.160
The research confirms
this, some reading,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.700
children who live closer

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.500
to libraries do more
reading over the summer.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.050
I got the date wrong on this,
on your sheet, it says 1985,

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.150
it's 1975 and it's the
heroic Barbara Heinz

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.140
who did the first study of
this summer slump and is one

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.990
of the absolute best studies.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.340
Our study, my former
student Francisco Ramos,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.030
this is our second
best known paper,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.350
our first best known paper which
I'm sure you've read is called

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.780
"Arnold's Advantages: How Arnold
Schwarzenegger Acquire English".

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.300
And what he said he did

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.770
which were two different
things, OK, enough gossip.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.260
Who was it that said, "If you
don't have anything good to say

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.080
about someone, sit next to me"?

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.940
That was Alice Roosevelt,
Theodore Roosevelt's daughter.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.340
Anyway, Francisco taught in
a school, elementary school

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.440
where they're high
poverty, very few books

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.620
but there was a public
library close by.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.120
He organized a group of second

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.330
and third grade teachers
including himself

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.790
and they made one trip

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.010
to the library before
the library opened.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.910
The librarians were very
cooperative, get this,

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.460
you better sit down and
I'm going to tell you this.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:42.380
The librarian allowed each
child to take out ten books.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.930
Wow. Isn't this wonderful?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.770
They immediately had
a classroom library.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.480
Three weeks after the visit,
they talked to the kids,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.780
they talked to the parents.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.660
Kids are reading more, 62% said
that parents were very impressed

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.930
with the children's increase
in interest in reading.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.180
They have notice improvement
to child's reading,

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.080
more time with books and most
important, they ask the parent

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.300
to take them back
to the library, OK?

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.630
OK. I'm halfway done.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.470
I'll be done by 6:30
at the rate I'm going.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.160
Part three, more
reading, more literacy.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.660
And this has dominated
my life since the 1980s.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.590
Study after study
shows self-selected--

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.950
absolutely right,
Scholastic, thank you.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.260
Self selected reading,
narrow reading,

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.120
reading that you choose,
that's your taste, OK,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.620
usually includes
a lot of fiction.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.830
I have really gotten more
interested in fiction

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.310
over the last few years,
appreciated its impact.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.030
The US government,
their official position,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.870
No Child Left Behind, then other
scenes against children says

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.330
that what we want
is more nonfiction.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.260
They never produced any
data but I think I know why.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.200
I'm kind of like Lily
Tomlin these days,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.400
my cynicism is having a hard
time keeping up with the times.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.420
Why do they want nonfiction?

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.340
It's easier to test.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.060
And that's where the money is.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.610
That is my suspicion.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.640
But fiction is fantastic
as we will see.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.370
By the way, I was just thinking
as Lois was giving her thing

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.650
about self selection, why
you got to do it yourself?

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.980
Do you like getting
books as gifts?

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.670
I don't. Gifts are
assigned reading.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.150
I never want to read them.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.260
Van, again, has a
paragraph about this.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.910
He says, I walked by my shelf
and there are all these books

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.210
that people have given me.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.210
They knew I was in
English Lit major,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.010
so I get a lot of
Jane Austen, OK?

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:45.850
And I see the books staring down
at me, making me feel guilty.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.160
That is good evidence why
reading should be self selected.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.260
Unless it's my son, he really
knows what I should be reading,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.700
no question, I trust him.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.990
I want to give you a couple of
studies which are just a tip

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.980
of the iceberg, lots and lots.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.080
A study from the UK, University

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.650
of London has been doing
this long-term study looking

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.500
at people since they
were infants.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.030
The last time they tested them
was a couple of years ago.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.330
They were 42 years old.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.230
They gave them a test to
vocabulary, native speakers

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.780
of English, then
looked at predictors.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.730
The best predictor, of course,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.200
was how much reading
you're doing now.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.970
They statistically
controlled for how they did

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.250
on previous questionnaires, how
much reading vocabulary size

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.660
when they were 16,
whether they were read to.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.630
Yeah. Those things counted
but that wasn't the cause,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.040
they controlled for all that and
you still got a powerful effect.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.020
When I get to be 42, I'm
going to start reading,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.630
let me tell you, this is great.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.000
He was independent
of their occupation,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.710
their parent's occupation
whether they went to college

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.260
or not, it's reading
that counts.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.850
The best predictor,
reading high brow

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.750
and middle brow was
a better predictor

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.610
than low brow-- than nonfiction.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.440
Here we go, a point for fiction.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.380
A study I co-authored with
my colleague, Beniko Mason

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.890
who teaches at University
of Japan.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.370
Her students were engaged in
self selected reading program

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.240
and she helped them
find the books et cetera

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.810
under the condition that they
take pretest and post-test

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.940
on a standardized
examination called the TOEIC.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.560
Here's what she found, for
every hour you read, you gain,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.570
we now think 0.7 points on this
test, which means you can go

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.490
from zero to 60 in two years.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.790
You can become a--

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.310
from a mediocre level
just about to the top.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.760
If you do it three years,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.730
you've got what they
call academic English.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.030
You've done it.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.620
So sit down with a
nice cup of coffee,

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.250
which is also good
for your brain.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.330
Read a book in another language

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.570
and you will make
great progress more

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.020
than doing test preparation
classes.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.210
OK. That's what a reading does
but it gives you other things.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.680
People who read more know
more about everything.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.390
Of course, they know
more about literature,

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.050
they know about history,
science,

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.090
they have more practical
knowledge.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.510
This is a research team headed

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.200
up by Keith Stanovich
of Michigan.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.950
We have other cases like
this, kids would say,

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.900
they only did well in school

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.740
because they had
access to books.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.950
The two cases-- I'll just
read you the details on one.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.450
Two cases are both very high
poverty, very difficult times,

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.210
they found a source of books.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.610
Here's Elizabeth Murray

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.580
who actually was a
subject of a special on TV.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.780
Very poor neighborhood, she
eventually went on the Harvard.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.920
I'll just tell you the story.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.800
Her dad had a very
interesting habit.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.860
He would go the public
libraries all around New York,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.310
New York area, get
a library card,

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.560
take out all the books he
could and never return them.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.070
And those days the libraries
weren't connected by computers.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.430
From library after library,
the house was filled

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.100
with fugitive books
from all over the city.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.290
Elizabeth said that
when she was in school,

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.130
she played hockey
most of the time.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.610
She only went to
school toward the end,

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.050
so she could see what was
on the test and she said,

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.860
this is how I sneak by
from grade to grade.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.320
Geoffrey Canada, Harvard
children's-- how--

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.690
Harlem Children's
Zone, same story.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.270
He got books from a buddy
of his and from his mom,

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.330
they were the source and this is
why he said he did OK in school.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:24.980
So reading gives you better
language, gives you knowledge

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.060
and it also gives you what
we call habits of mind.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.930
This is a stuff that's just come
out in the last couple of years,

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.400
big article about it
in Scientific American,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.970
I was very happy to see that.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.960
People who read more have
more empathy for others.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.690
Fiction reading is
what does that.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.020
You go through other
people's experiences

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.490
and you see the world
for how complex it is.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.650
You don't rush for
simple solutions.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.340
With that in mind, let
me show you a letter

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.540
to the editor that I published.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.080
In the Washington Post last
month, I was amazed it got in.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.530
They had article after article
about Donald Trump's spelling.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.940
And they blamed it
on poor proofreading,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.240
two articles in a row.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.430
And one, you know,
they have one--

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.050
people said why you're
picking on him, blah, blah.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.800
Well, here's my letter.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.280
My letter says, poor
spelling is indication

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.650
of more serious problems.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.230
Mr. Trump's mistakes
reflect problems deeper

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.020
than a failure to proofread.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.710
My research shows, poor
spelling is often the result

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.800
of not having a reading
habit and those

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.530
who read more know a lot more
about history and science.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.500
They have greater empathy
with other and understand

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.460
that the world is complex.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.730
Mr. Trump is a perfect
example of a nonreader.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.310
I rest my case.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.050
You're supposed to burst
under wild applause.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.140
I'm sorry, you've missed that.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.440
Come on, give me a break here.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.740
OK [applause].

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.830
All right.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:51.540
I've been writing him
nearly everyday on Twitter,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.670
and Betsy Devos constantly.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.450
It's going nowhere but at
least my followers see it.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:02.320
To summarize all these
into bigger picture,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.780
I claim poverty means
less access, less access,

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.760
less reading and more
reading more literacy.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.380
The last set of studies I'm
going to show you, I think,

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.890
are the most important
studies I've ever been part of.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.150
I did-- I was part
of a research team

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.550
with my two former students
Syying Lee in Taiwan

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.010
and Jeff McQuillan
in the United States.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.330
We looked at predictors
of both the NAEP exam

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.690
and the PIRLS exam.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.330
These are standardized test
giving the lots of kids.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.150
And we did what we called
multivariate analysis,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.450
which is [inaudible].

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.700
It's called Multiple Regression.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.580
For both of you who remember
you statistics class,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.310
here's what we can do in this.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.250
We can look at the
influence of predictors

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.650
as if they're not correlated
as if they're independent

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.270
with statistical magic.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.230
On the NAEP examination,
poverty, yes,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.450
high poverty means
lower NAEP scores,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.710
no question, very strong.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.780
If you put into the equation,
access to books, public library

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.150
and school library,
the access factor

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.220
in the first studies we
did were actually stronger.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.630
Access can make up for
the effective poverty.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.630
You should be staring
open mouth.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.450
OK. This is amazing.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.650
We did the same and then
we replicated our results.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:21.110
We did the same thing with this
international PIRLS test given

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.710
to kids in 40 countries
over the world played

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.300
up in the newspapers.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.410
[Inaudible] the results
should be published

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.230
in the sports section, all
right, who won, et cetera.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.990
Well, we found the same
results over and over again.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.110
The biggest predictor,
of course, poverty.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:42.340
If you add a library, a school
library of 500 books, nearly,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.590
as strong as the
effect of poverty.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.070
In other words, it helps
balance the effect.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.790
Kids in high poverty
don't read well

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.710
because they don't
have access to books.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.840
You have the school library,
they read a lot better.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.390
We also found in all our studies
that the effect of instruction

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.980
of various kinds,
early instruction,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.490
late instruction was
either negative or nothing.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.710
This is what's counted.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.050
Finally, a few more random
facts that support all these.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.580
When you statistically--

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.440
When researchers statistically
control for the effect

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.270
of poverty, American
test scores are nearly

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.910
at the top of the world.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.770
There's nothing wrong
with our teachers.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.370
We can always improve,
we know that.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.860
Nothing wrong with our schools,
it's not unions, it is poverty

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.000
and lack of access to books.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.830
So what can we do about this?

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.130
Two things.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.430
And I think they're
both wonderful.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.180
The first one is what
Dr. King recommended,

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.200
which is not radical right
or left wing communism,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.240
it's common sense, reduce and
eventually eliminate poverty.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.390
This means full employment
at way--

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:51.510
jobs that pay a decent wage
that people can live from.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.810
This is radical.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.110
No, it isn't.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.300
Number two, until that
happens, protect children

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.760
from the impact of poverty.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.270
That means three things in my
opinion, at least, number one,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.380
food deprivation,
good breakfast,

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.880
good lunch in school and,
of course, espresso machine

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.670
in the teacher's
lounge [laughter].

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.450
Yes. OK. Number two,
health care.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:20.780
David Berliner, his studies high
income areas have more school

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.420
nurses per child than
low income schools.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.720
You all know this.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.720
And it's not the crazy things,
it's not the exotic things,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.050
it's things like
getting dental care,

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.690
making sure that kids have
glasses when they need them.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.070
The ordinary every day stuff.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:39.870
Number three, invest in school
libraries and school librarians

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.440
which independently show
better results for literacy.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.360
Our hero here Keith.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.030
I want to mention two heroes,
one is Keith Curry Lance.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.330
You know who he is?

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.280
Check out Keith Curry Lance, OK?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.070
He is-- I call him
the "Golden Boy

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.750
of the American School
Library, so with good reason.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.250
He's been doing this
stuff for years

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.710
and it's all very
interesting research.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:10.210
The other hero, commenting on
Read-Aloud is Jim Trelease,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.050
the Read-Aloud handbook.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:17.830
My-- Let me tell me about
my mom and Jim Trelease, OK?

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.650
My mom and I had a
perfect relationship.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.220
Let me tell you, I
am my mother's son,

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.540
you know, I love that.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.970
But, I'm my mother's
son, no question.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.760
She thought I was wonderful.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.450
She loved the way
I gave speeches.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.850
She loved my writing.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.230
I had a copy of the
riddle out handbook

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.070
in the office and
she borrowed it.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.460
She gave it back to me and
you know what she said?

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.110
Stephen, why can't you
write like this [laughter]?

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.560
I wish I could.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.550
This guy has done more good
for libraries and reading

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.960
than any single person.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.910
And we need to get
people to read his book.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.210
It's still wonderful.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.670
Post script as Lois
mentioned, there is no evidence

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.290
for serious decline in reading.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.590
Everybody keeps saying it,
close look at the data.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:00.280
You see little blips
here and there.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.720
Here's my analysis which
I responded to the feds

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.740
on these several times when
they have this, you know,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.600
horrible articles about how
kids aren't reading anymore,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.900
et cetera.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.470
Here's a comparison.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.560
One of many we've done comparing
in 1946 report and a 2010 report

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.550
on how many minutes a
day kids are reading.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.110
Kids are reading, people
are reading the same number

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:27.980
of books, minutes per day of
reading as they did in 1945.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.040
Fewer magazines and newspapers
everybody knows this, OK,

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:39.470
but more websites which we now
have, total just about the same.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:43.490
There has been no serious
decline in reading.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.470
The problem is poverty.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.270
Thank you.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:59.010
[ Applause ]

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.310
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: [Inaudible].

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:07.120
Hello. So reading across tribal
nations is rather impossible

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.870
really to talk about these 560
federally recognized tribes,

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.280
a 100 plus tribes recognized
by state governments,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.050
just as difficult,
if not impossible

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.720
to generalize about
Indian people.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.970
It's also difficult and not
impossible to take one topic

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.990
or issue such as literacy

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.750
and describe how
it's being addressed

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.740
across hundreds of nations.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.490
That said, let's do it any way.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:39.920
Reading, let's look at what
traditional knowledge might be.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.680
So, using that as a background
to talk about reading,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.000
what is traditional knowledge?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.400
It's important to first
consider what is learning

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.700
in Indian country.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.260
Traditional knowledge
created over time,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.310
passed down over generations,

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.960
developed by the community via
living, evolving and growing.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.670
So that within tribal
communities,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.470
learning involves a lifetime

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.510
of acquiring knowledge
of indigenous ways.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.460
Indigenous ways are the
traditional life ways

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.390
of the original peoples also
called world view and approach

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.230
to conducting everyday life,
interaction with others

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.290
and philosophical or
religious perspectives.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.800
The heart of efforts
to support learning

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.690
and reading is the
complete intersection

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.530
between cultural protocols
of indigenous peoples

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.030
and professional values
in holding, collecting,

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:36.170
providing access and
using indigenous material

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.410
in intellectual content.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.650
Work with tribal nations
should be entered respectfully

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.770
and in ways that support
indigenous world view.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.450
And we might ask question such
as with their focus on English

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.820
in the printed word, art
libraries, archives and museums

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.650
as institution seen
by tribal communities

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.490
as agents of colonization.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.060
Is literacy an active
decolonization?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.110
The process of removal of the
results of the colonization

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:11.140
and the return of control to
indigenous peoples can support

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.700
for reading, take steps
to rectify any adherence

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.540
to colonial practices
and attitudes.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.270
And thus reading material
perpetuate harmful stereotypes

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.880
to libraries, for example,

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.610
represent formal educational
institutions similar

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.490
to boarding schools that
restricted as acceptable forms

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.590
of knowledge and
depressed native language

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.370
and other cultural expressions?

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:41.220
Note though that in the 10 years
or running a service initiative

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.550
with my students, if I can
read, I can do anything,

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.940
I never heard a native
parent ask me

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.250
to not bring English language
books to their children schools.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.640
We delivered 100,000 new books

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.160
over the 10 years
we ran the project.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.330
What do we know about
reading and ending country?

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.520
In 1919, there was a study
by the US National Commission

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.730
on Libraries and
Information Science

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.620
and they found significant
barriers and limited access

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.820
to library services by
American-Indians due to both

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.840
to cultural differences and lack

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.450
of culturally appropriate
resources.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.320
In 2007, just last year,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.230
Dr. Anthony Chow
conducted an evaluation

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.930
for the Montana State
Library in their LSTA Program.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.650
And he found that barriers
to library services

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.910
for tribal members still exist.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.350
There was little to
know convenient access

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.970
to either a public or
tribal college library.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.970
There was little support and
awareness of libraries across--

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.880
among tribal members because
their services were not

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.250
typically a feature of
their indigenous world view.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.250
No work with tribal
communities, the challenges

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.870
to engage adolescent,
children and youth older

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.720
within elementary school age.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.550
Chow also found that
racial tension experienced

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.150
by tribal members
visiting public libraries

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.230
in bordering tribal
territory and the lack

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.290
of financial resources for
tribal college librarians

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:13.670
to prioritize early
literacy programing.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.210
What's happening in Indian
country, there are hundreds

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.520
of tribal libraries and
archives, they exist in villages

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.890
in Alaska, pueblos in New Mexico
and the Everglades, in Florida,

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:27.280
in the Woodlands of Wisconsin,
Minnesota and Michigan.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.880
Reading takes place and is
supported amidst the challenges.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.970
These include tribal community
libraries that might serve

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.280
as the public library, school
library, archive records,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.230
museum and language center.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.960
Tribal college libraries are
often the public libraries

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.290
of their communities as well.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.330
And they are reading
advocates and champions.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.300
Tribal college librarians
gather to share their stories

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.790
for one week, each year
in Bozeman, Montana.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.150
American-Indian Library
Association Members advocate

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.070
and meet during the American
Library Association midwinter

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.430
meeting and the annual
conference.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.640
And every two years,
a number is drawn

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.060
to the International
Indigenous Librarians' Forum,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.660
which we'll note as 20th
anniversary in February 2019

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.750
in Auckland [inaudible]
in New Zealand.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.520
We see new support for
reading through the recipients

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.050
of funding through the Institute
of Museum and Library Services.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.470
Tribal libraries may receive
basic grants and may compete

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.640
for enhancement grants and
deadlines are available

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.340
at the imls.gov website.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.870
A few weeks ago, we had learned

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.610
that the IMLS will be funding a
one-year planning grant called

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.460
Reading Nation, that will
support the following efforts,

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.930
the Blackfeet Tribal College
Library in collaboration

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.100
with the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro,

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.400
Department of Library

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.760
and Information Studies
will do a number of things.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.970
They're going to establish
an advisory committee

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:59.040
to help design a study of how
children, youth and families

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.550
of the Blackfeet Nation
currently use library services.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.570
They're going to work with
that Advisory Committee

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.720
to conduct an environmental scan
to understand the current state

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.210
and potential factors
impacting tribal member use

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.910
of library services.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:19.740
And then design a pilot test,
a community assessment process

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.010
that identifies the
needs and challenges

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.190
that tribal members
face in using public

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.550
and community college
libraries with a specific focus

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.390
on children and use services.

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.850
Our data collection
starts in early July

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.380
when the team including Dr.
Anthony Chow from the University

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.790
of North Carolina at Greensboro.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.920
Ms. Aaron LaFromboise, Blackfeet
Community College tribal

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.870
librarian and Blackfeet tribal
member and myself will meet

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.560
in Browning, Montana
during the annual powwow.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.290
We will address this
research question,

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.420
how might libraries collaborate

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.230
in creating a reading
supportive environment

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.660
for Blackfeet children,
youth and their caregivers?

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.790
What is the current state

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.010
of library services among
Blackfeet Tribal Members both on

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.830
and off the reservation?

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.310
What are the unique needs
and barriers to access

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:17.890
to library services for tribal
members with an emphasis again

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.580
on children, youth and families?

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.100
And what are the
potential challenges faced

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.670
by public libraries
in understanding

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.330
and meeting those needs

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.400
in culturally sensitive
and appropriate ways?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.280
We're following a
mix method approach

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.840
of qualitative interviews,
focused group,

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.790
surveys disseminated by print,
smartphone text and online.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.400
Participants were recruited
using convenience sampling,

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.520
collecting data at
the annual powwow,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.630
stratified in purposeful
sampling

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.420
and sharing a diverse
stratum of tribal members

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.950
and public librarians
and a random sample

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.540
of a 100 tribal members living
on or off the reservation.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.350
And we're currently
preparing to communicate

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:58.650
with our Advisory Board

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.420
in drafting the data
collection instruments.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.730
We'll have more to
share in a year.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.420
I'm going to close with
introducing just a couple

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.270
of cases that illustrate the
impact of writing and reading

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.880
and including and not including
in some cases native people.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.770
And there aren't
answers to these cases.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.750
I teach a class for the
University of Texas at Austin

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:22.540
and for the University of Hawaii
at Manoa on access and care

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.650
of traditional cultural
knowledge and we use this

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.090
as real examples of things
that actually I experienced.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.290
So, imagine you're
adding author's reception

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:35.610
at a conference and you're
asked by nonnative writer

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.780
about your endorsement of
their latest children's book.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.340
And the writer ask, tells you
that she went to the reservation

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.370
where the book is based
and could not find anyone

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.420
who could write the
book as well as she did

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.120
and how might you
respond to that question

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.500
and which I avoided for
three times around the room.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.540
And then had to face
the author and describe

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.740
at least what I thought
of that book.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.530
And you can-- I finally
had to say you're not going

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.100
to get a good review
and then that.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.580
So that kind of closed
that conversation.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.750
Let's say your professional
organization is creating a

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.530
product as a promotional
calendar, and each month

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.890
of the calendar is
going to feature.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.680
And you hope a native
writer and your approach

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.010
because you're the
president of that association,

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.320
and you will be president.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.390
And your approach is saying
this would be a wonderful thing

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.100
for you to advocate during
your year and is going to--

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.400
and I said that's great.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.880
Oh, the president--
whoever is asked.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.230
That's great.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.940
And because each page
will feature an author

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.900
that you're nominating, a native
writer, a native illustrator.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.710
And months later you get a call
saying, well, they've decided--

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.640
the committee decided to go with
Paul Goble whom you remember

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.690
as someone who did
received the Caldecott Award

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:46.130
but who wasn't native and
borrowed stories from a tribe.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.050
And you say that's
really too bad

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.420
because you can't endorse
the product anymore.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.800
And the product is featured

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.700
on your association's graphics
catalogue two months later

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.560
in the American Indian
Library Association, find out.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.320
And then the rest becomes
a story that's published

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.620
in a handbook.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.410
So, read what happens next.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.760
A friend of yours wants to
write a children's book,

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.730
former student and is located
a story from your tribe

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.910
in an old anthropological report
and tells you this is going

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.010
to be a great honoring
experience for her.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.660
And I asked who is going
to see the process?

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.990
And that ends that
conversation as well.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:27.110
And then a friend describes
visiting a reservation

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.470
in Northern Minnesota
where you have a connection

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.870
and it's everything that they
expected to see, old cards,

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.030
lots of dude, and lots of dogs.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.440
So, these are the source
of things that you face

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.060
and hear about, and
they are contemporary.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.430
They happen within our lifetime
and perhaps just last year.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.690
And they illustrate not only
what you need to support,

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:51.210
just general world view of
nonnative and native people,

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:54.520
but the sorts of barriers and
challenges and opportunities

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.880
that people have who
worked with native people

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.250
and with native children.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.450
And I will say miigwetch,
which is thank you.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:01.750
Chi-miigwetch.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.550
Thanks very much.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:11.520
[ Applause ]

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.690
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: I have to
understand that Loreiene speaks

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.460
from great experience.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.450
You can imagine how lucky the
American Library Association has

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.450
been as she has served

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:26.620
as a really effective
president for that.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.810
And I just want to
then thank you.

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.430
I mean, this is a really,
you know, great panel.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.620
I have to say that because I've
chose them because, you know,

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.130
I know how wonderful they
are and that they don't--

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.230
and they speak, you
know, they talk the talk

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:40.690
and they walk the walk.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.670
And we're really privileged
in this room, you know,

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.600
to see so many experts
in the field.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.990
And I think we can really draw,
you know, from each other.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.130
I think this is going
to be an excellent day.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.510
We know that we'll be
talking about this, you know,

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:57.680
throughout our journey together.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.690
And I certainly hope that
this is a nice starting point,

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:05.360
you know, for us to
continue that reading journey

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.640
and to bring others
along with us.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.850
So again, thank you
for this opportunity

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.990
and have a great day of action.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:15.290
Thank you.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:36.290
[ Applause ]

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.370
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Thanks
again to that wonderful panel.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:39.670
I learned so much.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.340
And so many notions I had about
reading habits were dispelled,

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.930
so thank you for that.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.100
I know we're running a
little late and that's

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.500
because we start a little late.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.350
So if it's OK with everyone, I'm
going to start the next panel

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.290
and skip the break if that's OK.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.710
Our next panel is reading
promotion, what works,

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.320
what doesn't and
opportunities for innovation.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.050
And the moderator of our
panel is Benita Somerfield.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.100
She is a Library of Congress
Literacy Awards Advisory

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.450
Board member.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:15.510
She's former vice chair
Governing Board UNESCO Institute

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:19.560
for Lifelong Learning and she's
the founding executive director

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.970
of the Barbara Bush
Foundation for Family Literacy.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.740
Please welcome Benita
Somerfield [applause].

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.380
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Hi.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.060
I'm sorry to deprive
you of your break.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.920
I'm Benita Somerfield.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.510
You got my background.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:43.030
Thomas Jefferson famously said,
I cannot live without books.

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:49.120
And my former boss, Barbara
Bush, felt exactly the same way.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.540
And she lived with it
and she walked that walk

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.160
and she talked that talk.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.480
And yes, I was at the funeral.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.210
Barbara Bush and I founded
the Barbara Bush Foundation

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:05.320
for Literacy together
at the end of 1988.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.230
And I left at the end of 2011

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.670
when Barbara Bush
decided she needed to step

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.950
down to be with her husband.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.410
And her daughter
and son stepped up

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.600
and there was a new
executive director.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.460
So for those of you
who've been asking me, no,

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.760
I don't have anything to do

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.520
with the current
Barbara Bush Foundation.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.540
A couple of things about what it
means to be a voracious reader.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:38.330
And I suspect most of the people
in the room are like this.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.480
She didn't just pick
literacy because she had

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.780
to have a cause as First Lady.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.670
The woman read all the time.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.380
One of my favorite
stories was the famous rat

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.510
in the swimming pool story.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.000
Somebody rigged up
something that she--

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.320
she used to swim
laps every morning.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.840
Actually she did
that her whole life.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.570
Somebody rigged up
something for her when she was

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:03.350
in the White House that she
could read while she was doing

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:11.190
laps and somehow who knows, it
was a much less partisan time

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.100
so nobody blamed it
on the Democrats.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.200
Somehow a rat got into
the swimming pool.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.790
And as she was reading the
book a rat came dashing by her.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:26.940
And be a woman that really
didn't do with any nonsense

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.570
and hate to be interrupted
when she was reading,

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.690
she promptly hold the
rat out of the pool

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:36.850
and that was the end of that.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.210
So our panel is going
to talk about what works

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:43.010
in reading promotion,
not the research.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.260
What works, what doesn't
work, and opportunities

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:51.310
in this current time, in
2018 to promote reading.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:55.550
And just very briefly, what
I'm going to say is, of course,

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:59.230
what I've seen is that
it's absolutely critical

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:04.220
to have a strong charismatic
leader who leads the charge

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.090
that urges people to read.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.130
Now, that doesn't mean it has

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.080
to be a serious eat your
piece kind of message.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.620
You have to illustrate
why reading is fun,

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.910
why it's necessary to do
your job, why it's necessary

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.790
to perform in the democracy,

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.730
someone whose voice
can be heard.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:29.920
And frankly, in this world
in which we're living,

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.710
I have seen that we really need

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:37.220
to have leaders,
cultural leaders.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.010
Culture such it is but the
current culture who stand up

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:46.190
and talk about why
read, why do they read.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.630
And I'm talking about rock
stars, baseball players,

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.140
basketball players,
football players,

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:59.640
people that will encourage
today's-- not us, we read,

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.250
people that will encourage
today's youth to read.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.670
Years ago, there was a very
effective campaign called Get

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:08.970
Caught Reading.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.310
I don't know if any of you
are old enough to remember it.

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.800
I'm 73 although I know
I look much younger.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.590
And there were posters all over
the country of movie stars,

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.880
television stars, everybody.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.430
And this really funny posters
saying get caught reading

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.830
and there would be a book.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.840
Can't we have something
like that today

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.730
that says get caught reading?

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.860
And let me tell you why I
read or why I love books

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:39.270
and have a LeBron
James who, by the way,

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.900
is a big literacy supporter.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.130
Talk about why he loves book.

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:45.430
I'm talking about posters.

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:49.200
I'm talking about
billboards, that sort of thing.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.670
And yes, we do need books to
be widely and easily available.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.260
Another program I'm on currently
on the board of is Reach Out

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.830
and Read, which is a
pediatric literacy program.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.630
And yes--

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.670
[ Applause ]

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:10.730
And this again is outside
the box, outside the schools,

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:14.940
outside the traditional places
where books are given out.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.080
Doctors give books
every well-baby visit

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.910
from the time the child is
born up to five years of age

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:25.630
with instruction to the
parent on how to read,

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.810
even if the parent
isn't a brilliant reader

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:31.220
to the child, the interaction.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:37.300
And very often you
find that parents,

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.090
particularly parents
whom I come from,

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:42.420
impoverished backgrounds will be

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.790
in an impoverished situation
don't understand how important

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:48.240
it is for them to be
reading to their children.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.490
They understand very fast
once they get that first book

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.800
and they develop their
own reading habits

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.030
and it increases the bond
between parent and child.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.870
So yes, let's make books
available but not just

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:05.280
in all the usual places, let's
reach out and be where families.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.500
Families, by the way,
children go home from school,

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.160
their parents are in the house.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.890
They're not living
in orphanages.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.240
So if we just look at fixing
the schools and don't look

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.950
at what's going on
between parent and child,

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:21.030
how this is ever going to work?

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.130
What have I seen that's failed?

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.490
He want to-- Guy wanted
to talk about that.

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:31.350
What I've seen that's
failed is somebody talked

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:34.360
about No Child Left Behind,
it's my ex-boss' son I know.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.640
But that eat your piece
approach to reading,

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.110
it's good for you that's
why you should read.

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:41.520
Don't read books with
too many pictures.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.110
Don't read fiction.

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:44.750
Read things that are
definitely going to make you,

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:47.600
you know, stronger, better.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.400
That approach doesn't work.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.350
You've got to make
reading fun and relevant

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.700
and all the things they
are reading is as so many

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.490
of us here in this room.

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.790
OK, enough for me.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.240
We have a wonderful panel here.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:06.860
I'm going to let each person
introduce-- oops, I know, right.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.720
Actually I wondered about that.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.550
We're not behind.

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:11.850
We're not behind.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:14.600
I was threatening to cut
them all off ruthlessly

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.900
at 10 minutes.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.380
But I'm not going to cut you
all off ruthlessly at 10 minutes

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.820
because we have until
11 o'clock.

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.750
&gt;&gt; A lot of time.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.050
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:25.350
We've a lot of time.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.650
Then we're going to
have time for questions

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.930
and maybe the previous
panel want to come up

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:32.310
and answer questions too.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:36.190
OK. So the first person that
we're going to hear from today,

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:38.620
and if you'd introduce
yourself and say what you do,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.510
is Deborah Taylor of the
Enoch Pratt Free Library,

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:47.940
which is a spectacular
institution that I'm sure all

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.660
of us have known it for years.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.460
Deborah.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:57.560
[ Applause ]

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.860
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: Hello.

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.330
I'm Deborah Taylor, coordinator
of School and Student Services

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.670
at the Enoch Pratt Free Library.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.420
And it's my honor to be
with you to talk about some

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.710
of the things, some of the
programs that we have success--

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:13.200
that have successfully worked
at the Pratt Library and also

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.030
to talk about some things
that we have deemed as not

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:21.630
so successful and that we
are looking to improve.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:24.990
So with that said, I'll
go to the first slide.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:28.680
Do I have a clicker?

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.630
&gt;&gt; Is there a clicker?

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.930
&gt;&gt; Here.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.160
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: I don't
think that's the clicker.

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.790
&gt;&gt; That's the clicker?

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.090
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor:
The green button.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.390
OK. The first program
I want to talk

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.470
about is a program called
Family Reading Circles.

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:53.450
And Family Reading Circles
actually started with a request

00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:56.320
from the Maryland
Humanities Council that wanted

00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.740
to do a family reading program.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.880
Kind of designed after what
was a big deal in those days,

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.640
which was Oprah's book club.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.320
And what it meant was that
you were bringing books

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.460
and food together with families.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:15.730
And as you can see, this young
lady has abandoned her dinner

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.830
in order to examine
the books that we are--

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:20.510
that they were going
to take home.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:25.290
The Family Reading Circle
program is a six weeks program

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:28.670
that we do in branches,
that we do in schools,

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.460
after-school programs.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:34.460
We've even done this program
in transitional housing.

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:38.120
We have done this program
in community centers.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.350
And so, it's been in
a variety of places.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.750
But the main idea
of the program is

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:48.640
that families come together
once a week for six weeks.

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.060
Each week, they get two
high-quality picture books.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.930
We read the books aloud
together and discussed them.

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:01.980
We choose books that have
wonderful family themes,

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.230
but we also choose books
that are a lot of fun,

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:09.150
have a lot of wordplay, so
that we not only tell people

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:11.020
that it can be fun
to enjoy reading.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.470
We model it.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.770
One of the great things

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:18.820
about this program is how many
parents didn't have these kinds

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.480
of books for themselves.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.540
And how much joy and
delight they take

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:28.400
in finding these books.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.280
You can see one of the
things that we love

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.890
about this program
is it attracts dads,

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.060
not just moms but attracts dads.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:39.540
Well, we also encourage grand
mom, we encourage all kinds

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.990
of folks to participate.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.900
We-- One big hallmark
of the program is

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.400
to celebrate the parents, we
give the trophy to the parents,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.900
we recognize that what it takes
for a parent to come after work

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.240
for six weeks to be a
part of a reading program

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.780
as the big sacrifice and we
honor them for doing that.

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.630
There's a great deal of
interaction between the families

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.420
and the children when
they come to the program.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.630
They really enjoy being a part
of that particular activity.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.880
In addition to giving
trophies to the parents,

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.210
every family gets a certificate,

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:37.610
one of the slides I don't
have here is at the end

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.280
of the program we take a
picture of the family together

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.880
and they are placed in a
frame called family readers.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.180
So that's one of the
things that they take away

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.500
that they will have to remind
them of this great opportunity

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.720
and great experience
they had together.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.520
One of the things that we do
when we have author visits

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.190
at the Pratt library
is that we make sure

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:04.740
that the students
go home with books.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.920
As we heard from
the previous panel,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.050
the most important
thing is to have books

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:11.780
and to have access to books.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.150
And we used to get
questions about that,

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.450
why are you giving people books?

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:18.140
You should just want to
give them a library card.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.470
One of the things that we
know and one of the things

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.560
that I know from being
a voracious reader

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.500
and a voracious library
reader is

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.130
that when you become a
community of readers or part

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.650
of the community of readers you
buy books, you borrow books,

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:33.250
you have books, books
are all around you.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:38.360
So we want to make sure that we
encourage kids by having books

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.350
that they take can
take home themselves.

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:46.070
This particular visit was
with authors, Zetta Elliot.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.920
She came to Baltimore, she
did a number of programs

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.170
and our schools and this-- on
these tables are goodie bags

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:58.510
that the kids are going to
take with them after her visit.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:02.470
When we started doing increasing
author visits for kids,

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:05.490
Dr. Carla Hayden
was our director.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.220
And when we would propose
author visit, she said,

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.620
where are the kids that going
to get the author books,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.390
how are they going to get their
books signed, everybody who goes

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.140
to hear an author
gets a book signed.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.600
What are you going
to do about that?

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.970
So we had to find the
money to make sure

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:22.020
that we could make sure those
kids got their books signed they

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.470
had the full experience.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:30.430
This is author Sharon Flake,
we work in partnership with one

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.790
of our-- there's
a special project

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.310
in Baltimore called
Weinberg Project.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:38.150
And these are renovated
school libraries.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:41.150
And we have a partnership
with them so that

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:45.580
when we bring authors to town,
we go into those schools.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.580
Despite the fact that those
schools have brand new school

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:52.650
libraries, lots of
technology, great collection,

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:55.010
a full-time librarian
they don't have

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:57.660
as much opportunity
for author visits.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.440
So that's something that we
do with them, so we make sure

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.560
that we take our authors
to visit those schools.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.810
Wes Moore who was a prominent,

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:13.310
was a prominent Baltimorean I
think he's gone to New York now

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:18.180
but every year he would
come to the Pratt library

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.240
and he would talk to
the kids about service.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.790
Well, you know, he has
also written books.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:27.350
So we, we would bring
students into the library,

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.600
we go out to the
library to promote books,

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.900
out of the library
to promote books

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.390
and we bring students
in to the library.

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.700
And these students had all come

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.080
from various schools
throughout the city

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.830
that has service
learning project

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:41.750
because that was the
big focus of his.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:46.730
And they had an opportunity to
meet with him to get their books

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.280
and to get books signed.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.340
One of the things
that hasn't worked

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:58.630
for us has been too much
passive programming for parents.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:01.180
One of the-- We showed you the
positive that one of things

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.550
that really worked well

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:05.570
in our Weinberg school libraries
bringing the authors in,

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:07.560
having them engage
with students,

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.950
students getting
books to take home.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:13.080
Well, we have small collections
in each of those schools

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.830
and we call them the Pratt
libraries parents place.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.600
And we have wonderful
collections of how

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.140
to help your child in school
how to read to your child.

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.160
All those kinds of things
but the passive displays

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.660
for many parents don't
work as well as something

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.450
that is much more engaging.

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:34.160
So we are already taking
steps to make the--

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.010
in our Pratt library parents
place less of a place with books

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:44.110
and more of a programatic
engagement for parents,

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:47.600
so that they really can have
an opportunity to interact

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.400
with our staff and to
get those skills rather

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.700
than just buying books
about those skills

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.520
and making them available.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:59.510
And that's the end
of my presentation.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:06.430
[ Applause ]

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.130
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
That was terrific.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.430
Thank you.

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:15.460
Our next presentation will
be from Allister Chang from--

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.210
who is the CEO of
libraries without borders

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:24.870
and he won the international
prize of our competition

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:30.600
at the Library of Congress
Literacy Awards program.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.930
And I'm not sure

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:36.170
of the international
community so we picked him.

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:37.470
I don't know.

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:38.900
So I'm doubly delighted
to see him here today.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.700
Thank you.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.360
[ Applause ]

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.660
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: All right.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.360
Hello everybody.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:54.580
Thanks for having all of us,
Library of Congress and everyone

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.310
at the Center for the Book.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:58.610
This is exciting.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:06:59.910
So I've got a lot to share

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:03.370
and I'll try not to
talk until 11:45.

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:05.030
So who are we?

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:09.150
Libraries Without Borders is
a nonprofit that's focusing

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:12.260
on expanding access to
information particularly

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.090
in the most vulnerable
communities.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:19.170
And I'll read the statement
because we've just hashed this

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:23.050
out and there's always a tension
between how we translate this

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.060
from French to English.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.160
So any advice you have is great.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.670
We believe that information
and education empower people

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.970
and give them the ability

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:34.240
to make enlightened choices
for a better feature.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.750
To achieve that goal,
we built bridges

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.500
between the information
society which is us and those

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.800
who are excluded from it.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:49.070
And our scope of intervention
since 2007 has been classified,

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.590
I think, in three pillars.

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:53.620
We've been really thinking
about humanitarian contexts,

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.930
places where-- that have
suffered from natural

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:57.790
or political disasters.

01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:01.540
We've been focusing on
education and literacy

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.990
and also using our
library spaces

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:06.880
for entrepreneurship programs.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.180
So the last time I had an
opportunity to speak here,

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:17.870
we were really in the sort of
focusing on our flagship program

01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:19.890
which is called the Ideas Box.

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:23.220
And this is something that
we built learning from work

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.770
that we had done in Haiti
after the earthquake.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:28.520
One of the biggest challenges
that we had was really

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.400
in the supply chain, all right,

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400
books getting wet
during transportation,

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.630
not having storage or security
when it arrives to a place

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.170
that is just suffered
from a natural disaster

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:41.550
or to a refugee camp in
the African great lakes.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.320
So we built this with support

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.650
from Philippe Starck's
design team,

01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:50.400
something that could be easily
deployed in these contexts,

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.180
something that could be fit

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.550
on to standard transportation
pallets waterproof during

01:08:54.550 --> 01:09:01.270
transportation unfolds
into these modules

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:05.720
that eventually becomes
a full size media center.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:12.120
With the support from the
international literacy award,

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.970
we've been able to grow this
out now to, we've gotten now

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.160
over a hundred around in
the world and reaching

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.720
over a million people and with
over 2,800 different kinds

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.850
of curated content that we
customized for each context,

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:35.240
the sort of flagship
program has been in Burundi

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.100
and refugee camps where
partnered with UNHCR.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.190
But we've also done programs,

01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:44.210
last year our largest
program was in Columbia,

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:46.740
it's part of the peace building
initiatives with the ministry

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.170
of culture and the
national library.

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:55.880
And coming up we'll be having a
few ideas boxes in Puerto Rico

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.240
as part of the disaster
relief efforts there thinking

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.300
about how informal education can
support the other organizations

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.840
with-- working with the kids

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.880
that are still not
back in school.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:16.240
Our goal is to have many, many
more of these out in the field

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.900
to support our local partners
and, you know, I think for all

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.200
of you here who are perspective
implementing partners,

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.740
we'd love to talk more
with you about this,

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.500
how can the Ideas Box
potentially support your efforts

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.680
in these tough contexts.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.340
But what I really want to
talk with you about today

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.010
which we haven't-- I
haven't gotten a chance

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:39.050
to share here in--

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:42.810
at the Library yet is
our new initiative.

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:47.300
And this will be
more of a story.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:55.560
So in 2015, we had the Ideas Box
in New York in the South Bronx

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.960
where we were working with
the New York Public Library

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.250
to create pop up
libraries around the city.

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:04.750
And we had an ethnographer
from NYU follow us

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:09.480
for six months thinking
through and trying

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.560
to explore what are some of the
challenges that families have

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.030
with accessing library programs.

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.290
So we setup the Ideas
Box in public parks,

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.890
lobbies of low income housing,
legal aid waiting offices,

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:28.550
hospitals, barbershops, street
corner, subway stations.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.280
And one of the things
that we were finding

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.250
when we were interviewing
families was

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.680
that there's a very
big difference

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.760
between the availability
of programs and resources

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.020
and the accessibility
of those programs.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.810
And one of the, one
of the main barriers

01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:44.940
that we found was really
a scheduling barrier

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.980
in terms of participation.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.780
Offering a literacy program

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.340
that meets 6 p.m. every
Tuesday is really, really tough

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.080
for families that rely on
service industry jobs, right.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.890
You can't afford to miss
a shift, you miss one

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:02.120
of the classes, you're
embarrassed to go back,

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.280
one of the main reasons why a
lot of the families we talked

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.600
to were not able to bring
their kids or for themselves

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.360
to participate in, not only
library programs but a lot

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.890
of literacy opportunities.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:19.240
But this raises a huge
challenge, right, because those,

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.770
of course, are going to be
the most tested, you're going

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.740
to have much more evaluation
opportunity at a physical site

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.480
than if you're out
in the community.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.780
And also it's much
harder to design, right,

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.080
if you don't know how many
people are going to show up,

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.650
you don't know what
ages they are,

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:41.410
you don't know what their
reading level is going to be.

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:43.010
And so, we've been
exploring this now

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:46.700
for the last three years really
trying to kind of think through,

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:51.380
how do we work with our library
partners to think about outreach

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.750
and I use that word
acknowledging

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.860
that it can be defined in
so many different ways.

01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:01.270
We had-- One of our library
partners said, you know,

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:04.990
outreach is meaning less in
some ways because so much

01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:06.620
of the work we have to do is--

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:10.000
has to be embedded in the
community to begin with, right?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.620
What we found was
that one of the best,

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:20.720
best places to do this
work was in laundromats.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:25.690
And so laundromats are
really interesting spaces

01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:31.120
because you have
to go every week

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.080
if you don't have a washer dryer
at home, and you were there

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.400
for 90 minutes on average.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.000
In the winter if it's--
if you're in a cold place,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.970
you're going more than
once a week especially

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:44.010
if you have many kids.

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:46.990
The more layers, the more
laundry you have to wash.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:50.370
And what's been interesting,
there's been no day

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.670
of the last two years

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:52.970
that I haven't said
the word laundromat.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:57.100
And so, I've been learning
a lot about the industry,

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.140
it's a growing industry which
I think is really interesting

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:06.550
for those of us who
aren't in that space.

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:10.360
The revenues and profits of
laundromats has been going up,

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.210
I think as a consequence
of rising poverty.

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:17.520
What you see in this
basis is really, you know,

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.400
sometimes if you run a
college campus, of course,

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.750
you get college students but for
the most part you're really--

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.170
the clients of the
laundromat are lowest income,

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.640
can't save the capital $500 to
have a washer dryer at home,

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.850
live in space that is too
small, right, or in a building

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:35.750
that doesn't have
those amenities.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:40.350
And so, over the last year what
we've been doing is partnering

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:45.360
with our local library branches
state county and city libraries

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.270
as well as most excitingly a
trade group called the Coin

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.500
Laundry Association
and they have

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:59.650
over 30,000 small business
members across the country.

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:02.850
And we're trying to turn now
all 30,000 of those member sites

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:05.580
into extensions of
their local library.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.980
What I love about this is
that we're trying to think

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.540
through how to build out these
public private partnerships

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.740
at the really hyperlocal
level, right?

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.980
Because when you really
think about it, I don't think

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:21.760
that the innovation behind
this is a product, right?

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.060
As we've been exploring this,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.080
we found that Chicago Public
Library has been doing

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.240
laundromat programs
for the last 20 years.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.520
And so, we brought over
15 other organizations

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.470
that have been doing this siloed
laundromat programs together

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.890
to meet in Chicago with the
Coin Laundry Association,

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:43.110
to build up the tools
and capacity building

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:46.650
for any other organization that
wants to do this themselves.

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.660
I think that the reason why we
want to focus on that rather

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.100
than as Libraries
Without Borders,

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.790
built at our own
laundromat sites

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:56.600
and operate them is pretty
obvious to me, which is that,

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.690
you know, I myself won't know
the contexts, what texts curate,

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.390
what challenges people
are facing as well

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:04.900
as our local partners.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:10.530
And what's dynamic about these
hyperlocal public-private

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:14.250
partnerships between the small
business really Mom-and-Pop Shop

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.570
and not even necessarily
a library system

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.780
but a library branch is that
they can be super, super dynamic

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.160
with changing needs, right?

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.490
So when new questions come
up, you change the content.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.580
Last month a lot of the
library systems found

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.490
that people were asking a
lot of the tax questions

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:34.690
and so we're trying
to teach literacy

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:39.280
through helping people sort
through those, those questions.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.580
A lot of that is local.

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:52.050
When-- I spoke with one
parent, one mother in one

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:55.260
of the laundromat sites
in Detroit that we have

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.090
and this is getting to a more
macro level question that I have

01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:02.440
for this group which is, you
know, we've had this prompt

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:07.070
of talking about what programs
work, what programs don't.

01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:10.540
How do we define success
in our case, right?

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:15.350
Because literacy rates are
certainly one quantitative way

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.870
to measure it but
I'd like to get

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:21.370
at something that's little
bit more emotional and social

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.750
and how do we define that.

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:26.240
So when I was in Detroit,
spoke with one parent

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.360
who is participating regularly

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.730
in the laundromat
literacy programs.

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:38.090
And she said, you know,
her story was she had--

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:44.410
she was a single mom, had just
moved to Detroit, she had moved

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.810
with her boyfriend at that time.

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:48.110
He had left her.

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.510
She didn't know anyone
else in Detroit.

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:51.150
She'd been there now for a year.

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:52.740
And this was-- she
said the first time

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.330
that anyone had spoken to her
and ask her how she was doing?

01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:00.020
And it really stuck with
me because I think one

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:04.260
of the main barriers that I
think a lot of people have

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:12.750
with accessing existing
resources, right, is the social

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.050
and emotional; barrier.

01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:16.490
If you don't have the social
networks that are opening you

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.370
to these opportunities,
if you don't have--

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:20.790
if you don't think that
that's basis for you,

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:24.780
it doesn't matter how well
we design the program inside

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.920
if people don't feel
like they can use it.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.330
And so, how can we-- as a
community focusing on literacy,

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:34.770
think about not only
generating good content

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:38.490
and making it available but also
think about how we can think

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:44.550
about the softer elements to
make them actually accessible.

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:51.040
One other finding that
we've had is thinking

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.340
about how we curate content.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.290
And this gets back to
why I think this sort

01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:58.160
of hyper local public-private
partnership is really exciting.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.380
I think that there's
a big difference

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.520
between comprehensive
information

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.170
and relevant information.

01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:10.970
And so, in the laundromats
where we've been putting-- not--

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:12.300
yes, not only a bookshelf

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.240
but also what we've
been doing is putting--

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.790
moving one of the
folding stations out,

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:20.620
putting for laptops
or desktop computers

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.560
with the curated Wi-Fi hotspot.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.300
I think there's a big difference
between providing open access

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.370
to internet and curating
the space

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:34.710
to be a really education
focused, literacy focused corner

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:38.930
of the laundromat where
Wi-Fi is really curated

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:44.140
around our content partners,
PBS KIDS, Too Small to Fail,

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.660
really thinking about how
we curate that content

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.520
so that it's timed between
wash and dry cycles.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.850
Thinking about how we can have
this generational conversation

01:19:54.850 --> 01:20:00.440
happening in that space

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.840
and answering people's
most urgent questions.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.440
So what we've been
finding is instead

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.020
of having this set curriculum
and this again gets to really,

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:15.290
really tough challenge
on evaluation,

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:18.040
instead of answering--
providing, you know,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.770
this is the curriculum
for the laundromat,

01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:22.970
what we've been doing is
convening local organizations

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:26.580
to activate the laundromat
as a community anchor, right?

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.730
A community center of sorts
during the laundromat's busiest

01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.640
hours and for those of
you that haven't been

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.910
to a laundromat recently, some
of them can have 200 washers,

01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:38.180
200 dryers on the weekends.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.880
You have over 300
families at any given time

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.200
that you can be working with.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.030
And so the demand is-- it's so
much greater than the supply

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:47.580
when we bring our
librarians there.

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.100
But thinking through, you know,

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.230
people that we've been having
these conversations with

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:55.760
and running this program with
have something very urgent

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.930
that they need to that day.

01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:02.360
How can we make sure that the
literacy curriculum especially--

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.880
and the digital literacy
curriculum

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.030
that we're providing is taught
experientially to answer

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.500
that question, right, how do
you not just to use literacy

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:15.630
to read a fiction book
but how do you use it

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:18.850
to find health information,
sign up for health insurance,

01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:23.600
figure out how to do your taxes
and learn all those other skills

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.410
which I think literacy is the
only way you open the door

01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:29.130
to those opportunities for.

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.980
And so, I would like
to end on a couple,

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.790
just final closing
thoughts which, you know,

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:36.740
again it's not rocket science,
this have been tried and tested

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:39.260
and explained by others but what
we're finding as we're trying

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.420
to work on this piece
of the supply chain

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:45.930
of knowledge is really
been on our mind is

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.730
that the availability
of programs

01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:52.780
and content does not necessarily
mean that it's accessible

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:58.020
and that comprehensive libraries
are not necessarily relevant.

01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.820
Thank you.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:07.040
[ Applause ]

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.340
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Thank
you so much, Allister.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.540
I think you can see
why he won the award.

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.940
OK. Our final panelist
is Rachel Walker.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.610
And her background
is very different.

01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:25.520
She's work with Reading Rockets
which is a public television

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.830
which we call it
reading program,

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:29.300
reading awareness program.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.000
Everybody wins a whole bunch
of programs of that ilk.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.320
Again, out of the box-- a
bit and Rachel, I think,

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.260
[inaudible] representing
one organization.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:44.510
She'll speak for her
broad experience.

01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:51.500
[ Applause ]

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.800
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker:
Yeah, I represent a lot

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.240
of different folks, which
has been exciting for me

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.520
over the 30 years in my
career in children's literacy.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:01.850
I'm here today really
representing Reading Rockets,

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:05.480
which is a national
project of WETA,

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.910
the flagship public
television station here

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:11.960
in our nation's capital which
you may know for PBS news hour,

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:18.090
Ken Burns documentaries but
WETA really about 15 years ago,

01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:21.940
I had this idea that it would
be a good idea to take advantage

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:26.900
of this internet thing and to
use that to disseminate some

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:30.510
of the best reading research
that's out there because we know

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:34.350
that educators and parents
want that information.

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.690
And so, we started
with, you know,

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:39.130
what the National
Institute of Child Health

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:41.630
and Human Development and the
National Reading Panel were

01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:45.040
working on to really
determine what is the best

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.460
in teaching reading.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.930
And we took that information
and what we know best

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:52.450
which is the power
of story telling

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.750
through public television and
turn it into something to try

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:58.770
to really demystify
the reading research

01:23:58.770 --> 01:24:01.950
because that's really important.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:06.860
Teaching reading is complex
and it needs to be responsive

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:14.130
to the needs of each child so
we're not doing the PowerPoint.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.330
No? That's all right.

01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:27.630
I can talk without pictures.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:47.140
No? OK. So what I wanted to
say in terms of why I feel

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.920
like Reading Rockets is such
an important reading promotion

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.510
partner in the literacy
community is that we need

01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:57.570
to remember that we've
got to speak to that,

01:24:57.570 --> 01:25:01.340
that reading instruction
is important.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:05.230
High quality reading instruction
break down those barriers

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:09.100
so that you are ready
to read, to learn.

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.130
Sometimes I feel like
that's kind of obvious

01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:15.270
that it doesn't get mentioned
but we really do need

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:18.480
to remember that we have kids

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.370
who aren't going
to love reading.

01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:22.870
And one of the reasons that
they might not love reading

01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:24.210
or might avoid reading is

01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.380
because they haven't
mastered it,

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.600
they haven't mastered
decoding to become fluent,

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.720
they haven't gotten interested
in learning new words or looking

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.450
at new ideas and they're
really frustrated.

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:39.800
So reading promotion helps kind
of create those entry points

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.620
for those kids who are learning
or those kids who are striving.

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:47.020
We have to look at
ability and inclination.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.110
So one of the projects
that I've been involved

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.850
in through Reading
Rockets but also just

01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:56.720
because I'm really interested in
reading and getting kids excited

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.670
about reading was when
I was actually working

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.800
with Ms. Lynda Johnson Robb,
Reading is Fundamental.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.930
I started partnering with the
National Education Association

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:10.310
when they launched to
Read Across America.

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:13.160
Who knows what Read
Across America is?

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.790
Yes. Who knows who wrote,
"You're never too old,

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:19.890
too wacky, too wild, to pick up
a book and read with a child"?

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:21.520
Who-- so say it, who wrote it?

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.830
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] Dr. Seuss.

01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:25.370
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker: Dr.
Seuss did not write that.

01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:29.050
I'm so sorry to tell you
that, that was written

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:33.470
by an NEA staff person
and you can see it all

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:37.990
over the internet credited to
Dr. Seuss but no that belongs

01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:42.870
to Anita Merina who
authored that little rhyme.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:47.380
And it was the rhyme that
any-- I was attracted to,

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.910
by Dr. Seuss and, of
course ,the hat, you know,

01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:54.370
as Benita was saying with the
Get Caught Reading campaign.

01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:58.390
It's that oddness, that
juxtaposition of, you know,

01:26:58.390 --> 01:27:01.500
a Supreme Court Justice wearing
a cat in a hat hat is going

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.820
to get your attention
and makes you think,

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.540
oh maybe this is something that
I should be paying attention to.

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.420
But NEA really felt like Dr.
Seuss epitomized, you know,

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.790
a love of children
and a love of learning

01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:19.410
and this fun fantastical
rhyme and looking in the,

01:27:19.410 --> 01:27:22.010
the book that we have the
report from Scholastic.

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:25.530
You see, Dr. Seuss
is all over that.

01:27:25.530 --> 01:27:27.990
So he's dear to many folks.

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:31.020
And that's great
and it really has--

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:35.830
for 20 years Read Across America
has generated participation

01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:38.820
annually from about
45 million adults

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:43.930
and kids reading together, which
is tremendous, it's on the map.

01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:47.220
So that's great,
that's been working.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.710
We've gotten kids
excited about reading and

01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:54.550
yet it was time to change.

01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:59.260
NEA really recognized
that change was needed.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.620
It was the hat that was starting
to get all the attention.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.530
It wasn't what kids needed
or what adults wanted to do

01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:08.580
in their interactions with kids.

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:13.480
So, NEA really took the
opportunity to say we need

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:16.560
to do more, we need to do more
than a one day celebration

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.440
on Dr. Seuss's birthday.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.820
We need to launch readers
year round and we need

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:28.030
to give them access to both
those windows and mirrors

01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:31.280
and have for the past
several years really place

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.100
to greater emphasis
on year round literacy

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.330
with an annual calendar and
annual resources that focus

01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:40.560
on building a nation
of diverse readers.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.250
So looking at books
by Native Americans,

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:50.430
by folks from all walks of life
to kind of get the story out

01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:52.010
and hopefully what that's going

01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:54.340
to do is encourage
more diversity,

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.720
encourage more diversity
in publishing

01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.480
and encourage more
diversity in kids reading.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.080
The other hat that I've
been wearing lately is

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.470
as a program director
for a nonprofit here

01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:09.080
in DC called Everybody Wins.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:15.120
And Everybody Wins was started
about 25 years ago here in DC

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.040
by folks, right over here on
Capitol Hill, Senator Kennedy,

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.880
Senator Jeffords realized
that right in the shadow

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:26.850
of the capitol, folks
were not learning to read,

01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:29.500
kids were not being read
to, they didn't have access

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.420
to books, their school library
was blocked, so they decided one

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.640
of the things that
they could do was go

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.500
over during their lunch
hour and read to kids.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:45.380
And we found that that worked
that having a kid and a book

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.040
and an adult and a book share

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.330
and spend time together
actually made a difference.

01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:55.390
Everybody Wins in DC now
serves about a thousand kids

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:59.690
with readers from all over the
city, from all walks of life

01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:02.620
and we make sure that
kids are taking books home

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.590
so that we're improving their
access to books at home.

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:10.150
But what's really key are those
shared reading experiences

01:30:10.150 --> 01:30:15.970
and they're building connections
that are lasting a lifetime.

01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:21.000
I recently met a young
man who called to say,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.500
that 20 years ago he
had been a student

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:28.440
at Thompson Elementary
School in DC and he wanted

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.850
to know how could he now
become a reading mentor

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:36.870
because his reading mentor
had meant so much to him.

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:41.850
his reading mentor had worked
in the automobile industry.

01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:46.370
And guess what this young man
does now, he works as a lobbyist

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:50.130
for the National Automobile
Manufacturing Association.

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:53.890
So this mentor had an impact
that has influenced his life,

01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:58.180
influenced his career path and
now he was ready to give back.

01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.210
So bringing this-- this shared
reading experiences that build

01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:03.670
that kind of confidence
that build that kind

01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:04.970
of background knowledge

01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:08.190
and strengthen those
socioemotional skills

01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:12.480
that we all want kids
to have is so critical.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.970
But there's so much more
that we felt like we could do

01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:19.190
through the shared
reading experiences

01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:22.790
and the opportunities
to engage kids.

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:26.370
One of our-- One of Everybody
Wins additional partnerships

01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:31.950
in the city focuses on
bringing authors to schools

01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:34.800
with the partnership with
An Open Book Foundation,

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.820
which is a nonprofit here in DC
that takes advantage of the fact

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.480
that DC is full of authors

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.160
and that authors come
to DC all the time.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.690
And so, why not take them to
schools that are underresourced

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:51.330
and might really benefit
from that opportunity.

01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:55.420
We're ready now, this is our
innovation, we're ready to take

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:59.560
that step forward and not
just have authors come

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.410
into the schools, you know,
here's an author, yay,

01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:06.590
here's a book, yay, I got a new
book and the author signed it.

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:11.800
But to move that forward so that
we're continuing the learning

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.080
after the experience so that
kids are doing their own

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.540
writing, so that kids
are doing more research

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:20.540
on what they've learned and
talked about with the author.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:24.460
And we're very excited to see
what's going to happen with that

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.310
and how we can further
engage the school community

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:28.880
in those opportunities
by involving parents,

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.100
by involving parents, by
involving our reading mentors

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.860
so that they are also getting
a chance to come and speak

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:37.760
and talk about what
it is they do

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.760
and what it is they are
excited about reading

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.740
because it's an excited
adult reader

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.150
that is an excellent
example for a kid.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:51.630
And seeing adults around
them choosing reading

01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:56.130
and choosing reading as a
fun activity is I don't how

01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:59.170
as we can replace that and
I think that's why Read

01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:02.500
Across America was-- is so
successful for so many years

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:07.230
because if an adult in your life
is willing to put on a crazy hat

01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.760
and spend time reading with you,

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.200
then you know there's
something to that.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.470
And I'm hoping that
we'll be able to continue

01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:16.810
to find exciting entry
points like that for folks

01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:21.430
from all walks of life and that
we'll all be working together

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:24.210
on this reading promotion
opportunities

01:33:24.210 --> 01:33:27.500
because it makes more
sense if we're all sharing

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.600
that information and all kind

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.470
of supporting each other
as we do this work.

01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:35.530
I love-- I love Reach
Out and Read.

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:38.320
I'm so glad that you mentioned
that Benita because I think

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.730
that that's one of the strongest
reading promotion programs

01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:43.030
that's out there.

01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:47.020
And they need help and everyone
needs help and we're doing a lot

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.950
of the things that we all know
are right but we can learn

01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:52.540
from each other and
I really appreciate

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:55.370
that we're given the opportunity
to talk to each other and talk

01:33:55.370 --> 01:34:00.140
about our mistakes because those
are the things we want to avoid.

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.940
Thank you all so much.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:09.040
[ Applause ]

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.340
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfileld:
Thank you Rachel

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:15.080
for sharing your very
creative ideas from those--

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.460
from your work with those very
creative organizations again

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.900
out of the box.

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:22.550
Now, Guy, should we open
the floor to questions

01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:28.040
and then John, would you like
to also-- so it's 11 o'clock,

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.490
we have until 11:45,
so we'll take--

01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:34.970
[ Inaudible ]

01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:38.230
And let them come
up also afterwards.

01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:40.920
OK. Questions?

01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:44.390
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Hi.

01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:45.690
Laura Bailet.

01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:48.170
I'm one of the literacy
advisory board members.

01:34:48.170 --> 01:34:50.970
This has been really great
already this morning.

01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:53.710
So a couple of questions.

01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:56.250
Allister, I'm thinking
about the laundromat issue

01:34:56.250 --> 01:35:00.530
which I absolutely love and
but I'm also thinking about--

01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:02.770
I'm sorry I'm forgetting
your name--

01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:05.420
the woman from the
Enoch Pratt Library.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:10.720
OK. And you're really important
point that just creating sort

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.180
of passage centers
doesn't work very well.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:18.940
So in the laundromat scenarios,
is there a staff person there

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:25.440
that is guiding or prompting
or teaching or doing something

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.460
so that it is an
active learning center?

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.470
So if you could maybe
comment on that both

01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:32.610
of you if you have that.

01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:37.290
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: So for us,
we've also started to learn more

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:39.260
and more about that
the challenges

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.980
of just having a space.

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.770
So we found that, you know, like
One Laptop per Child and a lot

01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:48.690
of the programs that existed
in international development

01:35:48.690 --> 01:35:51.940
that we've tried to learn
from just putting the tools

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:53.750
into place doesn't
necessarily lead

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.360
to the educational impact
that we want to see.

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.030
It might lead to some
other things, connectivity,

01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.310
digital access, right.

01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:05.980
What we've been doing is
playing around with different--

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:09.990
for different contexts,
different levels of nudges

01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:13.620
where if you sign on to
the WiFi that we provide

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:17.030
at the laundromat like at the
airport, you get a portal pops

01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:19.770
up on your personal
device brings you straight

01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:21.210
to PBS KIDS, right?

01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:25.980
WQED or something of this
sort with a kind of caption

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:28.640
that says, you know,
here's a 15-minute activity

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.440
that you can do with your child
while you're at the Laundromat,

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.130
very kind of, very,
very clearly laid out.

01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:36.600
So there's the nudges.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.900
And then I think there's
the restrictions, right?

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.980
If you block every site except
PBS KIDS at that Laundromat,

01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.770
there's that piece too.

01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:48.610
And so, we've been
playing around with

01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:52.130
that because it's something
that we'd like to test

01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:57.110
for with different
content partners.

01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:58.970
There's the content
curation piece

01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:01.990
but then the main
impact is really coming

01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:03.540
from the facilitators, right?

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:07.470
When we have the
librarians actually

01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:12.010
on site leading programs
with that those tools is

01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:15.980
when we see the highest
engagement, the challenge,

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.350
of course, again
is HR is the most--

01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:26.870
usually the most expensive and
lowest supply and resource.

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:29.400
And so for us it's
really thinking

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.800
through how can the technology
amplify what they're already

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.110
doing and extend the reach
of who they can work with.

01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:42.650
But at this point we are still
even with those technologies,

01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:47.200
even with those nudges mostly
working on convening, right?

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.360
Convening facilitators to
come coalesce and volun--

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.510
other volunteer groups to come
and actually lead workshops

01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:58.780
at the laundromat sites.

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:08.170
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: But
then, I was going to say

01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:11.870
that passive displays
sometimes can't work

01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:20.100
but for our purposes we try
to be parent, so there were

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.910
so many reasons why
it didn't work.

01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:29.470
If you could imagine some school
libraries are on the second

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:30.990
or third floor of an
elementary school,

01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:33.970
not too many parents
get up to this--

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:37.250
&gt;&gt; You should go there because
people can't [inaudible].

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.620
&gt;&gt; Usually people can't hear me

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.330
when they shouldn't
be but anyway.

01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:42.630
[Inaudible].

01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:49.500
I am a librarian and I use to
book talk the middle school

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.770
so I'm sure I can project.

01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:53.370
The-- You know, many
schools, the school structure,

01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:54.710
the physical layout

01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:59.790
of the school can sometimes
be a barrier to putting

01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:01.250
up a display for parents.

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:06.190
Those libraries with--
library was across the hall

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:11.060
from the office, they got
more parental attention.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.340
So it really did depend
on things like that.

01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:18.500
So what we have been able
to do is we've been able

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.890
to hire an outreach,
a program assistant

01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:24.220
who was outreach specialist in
pre-K through grade 5 outreach

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.540
for our schools, so that
we can do some more work

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:33.170
around parental engagement and
connecting those parents back

01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:36.820
to both the school library
and the public library,

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.070
so that we're kind
of working together

01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:40.870
and reinforcing that idea.

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:43.870
But it just happen to be that
that particularly exhibit

01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:46.690
or display depending on the
layout of the school was going

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:49.430
to have varying degrees
of success.

01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:50.730
&gt;&gt; I have a question too.

01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:54.540
So I was so fortunate
to be able to go

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.420
to the LaundryCares
Foundation meeting

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.290
and as a representative of--

01:39:58.290 --> 01:39:59.800
actually being on the board
of Libraries Without Borders.

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.100
But Allister if-- can
you tell us what happens

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:02.400
at the largest laundromat
in the world?

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.700
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: You
have to do the podium only--

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.000
it's not that you don't
project [inaudible], it's--

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.300
the people can't
see [inaudible].

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.600
&gt;&gt; Pardon.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.900
One of the chores we took
as part of that meeting was

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.200
to the largest laundromat
in the world.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.500
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: Right.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.800
So that-- This is
outside of Chicago.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.100
They have over 300
washers, 300 dryers,

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.770
they have an aviary bird center

01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:19.250
so the families can
watch the birds.

01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:22.790
They have a clown
who's hired part-time

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:25.010
to come every afternoon
and weekends.

01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:26.380
[ Inaudible ]

01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:33.590
Yup. The owner does pizza every
two times a week every evening

01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:35.430
and it is really
already, you know--

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.010
I think the partnership
between laundromats

01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:38.310
and libraries is
really interesting

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:40.430
because already laundromats are

01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:42.090
in some ways community
anchors, right?

01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:48.340
And so the fit is really easy
to find the connections with.

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.180
Thanks for sharing that word.

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.810
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Thank you.

01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:54.110
Other questions?

01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:55.950
&gt;&gt; So I have a related question.

01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:57.840
This laundromat thing
is fascinating.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.540
So I'm interested in hearing--

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.240
I'm taking Laura's question
a little bit further.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.220
Is the outreach-- and I
understand you define that kind

01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:08.220
of liberally but is that meant
to say within the laundromat

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.240
and is it a space construction?

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.680
Is there some kind of hope to
convert to Library cards or move

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.920
to a Library for a
different kind of programming?

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.630
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

01:41:17.630 --> 01:41:18.930
Thank you.

01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:20.610
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: So we've
been doing free laundry days

01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:22.040
with sponsorship.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.870
It's a great way to build new
sponsorships with corporations

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:28.700
that haven't funded
libraries in the past.

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:35.720
Four hours free laundry, laundry
is 5, $10 a-- $5 a load usually,

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.350
so it's-- it adds
up for families.

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:41.270
One connection that I found
that's really interesting is a

01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:44.740
lot of the kids say-- have said
that they are embarrassed to go

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.090
to school if their
laundry is not clean

01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:48.500
so there's other dignity
elements to it too.

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:54.060
Well with free laundry what we
do is partner with a laundromat,

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.280
provide free laundry for four
hours we usually have three,

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.030
four hour line outside
the block.

01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:59.620
Invite local organizations
to come.

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.210
Sign people up for their
programs and sign people up,

01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:04.510
in order to get free laundry,

01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:05.810
you have to have a
library card, right?

01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:08.700
And that's an easy another
nudge restriction that we put

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:12.210
on which I know is not the most.

01:42:12.210 --> 01:42:14.550
It's a little bit of the
eager piece but I think

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:19.750
if we have a clown there it's
kind of-- it's fun [laughter].

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:23.200
&gt;&gt; So my question is to Dr. Roy

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.730
but really could be
answered by anyone.

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:29.610
I still appreciated or
comments about being careful

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:32.770
that we're not colonizing that
when we're trying to partner

01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.450
with organizations
and communities

01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:38.520
that we're not bringing
our own values.

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.060
And I see the challenge of that
is that we're bringing support

01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.710
to a community because we
believe that we have solutions

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:48.380
that can support that community
but if we're not really partners

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:50.600
in listening and apart of that,

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.930
we very much are just placing
our values on top of them.

01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:54.230
So really appreciate of that.

01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:58.230
And I'm just wondering what has
worked or not worked in for you

01:42:58.230 --> 01:43:01.230
or for anyone else in making
community partnerships

01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.660
that really truly partner
with the community?

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:04.960
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: Great.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.260
That's a great question.

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.560
I guess I'll use an example.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.860
Some years ago, the
State Library

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.180
in Arizona had a
supplemental grant

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:16.400
to their Bill &amp; Melinda Gates
funded technology centers.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.810
And so they provided
some funding

01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:21.990
to a higher community
tech in six

01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:24.900
or eight tribal settings
in Arizona.

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:29.290
Hopi Reservation, there
was one on-- let's see--

01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:31.700
I think Tony Odom
[assumed spelling], there--

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.010
so different locations,
travel locations.

01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:36.430
And I was the evaluator
for the project.

01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:41.070
And each site also
had a student intern

01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:42.890
from the University of Arizona.

01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:45.690
And so I got to meet with
all of the technology people,

01:43:45.690 --> 01:43:47.480
all the community people.

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.600
I remember going to a
chapter house on Navajo

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.570
and Navajo woman, then a woman
sat next to me very quietly

01:43:54.570 --> 01:43:57.590
and then pushed something toward
me, and it was a huge notebook,

01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.270
and it was filled with all

01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:02.290
of the things she had
learned to do at that center.

01:44:02.290 --> 01:44:05.380
And she had started for
the first time her own way

01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.920
of earning money was to
produce a graduation cards.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:11.830
And she learned Photoshop
and she learned how to print.

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:14.440
And she didn't say a word
but she showed me everything.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.690
And so I got to hear what
patrons did at those sites.

01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:20.360
But speaking with the students,
I also got to learn a little bit

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.490
about the motivation,
more about the motivation

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:25.390
of why did they volunteer
to go and work

01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:28.290
in support a community
tech person from

01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:29.670
and their own travel community

01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:32.090
and that students
were nonnative.

01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:34.370
Anyway the first student who
want to speak to me, she said,

01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:36.330
I need 20 minutes of the hour.

01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:39.400
And what she talked about is
what she felt she should have

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.550
experienced but didn't.

01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:43.410
She says, I should
have been brought

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:47.530
into the sacred religious
experiences I want--

01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:49.760
and her demands were great.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.150
And I had already spoken to
the people of those sites,

01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:53.450
so I kind of had a heads

01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:55.340
up of what the students
are going to say.

01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.010
And I said, so why
did you want this?

01:44:57.010 --> 01:45:00.240
And she says, well, my dad
was an Indian house service

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.710
physician in 20 years ago.

01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:03.710
That was his experience.

01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:06.420
And then another
young student said--

01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.730
and then they, they
had complaints.

01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:09.640
They said, you know, I showed
up on the day I was supposed

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.940
to be there and nothing
happened.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:12.530
No one knew I was coming.

01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:15.260
And at-- so that was
a common experience.

01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.740
But I knew one of the
students had been a star.

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:19.040
And that they-- they
didn't know.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.220
I'd already heard
from their sites.

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.950
And we got to this
student and I said,

01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:24.250
so what was your experience?

01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:25.550
She says, oh, like
everyone else.

01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:27.710
I went on the day I was supposed
to and no one was there,

01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:29.810
she said, but I went
the next day.

01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:32.260
And she said, then I
went the following week.

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.140
And what she did was her
expectations were she was there

01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:36.440
to help.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.510
And she was not there to
gain some inside track.

01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:41.900
So, a part was the motivation.

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.680
I think that many gifts come

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.240
from being involved
in community level.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.910
But it's not something you
can say, I'm going to do this,

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:53.090
so I'm going to cherry pick
some cultural experience

01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:55.520
so I can talk about
it in 20 more years.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:56.820
So, you know, I have--

01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:59.780
one of the books I've
read in there is a chapter

01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:01.970
on examining one's motivation

01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:05.570
and everyone needs
to do that as well.

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:07.740
So does that help answer
the question a little bit?

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.190
OK. Thanks.

01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:10.630
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: As you
can see we've opened the floor

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:14.590
to everybody, the first
panel and the second panel.

01:46:14.590 --> 01:46:19.160
OK. Other questions?

01:46:20.490 --> 01:46:23.250
None? Yes sir?

01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:25.060
&gt;&gt; This is a question
for anybody,

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.070
but maybe Allister
would be the best or--

01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:31.080
you know, I come mostly from
an international background.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.560
When you travel around the
world you hear ministers

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.700
and librarians say-- talk
about a reading culture.

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:40.010
So even in the golf for example,
they are burrowed with people

01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:41.750
who are quite wealthy.

01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:43.890
So we don't really have a
reading culture whereas we go

01:46:43.890 --> 01:46:47.270
to Russia for example, even the
relatively poor people are--

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:48.810
they're great readers.

01:46:48.810 --> 01:46:51.740
Is there anything in this
idea of a reading culture

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:55.560
or is it just as Dr. Krashen
said, you know, if you're poor,

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:58.700
you don't read and if you're
not poor, you read more.

01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:02.680
Or, is there a body
research on that

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.490
and is it relevant
to the United States?

01:47:06.490 --> 01:47:11.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: I think
it's unfair to ask question

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.600
because so many people do
not have access to books.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:18.870
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Could
you come to the podium?

01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:21.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: This
is good for my career.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.770
Wonderful.

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:26.410
If they have access to books
and they're still not reading,

01:47:26.410 --> 01:47:28.750
we can talk about the
absence of reading culture.

01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:31.350
But as James Patterson, which
I just quoted and pointed out,

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:34.550
it may very well be the case
that nonreaders are simply those

01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:36.830
who haven't found
the right books yet.

01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:38.130
Great study.

01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:41.510
I would like to see replicated
in the laundromat was called

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:43.080
"Spiderman in the Library."

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.560
I forgot the author's name.

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.630
They put comic books
in the library

01:47:46.630 --> 01:47:50.140
for junior high school children,
did not allow them to circulate,

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.290
they had to go to the
library to read the comic.

01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:54.820
Library traffic went up doubled.

01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:58.460
Books taken out went up
30% in a very short time.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:00.560
When we bring in
books, they really,

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.630
really, really want to read.

01:48:02.630 --> 01:48:05.540
And the best thing out now
for young people, comic books

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:08.730
and graphic novels, no question.

01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:11.060
One of the great things
about being on the airplane,

01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:13.680
you get to catch up
on the marvel movies.

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.510
Oh my gosh.

01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:18.920
Wonder Woman, Black Panther,

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:22.730
serious philosophical
discussions.

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:25.180
Wonder Woman is about
the nature of evil.

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:26.810
I'm going to spoil it for you.

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:29.590
Black Panther is on
the nature of justice.

01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:30.890
How do we do this?

01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:33.180
Is it correct when you
are born into wealth,

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.390
when you're given it,
what is your obligation?

01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:38.470
OK. These are heavy things
and that's what people--

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:42.490
it's framed in such a brilliant
way that people get involved

01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:44.240
in literature and reading.

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.280
So, let's ask the
question when we've--

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.950
about reading cultures when
we solve the access problem.

01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:52.750
Great question.

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:58.750
[ Inaudible ]

01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:00.750
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: That's
really an important question

01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:03.710
because I remember
hearing that commercial,

01:49:03.710 --> 01:49:06.210
read to your child
15 minutes a day,

01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:09.650
and I used to think
nobody ever read to me.

01:49:09.650 --> 01:49:12.060
But my grandmother
was a storyteller.

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:14.290
And so it's not so much
just the culture of reading,

01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:16.290
is it a culture of storytelling?

01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:17.760
And how do you incorporate

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.030
that so those stories are
captured and passed down?

01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:25.410
So one of the things that we do
with family reading circles is

01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:29.170
when we close out-- sometimes
we have a visiting illustrator,

01:49:29.170 --> 01:49:31.250
sometimes we have
a visiting author.

01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:33.750
But sometimes we have
a visiting storyteller.

01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:35.190
Because one of the
things that we--

01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:37.680
that if you observe
how parents interact

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.360
with their children now,

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.900
they are always giving
them directions.

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.420
They are seldom really
telling them things

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.200
or storytelling anymore.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.370
My grandmother told me
stories constantly whenever we

01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:50.670
were together.

01:49:50.670 --> 01:49:51.970
So I think the culture

01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:55.340
of storytelling is the one
we want to really encourage.

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:58.500
And if it means writing down
those stories and capturing them

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.440
and sharing them,
then that, I think,

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.170
helps with the whole
prospect of a reading culture.

01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:06.470
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Thank you.

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:07.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: Can I
add a friendly amendment?

01:50:07.770 --> 01:50:09.070
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: What?

01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:10.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: A
friendly short amendment

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:11.970
to your wonderful comment?

01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:14.880
We-- Stories are what
makes the world go round.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.490
All-- Everybody like
stories constantly.

01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:21.810
Let me give you some
advice for your social life.

01:50:21.810 --> 01:50:24.700
If you're invited to a party
and you don't know anybody,

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.320
watch three lady's movies.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.710
You can always go up to someone
and say, I just saw, you know,

01:50:30.710 --> 01:50:33.690
Iron Man 26, you
know, or whatever.

01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:36.720
And, you know, Iron
Ladies, Iron Lady,

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.620
and you can get a
reasonable conversation going

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.140
because people want
to know about stories.

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.680
We interpret our
lives as a narrative

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.500
where we are the protagonists.

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.800
So, absolutely.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.500
&gt;&gt; Thanks for that.

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:50.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.100
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker: I think
it is an important addition,

01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:55.380
but one of the things that has
worried me about when we talk

01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:59.580
about creating a culture
around reading is I've asked

01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:02.180
so many people over the
years, are you a reader?

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:04.100
Do you consider yourself
a reader?

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:05.490
Do you like reading?

01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:07.580
And most of the time,
the answer I get is no.

01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:09.140
I don't like reading.

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.440
I don't like reading at all.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.760
And then I said,
but do you read?

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.060
What do you read?

01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.360
Oh yeah, I read all the time.

01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:15.660
I read newspapers.

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:16.960
I read this.

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.260
I read journals.

01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:19.560
I read-- they don't
read fiction.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.250
So I don't want to-- I totally
agree about storytelling

01:51:23.250 --> 01:51:25.920
but my concern is
is that we've--

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.760
read to your child 15 minutes
a day, gives you that image

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.470
of I'm sharing a Dr.
Seuss book with you

01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:34.250
or I'm sharing a story with you.

01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:37.620
And I don't want to leave
out those folks who come

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.770
at it in a different way.

01:51:40.770 --> 01:51:42.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Krashen: There is
research, there's research

01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:44.590
on gossip and stories.

01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:47.990
Most of what goes on in
newspapers is human interest.

01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:50.480
What Albert Einstein
talked to other physicists,

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.600
they talked about their personal
lives, stories and gossip.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:56.200
I still maintain stories as
what makes the world go round.

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.900
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: And then
just to even broaden it more,

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:02.100
I think you can also
talk about song.

01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:06.730
So just recently words on
literature where, you know,

01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:10.870
Bob Dylan won earlier,
you know, Ira Gershwin.

01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:15.600
So, again, these are gateways,
storytelling, the songs,

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.930
the rhythms that we have are
all gateways to literacy.

01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:21.480
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: I've heard
parents say that their children

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.690
or there's-- particularly,
this occurs with boys,

01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:28.140
that all he wants to
do is study baseball

01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:29.880
or basketball statistics.

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:34.200
And I tell them, he is creating
the narrative in his head

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.870
from those statistics.

01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:37.360
He is a reader.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:41.780
But he is going after his
story land, his narrative

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:45.260
in a different way than
I might who, you know,

01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.300
with a voracious reader
of trashy romance novels.

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.630
So it just really does--

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:51.930
you know, you really have

01:52:51.930 --> 01:52:53.470
to respect the reader
where the reader is.

01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:55.840
And then I think
people see themselves

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.140
as part of that culture.

01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.440
&gt;&gt; Lois Bridges: Yeah.

01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:02.210
Just speaking to the scholarly
culture, I just wanted

01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:05.090
to mention one of the most
significant studies of all

01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:09.110
at the University of
Nevada, Mariah Evans,

01:53:09.110 --> 01:53:14.440
who's a sociologist, found
that even just 12 books

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:18.500
in the home created what she
called a scholarly culture.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:21.700
And I think what she meant
is that if you have books

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.550
in the home, you're
talking about the books,

01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:25.850
you're reading the books.

01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:27.370
You're sharing the
books with each other.

01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:33.880
And we find that parents who may
not have had access to literacy

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.970
as children themselves, if their
children are bringing books

01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:40.730
home, then they're
learning to read.

01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:44.640
The children, you have the books
in the home, are reading allowed

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.170
to their younger siblings.

01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:50.410
So you've-- it's-- the
talk as everyone has seen

01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:53.610
around the books, that is
so critically important.

01:53:53.610 --> 01:53:56.330
And also, by the
way reading allowed

01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:59.000
to children is so important.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.750
We know, but again, it's the
talk about the read allowed,

01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:06.680
you know, that bringing out
the child's personal engagement

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.900
with the book that
really makes a difference.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:15.260
So, in the end, it all comes
back again to access to books.

01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:18.520
If you have access to
books, anything is possible.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.080
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: I'll just
add a couple of things.

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.380
When we run--

01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:25.680
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
In the podium.

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:26.980
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: OK.

01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.280
When we run the reading
club for native kids,

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.430
I would go to travel schools and
we would certainly read books

01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:32.910
but we always did
the storytelling too.

01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:36.620
And I know that that the
secret to getting native kids

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.860
to pay attention is
to say you're going

01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:40.570
to tell them a ghost story.

01:54:40.570 --> 01:54:42.130
And you then tell
them ghost stories

01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:45.280
that you yourself experienced
and they're really true.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.950
And then I always told
the true ghost stories.

01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:50.520
And-- But for native kids,
one difference would be that--

01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.840
just like storytelling
is social,

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.330
reading is very social
for native children.

01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:58.360
And board books, you think
of board books as a bit--

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.060
books that you give babies,
but we found that kids

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.770
up to fourth grade would
use the board books

01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:04.070
because they would sit

01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:05.990
with other children especially
younger ones and they would go

01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:07.510
through the books together.

01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:10.360
And they would form their
own little pads of reading.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.880
They knew especially in those
schools where kid had reading--

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.390
kids had reading level to know

01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:17.450
that they knew everybody's
reading level

01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:19.400
and they would help each
other select the books.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.700
Like oh, no, no, no.

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.000
You want to read this,
you want to read that.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.410
So reading as a culture
is very communal just

01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:29.290
like storytelling is communal
with native schools especially.

01:55:29.290 --> 01:55:30.590
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:32.850
I just have one comment
I'd like to make.

01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:36.580
I need to speak up for the
adults, which is nobody is.

01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:42.190
What we found in the
Barbara Bush Foundation,

01:55:42.190 --> 01:55:46.610
we funded about a thousand
programs over the years.

01:55:46.610 --> 01:55:50.360
Many parents who were not
interested in investing

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.140
in themselves for variety
of reasons mostly none

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.230
of them very good about
self-concept care to learn

01:55:58.230 --> 01:56:01.040
to read so they could
read to their children.

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.770
I agree with you, it's the
conversation that matters,

01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:07.410
but I really-- I worked

01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:10.200
in programs before I've
run a foundation, you know,

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.860
during the great society
stuff in prisoners

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:15.480
and in homeless shelters
and whatever.

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:21.330
I don't-- we did family
literacy programs in prisons.

01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:23.690
I don't think it's
going to sound crazy.

01:56:23.690 --> 01:56:25.890
I don't think I ever run into
a parent that didn't want

01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:30.750
to be able to learn to read, to
read a book to his or her child.

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:34.080
And reading in this context
doesn't necessarily mean

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.320
that you have to have
fantastically developed

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.900
reading skills.

01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:42.610
It's be with the child, turn
the pages, tell the story.

01:56:42.610 --> 01:56:48.500
And that often insights a desire
to learn to read on the part

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:52.500
of the adults because it's for
the relationship with the child.

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:53.800
I just throw that in.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.580
Sorry, go ahead.

01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:01.450
&gt;&gt; Hi. So my office,
we do museum education.

01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:04.800
And so I'm listening to all of
you and we're probably not going

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.560
to get books into
children's hands as much,

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.490
we're doing more
digital outreach.

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:14.310
Is there-- Can you recommend,
do you have, just off the top

01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:17.940
of your head, maybe strategies
for what we should be creating

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.160
or how maybe should we be
reaching out to parents,

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.010
should we be reaching
out to libraries?

01:57:23.010 --> 01:57:27.650
What's our best approach
to help kids?

01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:32.220
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: I'll just use
one example since this is just

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.730
down the street the National
Museum American Indian.

01:57:34.730 --> 01:57:36.150
So I was involved with a group

01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:39.800
that created the first online
exhibits for the museum working

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.900
with eight, nine
and 10-year-olds.

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:45.880
And so, my job was to help
the children narrate a tour

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:49.520
of the museum materials
on exhibit that we move

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:51.230
from exhibition cases.

01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:54.380
We created 360 movies
of the objects,

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:58.010
linked them to panoramic
views of the exhibit space.

01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:00.820
And then the kids narrated
the tour but we use

01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.330
that following a narrow
history model of asking.

01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:07.170
I asked the children to
describe who created the object,

01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.010
where were they from,
how did they created

01:58:09.010 --> 01:58:10.570
and for what purpose.

01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:12.720
And they used written
materials as well

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.030
as their own cultural stories
to do the interpretation.

01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:18.880
So that was for the NMAI.

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.990
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
Any other responses?

01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:24.540
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker: So with
PBS and Reading Rockets,

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.880
we are definitely
a digital platform.

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:30.420
And so, we've done a lot at
looking at what that means

01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:32.580
and how is that really useful.

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.910
And we found that one of
the things that is great is,

01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:38.900
of course, video because
videos are very accessible.

01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:41.260
You can tell a lot of
stories with video.

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:44.570
But also we found that it
works even better if you take

01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:48.640
that video and you put it into
action so that if it's a digital

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:51.780
and you're communicating with
folks all over the world,

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.990
they can learn how
to use that video

01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:55.610
to the best that it can be used.

01:58:55.610 --> 01:58:57.990
So they share it with a
parent or to use it as part

01:58:57.990 --> 01:59:01.240
of the professional development
opportunity for a teacher.

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:03.530
So it can't just-- we don't
want it to just be static

01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:06.400
and they're online, we know
people will find it and use it

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.050
but to have that kind of
outreach in those opportunities

01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:11.520
where you're saying, here
are a lot of different ways

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.030
that you can put it into
action in your community.

01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:16.330
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
Any other responses?

01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:19.200
OK. Next question.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.560
&gt;&gt; Hi. Well, I'm really
interested in Rachel

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.940
and what you were
saying and you all--

01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:26.300
some of you all have alluded to
this with the power of process

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:29.870
and children going from author
visits or a books experience

01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:33.000
and making their own narrative
and what that looks like.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.380
So I just wanted to know if you
could talk a little bit more

01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:40.990
about that that process.

01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:43.880
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: You go.

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.110
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker: So
one of the reasons

01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:49.240
that I was really excited about
working with Everybody Wins

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:52.610
and the idea of doing
more to engage kids

01:59:52.610 --> 01:59:54.020
to share reading experiences

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:56.680
that were not necessarily
just one-on-one but looking

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.690
at that kind of community
that you build

01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:01.070
when you're sharing a
book that's the same

02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:04.190
and sharing the experience of
getting to meet the author.

02:00:04.190 --> 02:00:07.560
For a couple of years, I spent
some time in a middle school

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:11.620
and we decided that we
really needed to focus

02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:15.520
on helping students figure
out what motivated them

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.180
as readers and writers.

02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:19.190
And we thought that one
thing that would really do

02:00:19.190 --> 02:00:23.010
that would be to introduce
them to a lot of writers.

02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:26.390
And, yes, it was actually
true that that work.

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:32.090
So one year we had I think 14
author visits during a school

02:00:32.090 --> 02:00:35.660
year which was a tremendous
amount of effort on part

02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:38.290
of the teachers and
the librarians there.

02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:43.190
But what we saw was that
kids were and we ask them

02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:44.680
because we wanted to make sure.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.220
So we-- first we wanted to
know who do you want to meet,

02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:50.480
what authors are you interested
in, or what are your interests

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.390
because it wasn't going to do
any good to bring an author

02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:56.330
that we hadn't prep the kids
for or that didn't have some

02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:58.620
of connection to what
they are already learning

02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.300
or working on in school.

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:03.030
So to make it really
concentrated effort on figuring

02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:05.490
out how it fits in
to their daily lives

02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:07.990
because it's not
just necessarily

02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:10.330
that they're interested that's
going to be the motivation

02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:14.030
for them to get excited about
this but it's going to be kind

02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:15.930
of what they're existing
background knowledge is,

02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:17.950
so that they can take
it and go with it.

02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:21.150
So that's really what we look
at, the motivation factor

02:01:21.150 --> 02:01:23.460
but then also what
it is that we're--

02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:25.400
that they already have
that we can build on.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.950
And it-- I'm hoping
that it's going to work

02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:30.250
in elementary schools too.

02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:36.990
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: The
Pratt library partnered

02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:39.420
with the Reginald Lewis Museum

02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:41.390
and the Baltimore
City public schools

02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:46.240
to run a book making
contest that we had funded

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.980
from the Ezra Jack
Keats Foundation.

02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:50.260
They run the huge
one in New York.

02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.260
And so we were just starting out

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.650
and this gave the students a
chance to write their stories

02:01:57.650 --> 02:01:59.540
to illustrate their stories.

02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.950
We did a teacher workshop,
so the teachers learned how

02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:04.030
to show them different ways

02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:07.070
of making the books
like anything else.

02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:10.260
We had one teacher that
caught fire with the idea.

02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:12.910
And she was teaching
graphics art, ends with this--

02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:17.570
all of these submissions from
her class and they worked

02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:21.230
on getting those
students to actually write

02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:25.610
and make graphic novels
from what they did.

02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:29.140
And then we have the
announcement of the winners

02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:31.060
at the Reginald Lewis Museum

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.860
and then the library
displayed the winning and some

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.160
of the other submission.

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:37.250
So the three of us, there
were some kind of way

02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:41.120
that they're all three
institutions were engaged.

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.270
&gt;&gt; Rachel Walker: And
I love the book making.

02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:46.480
One of the other things
that we did was we figured

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:49.910
that kids were so excited
about what they were learning

02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:51.890
from authors that
they wanted to share

02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:53.750
that with all of
their classmates.

02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:57.640
So we created a podcast
that students then

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:00.410
after the author visits
would interview the authors

02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:02.930
and then develop their
own podcast to share

02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:06.350
that information with other
schools, other students,

02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:10.920
other communities,
which was a lot of fun.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.580
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: OK.

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.880
Other questions?

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.270
Laura.

02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:17.970
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: I've been
thinking a lot recently

02:03:17.970 --> 02:03:20.650
about the social
dimension of reading.

02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:25.850
And I think that that can
be a really powerful draw

02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:30.680
to help foster that culture of
reading that you talked about.

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:35.100
And also encourage people
to read in whatever way

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.690
who might not otherwise
be doing that.

02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:41.990
Now for myself I love nothing
more than as an individual

02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:44.360
and private person curling
up with a good book.

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:47.340
But I'm also-- I also
really enjoy a book club.

02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:52.200
And I think that there are
many examples of people,

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.130
young and old who are making
reading social that could help

02:03:56.130 --> 02:03:57.730
that sort of catch fire.

02:03:57.730 --> 02:04:00.810
I think one example that
I saw in the past year

02:04:00.810 --> 02:04:02.110
or so was a little boy,

02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:04.950
an 11-year-old boy named
Sydney Keys [assumed spelling]

02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:08.520
in the saint Lewis area who
started books and brows.

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.850
He's an African-American boy

02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:13.220
and he was having
trouble finding books

02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:15.630
about people like him.

02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:18.150
And he worked with a
private book seller

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:21.740
and now he has this whole
African-American boy's book club

02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.040
that's going.

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.320
And I think what
a fabulous idea.

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.120
And so, I wonder if others
have knowledge of qualitative

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.710
or quantitative research on the
impact of this social dimension

02:04:34.710 --> 02:04:37.340
of reading whether
it's big campaigns

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:40.170
like Oprah Winfrey's book thing.

02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:43.240
PBS now has a-- is it a book
of the month or whatever.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.080
So I don't-- I wonder if
others have perspectives

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.260
and information on that because
I think that can inject a lot

02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:53.040
of fun and social element

02:04:53.040 --> 02:05:01.320
that might be a catalyst
for people to read.

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:02.620
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: OK.

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:03.980
&gt;&gt; Allister Chang: This is not
directly in the literacy space

02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:05.480
but we've been partnering

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:08.840
with MIT media labs Peer 2 Peer
University and thinking a lot

02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:12.450
about how to turn
MOOCs into, you know,

02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.760
raise the retention
rates of MOOCs.

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:18.340
It's relied-- really
most robust studies

02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:22.780
on raising retention ever lied
on creating these pure networks.

02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:30.720
And I think that would tie
closely to reading as well.

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:35.050
&gt;&gt; And that was fast.

02:05:35.050 --> 02:05:38.840
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: So a lot of
you know about the Harry Potter

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.900
and what kind of group
of book clubs, you know.

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.740
And part of their work which
is now, you know, international

02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:47.160
and they have, you
know, local chapters.

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:50.650
So you build in the
local social aspect

02:05:50.650 --> 02:05:52.900
as well as between chapters.

02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:57.270
And every year one of the
requirements, you know,

02:05:57.270 --> 02:06:02.770
for a chapter and these are
all free, is to gather books

02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:07.670
and then distribute them to,
you know, folks in need for it.

02:06:07.670 --> 02:06:09.050
So that's part of their deal.

02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:13.440
And they also collaborate, you
know, with local publishers

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.580
in terms of making
books available online.

02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:21.650
So that social thing really,
you know, fosters, you know,

02:06:21.650 --> 02:06:25.500
kind of a growing
network of readers

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.860
of literacy and friendship.

02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:37.370
&gt;&gt; Lois Bridges: I know that
Chris certainly knows about this

02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:39.860
but I just wanted to
say that in classrooms

02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:43.530
where there are robust
independent reading programs,

02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:47.690
you find books clubs and
you also find teachers

02:06:47.690 --> 02:06:50.460
who know books, love
books, know literature

02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:53.180
and every day book talks.

02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:55.140
So like a movie trailer

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:58.320
for books advertising
books all the time,

02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.840
catching kid's attention, we--

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:03.960
you know, we have this idea that
reading this sort of a solo,

02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.800
lonely sort of thing but
know in the best classrooms

02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:11.890
where readers thrive, there's
a rich reading culture and lots

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:14.230
and lots of talk and sharing.

02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:17.800
Books catch hold just
like everybody wants to,

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.310
you know, wear a certain brand.

02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:21.990
Every kid in the classroom
wants to read the latest book

02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:24.580
from certainly daycare
rallying was sort

02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:25.930
of the ultimately example.

02:07:25.930 --> 02:07:29.820
I think more kids became readers
in the pages of Harry Potter

02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:31.750
than any other book in history.

02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:34.110
But reading is definitely
social.

02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:38.220
It's also cultural, of
course, and it's very personal.

02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:39.520
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: So,

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.820
I'm thinking this
should be a project

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:42.120
for our Literacy Awards board.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:44.560
It's kind of to come up
with some best practices

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:49.870
or do a whole symposium around
making books social to promote

02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:51.480
that culture of reading.

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.420
I'm very captivated with that.

02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:59.320
I think that is a big topic
that deserves more attention.

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:01.110
So thanks.

02:08:01.110 --> 02:08:03.670
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: So we have lots
of examples of the one book,

02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.900
one week type of
activity especially

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.140
from Nancy Pearl's
encouragement.

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:11.320
I can think of another example
with teens, native teens.

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:15.010
We organize something with
reader girls a few years ago

02:08:15.010 --> 02:08:17.150
and it was operation
team book drop.

02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:20.890
So we deliver the free book
to 10,000 native teens.

02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:23.410
And feedback from the
teachers involved were--

02:08:23.410 --> 02:08:25.920
and this was one of the
few examples they had.

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.910
They told us of kids who
no matter where they were

02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:31.180
in reading where awarded.

02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:34.070
So they were used to getting,
giving books to the kids

02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:39.290
who read well but not the kids
who are having difficulty, so.

02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:41.480
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Just to
reinforce your point Laura,

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:45.160
I was in book publishing
for a number of years.

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:50.320
And Oprah Winfrey's book club
was the single biggest seller

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:52.540
of books that anyone
had ever seen.

02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:55.660
If you got your book
nominated named by Oprah

02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:00.620
as the book, the
sells went crazy.

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:04.050
From that, I believe,
came the book clubs.

02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:06.470
All of a sudden my
cousin out in Long Island

02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:11.050
who very rarely read, she's
telling me she's going

02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:15.100
to a book club rather than
go into a fitness this.

02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:18.780
Well, it became something you
were supposed to do, right?

02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:22.110
They were all reading
books together

02:09:22.110 --> 02:09:24.670
and then people really began
to enjoy though I know people

02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:29.000
who make time in tremendously
busy schedules to go

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.080
and read the book,
right, make their time.

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.240
So there's definitely,
I agree with you,

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:37.760
there's definitely something
social and important in that

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:40.080
that I think what
you're looking to.

02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.380
Yes.

02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:45.460
&gt;&gt; Just thinking about a culture
of literacy and how we get

02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:49.970
from here to there and thinking
about this Scholastic statistics

02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:51.680
and thinking Jim
Trelease' handbook,

02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:55.370
Read-Aloud handbook
and, you know--

02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:59.350
and beginning at the beginning
that at birth as close

02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:02.280
as we can come to people
reading aloud and having

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.090
that shared experience
of love and bonding

02:10:05.090 --> 02:10:07.100
around a book, the
better we can be.

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:12.870
And even though the Scholastic
statistic improved from 30

02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:19.000
to 40%, that 60% of people
who don't know this yet and so

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.660
to think about what if
every baby received a book

02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.320
that families received
the book when they're born

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.360
to welcome them across
our country,

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.660
so just planting a seed.

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.960
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Yeah.

02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:37.310
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to follow back

02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:40.380
on the previous question
about book clubs.

02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:46.520
So I think a lot of us are we
actually offer book club kind

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.820
of programming.

02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:53.920
And one thing that we are trying
to do is find more information

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.430
or data to support the fact

02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:57.460
that this is really an
important thing to be offering.

02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:01.840
So if there is any such data
about this, how important it is

02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:04.990
for the social aspect of book
clubs or what else they can do,

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:08.440
it would be really appreciated.

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:09.740
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: OK.

02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:13.770
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor:
I was going to say--

02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:16.120
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
All right, all right.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:18.310
&gt;&gt; Deborah Taylor: I think
one of the things that--

02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:19.610
especially for young people,

02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:23.250
for teens in particular is
the availability of authors

02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:27.550
and their willingness to
engage kids in social media.

02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:31.110
Most of us if you follow
any of the social media,

02:11:31.110 --> 02:11:33.310
many of the authors are
really, really active

02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:37.010
and they're engaging
with their readers.

02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:40.630
So it's not just about
me reading a book,

02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:43.970
it's about me interacting with
the authors, the other people

02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:45.850
who like the same
books that I like.

02:11:45.850 --> 02:11:48.180
So social media gets a bad wrap

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:50.260
and then well-deserve
one sometimes.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:54.410
But it also has been a way
that writers can engage

02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:58.380
with their readers and also
to have that back and forth.

02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:02.290
And so that it does become
more of a social activity.

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.860
&gt;Allister Chang: Your
question I think raises

02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:14.700
for me a few followups to which
are thinking about what is--

02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:18.490
how do we-- if-- how do we
identify the exact intervention

02:12:18.490 --> 02:12:20.760
and then how do we--
what are the indicators

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:23.070
that we would actually
evaluate for that, right?

02:12:23.070 --> 02:12:27.010
Is it really rising literacy
rates in that community,

02:12:27.010 --> 02:12:31.060
is it economic empowerment,
is it more jobs?

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:33.410
I think as we are-- and we look

02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:37.280
at why the Gates Foundation
closed their global libraries

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:39.930
program, one of the
things that they told us,

02:12:39.930 --> 02:12:44.210
our program officer told us
was they were framing libraries

02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:46.870
as both the solution
and the problem, right?

02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:49.710
What is the problem?

02:12:49.710 --> 02:12:51.010
Not enough libraries.

02:12:51.010 --> 02:12:52.310
What is the solution?

02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:53.610
Build more libraries.

02:12:53.610 --> 02:12:55.540
But more and more were
moving towards a place

02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:58.530
where a public policy
priorities,

02:12:58.530 --> 02:12:59.830
foundation priorities.

02:12:59.830 --> 02:13:01.400
I think individuals
too are thinking more

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:05.520
about what are the tools and
things that I invest my time

02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:08.350
and that lead me to a
certain end goal, right?

02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:11.320
And I think it is our
task as a community

02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.040
to communicate how
our interventions

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.520
around building those book
clubs ties to those as well.

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.890
And I think that that's-- I
would be really interested

02:13:20.890 --> 02:13:23.610
for the researchers here
to think about what is it--

02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:27.470
what can we do with knowing that
there are so many interventions

02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:32.270
around the social aspect of
books to tie that to some

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:36.610
of those priorities, those
public policy priorities

02:13:36.610 --> 02:13:39.600
that we can actually get
funding for these programs

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.830
to continue existing, right?

02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:45.260

[ Inaudible ]

02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:49.350
OK. Is there another question?

02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:51.280
&gt;&gt; I just have a quick question.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.150
I hope it's a quick
answer but if not,

02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:55.220
it's something you
might want to consider.

02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:59.530
Is there a teen online
book club?

02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:00.830
There is? OK.

02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:02.880
Is there one that anyone
recommends over another

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:04.180
that we could direct teens?

02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:07.540
Because I don't feel like if
there's a space we direct teens

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:09.350
that may-- they may
not want to be there

02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:11.460
or they may feel regulated

02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:15.310
and that's something
we've been thinking about.

02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:19.510
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: Can
anybody answer that one?

02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:21.260

familiar with that?

geared for younger people.

02:14:35.110 --> 02:14:40.650
Are there other ones that
I-- that others know about?

[ Inaudible ]

02:14:51.130 --> 02:14:54.700
&gt;&gt; Lesley Farmer: I think you're
most often able to find those

02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:57.400
through the public
libraries when they do,

02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:58.700
you know, specific programming.

02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:02.150
And one advantage of doing
it locally is then, you know,

02:15:02.150 --> 02:15:04.250
kids that know each
other face-to-face,

02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:06.340
then they can continue
that because part

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:09.710
of that social deal is
building relationships.

02:15:09.710 --> 02:15:12.060
But there are-- all
right, there are Teen Inc.

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.700
and so many others have
been around for a long time.

02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:17.880
So I don't have it right off
the top of my head but check

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.180
with your public library

02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:20.480
and they can probably
tell you what are some

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.270
of the good ones or ask a team.

02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:25.990
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: I
have one other suggestion.

02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:28.130
The single best selling category

02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:31.680
for book publishers right
now is young adult books.

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:37.490
And I would check individual
publishers of books and deal

02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:40.200
with this and their authors and
see if there are book clubs.

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.570
I don't know any off the top
of my head but my guess is

02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:46.390
that there, very well, might be
book clubs within those websites

02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:49.170
because they've gotten much
more active in those areas.

02:15:49.170 --> 02:15:52.990
I think that's it.

02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:54.360
&gt;&gt; Loreiene Roy: I'll
add one thing to that.

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.070
There's a new initiative through
the American Library Association

02:15:57.070 --> 02:16:00.700
with a Kellogg grant
on truth racial equity

02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:02.210

02:16:02.210 --> 02:16:06.810

discussions around those topics

02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:11.490
starting with some
pilot public libraries.
