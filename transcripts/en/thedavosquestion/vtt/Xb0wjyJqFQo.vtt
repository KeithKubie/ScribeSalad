00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; Education is vital in preventing disease
and poverty and improving

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.170
standards of living.
Governments typically don't invest enough

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.869
in this and there need to be
more substantial and sustained commitments

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.960
to the funding and financing
of education, the reform of education services

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.589
globally.
This is a matter of [INAUDIBLE] who and its

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.579
very important that
business works with government to identify

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.670
education that is going to
help to increase jobs.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.399
It's not about education systems and schools,
it's also about

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.149
investment and the kind of education that
is provided and this has to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.520
be relevant to the needs of employers but
also the needs of communities

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.949
and people in communities.
And this challenge is vital now to meet the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.649
growing needs of young
people coming into the workforce.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.720
Finally, education is vital to prepare for
a different future, for a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.120
low carbon-type economy, for radically different
ways of consuming and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.060
the levels of consumption.
So education and investment in education is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.860
vital now.
