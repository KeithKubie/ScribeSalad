00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.969
- [Voiceover] In preparing for a race,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.969
Jill ran half the distance that Sam ran.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:08.907
So let me write that down.

00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:11.479
So let's say J, is the distance Jill ran,

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.846
is equal to half the distance.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.889
We'll say S is the distance that Sam ran.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:21.591
And Sam ran three times the
distance that Aisha ran.

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.735
So Sam ran three times the distance,

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:29.009
that we'll use A for the
distance that Aisha ran.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.771
What was the ratio of the distance

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:35.614
that Jill ran to the
distance that Aisha ran?

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:36.396
So let's think about it.

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:40.235
So here, we have how much
Jill ran in terms of S.

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:43.748
So maybe we could write how
much Aisha ran in terms of S.

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:44.900
Then we could find the ratio

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.194
and then the S, it should cancel out.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:49.265
So let's see, over here
if we wanna solve for,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.845
if we wanna write this,
so we have how much

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:55.652
Aisha ran in terms of how much Sam ran,

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:58.159
we can just divide both sides by three.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.504
So you divide both sides by three.

00:01:00.504 --> 00:01:03.794
We're left with Aisha ran

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:06.718
1/3 the distance Sam ran.

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:08.526
So if we wanna find the ratio,

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.916
the ratio of the distance Jill ran

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:11.229
to the distance Aisha ran.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.746
So it's the ratio J over A.

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:16.885
The ratio J over A.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:19.535
This is going to be equal to 1/2 S.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:21.266
That's what J is equal to.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.866
Over 1/3 S.

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:27.243
That's what A is equal to, over 1/3 S.

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:29.264
So it's equal to 1/2 divided by 1/3.

00:01:29.264 --> 00:01:32.379
The S is cancel out.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:35.909
So this is going to be equal to 1/2.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.987
You divide by 1/3, that's the same thing

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:41.214
as multiplying by three over one.

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:44.664
And so, one times three is three.

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:46.998
Two times one is two.

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:49.701
So the ratio is equal to...

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.761
So the ratio the distance
that Jill ran to the distance

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:56.322
that Aisha ran is three to two or 3/2.
