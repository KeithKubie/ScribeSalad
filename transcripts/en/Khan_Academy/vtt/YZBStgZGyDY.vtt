00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.120
We have the equation negative 9
minus this whole expression,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.720
9x minus 6-- this whole thing
is being subtracted from

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.750
negative 9-- is equal to
3 times this whole

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.500
expression, 4x plus 6.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.740
Now, a good place to start is
to just get rid of these

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.400
parentheses.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
And the best way to get rid of
these parentheses is to kind

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.940
of multiply them out.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.880
This has a negative 1-- you
just see a minus here, but

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.660
it's just really the same thing
as having a negative 1--

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.310
times this quantity.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.790
And here you have a 3
times this quantity.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.820
So let's multiply it out using
the distributive property.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.780
So the left-hand side of
our equation, we have

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.250
our negative 9.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.710
And then we want to multiply the
negative 1 times each of

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.980
these terms. So negative 1 times
9x is negative 9x, and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.040
then negative 1 times negative
6 is plus 6, or positive 6.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.230
And then that is going to be
equal to-- let's distribute

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.430
the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.210
And then 3 times 6 is 18.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.850
Now what we want to do, let's
combine our constant

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.780
terms, if we can.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.600
We have a negative 9 and a 6
here, on this side, we've

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800
combined all of our like terms.
We can't combine a 12x

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.040
and an 18, so let's
combine this.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.550
So let's combine the negative 9
and the 6, our two constant

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.260
terms on the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.270
So we're going to have
this negative 9x.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.590
So we're going to have negative
9x plus-- let's see,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.030
we have a negative 9 and then
plus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.510
is negative 3.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.260
So we're going to have a
negative 9x, and then we have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.660
a negative 3, so minus
3 right here.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.430
That's the negative 9 plus
the 6, and that is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.850
equal to 12x plus 18.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.280
Now, we want to group all the
x terms on one side of the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.200
equation, and all of the
constant terms-- the negative

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.150
3 and the positive 18 on the
other side-- I like to always

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.650
have my x terms on the left-hand
side, if I can.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.250
You don't have to have them on
the left, so let's do that.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.410
So if I want all my x terms on
the left, I have to get rid of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.590
this 12x from the right.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.860
And the best way to do that is
to subtract 12x from both

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.390
sides of the equation.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.620
So let me subtract 12x from the
right, and subtract 12x

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500
from the left.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.800
Now, on the left-hand side, I
have negative 9x minus 12x.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.880
So negative 9 minus 12,
that's negative 21.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.480
Negative 21x minus 3 is equal
to-- 12x minus 12x, well,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.240
that's just nothing.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.990
That's 0.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.250
So I could write a 0
here, but I don't

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.960
have to write anything.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.830
That was the whole point of
subtracting the 12x from the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.910
left-hand side.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420
And that is going to be equal
to-- so on the right-hand

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.320
side, we just are
left with an 18.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.370
We are just left with
that 18 here.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.130
These guys canceled out.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.990
Now, let's get rid of
this negative 3 from

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.840
the left-hand side.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900
So on the left-hand side, we
only have x terms, and on the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.800
right-hand side, we only have
constant terms. So the best

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.940
way to cancel out a negative
3 is to add 3.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.200
So it cancels out to 0.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.340
So we're going to add
3 to the left, let's

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.320
add 3 to the right.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.490
And we get-- the left-hand side
of the equation, we have

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.420
the negative 21x, no other x
term to add or subtract here,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.090
so we have negative 21x.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.320
The negative 3 and the plus 3,
or the positive 3, cancel

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.060
out-- that was the whole
point-- equals--

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.290
what's 18 plus 3?

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.820
18 plus 3 is 21.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.730
So now we have negative
21x is equal to 21.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.880
And we want to solve for x.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.300
So if you have something times
x, and you just want it to be

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.400
an x, let's divide by
that something.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.800
And in this case, that something
is negative 21.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.350
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by negative 21.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.670
Divide both sides
by negative 21.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.510
The left-hand side, negative
21 divided by negative 21,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.100
you're just left with an x.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.440
That was the whole point behind

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.260
dividing by negative 21.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.820
And we get x is equal
to-- what's 21

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.150
divided by negative 21?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.170
Well, that's just negative 1.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.450
Right?

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.340
You have the positive version
divided by the negative

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.850
version of itself, so it's
just negative 1.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.510
So that is our answer.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.060
Now let's verify that this
actually works for that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.850
original equation.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.320
So let's substitute negative 1
into that original equation.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.370
So we have negative 9-- I'll do
it over here; I'll do it in

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.560
a different color than we've
been using-- we have negative

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.400
9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there
originally, it's there

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.320
implicitly-- minus 9
times negative 1.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.720
9 times-- I'll put negative 1
in parentheses-- minus 6 is

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720
equal to-- well, actually,
let me just solve for the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.600
left-hand side when I substitute
a negative 1 there.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.060
So the left-hand side becomes
negative 9, minus 9 times

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.420
negative 1 is negative
9, minus 6.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.860
And so this is negative 9
minus-- in parentheses--

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.740
negative 9 minus 6
is negative 15.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.110
So this is equal
to negative 15.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.450
And so we get negative 9-- let
me make sure I did that--

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.080
negative 9 minus 6,
yep, negative 15.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.620
So negative 9 minus negative 15,
that's the same thing as

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.590
negative 9 plus 15,
which is 6.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.980
So that's what we get on the
left-hand side of the equation

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.000
when we substitute x is
equal to negative 1.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.680
We get that it equals 6.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.640
So let's see what happens when
we substitute negative 1 to

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.640
the right-hand side
of the equation.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.680
I'll do it in green.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.750
We get 3 times 4 times
negative 1 plus 6.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.010
So that is 3 times negative
4 plus 6.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.530
Negative 4 plus 6 is 2.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.790
So it's 3 times 2,
which is also 6.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.460
So when x is equal to negative
1, you substitute here, the

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.340
left-hand side becomes 6, and
the right-hand side becomes 6.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.610
So this definitely works out.
