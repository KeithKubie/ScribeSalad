and welcome back so we now have

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
and welcome back so we now have
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.669
and welcome back so we now have
leaderboards in our game and we have

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679
leaderboards in our game and we have
 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.280
leaderboards in our game and we have
this lovely view all of my leaderboards

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
this lovely view all of my leaderboards
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.460
this lovely view all of my leaderboards
controller however it would be awfully

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
controller however it would be awfully
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.260
controller however it would be awfully
nice if while I were in the middle of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
nice if while I were in the middle of
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.179
nice if while I were in the middle of
playing a game or done with the game I

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
playing a game or done with the game I
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.090
playing a game or done with the game I
could still also see the high scores

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
could still also see the high scores
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.859
could still also see the high scores
that were available in that particular

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
that were available in that particular
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.140
that were available in that particular
level you know just so I know what score

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
level you know just so I know what score
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.480
level you know just so I know what score
I have to beat or so on and so we can do

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
I have to beat or so on and so we can do
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.330
I have to beat or so on and so we can do
that with our leaderboard controller

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340
that with our leaderboard controller
 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560
that with our leaderboard controller
unlike the leaderboards controller with

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
unlike the leaderboards controller with
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020
unlike the leaderboards controller with
an S the leaderboard controller lets you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
an S the leaderboard controller lets you
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819
an S the leaderboard controller lets you
immediately bring up the scores for a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
immediately bring up the scores for a
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.299
immediately bring up the scores for a
specific leaderboard so this is pretty

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
specific leaderboard so this is pretty
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.440
specific leaderboard so this is pretty
easy to do let's jump into my game view

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
easy to do let's jump into my game view
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080
easy to do let's jump into my game view
controller and let's look at our little

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
controller and let's look at our little
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.310
controller and let's look at our little
nib file here and I'm going to add a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
nib file here and I'm going to add a
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.150
nib file here and I'm going to add a
button let's put it down here at the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
button let's put it down here at the
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.490
button let's put it down here at the
bottom and we'll call it leaderboards I

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500
bottom and we'll call it leaderboards I
 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.170
bottom and we'll call it leaderboards I
guess leaderboard with an exclamation

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
guess leaderboard with an exclamation
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939
guess leaderboard with an exclamation
point because we're super excited about

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
point because we're super excited about
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920
point because we're super excited about
this leaderboard and we'll anchor it to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
this leaderboard and we'll anchor it to
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.760
this leaderboard and we'll anchor it to
the bottom here OOP done and I'm going

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
the bottom here OOP done and I'm going
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.190
the bottom here OOP done and I'm going
to bring up my helper view control or my

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
to bring up my helper view control or my
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380
to bring up my helper view control or my
helper editor it's going to automatic

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
helper editor it's going to automatic
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.340
helper editor it's going to automatic
and in our game view controller mm-maybe

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
and in our game view controller mm-maybe
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:35.350
and in our game view controller mm-maybe
here we will add a view leaderboard

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360
here we will add a view leaderboard
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.340
here we will add a view leaderboard
button was pressed actually there we go

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350
button was pressed actually there we go
 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.450
button was pressed actually there we go
so let's go into our game view

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
so let's go into our game view
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.380
so let's go into our game view
controller here and we'll add of this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
controller here and we'll add of this
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660
controller here and we'll add of this
thing so first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
thing so first thing I'm going to do is
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.130
thing so first thing I'm going to do is
we're going to create a leaderboard

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
we're going to create a leaderboard
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.600
we're going to create a leaderboard
controller leaderboard VC equals gpg

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
controller leaderboard VC equals gpg
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.620
controller leaderboard VC equals gpg
leaderboard control or alloc init with

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630
leaderboard control or alloc init with
 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.550
leaderboard control or alloc init with
leaderboard ID and huh I don't actually

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
leaderboard ID and huh I don't actually
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200
leaderboard ID and huh I don't actually
know what our leaderboard ideas because

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
know what our leaderboard ideas because
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.050
know what our leaderboard ideas because
we've gone ahead and abstracted it away

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
we've gone ahead and abstracted it away
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.440
we've gone ahead and abstracted it away
in my leaderboard manager class so maybe

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
in my leaderboard manager class so maybe
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.910
in my leaderboard manager class so maybe
what I'll do is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
what I'll do is
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.250
what I'll do is
is a let me go ahead and create a little

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
is a let me go ahead and create a little
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.130
is a let me go ahead and create a little
class method here that will return in n

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
class method here that will return in n
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.790
class method here that will return in n
a string which will be leaderboard ID

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800
a string which will be leaderboard ID
 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.690
a string which will be leaderboard ID
for difficulty level and will pass in

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
for difficulty level and will pass in
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.559
for difficulty level and will pass in
our difficulty level simple enough and I

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569
our difficulty level simple enough and I
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.020
our difficulty level simple enough and I
think actually implementing this is also

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
think actually implementing this is also
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.280
think actually implementing this is also
pretty straightforward basically going

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
pretty straightforward basically going
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680
pretty straightforward basically going
to return and maybe we'll just cast this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
to return and maybe we'll just cast this
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.640
to return and maybe we'll just cast this
just to make sure leaderboard IDs level

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650
just to make sure leaderboard IDs level
 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.740
just to make sure leaderboard IDs level
and you know wouldn't kill me down to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
and you know wouldn't kill me down to
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.600
and you know wouldn't kill me down to
moraine valves checking here but I'm not

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
moraine valves checking here but I'm not
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.370
moraine valves checking here but I'm not
going to because this is a sample app so

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
going to because this is a sample app so
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.479
going to because this is a sample app so
let's go back to our game view

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489
let's go back to our game view
 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.240
let's go back to our game view
controller and let's create a little and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
controller and let's create a little and
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.940
controller and let's create a little and
a string leaderboard ID equals I'm going

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
a string leaderboard ID equals I'm going
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.479
a string leaderboard ID equals I'm going
to go up here and import our gmn

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489
to go up here and import our gmn
 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.440
to go up here and import our gmn
leaderboard manager all right now let's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
leaderboard manager all right now let's
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.199
leaderboard manager all right now let's
go back down here and now we can create

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
go back down here and now we can create
 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.970
go back down here and now we can create
our end a string that's our leaderboard

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
our end a string that's our leaderboard
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.849
our end a string that's our leaderboard
ID and that will equal gmn leaderboard

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
ID and that will equal gmn leaderboard
 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.699
ID and that will equal gmn leaderboard
manager leaderboard aya for difficulty

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
manager leaderboard aya for difficulty
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.530
manager leaderboard aya for difficulty
level self game diff and now we can

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
level self game diff and now we can
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.800
level self game diff and now we can
basically say our leaderboard VC is our

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
basically say our leaderboard VC is our
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780
basically say our leaderboard VC is our

leaderboard vc leaderboard delegate will
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.680
leaderboard vc leaderboard delegate will
be self and then we can call self

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
be self and then we can call self
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.530
be self and then we can call self

we're going to get a little warning

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989
we're going to get a little warning
 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.569
we're going to get a little warning
because we haven't declared herself as a

GP g leaderboard delegate so let's do

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
GP g leaderboard delegate so let's do
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.870
GP g leaderboard delegate so let's do
that i'll go up here and we'll do it

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
that i'll go up here and we'll do it
 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.990
that i'll go up here and we'll do it
right here remember this is leaderboard

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000
right here remember this is leaderboard
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.210
right here remember this is leaderboard
controller delegate not leaderboards

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.900
 
and now we can add a delegate method

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910
and now we can add a delegate method
 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.740
and now we can add a delegate method
leaderboard view controller did finish

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320
animated yes completion ill and we're
 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.320
animated yes completion ill and we're
done so now I can run this and maybe I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
done so now I can run this and maybe I
 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.490
done so now I can run this and maybe I
can jump into my easy game here and hmm

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500
can jump into my easy game here and hmm
 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.230
can jump into my easy game here and hmm
thinking maybe before I start playing

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
thinking maybe before I start playing
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.490
thinking maybe before I start playing
this game let's see what the leaderboard

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
this game let's see what the leaderboard
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.270
this game let's see what the leaderboard
says and I can look and say oh look this

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280

scorer of three no way I can beat that
 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.420
scorer of three no way I can beat that
so maybe I'll go back and check out my

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430
so maybe I'll go back and check out my
 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.820
so maybe I'll go back and check out my
medium game here if I view the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830
medium game here if I view the
 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.650
medium game here if I view the
leaderboard remember we're creating a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660
leaderboard remember we're creating a
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.450
leaderboard remember we're creating a
leaderboard controller with the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460
leaderboard controller with the
 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.670
