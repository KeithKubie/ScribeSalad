changes in migration patterns so you

00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:28.589
changes in migration patterns so you
 

00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:29.719
changes in migration patterns so you
know you have people coming in from

the south have been moving to the south
over the last few decades and that means

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039
over the last few decades and that means
 

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:40.309
over the last few decades and that means
that in southern cities there's a less

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:40.319
that in southern cities there's a less
 

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:43.009

a huge migration from Mexico a huge
migration from this area I mean they're

00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:55.829
migration from this area I mean they're
 

00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:57.199
migration from this area I mean they're
probably more Pittsburghers in North and

00:27:57.199 --> 00:27:57.209
probably more Pittsburghers in North and
 

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:58.309

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.829
kind of middle sound a kind of southern
sound and that's about all there is in

00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839
sound and that's about all there is in
 

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:19.319
sound and that's about all there is in
the way of differentiation but on the

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:19.329
the way of differentiation but on the
 

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:21.630
the way of differentiation but on the
other hand geographic mobility also

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640
other hand geographic mobility also
 

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.260
other hand geographic mobility also
leads to dialect awareness and I think I

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:25.270
leads to dialect awareness and I think I
 

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.089
leads to dialect awareness and I think I
was talking to you before right before

00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:27.099
was talking to you before right before
 

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:28.410
was talking to you before right before
this about how that works you moved to

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:28.420
this about how that works you moved to
 

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.780
this about how that works you moved to
Boston and somebody tells you you sound

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:30.790
Boston and somebody tells you you sound
 

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.270
Boston and somebody tells you you sound
funny and you never realized you sounded

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280
funny and you never realized you sounded
 

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.460
funny and you never realized you sounded
funny before so suddenly being become

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:35.470
funny before so suddenly being become
 

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.730
funny before so suddenly being become
aware of your accent it doesn't just

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:38.740
aware of your accent it doesn't just
 

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.980
aware of your accent it doesn't just
happen you don't just become aware of a

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:40.990
happen you don't just become aware of a
 

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.079
happen you don't just become aware of a
local accent because everyone you hear

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:43.089
local accent because everyone you hear
 

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:45.180
local accent because everyone you hear
has that accent if everyone you hear

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:45.190
has that accent if everyone you hear
 

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.280
has that accent if everyone you hear
sounds the same you don't become aware

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:47.290
sounds the same you don't become aware
 

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:51.539
sounds the same you don't become aware
of it everybody talked that way so older

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:51.549
of it everybody talked that way so older
 

00:37:51.549 --> 00:37:53.220
of it everybody talked that way so older
people that I talk to in the in the

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.230
people that I talk to in the in the
 

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.069
people that I talk to in the in the
interviews I did would say yeah I'm sure

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079
interviews I did would say yeah I'm sure
 

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:59.220
interviews I did would say yeah I'm sure
we said you know I'm sure we said Yin's

00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.230
we said you know I'm sure we said Yin's
 

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.260
we said you know I'm sure we said Yin's
when we were growing up but we just

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.270
when we were growing up but we just
 

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.359
when we were growing up but we just
didn't hear it everybody did it it was

00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:03.369
didn't hear it everybody did it it was
 

00:38:03.369 --> 00:38:05.430
didn't hear it everybody did it it was
just not audible wasn't you you didn't

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440
just not audible wasn't you you didn't
 

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.170
just not audible wasn't you you didn't
notice you couldn't notice it so

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:07.180
notice you couldn't notice it so
 

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.849
notice you couldn't notice it so
geographic mobility is what leads to

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:08.859
geographic mobility is what leads to
 

00:38:08.859 --> 00:38:10.260
geographic mobility is what leads to
dialect awareness so you have this kind

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:10.270
dialect awareness so you have this kind
 

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.839
dialect awareness so you have this kind
of very interesting paradox I think this

00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:12.849
of very interesting paradox I think this
 

00:38:12.849 --> 00:38:14.880
of very interesting paradox I think this
is really what drives my project is that

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:14.890
is really what drives my project is that
 

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.589
is really what drives my project is that
at the same time that the dialect is

at the same time that the dialect is
 

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:19.680
at the same time that the dialect is
kind of going away people are becoming
