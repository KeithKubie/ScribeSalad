00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.559
So they are four critical resources you need to think about

00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:05.249
as we just we talk about their physical resources,

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:08.769
final resources, human resources, and intellectual resources.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.049
Let's take a look at each one.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.689
For physical resources, this might seem at first kind of the obvious is your company facilities

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.649
and that is office base, company location

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.799
are you in downtown ??? or are you in Ann Arbor Michigan

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.188
or you were in Delft in the Netherlands or ???.

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:30.099
Where the best place to locate your companies headquarters

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.669
and where are you going to do most of the work.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.649
The second part of physical resources where are you going to get the supply

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.199
for your product and services.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.879
So for example you're making silk and whose going to be your silk and weaver supplier

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.329
in the value chain or your making still, where are we going to get the iron ore

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.629
or are you going to need a thousands of square feet of warehouse space

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.699
if you're going to setup a distribution center

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.649
and what's really interesting is this kindly obviously a fact where you going to put your company facility.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.259
Maybe you want to have your manufacturing facility next to the city supplier

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:08.759
or you might say, okay we understand their distant and we can manage that remotely

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.078
but you need to actually think through not only this relationship

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:18.789
but as you'll see the relationship between resources and the partners part of the business model campus

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.869
because some of this supplies and services required deep relationships.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.919
Not just ordering out of a catalogue but true partnerships.

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:32.819
Now the other thing to just remember is many physical goods if they are in a physical channel

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.687
are capital intensive which is a fancy word for saying doing a start up like  ??? space ads

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:42.719
is very different than doing a IOS or android.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.639
The amount of resources your going to need for physical goods just are dramatically different

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.689
and when your thinking about the finance component,

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.599
you have to really think about what happens after year 1, year 2. etc.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.699
How do you scale this business?--And in the 2nd decade of the 21th century

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:04.779
a good number clean text startups like scientist startups are now encountering this phenomenon.

00:02:04.779 --> 99:59:59.000
Does this work great as a startup but there is a value of death for a capital and scam.
