- Hello, teachers, I'm Sal Khan,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.170
founder of the
not-for-profit Khan Academy,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.170
with the goal of helping you

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.990
accelerate outcomes in your classroom.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.170
And I have an exciting announcement.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.500
What we're launching is a new

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.680
mastery framework on Khan Academy.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.670
We have some of the most
significant features ever

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.360
around personalization
and mastery learning,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.630
where your students can get
as much practice as they need,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.270
as much feedback as they
need, and the most important

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.340
part of a mastery learning
system is the teacher,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.230
is the human being in the classroom.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.700
So it's explicitly designed to
increase human interactions,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.290
to give you, the teacher,
insights on which students

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.180
might need help, which students might need

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.590
a little bit of motivation.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.450
We've designed dashboards so
that teachers can identify

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.090
gaps and misconceptions in
their students in real time.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.940
We've significantly added
to the amount of content,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.200
not just in math, where we've
always had tens of thousands

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.640
of exercises from
kindergarten through calculus

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.320
and statistics, but also in
high school and college-level

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.690
sciences and the humanities.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.080
And, most importantly, it's
flexible to meet your needs.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.850
This can be done in the
classroom, it could be used

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.040
as part of in-class practice,
it could be part of review,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.570
or it can be done as part of homework.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.690
And we are seeing the
classrooms that use Khan Academy

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.090
for the classroom, at
least 30 minutes per week,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.600
are seeing incredible gains
in their student outcomes.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.100
- I look at my reports a lot.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.690
I use data a lot to drive my instruction

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.850
and to drive what I need to reteach.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.200
- They tell me exactly
where that student is.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.230
It tells me how many
attempts that they have done

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.640
and specifically, so there's
real data telling me,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.490
hey, this student is getting it wrong.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.590
- They're not doing 30 problems
and then realizing, uh,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.310
I don't know what I'm
doing and I just made

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.040
some really bad habits for myself.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.480
- So thank you, teachers.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.370
All of us at Khan Academy
are incredibly inspired

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.910
by the work that you
do day in and day out.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.570
Anything we can do to
make your lives easier

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.130
or to help accelerate the
learning for your students,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.344
we are excited to do with you.

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:02.011
(upbeat music)
